Consumer  prices for goods and services rose in practically all regions of  Russia by 1-2.5 percent.    Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in  February  were as follows (as a percentage of the preceding date):                    02/08      02/15      02/22      Average daily price rise                                                     February      January   Consumer        103.3      102.8      101.9      0.36          0.68  goods and  services   including:   foodstuffs      103.8      102.5      101.6      0.36          0.68   nonfood items   102.8      102.5      102.4      0.35          0.40    for-fee         103.1      107.4      101.7      0.54          2.38  services for  the  population      Since the beginning of the month prices in the consumer  market increased by 8.3 percent, including those for  foodstuffs--by 8.1 percent, nonfood items--by 7.9 percent, and  for-fee services for the population--by 12.5 percent.  <H5>  Foodstuffs </H5>   From 15 to 22 February, prices for basic foodstuffs rose at  a  slower pace: by 1.7 percent in organized trade, and by 1.0  percent in nonorganized trade.    Price changes by main categories of food products over this  period are shown below.                         as % of the preceding observation date                        including                        Total           in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    101.6           101.7               101.0   including:   Meat and meat        101.5           101.9               100.4  products   Fish and fish        103.0           103.1               99.0  products   Milk and milk        103.4           103.6               102.2  products   Eggs                 101.1           101.2               99.8   Sugar                100.2           100.2               100.4   Bread and bakery     101.6           101.6               -  products   Cereals and          103.5           103.4               106.2  macaroni items   Vodka                99.0            99.0                100.0   Potatoes and         104.4           104.2               104.7  vegetables      In organized trade over the past week the pace of  price increases slowed down with respect to practically all  monitored foodstuffs. At the same time, prices with respect to  milk products, cereals and macaroni items, vegetables, and fish  products continued to rise at an anticipatory rate. There was  practically no change in prices for sugar, vodka, vegetable oil,  tea, flour, and oranges.    Since the beginning of February prices for milk products  have  risen by 17.6 percent; for cereals and macaroni items, potatoes,  and vegetables--by 13 percent; for bread and bakery items--by 10  percent; and for meat and meat products--by 7.7 percent.    In nonorganized trade, prices rose over this week  on average at a somewhat slower rate than in organized trade (1  percent). Vegetable prices rose at a higher rate. Those for  fresh cabbage increased by 8 percent. Since the beginning of the  month vegetable prices have risen by more than 20 percent.    The cost of a consumer basket of 19 basic  foodstuffs rose over the week by 1.6 percent and amounted  as of 22 February to 40,800 rubles [R], calculated on a monthly  basis. Magadan remains the most expensive city (R97,500) and  Ulyanovsk--the least expensive (R23,800). Moscow is in 30th  place of 132 monitored cities (R45,300 on a monthly basis).  <H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>   Over the past week prices for the main categories of nonfood  items rose by 1-3 percent. A higher rate of price increases was  registered with respect to synthetic detergents and certain  categories of medical supplies (5-10 percent).    Since the beginning of February prices for fabrics, cultural  and household items, and certain categories of medical supplies  have increased by 10-20 percent.  <H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>   Fees for services changed insignificantly over the past week  (1.7 percent). Since the beginning of February the cost of  municipal housing has increased 1.8-fold, hot water  fees--1.6-fold, and the cost of basic residential telephone  service--by almost 30 percent. Suburban train and intercity bus  fares increased by 20 percent.  <H3>  Production of the Most Important Varieties of Industrial  Output </H3>   Over 20 days of February 1994, of 163 categories of products  counted in periodic reports, average daily production as  compared to the corresponding period of February 1993:    --increased with respect to 11 items, (including  polypropylene, polyvinylchloride plastics, cotton fabrics, tea,  toothpaste), or 7 percent of the total number;    --Decreased with respect to 149 positions, or 91  percent of the total number;    and as compared to the corresponding period of January 1994:    --increased with respect to 101 items, (including  coal, iron ore, steel pipe, sulfuric acid, mineral fertilizers,  caustic soda, synthetic dyes, polyvinylchloride tar and  vinylchloride copolymers, chemical fibers and filaments, large  electric machinery, metal-cutting machine tools, self-propelled  cranes, rail freight cars, trolleybuses, friction-free ball  bearings, wood-chip board, cardboard, cement, construction  brick, roof slate, asbestos-cement pipe and couplers, soft  roofing and insulation materials, refrigerators and freezers,  washers, tape recorders, radio receivers, television sets,  sewing machines, fabrics, knitwear and hosiery, footwear,  butter, high-fat cheese and feta cheese, whole-milk products,  bread and bakery items, facial soap), or 62 percent of the total  number;    --decreased with respect to 59 items, or 36  percent of the total number.    Based on the dynamics of the output of most important  categories of products, the estimated average daily volume of  industrial production over the elapsed period of February 1994  amounted to 74 percent of the level of the corresponding period  of last year's February.    The output of main categories of industrial products over 20  days of February 1994 is characterized by the following data:                               Produced over     as % of the corresponding period                             20 days of        (in terms of average daily                             February 1994     production)                                                February 1993     January 1994   Electric power--billion    58.9              98                108  kw-hr   Oil, including gas         15.9              83                92  condensate, million  tonnes   Natural gas, billion       36.8              99.1              100.0  cubic meters   Coal, million tonnes       16.3              91                113   Steel, million tonnes      2.3               72                95   Finished rolled ferrous    1.8               72                94  metals, million tonnes   Steel pipe, thousand       201               52                109  tonnes   Large electric             156               45                156  machinery, units   Metal-cutting machine      357               43                147  tools, units   Trucks, thousand units     9.5               29                90   Passenger cars, thousand   44.7              83                4.7 times  units   Tractors, thousand units   893               12                70    Chemical filament and      10.6              47                102  fiber, thousand tonnes   Mineral fertilizer         352               74                106  (recalculated as 100  percent nutrients),  thousand tonnes   Automotive tires for       1.4               62                105  agricultural vehicles,  motorcycles, and  motorollers, million  units   Commercial timber,         4.2               61                93  million cubic meters  raft wood   Lumber, thousand cubic     591               63                90  meters   Paper, thousand tonnes     128               76                94   Cement, million tonnes     1.7               74                120   Roof slate, million        68.1              33                2.1 times  standard tiles   Construction brick,        424               73                113  million units of  standard brick   Soft roofing and           18.0              51                105  insulation materials,  million square meters   Fabrics, total, million    166               89                121  square meters   Hosiery, million pairs     22.3              74                121   Knitwear, million units    12.5              78                136   Footwear, million pairs    3.0               41                143   Television sets,           166               82                122  thousand units   Radio receiving devices,   64.0              48                147  thousand units   Refrigerators and          174               95                103  freezers, thousand units    Electric vacuum            54.3              31                64  cleaners, thousand units    Washing machines,          116               53                124  thousand units   Meat, including            89.6              65                84  subproducts, category I,  total, thousand tonnes   Whole-milk products,       342               81                104  recalculated as milk,  total, thousand tonnes   Butter, total, thousand    13.2              69                111  tonnes   Granulated sugar,          53.4              64                76  including that produced  from customer-supplied  raw material      Over the first three weeks of February 1994 there was no  production of grain harvesting combines or electric and diesel  railroad locomotives.  <H5>  Rail Transport </H5>   As of 1 February 1994, 44.4 million tonnes of goods due to  be  transported by rail were waiting at enterprises and railroad  stations, including 36.4 million tonnes at track-adjacent  loading areas of enterprises and stations, which is 0.8 percent  more than as of 1 February 1993 and 17 percent less than as of 1  January 1994.    The most significant among unshipped cargo remainders were  the following:                              Remaining cargo to be       As % of the                            transported by rail         corresponding period of                            waiting at track-adjacent   last year                            loading areas of                            enterprises and stations                            as of 1 February 1994,                            million tonnes   Total cargo               36.4                        100.8   including:   bituminous coal           13.5                        111   oil and petroleum         1.3                         89  products   iron and manganese ore    3.0                         110   timber                    3.7                         90   construction cargo        5.5                         74      Kemerovo Oblast accounts for 50 percent of the total  quantity  of bituminous coal awaiting shipping in Russia, Rostov  Oblast--for 18 percent, the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia)--8  percent, and the Republic of Komi--7 percent; 12 percent of the  timber is awaiting shipping in Arkhangelsk Oblast, 9 percent--in  Irkutsk Oblast, 8 percent each in Kostroma and Tyumen Oblasts  and the Republic of Komi; with respect to construction cargo  remainders, Novosibirsk Oblast accounts for 26 percent,  Sverdlovsk Oblast--11 percent, and St. Petersburg--8 percent;  with respect to iron and manganese ore: Belgorod Oblast--56  percent, and Kemerovo Oblast--12 percent; and with respect to  oil and petroleum products: Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast--20 percent,  Omsk Oblast--18 percent, and Perm Oblast--15 percent.  <H5>  Privatization in Industry </H5>   In 1993, 12,000 state and municipal industrial enterprises  were privatized in Russia. At 3,800 enterprises the  privatization process has been completed and all payments have  been made in full (including at 1,900 light industry  enterprises).    The denationalization process has spread to all industrial  sectors. It is practically complete in light industry (98.6  percent of the total number of state and municipal enterprises  in the sector had been privatized as of the beginning of the  year); the process is actively progressing in ferrous metallurgy  (54.6 percent), the chemical and petrochemical industry (52.9  percent), and machine building and metalworking (51.0 percent).    At the same time, in the construction material and food  processing industries, whose enterprises are subject to  mandatory privatization, denationalization is proceeding at a  relatively slow pace: 35-43 percent of enterprises have been  privatized.    Data on privatization of state and municipal enterprises by  industry sector in 1993 are shown below:                                 Privatized enterprises                                Entities as % of     Charter capital, R billion                               the number of                               state and                               municipal                               enterprises as of                               1 January 1993   Industry as a whole          11,948               44.6           422.8   including:   power generation             80                   9.1            45.4   fuel industry                64                   10.0           60.1   ferrous metallurgy           119                  54.6           48.7   nonferrous metallurgy        80                   35.1           16.5   chemical and petrochemical   281                  52.9           27.5  industry   machine building and         2,901                51.0           125.0  metalworking   timber, woodworking, and     909                  21.5           13.7  pulp and paper industry   construction material        826                  35.5           10.7  industry   glass and                    55                   45.1           1.5  porcelain-stoneware  industry   light industry               3,374                98.6           26.8   food processing industry     2,071                42.9           29.7      Denationalization in Russian industry in 1993 was  accomplished mostly through conversion to joint-stock holding.  This was the preferred method chosen by 6,223 state and  municipal enterprises, or 52 percent of those privatized (in  1992--19 percent of enterprises). Under this method, enterprise  employees select, as a rule, the second option for preferences,  whereby common stock, which comprises 51 percent of the charter  capital, is to be sold to enterprise employees, as well as  employees of enterprises that are linked with it in a single  technological complex (in 1993, 47 percent of shares were sold  to employees of privatized enterprises).    This method of privatization was used most in 1993 in  machine-building and metalworking, where 1,870 joint-stock  companies were set up; in the food processing industry--1,732;  and the construction materials industry--500.    In 1993 more than 577 million shares of stock were issued  and  sold, with a nominal value of R1,000 per share on average, for a  total amount of R416 billion. About 53 percent of all stock  issued, in the amount of R187 billion, was transferred to the  property fund (of them, 72 million shares were sold by the fund  through auctions, 2.4 million shares--through bids, and 7.5  million shares--at investment auctions). After selling stock at  auctions, through bids, and through investment auctions, as of 1  January 1994, 215.5 million shares worth R154.8 billion were  left in the fund.    About 23 percent of all shares were purchased by enterprise  employees at the selling price set by the State Committee for  the Administration of State Property, in the amount of R144  billion. Also purchased were 77.5 million shares of Class A  preferred stock (13.4 percent) in the amount of R46.8 billion.  Forty-five million shares of common stock worth R27.3 billion  were distributed on preferential terms among enterprise  employees.    The Russian economy received R118.5 billion from  privatization of industrial enterprises, including R15.7 billion  from fully privatized enterprises.  <H5>  Account-Clearing Relations with CIS and Baltic Countries </H5>   By the beginning of 1994 the accounts payable debt at  enterprises in industry, construction, transportation, and  agriculture amounted to R47.0 trillion, including R16.4  trillion, or 35 percent, in past due accounts; enterprise  accounts receivable amounted to R43.8 trillion, including R18.1  trillion, or 41 percent, in past due accounts.    Russian Federation enterprises accounted for the greatest  share of past due accounts--R16.0 trillion, or 98 percent; and  CIS and Baltic countries through direct contracts--for R0.3  trillion, or 1.5 percent.    Enterprise accounts receivable in transactions between  Russian Federation enterprises amounted to R16.5 trillion, or 91  percent of the total amount. Past due accounts of enterprises  located on the territory of CIS and Baltic countries in direct  contracts with Russian enterprises amounted to R0.6 trillion, or  3.4 percent.    The status of account-clearing relations of enterprises and  organizations in Russian industry, construction, transportation,  and agriculture in direct contracts with enterprises located on  the territory of CIS and Baltic countries was characterized by  the following data (billions of rubles):                            Past due accounts                           receivable                  payable                           as of         as of         as of         as of                          01/10/93      01/01/94      01/10/93      01/01/94   Russian enterprises'    479.7         619.5         224.5         252.9  accounts with CIS and  Baltic  enterprises--total   including with  enterprises in:   Ukraine                 172.3         208.5         95.8          96.5   Belarus                 71.2          96.2          22.4          24.5   Uzbekistan              45.8          50.0          11.3          12.2   Kazakhstan              115.8         169.2         72.8          85.4   Georgia                 6.1           2.7           1.3           5.6   Azerbaijan              7.7           11.7          3.0           4.8   Moldova                 0.1           11.6          1.6           3.4   Kyrgyzstan              6.7           7.6           1.5           1.1   Tajikistan              8.0           11.6          4.0           2.8   Armenia                 2.3           2.7           3.7           4.2   Turkmenistan            19.1          29.1          3.1           3.9   Latvia                  8.7           11.7          1.7           3.6   Lithuania               4.7           4.1           1.6           4.2   Estonia                 1.2           2.8           0.8           0.7      The greatest share of past due accounts in the total amount  of receivables existed in accounts with enterprises in  Kyrgyzstan (51.9 percent), Belarus (55.4 percent), Kazakhstan  (56.8 percent), Latvia (58.5 percent), Uzbekistan (59.6  percent), Armenia (64.2 percent), Tajikistan (65.1 percent), and  Turkmenistan (69.2 percent). The greatest share of past due  accounts payable existed in accounts with enterprises in Ukraine  (44.6 percent), Uzbekistan (45.0 percent), and Armenia (56.5  percent).  <H5>  Employment in Northern Regions </H5>   The situation in the labor market in the northern regions is  developing unevenly. While in Tyumen and Kamchatka Oblasts and  the Republics of Komi and Sakha (Yakutia) the unemployed  population figures per vacancy listed with the employment  service are about the same as the average for Russia, in the  Republic of Buryatia and Arkhangelsk and Sakhalin Oblasts it  reaches 12-24 persons.    Statistics organs conducted a simultaneous survey of 500  enterprises and organizations in industry, construction,  transportation, and health care, located in the northern regions  of the country. The respondents were managers and employees of  these enterprises' personnel department.    Over the past 1.5 years the total labor force at surveyed  enterprises and organizations shrunk on the whole by 9 percent.  The number of employees who have moved here from other  territories fell by 18 percent as compared to 6 percent among  other workers; in construction--by 26 percent and 16 percent,  respectively. The proportional share of contract workers who  came to the northern regions on a fixed-term special northern  region contract in the total labor force fell over this period  at surveyed enterprises from 22 percent to 20 percent, and in  construction organizations--from 24 percent to 22 percent.    Below are data on changes in the number of workers under  fixed-term special northern region contract in relation to the  total labor force at surveyed enterprises, by individual region.                      Proportional share of workers under fixed-term contract in                    relation to the total labor force                     1992         1993 total    including                                                specialists         workers   Amur Oblast       21           15            17                  14   Irkutsk Oblast    15           9             9                   10   Kamchatka         29           27            24                  29  Oblast   Magadan Oblast    56           56            59                  55   Murmansk Oblast   35           33            45                  28    Maritime Kray     22           18            26                  15   Sakhalin Oblast   25           21            27                  18    Tomsk Oblast      15           9             17                  6   Tyumen Oblast     33           30            40                  25   Republic of       9            10            16                  7  Komi   Republic of       33           27            26                  28  Sakha (Yakutia)       At surveyed enterprises in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Khabarovsk  and  Krasnoyarsk Kray, and the Republic of Buryatia, workers  attracted from other territories comprise between 2 and 7  percent.    Among workers under fixed-term special northern region labor  contract, 71 percent came from other regions of Russia, and 29  percent--from former USSR republics. Among the guest workers, 21  percent are under 30, and 12 percent are over 50.    One out of every two surveyed workers has worked in the  northern regions for more than 10 years, and 13 percent--for  more than 20 years.    According to the estimates of personnel department managers,  about half of surveyed enterprises and organizations are  experiencing a labor shortage. This problem is most acute in  Murmansk Oblast, Khabarovsk Kray, and the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia), where between 55 and 63 percent of enterprises are  short of skilled workers. A shortage of specialists was noted by  26 percent of managers of industrial enterprises, 21 percent of  construction organizations, and 55 percent of health care  institutions. In addition, the situation is substantially  exacerbated by a mismatch in professions and skills on the  demand and supply sides of the labor force.    In the opinion of personnel service managers, in 1994 the  labor shortage will be exacerbated at one out of five  enterprises, and at one out of six a shortage may arise. In  Buryatia, Sakhalin, Kamchatka, and Magadan Oblasts and the  Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), 45-53 percent of surveyed managers  expect this situation.    At the same time, 31 percent of surveyed enterprises are not  experiencing labor shortages, and 17 percent of surveyed  managers indicated a potential labor force surplus. This will  affect to a greater extent enterprises on the territory of the  Komi Republic and Krasnoyarsk Kray (28-35 percent).    In Tyumen Oblast one-third of personnel department managers  assume that labor force requirements at their enterprises will  decrease.    The prospects of enterprises in northern regions with  respect  to labor force supply depend to a great extent on the intentions  of individual workers currently working at enterprises regarding  future work in the northern regions. To determine these  intentions, a survey of 5,400 guest workers from other regions  was conducted. More than one-half of respondents (53 percent)  indicated that they intend to leave their current place of  residence and employment; two-thirds of them do not have housing  in the area they intend to move to.    Of those workers who intend to leave the northern regions,  73  percent are persons with higher and secondary vocational  education. One out of three is between 30 and 40 years old.    Among the respondents who intend to leave the northern  regions, 3 percent indicated that their labor contract for work  in the northern regions is about to expire; the rest name other  reasons prompting them to move.    One out of four respondents indicated dissatisfaction with  the pay level as one of their main reasons for leaving.    The survey results showed that the system of preferences and  allowances for people living and working in the northern regions  has lost its determinant role in attracting labor resources to  work in harsh natural and climatic conditions. Despite the  higher nominal wages of workers in the northern regions, the  pay's purchasing capacity does not provide substantial  advantages as compared to other territories in Russia. For  instance, the average monthly wage in Arkhangelsk, Kamchatka,  Magadan, and Sakhalin Oblasts and the Republic of Sakha  (Yakutia) recalculated as the cost of a comparable consumer food  basket is on the same level as central and southern regions of  Russia.    Among the reasons for leaving, 13 percent of workers named  poor food and consumer products supply. This problem is most  acute in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) and Tyumen and Irkutsk  Oblasts.    A large group is comprised of workers who intend to leave  the  northern regions because of dissatisfaction with housing  conditions. This reason was named by 10 percent of respondents,  and in the Republic of Buryatia and Arkhangelsk and Amur  Oblasts--by more than 15 percent.    Ecological factors have a substantial influence on workers'  migration mobility. The poor state of the environment was named  as one of the main reasons for leaving by 24 percent of workers  in Arkhangelsk Oblast, 19 percent in Irkutsk Oblast, 15 percent  in Murmansk Oblast, and 11 percent in Khabarovsk Kray and Tyumen  Oblast.    In addition to the aforementioned main reasons prompting  people to leave northern regions, the respondents indicated that  they had to leave because of poor health, dissatisfaction with  social and household services, difficulties in providing summer  recreation for children, and access to school and other  education for children.    Many of those returning to near abroad countries before  their  labor contract expires are not certain that their housing,  reserved for them for the period of absence, is still there, or  that the preferential length of service record earned in Russia  will be taken into account in qualifying for retirement.    To the question regarding on what terms the respondents  would  agree to continue work in the northern regions, 9 percent  replied that they would not stay under any circumstances. In the  Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Khabarovsk Kray, Arkhangelsk, and  Tyumen Oblast the proportion of such workers was 14-16 percent.  If material incentives are improved, 25 percent of workers and  professionals among those who intend to leave would stay. Among  managers, the share of those who would stay on condition of  better pay is lower than among specialists and workers. In  health care, 28 percent will reverse their decision to leave if  their pay is increased.</p>

			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Business journal planned THE Economist Group yesterday announced that it had reached agreement with Diamond Incorporated to launch jointly a Japanese-language magazine early next year. Global Business magazine will be aimed at internationally minded Japanese business executives. It will have an initial circulation of some 15,000 and be published every two weeks. The magazine's content will split three ways. One third will be translations of articles from The Economist magazine and another third will cover international business and finance. The final section will focus on domestic Japanese issues. Pearson, publisher of the Financial Times, owns 50 per cent of The Economist. Mr David Gordon, chief executive of Economist Group, said the main publishing risk would be shouldered by Diamond, which already publishes Japanese-language versions of the Harvard Business Review and Fortune magazine.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Provincial Party Committee and Government Make Plans for </F> Maintaining Social Stability"]    [Excerpts] The provincial party committee and provincial  government convened a meeting in Hangzhou yesterday for  secretaries of prefectural and city party committees, city  mayors, and prefectural administrative commissoners. In view of  the major accidents and cases that have occurred in Zhejiang  since the beginning of this year, the meeting will map out  further plans for maintaining stability in the province. The  meeting stressed: All localities and departments should remain  sober, eliminate factors leading to instability, rectify  enterprises and organizations with serious problems, strengthen  management, and strengthen law enforcement so as to create a  good environment for reform, opening to the outside world, and  economic construction. Provincial Party Committee Secretary Le  Zemin and Provincial Governor Wan Xueyuan spoke at the meeting.    The meeting noted: Since the beginning of this year, party  committees and governments have conscientiously implemented the  party Central Committee's principle on seizing opportunities,  deepening reform, opening wider to the outside world, promoting  development, and maintaining stability; properly handled the  relations among reform, development, and stability; and adopted  measures to deal with the problems in connection with grain  production, economic efficiency in enterprises, and vegetable  supply. Satisfactory results have been achieved, and the  general situation is good. While affirming these achievements,  we should also be aware that problems still exist in social  stability and public order. [passage omitted]    The meeting said: While focusing on economic construction,  reform, and opening to the outside world, party committees and  governments at all levels should also pay attention to social  stability work. At present, they should concentrate on the  following tasks.    First, strictly investigate and punish according to law  those  who are responsible for major accidents. [passage omitted]    Second, rectify enterprises and departments plagued by  serious problems. Provincial and local authorities must rectify  some key trades that are closely related to people's lives and  property and are also plagued by many problems, in order to  eliminate factors of instability and remove hidden troubles.  [passage omitted]    Third, strengthen propaganda and education. In June, the  province should launch propaganda activities focusing on safety  education and social stability. Propaganda tools such as radio,  television, and the press should be used to spread education on  traffic safety, tourism safety, public order, professional  ethics, laws, and regulations. [passage omitted]    Fourth, to comprehensively improve public order, it is  necessary to mobilize all forces in society. [passage omitted]    Fifth, responsibility and tasks should be clearly divided  among all organizations and departments. [passage omitted]</p>

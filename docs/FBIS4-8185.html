			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, 11 Apr (TANJUG) -- Momcilo Krajisnik,  president of the Srpska assembly, said today that "the U.S.  bombing of Serb positions is a crime against the Serb people and  against peace."    It is obvious that neither the United States nor the UN are  ready for the establishment of peace in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Krajisnik told Radio Yugoslavia following  yesterday's bombing of Serb positions near Gorazde.    The Serbs have the right to defend themselves and will not  allow the UN to help the Muslims to improve their positions,  Krajisnik added.    He stressed that the Serb side has demanded to be told by  UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] who ordered the bombing and that  those who made the decision to authorize the attack would be  unwelcome in the Srpska republic.    Krajisnik said the Serb side has clear evidence that  UNPROFOR  provided help in arming the Muslims and that it is biased in  favor of the Muslims.    "The bombing by the U.S. planes was further proof that  UNPROFOR is not impartial in the civil war in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina", Krajisnik said.    "We cannot solve problems partially and establish peace in  the areas where the Muslims are suffering military defeats. We  said this to General Michael Rose on three occasions yesterday  and asked him to use his influence with the Muslims so that we  can achieve peace in Gorazde."    The Serb side, according to Krajisnik, agreed to have  Gorazde  defined as a protected zone and to find a way to define its  borders, but the Muslim side has rejected such proposals.</p>

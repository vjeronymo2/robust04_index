			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Badgerline warns of losses Badgerline, the Avon-based bus company which last Monday announced doubled pre-tax profits for 1993, is likely to be in the red after restating the figures following the rejection of planning permission for a supermarket at one of its depots. The planning refusal will lead to a Pounds 5.2m write-down of the depot's value in the company's balance sheet, with a net Pounds 5.2m being written off pre-tax profits, directors explained. Badgerline, which was floated last November, achieved pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.9m, compared with Pounds 3.2m. A public inquiry concerning the company's Kensington depot in Bath, where Safeway wanted to build a supermarket, closed on January 20, but early last week the company was still awaiting a decision. Two other schemes for supermarkets in Bath were also turned down. Mr Trevor Smallwood, executive chairman, said the group was disappointed by the Secretary of State's rejection of the plans. He said the write-down would have no impact in terms of the group's continuing profitability.</p>

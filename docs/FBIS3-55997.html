Your day is beginning in our  famous and legendary St. George's Hall in the Grand Kremlin  Palace, in which the names and historic deeds of our great  ancestors are reflected. This setting does, as it were, provide  the starting point for our talks.    I well remember our first meeting in Vancouver. I remember  how we laid the foundations for a U.S.-Russian partnership and  how personal friendship arose between us. I am sure that this  is a basis for ensuring that the talks this time will be even  more in- depth, more practical, and more global in nature.    I think that you will retain a good memory of people in  Russia, of Muscovites, and that you will sense this fully in  your meetings with people. Welcome to Russia. Welcome to  Moscow.</p>

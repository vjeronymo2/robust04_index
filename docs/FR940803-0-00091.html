			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (c) A ``town meeting'' took place on April 4, 1994, at Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 Second Street SW., Washington, DC. This open meeting, comprised mainly of representatives from the towing industry and the Coast Guard, solicited and elicited detailed comments concerning the recommendations of the Coast Guard and Department of Transportation (DOT) in the study of safety of towing vessels. The comments helped shape both the Work Plan and the new regulatory language. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The net effect of this interim rule and of a similar one, going forward under docket number CGD 94&hyph;027 and concerning 33 CFR part 160, will be to rationalize the ``division of labor'' between that part and 46 CFR part 4. Part 160 will comprehend all urgent matters, including some that part 4 might have seemed either to embrace or to neglect. Conspicuous among these will be many allisions with bridges, prompt notice of which might prevent another such catastrophe as the AMTRAK accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule cross-refers to new 33 CFR &sect;&sect;160.203 and 160.215, which, respectively, redefine the term ``hazardous condition'' and elaborate the requirements for reporting hazardous conditions. &sect;160.215 now covers many allisions with bridges and every hazardous condition ``caused by a vessel or its operation.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Like the interim rule on part 160, this interim rule on part 4 adds the term ``operator'' to the list of those responsible for giving notice. Often, a vessel is owned by one company but operated by another. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Making ``operator'' explicit in both parts will clarify the operator's responsibility for giving notice of hazardous conditions and marine casualties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule breaks existing 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;1 into two paragraphs. Paragraph (a) will require specified marine casualties to be reported immediately after the resulting safety concerns have been addressed rather than ``as soon as possible.'' This quoted phrase has allowed for considerable personal interpretation and has been removed. Paragraph (b) will eliminate dual reporting when a hazardous condition also involves a marine casualty, by allowing the notice given under 33 CFR 160.215 to suffice for the notice required in 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;1(b). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> New paragraph (b) of 46 CFR 4.05&hyph;10 emphasizes the filing of the required written notice without delay. The timely submission of the written notice of marine casualties not involving hazardous conditions will fulfill the requirement of paragraph (a) of &sect;4.05&hyph;1. The substitution of written for spoken notice will lighten the burden both on mariners of giving, and on the Coast Guard of getting, spoken notice of marine casualties not involving hazardous conditions. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule is not a significant regulatory action under &sect;3(f) of Executive Order 12866 and does not require an assessment of potential costs and benefits under &sect;6(a)(3) of that Order. It has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under that Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is not significant under the regulatory policies and procedures of the Department of Transportation (DOT) [44 FR 11034 (February 26, 1979)]. The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a full Regulatory Evaluation under paragraph 10(e) of the regulatory policies and procedures of DOT is unnecessary. This finding rests on the determination that this interim rule clarifies an existing requirement and does not place any new requirement on the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], the Coast Guard must consider the economic impact on small entities of a rule for which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required. ``Small entities'' may include (1) small businesses and not-for-profit organizations that are independently owned and operated and are not dominant in their fields and (2) governmental jurisdictions with populations of less than 50,000. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Coast Guard has reviewed this interim rule for potential impact on small entities. Because this rule does not place any new requirement on the public, the Coast Guard has determined that it will have no economic impact on small entities. If you nonetheless think that your business or organization qualifies as a small entity and that this rule will have a significant economic impact on it, please submit a comment (see ``ADDRESSES'') explaining why and to what degree this rule will economically affect it. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / As They Say in Europe: I am waiting to be asked ONCE UPON a time I thought this column was going to gain me a place as an expert. Somebody somewhere would ask on some late night show, or back-of-the-paper opinion page, what the European press thought of this or that. It could have been the Newbury by-election or fiscal convergence: I would have a ready answer. But I have learned that few believe that much can be gained from other people's news. This view was encapsulated in the observation of a top FT writer who said that this column showed that foreign papers were 'as crazy as our own.' I believe the time has come to demolish the idea that reading El Pais or Bild is a kind of journalistic train spotting. (As Richard Tomkins put it in his piece last week about real train spotters, they do it because it is no worse than doing something else.) In a last-ditch attempt to prove that valuable insights can be gained from other's news, I opened a random copy of the Neue Zurcher Zeitung: last Saturday's, at pages 10 and 11. While you were reading about Jancis Robinson's wine bargains or Ms Davenport's delicious ways with oxtail, your opposite number in Zurich was glued to a page devoted to 'The weather in April.' This is a regular feature and it keeps to its brief: to cover as fully as possible all meteorological phenomena in Switzerland for the month in question, mentioning other countries only insofar as they contribute to drought or storm. It is a mine of information and a model of its kind in precision and breadth of coverage. One chart shows minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall and respective deviations from the norm in 11 Swiss cities. The flavour of this unique feature can be gained from a single paragraph: 'The largest part of the country in April experienced below-normal levels of sunshine. But positive deviations were to be found in northern and eastern Switzerland, mostly about 10 to 20 per cent but up to a maximum of 30 per cent. The greatest reductions, around a quarter of the norm or even more were in upper Valais and the Bernese high Alps into the central Alpine region, from the upper part of Lake Geneva almost into the Freiburg region as well as the southern high Jura and the Upper Engadine. There were also substantial below-normal figures throughout Ticino.' But there is always the danger of attempting too broad a canvas, thereby boring the reader. So the weather editor ensures local interest is fully covered in several paragraphs and two diagrams about Zurich alone. One is a graph showing the amount of daily sunshine in the city compared with theoretical maxima. There is a day-by-day pollution record too. The seasonally adjusted increase in ozone in April appeared small. Page 11 was headed 'Various announcements.' Certainly the 'Various' title was well-earned. The main story was 'Inauguration of the new Bavarian State Chancellery - Less-than-convincing example of 'Building for democracy'.' It was noted that 50,000 people had signed a protest against the project, a pretentious affair commissioned by Bavaria's most famous post-war son and known, as a result, as the 'Straussoleum.' Next door was a large piece entitled 'Ireland relaxes contraception.' This said that the question had been a 'seismograph of church-state relations.' Then followed an obituary of the British film actress Ann Todd. The most interesting story was about the 'Surprising change of ownership' at the Demel cake shop in Vienna. Demel's Konditorei is famous throughout middle Europe and has been locked in a bitter battle for some time with the Hotel Sacher over the rights to the Sachertorte, 'Austria's most famous pastry.' The enterprise has now been taken over by the Raiffeisen Zentralbank. Demel's had been compromised by its links with a convicted murderer, Udo Proksch; the government is chasing his money which came from an earlier sale of Demel shares. That instructive tale was followed by 'Medical failures - not quite so rare.' The filler was about an 'uncompleted rape' in Lucerne. And there was a bit about Asil Nadir's escape to northern Cyprus. One gains a total picture of the Swiss, or more specifically the inhabitants of Zurich, from these two pages. There is the obsessive concern with the physical environment which is based on a fanatical sense of place. There is the scarcely concealed dislike of Bavaria and the not-very-genial contempt for Austrians. The Irish story feeds a stiff-necked protestant anti-clericalism. Then there is the usual bit of crime, an obituary and a half-hearted attempt to whip-up a medical scare story. So it is that I have become expert in many questions about other nations. And so it is that I have never been asked the questions. James Morgan is economics correspondent of the BBC World Service.</p>

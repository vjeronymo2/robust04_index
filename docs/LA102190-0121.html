			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> BOOS FOR MAYOR  </P> <P> Couldn't San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor have used a different analogy in her  remarks to GOP officials, instead of calling San Diego "a beautiful girl" who  "doesn't have a dowry" ("Mayor Tries to Sweet-Talk GOP Into Picking S.D.," Oct.  12)?  </P> <P> And boos also to City Councilwoman Judy McCarty for saying that "we may not  have a dowry . . . but we can promise you a lot of fun."  </P> <P> In other words, we are for sale; we'll give you our bodies for your money.  </P> <P> Can you imagine "a handsome boy" with no dowry who'll give you a lot of fun?  Shades of "American Gigolo."  </P> <P> I know that advertising uses sex to sell products -- but our mayor using a  sexual analogy to sell our city? Absurd, tasteless and typical of today's  "marriage" of entertainment, news, politicians.  </P> <P> MICHELLE M. BURKE, Fallbrook  </P></p>

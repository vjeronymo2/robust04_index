			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] I have just received an INTERFAX report in the  studio. It says that Boris Yeltsin has accepted the resignation  of Procurator General Aleksey Kazannikov.    This is followed by a report from the presidential press  service which says that the edict also decrees that Aleksey  Nikolayevich Ilyushenko be presented to the Federation Council  as a candidate for nomination to the post of procurator general  of the Russian Federation.    Until the procurator general is appointed, Ilyushenko is  entrusted with carrying out his duties.    Under another edict, Ilyushenko is released from the post of  head of the control directorate of the president's  administration.</p>

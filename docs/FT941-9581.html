			<p>940214 FT  14 FEB 94 / Viacom favourite as Paramount bid draws to a close Viacom, the US cable television group, last night looked the clear favourite to win the Dollars 10bn battle for control of Paramount Communications, which formally comes to a close tonight. QVC Network, the rival bidder in the five-month struggle, said yesterday that it would not raise its own bid further. Since investors last week expressed a clear preference for Viacom's offer, it seemed likely that Sumner Redstone's cable television group would come out in front. It remained unclear, though, whether Viacom would be able to muster enough support to declare an outright victory by tonight. If it does not speak for at least 50.1 per cent of Paramount's shares, then the formal biddingprocess for the group will end and the battle will collapse into a free-for-all. QVC's statement yesterday that it would not offer more for Paramount came after hints last week that it might change the terms of its bid. 'We said we would not bid above the prudent value for the company, and we haven't,' it said. But QVC added it believed it would be a better owner of Paramount than Viacom, and it continued to question some aspects of Viacom's bid. Viacom's B shares dropped by 4 per cent in New York on Friday, signalling a clear belief that it will come out on top in the five-month battle. Investors fear that whichever company is the victor will be weighed down financially by the takeover. The price of Viacom's B shares fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 31 5/8 on Friday in a trading session which was shortened by an early stock market close due to bad weather. The shares have now almost halved in value since last September, when Sumner Redstone's cable TV group first bid for Paramount. While both offers for Paramount are worth around Dollars 10bn, Viacom has won Wall Street's support with a higher cash component in its bid, along with guarantees for Paramount shareholders should its own share price fall in the year after a takeover. At five months and two days, the Paramount bid war is now two days short of the record five-month, four-day takeover of computer company NCR in 1991, the longest takeover fight in recent Wall Street history.</p>

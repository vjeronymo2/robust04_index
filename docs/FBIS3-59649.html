			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] The Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development  Corp.'s (PNC) Monju fast breeder reactor (FBR) (electrical  output: 280,000 kW) is situated on a plateau facing the Sea of  Japan half-way up a ria coast at the tip of the Tsuruga  Peninsula in Fukui Prefecture. In April, 1991, the PNC finished  installing the reactor's equipment. The PNC now looks toward the  first criticality as it enters into the final round of tests.    The tests are to check the sodium coolant flow and other  such  values to confirm that they match the design values. That data  will be indispensable in obtaining other nuclear data from  reactor physical tests after criticality is reached, and will  contribute greatly in the detailed design of the No. 1  demonstration FBR that the electric power industry (the Japan  Atomic Power Co.) will build in the near future.    The design of the Monju started 25 years ago, and the  results  of operating the Joyo demonstration FBR (Oarai-machi, Ibaraki  Prefecture) were used to the utmost in constructing the Monju.  The Monju is actually the fruition of a quarter century of  development efforts. Unlike power generated by light-water  reactor that use water as a coolant, the Monju uses sodium. This  is the first such nuclear power generation. Although the Monju  is the fifth reactor of its kind, following prototype FBRs in  France, the UK, and Russia (two), the facilities are the newest  and best. Even France has used the Monju's sodium fire  prevention measures as a reference and is now making repairs to  its Super Phoenix so that it can resume operation of the reactor.       The Monju uses sodium, but to prevent accidents, leakage,  and  fires, air is expelled from the inside of the reactor housing  vessel, in which both the primary and secondary systems are  located, and the inside of the reactor housing vessel has an  atmosphere of inactive nitrogen. Because the periphery of the  reactor cannot be seen, this was the last chance to report about  the site that will be pressed with tests before criticality.  <H5>  A "High-Tech Castle" Made By Pulling the Pieces Over a Roller </H5>   A private bay where large, heavy objects are unloaded from  ships can be seen below the plateau half-way up the ria coast.  Since construction of the Monju began on 25 October 1985, all  the equipment and materials, such as that for the housing vessel  installation (completed in April 1987) and the reactor vessel  installation (completed in October 1988), have been brought up  from the private bay. The number of transport ships that entered  the bay is 119; in terms of weight, about 200,000 tons. Because  of all that the "high-tech castle" is completed today. To get  from the private bay to the site you have to travel about 1.2 km  up a sloping road. Bringing the 280-ton reactor vessel up to the  site took four days (starting on 11 October 1988). The scene of  the cautious, 1-meter/minute pulling of the reactor vessel over  a roller, like the construction of the Pyramids in ancient  Egypt, is unforgettable.    An event of 19 years came to mind while I was looking up at  the "castle" from the bay. The delay of the start of operation  of the completed Joyo demonstration reactor, the parent of  Monju's construction, due to design re-evaluation (October to  December 1974) was a "gift." So as not to repeat the mistake of  the Mutsu nuclear-powered ship, on which a radiation leak  occurred in the summer of that year, the decision was made to  have a comprehensive inspection of the facilities. Needless to  say, during the 16 years of Joyo operation that followed, there  were no accidents, though various troubles occurred in the  stages of experimental reactors in advanced countries that had  started 10 years earlier than Japan. Sodium leakage, which is  the FBR's weak point, did not occur, and as many as 50,031 fuel  rods have been burned so far with not a single rod showing any  damaged fuel. That was because the Mutsu was a "bad example"  from which much was learned.    Returning back to the present, the first criticality of the  Monju was changed for the third time from "October criticality"  to next spring because of the troubles with the fuel pellet  sintering furnace (Tokai-mura, Ibaraki Prefecture) that delayed  the production of the remaining 15&percnt; of the total fuel for  the  Monju. That happening truly shows the one-and-indivisible  relationship between the "reactor" and the "nuclear fuel cycle."    A look at the recent trends in the Atomic Energy  Commission's  FBR Development Project Special Subcommittee, which is now  discussing future measures for making FBRs practical that  include the No. 1 demonstration reactor project, shows that the  nuclear power industry should use as material for deepening its  self-awareness the fact that MITI and part of the electric power  industry only see "reactors" and are lacking in consideration  toward the "nuclear fuel cycle." And, the PNC should effectively  use the date when it came to the surface as a bad example, as in  the past example of the Joyo reactor.  <H3>  Engineer Spirit Making the Most of a Once-in-1,000-Years  Chance </H3>   During the busiest phase of the construction there were as  many as 4,000 workers at the site. Recently, the total number of  workers dropped to 400; 200 people are PNC employees, including  80 people from 10 electric power companies, and 200 people are  from collaborating companies. Nevertheless, the atmosphere is  tense as can be with the 400 workers conducting overall  inspections of all the machinery and equipment before the task  of loading 198 fuel assemblies into the core.    The 80 people from the electric power industry are the  necessary operations and maintenance personnel for future FBR  electric power generation. For four years already they have been  permanently stationed at the Monju, and there are 10 young  electric power men burning with the engineer spirit who have  been working at the plant since the construction stage. There  will be a five-man system in which two men will be electric  power men; one of the two has experience operating a gas  reactor, a boiling water reactor, and pressurized-water reactor.  They are all impressed that the frontier for unfolding Japan's  nuclear power policies is in their region. "They all should be  proud to not pass by this once-in-a-thousand-years chance--the  startup of Japan's first FBR electric power generation,"  mentioned Plant Division No. 2 Chief Maeda.    Next I will present a few of the results from the tests thus  far. The first is an example that shows that the nuclear reactor  system is a "large-scale precision machine." The fuel  transporter weighs about 450 tons, and the precision when the  fuel moves on the 80m-long rail at 5m/sec then stops is +/-1mm.  During fuel exchange it will be entirely automated. The  transporter moves precisely to the targeted fuel and is the  indispensable basis for accurately bringing fuel into and out of  the reactor.    The next result comes from the preliminary plant  characteristics tests that have been carried out since early  this year. The tests involved circulating sodium in the pipes of  the primary and secondary systems. The temperature of the sodium  was raised to 200&deg;C with an external heater, then when the  sodium was circulated by means of a pump, the pump's rotational  energy was transmitted, and it was confirmed that the  temperature of the sodium entering the reactor core rose to  400&deg;C due to the frictional heating. When the Monju actually  generates power, the sodium flowing in the pipes will be at a  temperature of 530&deg;C. However, even without using an "atomic  fire," the stage where it is alright to raise the temperature  another 130&deg;C has already been reached. "With this, it looks  quite certain that there will be no problems with Monju  operation after the first criticality," says Director Tadao  Takahashi optimistically.  <H5>  "International Stage" With France, UK, US, and Germany </H5>   Because the Monju is the newest kind of prototype reactor,  it  has already attracted the attention of advanced countries.  Concretely, two French men who have experience operating  France's Super Phoenix reactor and an English couple who have  operated the British PFR are permanently stationed at the Monju  and take part in all of the tests. It has also been decided that  one person from the U.S. and one person from Germany will be  included in the near future. It is becoming an "international  stage" geared toward the practical use of FBRs. International  exchange is also vigorous: in the evening after their work is  finished, the Japanese workers receive French language lessons  from the French men. Despite the talk about a worldwide slowdown  in FBR development, Director Takahashi says, "Just because it  looks at first sight as if a slowdown is occurring because of  each country's social and economic situations, that does not  mean that it will be choked off altogether." That is because  countries will be preparing for the age around the middle of the  21st century when energy resources will start to dry up.    Japan, which long ago lagged behind in development, is now  in  a position to move to the top in the world. "Like skating, Japan  is in the position of `responsibility foremost,' and firmly  senses its international responsibility," emphasizes Director  Takahashi.    Recently in France troubles with the prototype and  demonstration reactors have continued, and the restart of the  Super Phoenix's operation has been politically delayed. With the  aim of starting operations in the middle of next year, political  procedures and repair work are progressing. One example of that  is the sodium fire prevention measures, which were thoroughly  investigated by anti-nuclear groups. The Super Phoenix's  secondary system is now undergoing repairs. Frankly speaking,  that is something France learned by watching Japan.    In the Monju's reactor housing vessel where sodium will flow  in the primary and secondary system pipes, the air will be  expelled and replaced with inactivated nitrogen gas. Even if  there is a leak, the reactor is devised so that it will not  naturally ignite. There is also a double safety measure: metal  covers the floor, walls, and ceiling.    In contrast, such safety measures are not provided for in  the  pipes of the Super Phoenix's secondary system, and that became  its "ruin." Through Japanese-French atomic energy exchange,  France is learning from Japan and is now doing repair work on  the Super Phoenix.    Getting back to domestic issues, since 2 September 1992 the  Atomic Energy Commission of Japan has been looking ahead to the  middle of the next century in discussing revisions to the  "Long-Term Atomic Energy Utilization and Development Plan."  Whether or not it reflects the trends in France and other  countries, MITI and part of the electric power industry are  taking a "wait and do nothing" attitude about practical use.  Nevertheless, "pleading words" directed to the Atomic Energy  Commission were heard from the Monju's head ranks, including the  site supervisors. "Please decide the route of FBR development.  The important thing is the succession of the technology."</p>

Izhar Ibrahim, Indonesia's chief delegate to the Kuala  Lumpur talks on the dispute, said there seemed to be progress in  the talks because Malaysia had reacted positively to Indonesia's  hope for a speedier settlement. During the talks, which started  on Wednesday, Malaysia also responded to Indonesia's statement  on the ownership of the islands made during the earlier talks in  July 1992.</p>

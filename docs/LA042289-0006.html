			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MANILA SLAYING BRINGS CAUTION FOR AMERICANS  </P> <P> Americans in the Philippines were advised Friday to take extra safety  precautions after suspected Communist guerrillas assassinated a top U.S.  military adviser in a Manila suburb.  </P> <P> The Philippine military also stepped up security for U.S. bases and personnel  after Army Col. James N. (Nick) Rowe was ambushed on his way to work early  Friday morning.  </P> <P> Rowe, 51, a native of McAllen, Tex., was a decorated Vietnam War hero who was  held in a cage for five years by the Viet Cong as a prisoner of war until he  escaped in 1968.  </P> <P> Rowe was chief of the army division at the Joint U.S. Military Advisory Group  headquarters in the Manila suburb of Quezon City. The unit provides training  and logistical support to the Philippine military, which is fighting a 20-year  Communist insurgency.  </P> <P> </P> <P> No Claim of Responsibility  </P> <P> No group claimed responsibility for the attack, but Defense Secretary Fidel V.  Ramos said Philippine officials believe the killers were Communist rebels. He  noted that the rebels had threatened to attack U.S. targets unless the United  States closed its bases here and stopped aiding President Corazon Aquino's  government.  </P> <P> U.S. Ambassador Nicholas Platt said in a statement that he was uncertain about  the rebels' involvement.  </P> <P> "But should anyone think that killing this brave officer will alter in any way  (the) U.S. policy of support for Philippine democracy, they are wrong," he  said. " . . . This act will only strengthen American resolve to stand with the  government and people of the Philippines led by President Aquino. We will not  be deterred by terrorists."  </P> <P> At the White House, Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater called the killing "a  cowardly and heinous act.  </P> <P> "Col. Rowe was in the Philippines to help the Filipino people in their efforts  to defend democracy," Fitzwater said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> November 2, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE PUSHES PLAN TO LET INS IDENTIFY ALIEN CRIMINALS WHILE THEY'RE IN COURTS  </P> <P> Thousands of illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes, including murder and  drug trafficking, escape deportation because immigration authorities are not  trying to identify them in state courts, an Orange County judge told a  congressional panel Wednesday.  </P> <P> Superior Court Judge David O. Carter, who has established an unusual program in  his courtroom to allow immigration officials to check the citizenship of  convicted felons, urged Congress to take steps to ensure that other  jurisdictions adopt the idea.  </P> <P> Carter's program is believed to be the only such effort in the country,  according to congressional aides and immigration officials.  </P> <P> Carter testified before the immigration subcommittee of the House Judiciary  Committee, which is considering legislation that would expand the arrest powers  of federal immigration agents. The committee is also studying the more  fundamental problem of how to deal with illegal aliens who commit serious  crimes.  </P> <P> Although it is difficult to determine the number of criminals who are in the  country illegally, Carter and others said the problem is substantial. One  immigration official told the panel that state and federal prisons house more  than 120,000 aliens, not necessarily illegal, who are deportable because of  their criminal convictions.  </P> <P> The Immigration and Naturalization Service generally does not try to identify  illegal aliens among the criminal population until after they are incarcerated,  according to an official of the General Accounting Office who testified at the  hearing.  </P> <P> "This strategy . . . is not effective in dealing with all deportable aliens  because, for example, they may receive a probationary or suspended sentence,"  said Lowell Dodge, director of the justice section of the GAO, the  investigative arm of Congress.  </P> <P> Under federal law, aliens -- both legal and illegal -- become deportable if  they are convicted of so-called aggravated felonies such as murder, robbery,  drug dealing or other serious crimes.  </P> <P> "A primary focus of the (INS) . . . should be the deportation of illegal  immigrant narcotics offenders out of the state courts," Carter told the  subcommittee.  </P> <P> He said the government's "drug war" has tended to focus on the federal level  and failed to recognize that most offenders are under state jurisdiction.  </P> <P> "In the past, INS was not invited into the state courts," he said. "The result  is that the vast majority of illegal immigrant drug dealers are not deported by  INS."  </P> <P> The program Carter instituted a year ago is intended to correct that problem,  the judge said, by identifying criminals who are in the country illegally  before they are released on probation or shipped off to county jail or state  prison.  </P> <P> Identification of illegal aliens who have received probationary sentences  permits them to be deported immediately instead of being allowed to remain in  the country. And by placing an INS hold on convicts before they are  incarcerated, officials ensure that the criminals will be subject to  deportation upon their release from custody.  </P> <P> During the first nine months of 1989, Carter said INS identified as illegal  aliens 36.4% of the 1,880 defendants in his court who were convicted of felony  offenses or probation violations.  </P> <P> Carter suggested that the federal government should require cooperation between  state courts and federal immigration authorities for those states that receive  federal aid for anti-drug programs.  </P> <P> The proposal met with an enthusiastic response from Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),  a subcommittee member who authored the bill to give immigration agents general  arrest powers.  </P> <P> "You are really doing something that is unique and of real benefit to this  country, and it's incredible to me that it's not being duplicated elsewhere,"  Smith told Carter.  </P> <P> Smith said William J. Bennett, who heads the federal anti-drug effort,  expressed interest in Carter's suggestion in a conversation Wednesday morning.  Carter, however, said Bennett so far had ignored his request for an  appointment. Smith said he would try to arrange a meeting.  </P></p>

			<p>940408 FT  08 APR 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: London coffee futures surge to fresh highs Coffee prices reached a new high point yesterday as July futures on the London Commodity Exchange soared Dollars 33 a tonne to close at Dollars 1,440 a tonne. Even some London traders were surprised at the strength of the market, which has seen prices rise by nearly Dollars 100 a tonne in the past week. Fund buying continued to push up the price yesterday, but trade and roaster buyers were also active in the market. Rumours that the Ivory Coast was about to halt coffee and cocoa exports unless shippers paid a back-dated export tax also helped to fuel the market. A report on levels of coffee stocks by ED &amp; F. Man, the London trading house, helped to underpin prices. The report concluded that stocks of robusta coffee held by consumers had dropped to uncomfortably low levels. The broker estimated that stocks of green coffee in consumers' hands had fallen to 16.9m bags at the end of February, 3.3m bags below from the level a year earlier. The fall in stocks underlines the success of the producers' retention scheme whereby exporters withhold up to 20 per cent of supplies from the export market. This was set up in October last year with the aim of eroding the consumer stocks that were hanging over the market. But crop problems in producing countries have probably done more to fuel fears of coffee shortages. In Indonesia heavy rains have delayed shipments and boosted prices, but the overall size of the crop is not expected to be affected and production is forecast to be up slightly on last year at 7m bags. However, the Ivory Coast crop is believed to be much lower than last year at between 2m and 2.5m bags, compared with 3m bags. Soaring prices in the coffee market have attracted speculative interest, which traders believe could switch quickly to another market once prices begin to fall, exacerbating any downturn. 'At some point the bubble will burst and it could become quite ugly,' one trader commented.</p>

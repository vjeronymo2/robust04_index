Final  </P> <P> AQUINO VOWS FIGHT ON 'SHAMELESS CORRUPTION'  </P> <P> Philippine President Corazon Aquino today admitted government corruption has  returned on a shameless scale under her presidency and said she will lead a  major campaign to stamp it out no matter who gets hurt.  </P> <P> Aquino also lashed out at her critics, calling them "thieves" who have no right  to preach to her about honesty because they plundered the economy when they  were in power.  </P> <P> She said the anti-corruption campaign "must spare no one," neither friends who  helped bring her to power nor her political enemies.  </P></p>

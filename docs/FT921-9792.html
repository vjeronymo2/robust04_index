			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / PM outlines manifesto 'pillars' MR JOHN MAJOR told Young Conservatives at the weekend that individual choice, opportunity, ownership and responsibility would be the 'pillars' of his manifesto. Mr Chris Patten, party chairman, told the Young Conservatives' conference in Eastbourne, that economic competence and taxation, defence and 'leadership' would provide the core of the party's attack on Labour. His slogan was that the Tories offered economic recovery and Labour permanent recession. Some of the details have been held back to give substance to a carefully-planned series of announcements over the next few weeks, but the Conservatives have now marked out clearly the ground on which they intend to fight the general election. The themes would not have looked out of place in a manifesto crafted by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, Mr Major's predecessor as prime minister and party leader. But the government, Mr Major insisted, would never forget those who had been 'knocked off' the ladder of opportunity or the need for a 'free' National Heath Service. The emphasis on individual choice which already runs through the Conservatives' tax, education, and privatisation policies is to be progressively strengthened in the approach to the election. A white paper later this week on employment and training will signal a further push to establish the primacy of the individual over collective agreements in the workplace. There may also be proposals to extend to adults the scheme to give individual training vouchers to the young unemployed. A consultation paper next month will foreshadow a manifesto commitment to break the local authorities' remaining grip on housing by the introduction of compulsory competitive tendering for housing management. There will also be further efforts to promote the Citizen's Charter as the instrument through which individuals can assert their rights against the state. Mr Major edged back from a detailed plan for the privatisation of British Rail, preferring to talk of the 'break-up' of the rail monopoly. He foreshadowed a series of pledges to reinforce personal ownership. Alongside a reduction in inheritance tax, the promise is for tax incentives for share ownership and other savings and - the recession notwithstanding - an attempt to extend the sale of council houses and flats. Opportunity and responsibility are presented as the mirror image of the drive for choice and ownership. Ownership will provide opportunity; choice will confer responsibility. The aim is to develop each of them in a detailed programme of announcements planned for the next few weeks. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will be expected to pull together many of the strands in his Budget on March 10. If all goes to plan, Mr Major will draw in the rest in a speech four days later at the Conservative Central Council. That speech is intended to launch the election campaign proper.</p>

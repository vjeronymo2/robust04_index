			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Terrorists Are Planning Revenge"] </F>   [Excerpts] Combatants of the Islamic resistance movement  Hizballah (party of Allah), in cooperation with top terrorists,  are preparing attacks against Israeli targets abroad. In this  context, they are also planning to operate on German soil.  According to Arab intelligence services, a close collaborator  of the legendary terrorist Carlos has left his hideout in Iran  and arrived in Beirut to prepare some operations. In the  Lebanese capital, the Carlos aide discussed with the chief  coordinator for operations abroad of the Iranian Hizballah the  setting up of terrorist cells that will also be active in the  Federal Republic. The members of such cells will above all be  recruited from the Islamistic movement in Tunisia. The ill-famed  terrorist organization of Abu Nidal has channeled four  combatants with forged travel documents from Beirut via Cyprus  to Germany. The planned terrorist operations are intended as  revenge for the kidnapping of Islamic activist Mustafa  al-Dirani. [passage omitted on al-Dirani kidnapping]</p>

			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: Short cut to growth The government's decision to cut rates is a surprise only as regards its timing. By acting yesterday it imposed large losses on gilt-edged market-makers who were short ahead of tomorrow's auction. Its disregard for a group whose co-operation is needed in sales of up to Pounds 1bn a week in the coming financial year adds to the sense that the cut was a matter of political urgency after last week's unemployment data. If the restoration of growth is thereby confirmed as the top policy priority, the markets must expect rates to fall further. The March budget may also pay only lip service to fiscal rectitude and the need to reduce the PSBR. Of course, higher growth would reduce the borrowing requirement over time. But it has also looked for some time as though lower short-term rates - and by implication a lower exchange rate which will eventually help attract overseas money - will also be needed to help finance it. One task for the authorities has thus been to engineer a steeper yield curve to encourage investors to switch out of cash. Even after yesterday's rate cut the difference between three month and 10 year money is still only 2.6 percentage points in the UK compared with 3.4 in the US. Ultimately the shape of the curve will probably matter more to PSBR funding than will any lingering offence felt by market-makers. Assuming that a steeper curve is part of the strategy, the temptation to allow sales of gilts to banks to count as PSBR funding becomes hard to resist. Banks have been reluctant buyers of gilts so far, but would become less so as the curve steepened. Even so, a specially-tailored instrument might be required. An ultra-short, two year gilt would fit the bill. It would suit the banks - and allow the authorities to argue that any relaxation of their funding rules would be limited in time.</p>

Abacha's government will soon meet the same ends as those of  General Ibrahim Babangida and Ernest Shonekan, his predecessors,  Abiola was reported as saying by the independent Lagos daily  GUARDIAN on Monday.    Abacha came to power in November last year following the  collapse of Babangida's eight-year regime in August and the  short-lived government of Shonekan, an unelected civilian former  premier.    "Any nation that does not have the chance of choosing those  who lead them is a slave nation," Abiola added. Abiola, a  millionaire Muslim who headed the Social Democratic Party's  presidential bid for power, explained why he had not led an open  rebellion against the cancelling of the presidential election  result. "I am not mad enough to fight with the sword. To be  president you have to be alive. I want to stay alive to govern  Nigeria and solve its mounting problems," Abiola said.    Abiola branded Abacha's regime "anti-democratic and  illegitimate" when he returned to Nigeria at the end of December  after leaving for a "rest" in Britain.</p>

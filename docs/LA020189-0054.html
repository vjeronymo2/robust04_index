			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> 17 DIE IN CRASH OF JET TANKER  </P> <P> A refueling tanker jet bound for Hawaii crashed in a ball of flame Tuesday as  it took off from Dyess Air Force Base, killing at least 17 people aboard,  officials said.  </P> <P> Officials at K. I. Sawyer Air Force Base near Marquette, Mich., where the  flight originated, said the plane's passengers included spouses of military  members or retired military members. No children were believed to be on board.  </P> <P> The crew of the KC-135 tanker "never got it off the ground," said Vernon  Wright, 19, who saw the crash. "The first thing I saw was just the mushroom of  the smoke."  </P> <P> "I heard the plane as it was coming down," said Skeet Jackson of Abilene.  "Engines were backfiring and missing. It curved off to the left and crashed,  and then I saw the ball of smoke and fire go up."  </P> <P> Air Force Lt. Col. George Peck at Strategic Air Command headquarters in Omaha  said that at least 17 people were killed. He added that there was no evidence  the crew had radioed for help before the crash.  </P> <P> The plane was on a training mission from Dyess to Hickam Air Force Base,  Hawaii, a spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> Sources in Washington said the plane was almost fully loaded with jet fuel,  carrying 155,000 pounds, including its own fuel and fuel to be transferred to  some F-16 fighter jets as they crossed the Pacific Ocean.  </P> <P> Air Force officials said the tanker crashed near the south end of the base  runway, near U.S. 277 and about 6 miles southwest of Abilene.  </P> <P> The maintenance record for the plane, powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney jet  engines, was not yet available, Peck said.  </P> <P> It was the second crash at Dyess in less than three months. A B-1B bomber  crashed there Nov. 8, a B-1B bomber crashed there after its crew of four bailed  out to safety.  </P></p>

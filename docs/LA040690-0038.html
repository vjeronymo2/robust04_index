			<p><P> April 6, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EL CAMINO REAL'S BOLDT TOUGH NUT TO CRACK, 6-4  </P> <P> For high drama, one would be hard-pressed to find a better package than El  Camino Real High's 6-4 squeaker over host San Fernando in a Northwest Valley  Conference baseball game Thursday.  </P> <P> But for Sean Boldt and Richard Sanchez, it was just another act in a  long-running show. Boldt, a pitcher for El Camino Real (8-0-1), The Times'  top-ranked team in the region, and Sanchez, a senior third baseman for  fifth-ranked San Fernando, met once again in tense competition, as they have  been doing since their Little League days.  </P> <P> "I've been going one-on-one against him since I was 10," Boldt said.  </P> <P> This time it was Boldt winning the battle of one-upmanship. He retired Sanchez  twice in the final three innings -- including the game's final out -- to seal  his first save of the year and make a winner of starter Ryan McGuire (3-0).  </P> <P> What made this latest confrontation between the longtime rivals more memorable  were the circumstances: Two of the City Section's top teams locked in a  give-and-take game for the second time in three days. And when McGuire,  pitching with a slightly aggravated hamstring, tired in the fifth, Boldt got  his first call of the year.  </P> <P> Boldt, a junior right-hander who was trying to protect a one-run lead, found  the bases loaded, two out and Sanchez staring at him. Sanchez came to bat with  eight hits in his last nine tries, a conference-leading 24 hits and a .543  batting average.  </P> <P> "I was fully aware of that," Boldt said. "We had it on our charts."  </P> <P> Familiarity, then, bred relaxation for Boldt, who coaxed Sanchez into ending  the inning -- albeit on a stinging line drive to center fielder Jeff Marks.  </P> <P> Then, with Tigers at first and third in the seventh, McGuire threw his body in  front of Sanchez's sharp, two-out grounder to first base, and, from his knees,  fired a line drive to Boldt who beat Sanchez to the bag as the base flew into  the air from the impact of colliding feet.  </P> <P> For a time, it did not appear as if El Camino Real would need Boldt's heroics.  With the score tied, 1-1, in the third inning, the Conquistadores touched  Hector De La Cruz (2-2) for four runs and a 5-1 lead. Pat Treend had a  run-scoring double, Greg Lederman hit an RBI single and Gregg Sheren ripped a  two-run double into the gap in left-center.  </P> <P> San Fernando (8-3-2, 5-3-1) chipped away, however, scoring once in the third on  Adrian Diaz's double and twice in the fourth on a Carlos Rodriguez double and a  McGuire balk with a runner on third.  </P> <P> El Camino Real scored an unearned run in the top of the seventh to account for  the final score.  </P></p>

			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Science scrutinises the brain in action Scientists have known for many years that specific parts of the human brain are used for performing different types of thinking, but pin-pointing and mapping these areas has proved difficult. Now a team of researchers from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories and the University of Minnesota Medical School has developed a new non-invasive technique which enables them to safely and accurately 'see' the human brain working in a normal conscious person. The scanning technique, called Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (Bold) imaging, detects increases in oxygenated blood flow to active areas of the brain. Unlike the standard images of different types of brain tissue produced by conventional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the new method provides colour images showing the precise locations of increased neuron activity. 'Our method adds an entirely new dimension to MRI images of the brain, allowing us not just to see the brain, but to see it working,' said Bell Laboratories biophysicist Seiji Ogawa. 'By imaging the brain in this way, we can map the specific sites of certain mental activity.' AT&amp;T: US, 201 564 3836: University of Minnesota: US, 612 624 4604.</p>

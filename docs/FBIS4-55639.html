			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Kevin Drew: "Slovakia Pushes Reforms"] </F>   [Text] Bratislava--Slovak leaders are stepping up their  economic reform program, pledging to put 100 billion Sk ($3.3  billion) worth of companies on the market when the second wave  of privatization is launched in September. Around 300  companies, representing 33 percent of all state-owned property,  are slated to go on the auction block this fall. In comparison,  only 3 percent privatized between June 1992, when Vladimir  Meciar was elected prime minister, and last month, when  parliament forced him out of office.    The drive towards privatization, timed to hit on the eve of  the national elections scheduled for Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, is  being urged along by government officials and economists who  want to reinstill in the international community the confidence  that Slovakia is committed to reform. "The aim is to push  privatization so far that no future government could reverse it,  not even Meciar," said one Western advisor who wished to remain  anonymous.    Inheritors of the poorer half of the former Czechoslovak  nation, Slovak leaders have managed to make some progress  towards a market economy. The private sector now accounts for  nearly 40 percent of economic activity and government debt is  low compared to many other post-communist countries.    "It's not that Slovakia has backpedaled or done poorly,"  said  Andreas Georgiou, resident representative of the International  Monetary Fund. "Slovakia hasn't progressed as rapidly as it  could have, but it has progressed."    Between 1989 and 1992, 30 percent of the Slovak economy was  privatized. But soon after Meciar was elected prime minister in  June 1992, the Slovak government announced it was slowing the  pace of privatization, arguing that rapid reforms could backfire  by creating skyrocketing inflation, unemployment and public  discontent.    A number of the privatization projects carried out under  Meciar's government have since been attacked as illegal. Early  this month, for instance, the parliamentary committee for  privatization found that 13 projects approved by the Meciar  administration in February violated the government's own  privatization rules by giving advantages to a select group of  buyers.    The former government approved the direct sale of state  companies to pre-selected buyers, even though the buyers of some  firms such as Tesla Stropkov, Skloobal Nemsova, ZOS Vrutkz and  ZOS Trnava could not demonstrate that they had enough financial  resources to develop the companies.    The slowdown in privatization never achieved its goals,  however. Under Meciar, unemployment and inflation shot up  because the government never implemented a clear reform path.  Budget deficits began to mount.    Unemployment in Slovakia now stands at 15 percent, compared  to 3 percent in the Czech Republic; inflation is 15 percent,  compared to the annualized Czech rate of 10 percent; and the  average monthly income is $160, compared to over $200 in the  Czech Republic.    The slowdown of privatization also sent warning signals to  international investors initially eager to capitalize on  Slovakia's well-trained and cheap labor poor. By mid-1992, only  122 Slovak companies had U.S. investment, totaling just $20  million.    "Investors don't like uncertainty," said Douglas Swaim,  senior investment officer of the Slovak-American Enterprise  Fund. "From the inside, we're convinced that Slovakia will  stabilize. But from the outside, you have to wonder."    In the six months left before the fall elections, the new  government hopes to assuage such fears. "We must finish our  attempts at macroeconomic stability as well as microeconomic  stability," Finance Minister Rudolf Filkus told reporters  recently.    Government leaders intend to reduce this year's projected  budget deficit from 23 billion Sk to 6 billion Sk, lower  inflation to 13 percent and keep unemployment under 17 percent.  Courting foreign aid and smoothing trade relations with the  Czech Republic are also priorities.    "To some degree, Slovakia is a diamond in the rough," said  Swaim. "If the country can get its act together with  privatization and articulating a clear economic policy, it will  have no trouble attracting investors."</p>

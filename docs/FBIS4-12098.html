			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reports by Muhammad 'Ali al-Qulaybi in Tunis and Ilyas </F> Nasrallah in London: "News of a Secret Agreement Between Israel  and the PLO"]    [Excerpt] An informed Palestinian source has revealed to  AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that the security agreement on Hebron signed  by the PLO and Israel the day before yesterday in Cairo was  coupled with another secret agreement between the two sides,  details of which have not been officially announced.    The source said that one of the secret agreement's  provisions  was Israel's agreement to allow 35 Palestinian deportees, all  Fatah members, to return to the occupied territory. It is  believed that these deportees will constitute a part of the  security and administrative apparatus of the Palestinian  autonomy in Gaza and Jericho. The agreement also provides for  the revival of the Hebron Municipal Council under the  chairmanship of Mustafa al-Natshah.    According to the same source, a list of the names of the 35  deportees is being prepared in Tunis. It is believed that the  list will include names whose repatriation was requested by the  PLO and rejected by Israel last year. The list, which will be  submitted to Israel tomorrow, is expected to include Muhammad  Dahlan, former official in charge of Fatah in the Gaza Strip;  Jibril al-Rajub, former official in charge of Fatah in the  central sector of the West Bank and current director of the  commander in chief's office in Tunis; Samih Subayhat and Marwan  al-Barghuthi, two Fatah activists who occupied the post of Bir  Zayt University Students Union chairman at different times;  Akram Haniyyah, former editor of the paper AL-SHA'B and current  personal adviser to Palestinian President Yasir 'Arafat; and  Ahmad al-Dik, formerly a prominent Fatah figure in the West Bank  and son-in-law of the late Khalil al-Wazir (Abu-Jihad).    It is believed that by agreeing to allow the repatriation of  35 deportees, Israel was trying to compensate for the killing of  six Fatah members in Gaza last Tuesday. [passage omitted]</p>

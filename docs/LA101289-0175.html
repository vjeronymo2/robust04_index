			<p><P> October 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STATE TO PROBE ELKS IN VALLEY;  </P> <P> BIAS: THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WILL INVESTIGATE WHETHER A LODGE VIOLATED  THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF 2 BLACKS IT REJECTED.  </P> <P> The state attorney general's office announced Wednesday that it will  investigate whether members of the Van Nuys Elks Lodge violated state civil  rights laws last month in twice rejecting two blacks who applied for membership  in the predominantly white club.  </P> <P> The decision follows a similar investigation into the Lompoc Elks Lodge, which  rejected two blacks for membership last winter. That investigation was called  off after the lodge voted last month to admit the men under new voting laws  passed last July by the national membership, Deputy Atty. Gen. Louis Verdugo  said.  </P> <P> The new laws allow lodges to admit members by a two-thirds vote. Previously,  applicants could be rejected if as few as three members opposed them.  </P> <P> Before investigators try to determine whether the club's votes constitute  illegal discrimination, they must decide whether the matter falls within the  attorney general's jurisdiction, said Verdugo, who works in the office's Civil  Rights Enforcement Unit in Los Angeles. That means showing that the lodge has  attributes of a business or that membership generates business advantages, he  said.  </P> <P> If investigators find evidence of illegality, they will present the findings to  a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge, who can hold a hearing to decide  whether to order the lodge not to consider race in reviewing membership  applications, Verdugo said.  </P> <P> Dan Davis, a spokesman for the 300-member lodge, said he was unaware of the  attorney general's decision and could not comment on it. He has said in the  past that the lodge is not racist and that it accepts applications from men of  all minority groups.  </P> <P> The rejected black applicants Wednesday welcomed the investigation but said  they wished it were unnecessary.  </P> <P> "It's ridiculous that this has come to pass," said Thomas J. Montgomery, 67, a  retired state motor vehicles examiner who was awarded the Bronze Star for valor  in the Army in World War II.  </P> <P> "I never had any idea that racism was so close to us here in the San Fernando  Valley, in Van Nuys. I was shocked that we were turned down, and the second  time was even worse."  </P> <P> The other rejected applicant, Jules S. Bagneris III, said: "If the Van Nuys  Elks are without racial prejudice, then they have nothing to fear from an  investigation. It's not a big surprise that he is going forward with it. Where  there's smoke, there's fire, and apparently the smoke was strong enough to  warrant a full investigation."  </P> <P> Bagneris, 29, is a Lake View Terrace resident and minister at an African  Methodist Episcopal Church in El Centro who ran unsuccessfully against Los  Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi in April.  </P> <P> State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Tarzana), a lodge member who sponsored Bagneris and  Montgomery for membership, said he does not believe the inquiry will uncover  evidence of widespread racism.  </P> <P> "I don't think it's a case of bias by the entire lodge," he said. "I think  there are some members that are racially motivated, but I think they are a  small minority.  </P> <P> "A majority of the members that voted are in favor of admission," he said,  referring to the second ballot vote of 34 to 19 to admit the men, two votes  short of the needed two-thirds support.  </P></p>

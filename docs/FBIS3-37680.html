Galina Sidorova, political adviser to the Russian foreign  minister, told the ITAR-TASS correspondent that one of the  subjects discussed by A. Kozyrev and K. Kinkel was German  assistance in the development of contacts with Russia's northern  regions, in the first place with Murmansk. Germany, as the  future chairman of the Council of the Economic Community,  intends to hold a meeting there of the three (the former, the  current, and the future chairmen of the Council of the European  Community), to see on the spot what can be done for establishing  cooperation with Murmansk Oblast.    Germany intends to participate most vigorously in the  development of this oblast and at the meeting of the ministers  some specific decisions in this area were discussed. In  particular K. Kinkel intends to propose a German town as a  "twin-town" for Murmansk.    Germany is ahead of many other countries in terms of  fleshing  out its political partnership with Russia. If effective  cooperation is established with Murmansk, this could serve as a  positive example for other regions of Russia, the minister's  political adviser pointed out.    A. Kozyrev and K. Kinkel also discussed the situation in the  Baltic region and Russia's attitude to the Baltic states.</p>

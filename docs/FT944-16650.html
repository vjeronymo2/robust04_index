			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / International Company News: Pechiney sets sights on cutting debt Pechiney, the French state-controlled metals group, plans to reduce its debt 'sharply and rapidly', partly through assets sales, in the hope of being privatised after the end of 1995, Mr Jean-Pierre Rodier, the new president, said yesterday. Mr Rodier told the Tribune Desfosses, the French newspaper, that after two months in his post he had started a detailed study of what Pechiney might sell to reduce its FFr20bn (Dollars 3.8bn) debt. 'The problem is not so much selling assets as choosing well what you want to keep,' he said. The newspaper raised the possibility of Pechiney selling Howmet, its US aircraft and engine components subsidiary, either through a stock market flotation or a management buy-out. Mr Rodier, however, stressed that no decision had been taken. Mr Rodier's background is in the non-ferrous metals industry, most recently with Union Miniere of Belgium, and he said he could not imagine Pechiney 'without a significant activity in aluminium'. He welcomed the recent pick-up in world demand and prices for aluminium, due in large part to joint action by Western and Russian producers to cut back output. He also reaffirmed the Dollars 1bn plan of Pechiney, along with Bechtel of the US and Morgan Grenfell, the British bank, to modernise Russian aluminium factories.</p>

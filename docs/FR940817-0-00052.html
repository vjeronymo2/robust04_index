			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Legal Sufficiency <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sixty-nine advocacy organizations and individuals filed substantially similar or identical comments stating that the regulations are legally insufficient to meet the legislative mandate set forth by Congress. These comments are generally summarized below and followed by specific comments and responses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters stated that the regulations are legally insufficient because they fail to comply with the congressional mandates: (1) to define the enforcement authority; (2) to elaborate on the scope and limits of such authority and to formulate written policies, directives, rules, and regulations to ensure the exercise of that authority within those limits; (3) to provide training for officers in how to exercise the discretionary authority granted; and (4) to outline a formal procedure for agency accountability to the community when the authority has been exercised. The commenters stated that the regulations are insufficiently specific and detailed on each of these subjects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the Service agrees with many of the suggestions regarding appropriate law enforcement standards as consistent with Department policy applicable to all law enforcement agencies, the Service disagrees that these regulations are either the appropriate vehicle to specify the detail of such standards, or that Congress mandated such a degree of specificity. The commenters effectively requested that the Service and the Department provide specific guidelines for discretionary decisions under other legal constraints and sound judgment, detailed procedures of daily operation, and substantive training materials, timetables, and protocols that are encompassed in enforcement manuals, supervisory review procedures, and training curricula. For reasons discussed in greater detail below, the Service will not provide this information and guidance in regulatory form; the Department declines to make an exception to standing policies for the management of the criminal justice system in the Executive Branch. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The suggestions made by these comments are appropriately directed to the functions of training and management, not administrative rulemaking. The Service and the Department agree with many of these suggestions, and, as noted below, have either incorporated them into existing training and management guidelines or are in the process of doing so. A section-by-section discussion of these comments follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Section 287.1(g)_Training <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The commenters criticized &sect;287.1(g) for not providing sufficient detail regarding the substance of the training that must be completed by Service officers prior to assuming the new enforcement authority provided by section 503 of IMMACT. The commenters noted that neither the course subjects, length, nor materials are specified, and stated that the regulations should at the very least indicate how the curriculum of existing Service training programs will be amended. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The commenters also alleged that ``nothing new'' is added by these regulations because all Service officers have already completed one course of basic immigration law training. The commenters suggested that the regulations should require that Service officers attend additional training before assuming additional enforcement authority. Finally, the commenters suggested that the regulations should require periodic attendance by Service officers at national or local training events devoted to new legal standards, case decisions, and Service interpretations of the law. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response, the Service notes that these commenters appear to have assumed that Service officers who have previously completed a course of basic immigration law enforcement training will not be required to undergo additional training before being authorized to undertake the enhanced enforcement authority prescribed in section 503. However, &sect;287.5(c)(4)(iii) of the proposed rule specifically stated that no immigration officer could assume enhanced arrest authority until the Director of Training had certified that the immigration officer had completed a training course encompassing such arrests and the standards for enforcement activities specified in &sect;287.8 of the regulations. Virtually all affected officers will receive additional training during the planned one-year interval between the publication in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  of this final rule and its effective date. This training is currently being developed in conjunction with other components of the Department to ensure that the training is consistent with existing training on the execution of law enforcement authorities and the investigative and prosecutorial policies of the Department. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Service agrees that existing training courses in basic law enforcement should be amended to include the training required by section 503; these curricula are in the process of being revised. Furthermore, the Service agrees that officers should receive training throughout their careers regarding new statutes, legal precedent, and policies for enforcement. Service guidelines and training programs will be continually updated to meet these needs. Precisely because judicial precedent and the Department's investigative and prosecutorial policies are constantly evolving, the Department concludes that it is not appropriate to further specify in regulations the curricula or frequency of training programs. Moreover, daily supervision to ensure compliance with legal standards enunciated by Congress and the courts is generally more effective and efficient than developing detailed statements in the form of regulations that cannot provide guidance in all situations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Man suspended as too fat to fit A 22-STONE Liverpudlian fitter has been suspended from his job for being obese. The fitter, employed by NEI Clark Chapman in the Liverpool docks, has been sent home on full pay and told he can resume work when he loses two stone. The company believes the fitter is a potential danger to himself and to others because he has to climb cranes and work in an area with moving machinery. The fitter, in his early 30s, was originally suspended after he tried to sue the company for negligence after a fall which injured his back. The company claimed the fall was due to his weight. Mr Dave Gough, an official of the AEEU engineering and electrical union who represented the skilled fitter, said the company had subsequently treated the man well and had even paid for him to go on a weight-watchers course. But he added: 'I am worried about setting precedents and about who should decide when someone is too fat. After all, if it was just a question of being overweight then three-quarters of British industry, and almost all the managers, would qualify for dismissal.' Mr Gough said stories had circulated in the company about the large number of Mars bars the fitter would eat during the breaks. 'I told him that if he was responsible for his own size he probably deserved the sack, but if it was a question of some sort of metabolic illness then he deserved the full support of the union.' The company said yesterday the fitter was now officially on sick leave rather than suspended. Mr Gough said he did not know how much progress he was making in losing weight. Cases of being sacked for being too fat are not unknown. Last year Mr Gary Cannon, a sewer worker, was sacked because he was too fat to fit through a manhole.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, May 13 (AFP) -- A UN military observer  killed at the edge of the Sarajevo exclusion zone was a  Malaysian, UN forces spokesman Eric Chaperon said Friday [13  May], adding that the shell which hit his vehicle was "not an  accident." Another UN observer injured in the same incident  Thursday was an Egyptian but his life was not in danger, Major  Chaperon said. He identified the dead observer as Major Ariffin  Zakaria. He said his body was to be flown to Kuala Lumpur  Friday and a brief military ceremony would be held in his honor  at Sarajevo airport. He said the Egyptian was Lieutenant  Colonel Mohamed Kamal El Din, who suffered shrapnel wounds to  his legs and was evacuated by helicopter to a Canadian medical  unit in Visoko, northwest of Sarajevo.    The UN military spokesman said a single shell was fired on  their vehicle after it got stuck in mud at Cermenica, 15  kilometers (eight miles) northeast of Visoko. "It is not an  accident of firing," he stressed. But he refused to say whether  the shell had been fired by Bosnian Serb forces who have a  position only a kilometer (less than a mile) from where the  observers' truck got bogged down.    The two UN soldiers had called for assistance.    The spokesman said a Bosnian Army soldier was also wounded  when he and a colleague on board a tractor came under fire as  they were trying to tow away the UN vehicle. He said the  Bosnian soldier had been hit in the back, but was out of danger.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Geneva, 7 Jun (TANJUG) -- Srpska republic president  Radovan Karadzic says that there is a possibility of a document  marking the end of the war being signed this afternoon in  Geneva's Palais des Nations. Following his talks with Yasushi  Akashi, UN special envoy for the former Yugoslavia, Karadzic  said at a news conference: "We have conducted difficult but  constructive talks. Our suggestion about a general 12-month  cease-fire was not accepted."    Momcilo Krajisnik, president of the Srpska republic  assembly,  said to a TANJUG correspondent:    "We expect that a document will be signed on an  all-encompassing four-month cease-fire, but we still have to  wait for the Muslim side's reply. Yasushi Akashi is expected to  meet the Muslim delegation this afternoon. Afterwards, a  plenary session may take place and, eventually, documents may be  signed. Everything is still uncertain, though."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brno, April 8 (CTK) -- In terms of the gross  domestic product and industrial production, the Czech Republic  has overcome "the biggest decline and we can basically speak of  potential prospects of economic growth," Czech Minister of  Industry and Trade Vladimir Dlouhy said today.    Taking part in a discussion meeting with university students  in Brno, he said "the decline of GDP was 14.2 percent in 1991,  7.1 percent in 1992 and 0.3 percent last year, while this year  we expect growth of around 2 percent."    Dlouhy said that "we can expect inflation to be under 10  percent" this year. He stressed that the Czech Republic in this  point differed from other post-Communist economies, including  Slovakia, Poland and Hungary.    Dlouhy also said that European Community countries had 20  percent share in the Czech Republic's exports at the end of the  1980s, while last year the figure was 55 percent and this year  it may reach 60 percent.    He attributed the figures to the fact that a number of  companies had managed to find new markets and at the same time  penetrate "hard world markets, when the soft, socialist ones,  simply disappeared."</p>

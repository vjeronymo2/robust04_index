			<p><P> August 18, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNITED STATES INVOLVEMENT IN MIDEAST  </P> <P> In all the heated rhetoric over the newest Middle East crisis, three major  realities have been overlooked:  </P> <P> 1. Had Israel not taken out the Iraqi capability to develop nuclear missiles  some years go, the forces in Saudi Arabia might well be confronted with those  missiles as well as chemical weapons.  </P> <P> 2. Never, in all its confrontations with the numerically superior Arab forces,  did Israel ever ask for the deployment of even one single American GI.  </P> <P> 3. Yasser Arafat, in his support of Saddam Hussein, has revealed once and for  all what he truly stands for: support of a despot who would murder men, women  and children with gas and sacrifice untold thousands of his citizens.  </P> <P> Indeed, there are actions for which Israel might be criticized, but the above  realities should not be ignored.  </P> <P> JOSEPH J. HONICK  </P> <P> Encino  </P></p>

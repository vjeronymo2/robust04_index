			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jason Moskovitz from Brussels on </F> the NATO summit, including recorded comments by Canadian Prime  Minister Jean Chretien and Canadian Foreign Minister Andre  Ouellet]    [Text] The NATO summit in Brussels has ended with a stern  warning to Bosnian Serbs. NATO is considering air strikes  unless Serb forces stop blocking United Nations peacekeeping  operations. NATO is asking the United Nations to draw up  contingency plans for this purpose. The warning in the summit's  final communique comes after the Allies resolved differences  among themselves.    Canada had said the threat might put the lives of its  peacekeepers in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica at risk.  Jason Moskovitz reports from Brussels.    [Moskovitz] In less than 24 hours the Canadian position on  air strikes has shifted significantly. Andre Ouellet, the  foreign minister, was unequivocal yesterday against. He said  air strikes could endanger the lives of Canadian peacekeepers.    [Ouellet] [recording begins mid-sentence] ....believe that  our soldiers that are there could be in serious danger if there  is bombing. In fact it could kill soldiers.    [Moskovitz] Today Prime Minister Jean Chretien says the  Serbs  must let Canadian soldiers be replaced in Srebrenica or face  possible air strikes.    [Chretien] They cannot move. It so happens at this moment  that the Canadians cannot be replaced in Srebrenica by the Dutch  soldiers, and we are telling them that the time has come to  allow their replacement.    [Moskovitz] Should there be air strikes, the prime minister  was asked what measures would be taken to protect Canadian  soldiers.    [Chretien] If my grandmother had wheels, she would have been  a bus, as Mr. Trudeau used to say. So I, you know, if, I am  telling you madame [addressing news conference] clearly that the  condition for air strikes does not exist today [sentence as  heard]. They might exist eventually, but they do not exist  today.    [Moskovitz] Canadian officials appeared caught off guard  with  the tough language of the final communique. In regard to the  Canadian position, yesterday was yesterday, today is today.</p>

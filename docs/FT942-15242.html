			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / EU patches up bananas dispute The European Union yesterday papered over an internal row about banana imports, which had threatened to overshadow the signing of the Uruguay Round trade accord and could have jeopardised a parallel international agreement to liberalise public procurement. The dispute was sparked by Germany's concern that by signing the Uruguay Round, it could prejudice the outcome of a court case it has brought which challenges the EU's new banana import regime. France had said that unless Bonn withdrew the case, Paris would hold up EU approval of an agreement in the Gatt to open to international competition public contracts worth more than Dollars 300bn a year. The conflict was defused when the 12 agreed to a Commission statement recognising Germany's right to pursue its legal case but prohibiting it from linking bananas to approval of the Uruguay Round. France said it was satisfied but German officials said they would continue their fight for the right to import more Latin American 'dollar' bananas.</p>

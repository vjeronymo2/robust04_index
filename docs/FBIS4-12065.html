			<p>BFN     [Text] At the last minute today, Oman canceled the Israeli  Foreign Ministry delegation's arrival. The high-level  delegation was slated to arrive in Oman tonight in order to  prepare for the participation of an Israeli delegation headed by  Deputy Foreign Minister Beilin in a new round of multilateral  peace talks. Our political correspondent Gadi Sukenik has  learned that at this stage, the preparatory visit has been  delayed by one week. It was also hinted that the Israeli media  will not be permitted to attend the talks themselves --  scheduled to be held several days later -- as previously planned.</p>

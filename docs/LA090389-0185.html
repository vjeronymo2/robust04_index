			<p><P> September 3, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> JOB CENTER A YEAR LATER;  </P> <P> COSTA MESA PLAN TO GET DAYWORKERS OFF STREET LAUDED, ASSAILED  </P> <P> Each morning around sunrise, Jose Cordoba, a silver-haired gardener from the  Mexican state of Michoacan, joins about 50 Latino men to wait for day labor  jobs at the Costa Mesa Job Center.  </P> <P> "Before I started coming here, I waited for work on the street and made only  about $30 for 12 hours," said Cordoba, who now lives in Costa Mesa. "Here, if  they offer less than $5 per hour, I won't take it and neither will anybody  else, so they have to pay more."  </P> <P> Cordoba is one of several hundred Orange County Latino residents who have taken  advantage of Costa Mesa's 11-month-old job center, said to be the nation's only  municipally sponsored hiring hall. Each day, about 50 men show their Social  Security cards and drivers' licenses -- proof of their legal status in this  country -- to center staff members. Then they wait for construction foremen,  gardeners and others to drive by in search of workers.  </P> <P> A half-dozen Southland communities are considering following Costa Mesa's lead,  and the center has drawn widespread attention. Backers claim that it has  improved dayworkers' wages and eased the burden for employers who face fines if  they hire undocumented workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Opposition Claims  </P> <P> But a growing chorus of critics is charging that the center is a tool to  isolate undocumented workers who seek jobs from street corners and eventually  drive them out of the city. By requiring people at the center to show proof of  their legal status, they argue, the city is violating the civil rights of the  workers.  </P> <P> Though the job center at 1697 Placentia Ave. has marginally improved working  conditions for legal workers, they say, it has worsened conditions for  undocumented workers and for those who have applied for citizenship by  excluding them from seeking work there.  </P> <P> Job centers for day labor in California go back to the turn of the century.  Longshoremen sponsored the first hiring halls in the state around 1900, and  other unions followed suit. Public sponsorship of job centers began in San  Francisco and Los Angeles around 1913 when the areas suffered a  mini-depression.  </P> <P> "Cities have generally opened these kinds of centers in times of depression,"  said James Gregory, professor of labor history at UC Berkeley. "Most of the  work has been taken over by states and the federal government, but cities come  back to it when there is a high unemployment rate."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Employers' Reluctance  </P> <P> In Orange County, though, where the official unemployment rate has settled in  the full-employment 3% range in recent years, the Costa Mesa day-labor center  satisfies a different need. Crowds of Latinos stand each morning on street  corners in Costa Mesa and across the Southland looking for work. They are  generally non-English speakers who say they cannot find full-time work, either  because they do not speak English or because employers will not hire Latinos.  </P> <P> "I've left applications at eight landscaping companies in the area since I got  permission to work in May," Jose Cordoba said. "One of the companies even  looked at my identification card and said, 'No that's not legal,' even though  it was given to me by the government."  </P> <P> Since passage of the Immigration and Reform Act of 1986, employers have been  required to check documents of all employees to ensure that they are permitted  to work. In Orange County, 184,000 people have been granted amnesty since the  act was passed. But an estimated 150,000 undocumented workers remain, and many  of them regularly seek work as day laborers, according to a study published by  the Orange County Commission on Human Rights.  </P> <P> Many employers, fearing INS penalties for hiring illegal workers, have been  discouraged from using any Latinos.  </P> <P> "In Orange County, there's discrimination because employers are afraid all  Latinos are illegal, and I think it has increased since they passed (the  immigration reform act)," said Leo Chavez, a UC Irvine professor of  anthropology who specializes in immigration. "Ever since (the immigration  reform act) was passed, people won't hire Latinos like they used to."  </P> <P> In Costa Mesa, officials considered the issue for at least a year before  opening the center. Mexican and Central American refugees, both legal and  illegal, had long crowded Lions Park and several other areas around the city  each morning, causing neighbors to complain.  </P> <P> "We just thought it was unacceptable to have a hundred people in a city park  walking up and down the sidewalks, littering and waiting for work," said Costa  Mesa Mayor Peter F. Buffa. "We really only had one concern when we set up the  center -- to find work for legal workers." So Costa Mesa approved a plan last  fall to spend $3,000 to $4,000 a month to rent and staff a rehabilitated gas  station where workers could wait in comfort and out of the way. Buffa said it  was decided to allow only documented workers to use the center because the city  is prohibited by federal law from spending public funds on undocumented  workers.  </P> <P> "Our idea was to tell people to go to the job center if they had documents . .  . and if they didn't have them, to apply for amnesty," Buffa said.  </P> <P> The city hired three bilingual aides to coordinate English-speaking employers  and Spanish-speaking workers, and soon local people donated furniture and food  as well.  </P> <P> Though only a few people showed up the first day, by the end of the job  center's first month, 879 people had been through the doors and more than 300  jobs had been delivered.  </P> <P> A few problems were encountered, though.  </P> <P> "At first, we handed out jobs on a first-come, first-served basis," said Costa  Mesa intergovernmental relations officer Cheryl Friedling, who helped set up  the center. "Because they were so eager to work, they came earlier and earlier,  sometimes with sleeping bags so they could be first in line, and we decided  that was inhumane."  </P> <P> Job center managers started drawing lots for the first job when the center  opened at 6 a.m., and user numbers grew steadily. During the facility's first  six months, the number of day laborers who signed up each day grew from about  25 to as many as 85 in March. Consistently, for the first few months, 40% of  those who arrived found work. Dozens of workers continued to stand on the  streets near the center, but their numbers dwindled as the facility was  increasingly successful.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Construction Employers  </P> <P> About 25 employers, mostly construction companies, also started coming to the  center each day to pick workers for a day or two of manual labor.  </P> <P> "These people (at the center) are great for demolition and concrete work," said  Jerry Perez, a residential remodeler, as he hired two workers at the center on  a recent morning. "I pick them up here, take care of them, buy them lunch, and  then bring them back in the afternoon."  </P> <P> Perez said he starts off workers from the center at $6 per hour. Like most  other center users, Perez said one of the major reasons he uses the center is  because its three clerks have been trained by the INS to check working papers.  Others agree.  </P> <P> "We used to have to pick up workers at the doughnut shop or the park like  everyone else," said John Bennett, co-owner of Evans Plumbing Inc., a small  Costa Mesa firm that now hires two or three workers every couple of weeks.  "They've already shown somebody their green card and that takes responsibility  off our back."  </P> <P> Workers are nearly as satisfied with the center as employers, but many say the  amount of work available through the center is declining. And although work is  sporadic, most say overall that they are better off than before the center was  opened.  </P> <P> The city offers no formal wage control to workers, but a center employee  occasionally asks if any of the workers have had problems collecting their  wages. If problems crop up, Costa Mesa Police Officer Dennis Jefcoat, who last  spring received an award from the Orange County Human Relations Commission for  his work with Latin laborers, is called.  </P> <P> Jefcoat points out that the only problems of non-payment of wages or labor  theft reported recently in Costa Mesa have come from the group of mostly  undocumented workers who still gather each morning at Lions Park, not from  those who frequent the job center.  </P> <P> "The people at the center are being treated better, and those in (Lions Park)  are getting the message that Costa Mesa isn't a good place to find work,"  Jefcoat said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Critics' Lone Complaint  </P> <P> Even critics of the job center, which include the American Civil Liberties  Union and Catholic and Latino groups, laud its efforts to help the newly  legalized and non-English-speaking population. They complain only that  undocumented workers are denied entry and that the city is trying to drive out  workers in other parts of the city. Checking documents is the responsibility of  federal rather than city government, they contend.  </P> <P> "Costa Mesa has chosen to discriminate and is denying people the right to  work," said Father Jaime Soto, vicar for the Hispanic Community of Orange  County. "If the city is going to address the problem of day laborers, they  should make a center open to all workers."  </P> <P> Along with Latino groups, the ACLU recently threatened the city with a lawsuit,  citing both a city ordinance denying funds to groups that serve undocumented  workers and the practice of denying those workers entrance to the center.  </P> <P> "A hiring hall has to be open to all residents, not just documented workers,"  said Rebecca Jurado, an ACLU attorney. "When a local body takes it upon itself  to check documents before they give somebody a job, they're being overbroad and  unconstitutional."  </P> <P> Recently, use of the center has declined. In July, the total who arrived each  morning dropped to its lowest point since January and the percentage of workers  hired fell to only 34%, the worst rate since the center opened.  </P> <P> Competition from illegal aliens standing on the street has increased and many  gardeners are heading there, say workers at the center. That could mean that  center users will eventually return to the streets.  </P> <P> "At the center, it's better than in a factory, but we only work about two days  a week," said Juan Ruiz, 35, who came to this country three years ago from  Mexico. "I'm not really thinking about going back to the park to look for work,  but there is a chance that I might have to eventually."  </P> <P> But authorities on the subject contend that the center will continue to draw  workers and employers, if for no other reason than the convenience.  </P> <P> "Employers won't leave Costa Mesa to find workers, and as long as there's a  center some will come there," UCI's Chavez said. "It's an implicit part of  their agreement that workers come to where the employers are . . . and that  probably will never change."  </P></p>

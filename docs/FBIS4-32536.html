			<p>BFN     [Text] At about 0500 this morning, a Serbian Army convoy  made up of 28 tanks and seven transportation trucks, as well as  other military equipment, moved from Prishtina in the direction  of Podujeve on the Miloshev-Leban road. A characteristic of the  Serb Army movements this time is that many Serb flags were seen  placed above the tanks.    It is worthy of mention that in this region today, there  were  frequent flights by Serbian aircraft, and many military vehicles  were observed on the streets of Prishtina, reports the Kosova  Information Center.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria May 2 SAPA -- Two South African Police  [SAP] generals named in the Goldstone Report on "third force"  activities would return to work soon, SAP commissioner Gen Johan  van der Merwe said on Monday [2 May]. He said in a statement he  had ordered Generals Basie Smit and Johan le Roux back to work  on Monday, saying no grounds existed for them to stay away.    The two generals and a third, Krappies Engelbrecht, were  implicated in a report by Mr Justice Richrd Goldstone on March  18. The report said there was prima facie evidence of the  generals' involvement in third force activities and gun running.    They were suspended by President F W de Klerk pending an  investigation into the allegations.    Gen van der Merwe said he had made his decision after  consultations with Transvaal Attorney General Jan d'Oliveira. "I  am convinced the evidence which Dr d'Oliveira has in his  possession at this stage is not of such a nature that the two  generals should be withdrawn from service as a result thereof.    "Even though the generals voluntarily withdrew from service  the investigation could still continue for several months and  due to a lack of grounds for such withdrawal it can no longer be  permitted," Gen van der Merwe said.</p>

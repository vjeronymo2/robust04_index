			<p><P> January 26, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> GIVE DOGS THEIR OWN PARK, WOO URGES  </P> <P> Los Angeles' only official dog park, Laurel Canyon Park, has become so popular  that a city councilman Wednesday proposed fencing most of it off so dogs could  run free there all day, not just during selected hours.  </P> <P> "The sheer volume of people taking advantage of the ability to run their dogs  free during the specified hours has severely taxed the limited parking  resources at and around Laurel Canyon Park," Councilman Mike Woo said in his  motion to the council.  </P> <P> "There also have been repeated instances of people not respecting the time  limitations, often due to the number of dog owners present during the limited  hours."  </P> <P> The City Council in April decided to allow dogs to run free at the park from  dawn to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to dusk. At other times, only leashed dogs are  permitted in the park.  </P> <P> The council's decision had capped a long and often nasty dispute between dog  owners who let their animals run loose and other park users who complained that  animals were taking over the place.  </P> <P> On a sunny day, as many as 100 dogs can be found in the small park off  Mulholland Drive at the crest of the Santa Monica Mountains. It is the children  who are confined -- in a small playground tucked in a corner.  </P> <P> Woo's proposal calls for a "permanent, fenced-off section of Laurel Canyon  Park, separate from picnic and other play areas, for exclusive use as an  off-leash dog run, to be available for use during all hours."  </P> <P> Diana Brueggemann, an aide to Woo, said the councilman proposes to fence off  the majority of the park, which has about four acres of flatland in addition to  surrounding hillsides. The exact dimensions, location and size of the  fenced-off area have not been worked out.  </P> <P> Parking and traffic congestion near the park is especially bad during winter  evenings when there is only about an hour of daylight after work for dog owners  to run their pets.  </P> <P> "This is a good compromise," she said.  </P> <P> The council sent Woo's proposal to its Parks Committee for a recommendation. It  is expected to be approved. The park is in Woo's district, and council members  customarily defer to a councilman on a matter in his district.  </P> <P> Jane Purse, a leader of a group of dog owners, said Woo's proposal is "probably  better than what we have at the moment, which is difficult to enforce."  </P> <P> Jerry Greenfield, president of Laurel Hills Homeowners Assn., said Woo's  proposal fails to address the problem: "You have 20 parking spots and hundreds  of people who want to use the park." A better solution, he said, is to allow  dogs to run free in other parks.  </P></p>

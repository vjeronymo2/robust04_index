			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Scroggs moves up in Fisons shuffle FISONS, the troubled UK pharmaceuticals group, yesterday reshuffled its board. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chairman of the group's scientific equipment division, has been appointed chief executive of the company and chairman of the pharmaceuticals division. The move fills the gap left by the resignation of Mr John Kerridge who retired as chief executive last year. The company said Mr Peter Fothergill, pharmaceuticals chairman, had also resigned. Fisons also announced that US Food and Drug Administration officials were due on April 20 to inspect its manufacturing facilities for Opticrom, its hay-fever treatment, which has been withdrawn in the US at the request of the FDA. It has not asked them to inspect the facilities for Imferon which has also been withdrawn. The company has said it might not relaunch the product. The announcement pleased analysts, although there was some disappointment they had not been able to find an external candidate from the pharmaceuticals industry. The stock closed up 8p at 334p. Mr Scroggs took over the scientific equipment division in 1981 when it had a turnover of Pounds 64m and profits of Pounds 2.8m. Last year the division made Pounds 68.4m on sales of Pounds 645m. More than 50 per cent of its sales are now in the US. Mr Scroggs said his appointment as chairman of the pharmaceutical division ended the deficiencies in communications that had existed between the pharmaceuticals management committee and the main board. The various divisions will no longer operate as independent fiefdoms. He said it was too early to give details of new strategic moves. However, Mr Patrick Egan, group chairman, said the company was not in negotiations with any other company with a view to merger, nor had it been, nor had it received any offers. He added he had no intention of selling the horticultural business. Mr Egan said the pharmaceuticals division would concentrate on products for respiratory and central nervous system ailments. He said the company had something of a fetish about not collaborating with other groups. It was now looking at co-development and co-marketing projects, particularly in the cardio-vascular field.

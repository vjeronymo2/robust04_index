			<p><P> August 29, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: $2,500 REWARD PLEDGED IN VANDALISM CASE  </P> <P> Simi Valley business leaders pledged a $2,500 reward Monday for information  about vandalism two weeks ago that left the home of a black family a shambles  and defaced by racial epithets.  </P> <P> Some of the money may also be used to help the family repair and refurbish  their home on Niles Street, according to spokesmen who said they represent 90%  of the city's business community.  </P> <P> "We mainly want to send a signal out that the community is behind this family,"  said Jack Parfitt, president of the Simi Valley Noontime Rotary Club.  </P> <P> "And that we want these sorts of acts to stop," said Burt von Bieberstein,  president of the Simi Valley Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> The residents -- Northridge Junior High School teacher Louis Boss, his wife,  Ontee, and their four children -- discovered the damage Aug. 14 when they  returned from an out-of-town trip. Every room was ransacked and littered with  piles of ruined belongings, while the word "skinheads" and racial epithets were  spray-painted on walls inside the house, police said.  </P> <P> Simi Valley Police Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller said the investigation had been  made a priority but that there were no suspects.  </P> <P> Simi Valley's three Rotary clubs each pledged $500, with at least $1,000 to be  used for a reward. The local Kiwanis Club, meanwhile, promised to match up to  $1,000 for a reward and also offered to pay the deductible on the family's  insurance policy.  </P> <P> The Jaycees offered their labor to repair the house.  </P></p>

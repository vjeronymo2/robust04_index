			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sun Tanzhen (1327 3389 6966) of the Research </F> Institute for Rural Development of the Academy of Social  Sciences: "How Do China's Rural Finances March Toward Market  Economy"]    [Text] I    The structural changes and the high-speed development of  China's rural economy during the 1980s have created a huge  market of demand and a large activity space for the development  of rural banking industry. China will soon enter the GATT, and  our banking industry will soon encounter tremendous outside  pressure. As far as the opening up modern rural financial  undertakings is concerned, this all means challenges as well as  rare opportunities:    1. According to figures revealed by the State Statistics  Bureau, the per capita saving of a peasant household was only  7.05 yuan in 1978, a mere 5 percent of the per capita net income  in that year. As of 1991, the per-capita saving of a peasant  household had reached 271.91 yuan, accounting for 38 percent of  the per capita net income in that year. If we take savings as a  kind of financial asset, we can clearly see the upward trend of  the percentage of a peasant's financial asset to the net income  in each year. The growth of the peasants' financial asset shows  that peasants are able to save more after their income  increases. This is also a requirement for the development of  modern banking industry in the countryside. In conducting an  aggregate economic analysis, Western macro-economists often  state that "savings are equivalent to investments." However,  savings need an effective media to become investments. That  media is the financial system composed of modern financial  organizations and the money market. Nevertheless, the functions  of the existing financial organizations in China are not so  perfect. It is difficult for these organizations to play their  role well in doing financing. When we carried out investigations  in the rural areas during the past few years, we often found  that some peasant families often keep tremendous amounts of cash  locked in boxes at home. This situation is closely related to  the slow development of the rural banking industry in China.    2) The rapid development of various rural industries and the  vigorous rural economic activities to become market-oriented  have greatly increased economic contacts and rapidly expanded  the business of settling accounts in the same and in different  areas. Right now the existing financial institutions are weak in  settling accounts, the account-settling procedure is  complicated, and there is endless carping and countless taboos  in this connection. Methods used to settle accounts are also  backward. On top of all this, the range of services provided by  the financial institutions remains narrow. Their efficiency is  quite low, and services are poor. As a result, many rural  economic entities often use cash in business transactions, thus  aggravating the situation wherein money is being circulated  outside the bank. This kind of situation has not only increased  the risk of the financial institutions in money circulation and  their cost in settling accounts, but also made them lack of  short-term loans. From the macro-economic point of view, it is a  tremendous financial loss.    3) The contradiction between supply and demand of long-term  capital in rural areas is becoming sharper and sharper in each  passing day. The rural long-term capital includes social capital  (roads, water supply and drainage channels, electric power and  other infrastructural facilities) and industrial capital. The  experiences at home and abroad show that it usually takes more  than 10 years to accumulate long-term funds in support of social  capital and that it also takes more than one year to accumulate  medium and long-term funds in support of industrial capital.  With the further development of the rural economy, the demand  for long-term capital is becoming greater and greater. Due to  the fact that China's market for long-term capital is nearly a  blank, right now we can only fill this gap by relying on the  various irregular flexible measures adopted in various  localities for the supply of long-term capital such as raising  social funds and soliciting public assistance and donations. The  supply of such funds is unstable. In addition, the cost in  raising funds in such way remains high. It is far insufficient  to satisfy the requirements in developing China's economy. As a  result, the contradiction between the supply and demand of the  long-term capital is becoming sharper and sharper.    4) Impact from China's re-entry into GATT and opportunities  to become export-oriented. If negotiations are carried out  normally, China is expected to return to GATT (hereinafter  referred to as "China's re-entry to GATT"). The "Uruguay Round"  of talks -- the eighth round of multilateral GATT trade talks --  had entered the final stage since its inception in September  1986. The service trade agreement of the Uruguay Round (draft of  the final agreement) had stipulated the detail provisions on the  five aspects of market access, national treatment, market  transparency, most-favored nation status and the special  treatments to developing countries. In order to develop China's  banking industry, we must earnestly deal with the following  issues:    A) Exclusion clause for suppliers of financial services.  Those financial institutions owned or controlled by the  government which mainly execute government functions or carry  out activities for the government should not provide financial  services. Therefore, China's current system of financial  institutions with state-run banks, insurance companies and  securities companies as its main entities will encounter serious  institutional obstacles when it faces competitions from the  international banking industry after China's re-entry into GATT.    B) The right to go into business (business involvement).  Each participating nation should give providers of financial  services of other participating nations the right to set up  offices in its own country to offer the same type of financial  services.    C) New financial service. It is the type of financial  service that none of the financial service providers is offering  in a specific participating nation except it is being offered in  one participating nation. The latter should permit the financial  service providers of other participating nations to offer new  financial services in any form within its boundaries. In view of  the tremendous differences in the form of shipment and delivery  used by China's existing financial institutions in providing  financial services, the provision on a participating nation's  obligation to provide new financial services will create a  strong shock wave on China's banking industry.    D) National treatment. Each participating nation should  permit other participating nations' financial service providers  which have already set up offices in its boundaries to contact  the disbursement and account-settling departments of this  participating nation for access to the supply of government  funds by refinancing through the regular commercial channel.  Foreign financial service providers should be given equal  treatments as their domestic counterparts in seeking membership  of financial organizations and participating in any institution  which has the rights to formulate its own rules and regulations,  in securities or futures exchanges, and in account-settling  organs or other organizations or associations. Moreover, when a  nation gives direct or indirect special privileges or treatments  to its own financial institutions in rendering financial  services, the foreign financial institutions in the country  should also enjoy the same privileges and treatments. With  regard to the aforementioned mandatory clause, we naturally may  gradually reduce the various restrictions which conflict with  GATT rules in accordance with the special GATT preferential  treatments to developing nations, while protecting our own  financial institutions to a certain extent and within a limited  period of time. However, China's re-entry into GATT will  undoubtedly have a great impact on China's banking industry. It  will put pressure on us, while providing us with a motivational  force. Whether or not we can seize the opportunities, meet the  challenges, turn the pressure into a motive force, the key lies  in our efforts to deepen our financial reform, open our banking  industry wider to the outside world and increase our  competitiveness in the world market.  <H8>  II </H8>   While we are faced with the aforementioned market changes in  rural economy and the tremendous challenges and opportunities  given us by China's chance to re-enter GATT, our rural banking  industry deplorably fails to keep pace with this situation.  Signs are manifested as follows:    1) Monopolistic short-term money market and backward methods  for financing. As far as the whole country is concerned, the  Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank  of China and the rural credit cooperatives under its  administration, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank of  China and the Bank of Communications are the only national banks  in China that have branches all over the country; and can accept  deposits directly from the residents, serve various economic  entities in settling accounts and extend loans to financial  institutions which need money. Only they can handle "real  banking businesses." Although the functions of the  aforementioned five banks somewhat overlap each other since the  development of the reform program, their monopoly in the realm  of production is still not broken down. The 180,000 odd  financial institutions which emerged in the 1980's had  preliminarily shattered the monopoly of a single bank in the use  of funds, but they have not become effective competitors of the  specialized banks in China's banking industry, since they only  have a few branches and they are short of capital. They cannot  accept deposits. Nor can they settle accounts or build vaults.  In the rural areas, the Agricultural Bank of China and the rural  credit cooperatives under its administration have still  monopolized the rural banking industry. As a result, the methods  for financing in the rural district is still far behind the  world advanced level. If we view China's entire banking  industry, its standard is equivalent to that of the developed  nations in the 1950's. If it is said that there is a gap between  China's industry and that of the developed nations, then there  is even wider gap between China's banking industry and that of  the developed nations. Other direct consequences of the monopoly  of the banking industry are less service items and poor service  quality.    2) The long-term money market is nearly a blank. It badly  needs development. According to our survey, long-term financing  activities in China's rural areas are limited to loans between  close relatives and good friends for the building of rural  residential houses. Here, there are no modern financial  institutions. Factors of the money market such as the interest  rate, mortgage, equity and credit period are non-existent. This  situation is no doubt a considerable obstacle to the  accumulation of long-term capital needed to further develop the  rural economy.    3) Weak, ineffective and insufficient number of  nongovernmental financial institutions. In China's rural area, a  group of nongovernmental market-oriented financial institutions  have emerged in the course of developing the market economy  during the past 13 years. These financial institutions have  satisfied, to a certain extent, the needs of the rural money  market at various levels and counteracted the weaknesses of the  aforementioned monopolistic financial institutions in the supply  of funds for the development of market economy in rural  districts. Nevertheless, these nongovernmental financial  institutions share common weaknesses of relatively incompetent  personnel, insufficient of capital and backward methods for  financing. The current state of affairs shows that it will be  difficult to rely on the existing nongovernmental financial  institutions to meet the challenges and competitions from the  world banking industry after China's re-entry into GATT.  Specifically speaking, China's major nongovernmental rural  financial institution -- the Rural Cooperative Foundation --has  made remarkable progress. However, its capital was only 10  billion yuan by the end of 1991, a fraction of the 300 billion  yuan deposits in the Agricultural Bank of China. Moreover, it  receives serious internal administrative inferences. Its rules  and regulations are far from being perfect, and its management  needs improvement. Meanwhile, private money houses, credit  unions and other nongovernmental financial organizations are  still sporadic, and they score little progress because of their  traditional practices.  <H8>  III </H8>   In order to bring about changes to turn China's rural  economy into a modern market economy and increase China's  competitiveness in the world market, we should reform the rural  banking industry as follows:    1. We must resolutely break down the monopoly in China's  banking industry, encourage competitions in the financial sector  and vigorously develop modern nongovernment financial  institutions. Under the macroeconomic guidance of the state  financial policy, we must cultivate multi-level financial  organizations in various economic sectors, draw on the advanced  experience of foreign countries, adopt a series of feasible  measures against financial monopoly in the banking industry, and  encourage and safeguard competitions among various types of  financial institutions. The major task of the governments at the  central and provincial levels is to develop a group of modern  financial institutions that may compete in the international  market. Due to the requirement for high technology and  professionally trained personnel in the development of a modern  banking industry, one of the realistic measures is to encourage  those staff members who had left the existing state-run  financial institutions or those who returned from their studies  abroad to set up or lead new financial institutions. The related  departments and governments at all levels must work hard to  create a good external environment for this type of new  financial institution. The state financial administrative  departments may also set different standards for modern  financial organizations and encourage them to further improve  themselves through competition. Meanwhile it is necessary to  clearly define the government's function in working out  financial policies and its function in the control of financial  institutions; and adequately separate these two functions. The  former is mainly aimed at harmonizing the relation between  economic development and the money supply, stabilizing the value  of money and controlling where to put the money is use. The  latter is mainly aimed at guiding the financial institutions,  developing modern financial organizations, helping them become  more competitive and promoting and safeguarding fair  competitions in the banking industry.    2. We must vigorously form and develop the long-term money  market. Since the beginning of the 1990's, China had made  preliminary breakthroughs in doing direct financing. The  securities market had gradually grown out of nothing and opened  up a new path for raising long-term capital. From now on, we  must study and find new ways on how to channel the money in the  securities market to rural areas.    In the course of developing the long-term money market, we  must pay particular attention to the role of the insurance  industry. Generally speaking, the insurance companies sign  insurance contracts with their clients who wish to guard against  any contingency. They collect a fixed amount of insurance  premiums from their clients, and pay indemnities according to  the contract when the specified accident occurs. The insurance  companies use this method to provide their clients with  financial assets. At the same time, they keep the premiums they  receive as reserve funds to pay indemnities in case something  happens. In general, they have a considerable amount of money on  hand. As a result, the insurance companies which are the main  suppliers of industrial funds often play an important role on  the securities market. This is particularly true in the realm of  life insurance. The insurance companies are able to use modern  technology to accurately predict the rate of mortality. Also,  the insurance contracts they sign with their clients are usually  extra long-term ones. Therefore, their capital is relatively  long-term and stable. Life insurance, as the main body in the  supply of long-term funds, plays a significant role in the  long-term money market. The figures provided by the State  Statistics Bureau indicate that insurance premiums in China grew  from 2.57 billion yuan in 1985 to 20.97 billion yuan in 1991,  with an average annual growth rate of 41.9 percent. Its old-age  pension insurance premiums grew from 180 million yuan in 1987 to  3.31 billion yuan in 1991 with an average annual growth rate of  62.5 percent. The percentage of the old-age pension insurance  premiums in the entire amount of premiums collected also rose  from 6.9 percent in 1985 to 15.8 percent in 1991. The  departments of civil affairs in various localities have also  enthusiastically encouraged people to buy rural social old-age  pension insurance. Right now, more than 800 counties (cities and  districts) in China have carried out experiments in selling  rural social old-age pension insurance policies. More than seven  million peasants have underwritten the old-age pension  insurance. This situation indicates that the insurance industry,  particularly the old-age pension insurance which is the main  long-term money supply already has a good start in China. It is  expected to grow rapidly. The next step is how to tackle the  issue of guarding against monopoly and safeguard competition and  how to turn the insurance funds into long-term capital.    3. We must promote the modernization of the banking industry  and further improve technologies in this connection. We should  draw on the advanced experience of the banking industry abroad.  To speed up the process of making full use of the foreign  advanced banking technologies, we urgently need to carry out the  following tasks:    A) We must establish a modernized system for settling  accounts.    B) We must set up a modernized mortgage system and improve  the relevant organizations.    C) We must reform the system of loan administration, and  use, wherever possible, the method of bill discount and that of  bill rediscount by the Central Bank for extending short-term  loans. Some of the major issues which have plagued China's  banking industry are the fact that it is difficult to control  where to actually use the credit funds and the misappropriation  of funds. If we extend short-term loans by mainly relying on the  method of bill discount, we would be able to solve, to a great  extent, the headache in our banking industry.    D) We must accelerate the process of computerizing the  banking industry.    In short, China is a developing nation with a shortage of  capital. To maintain sustained and steady economic growth, we  will have to rely, to a great extent and for a long time to  come, on our family savings. How to effectively and smoothly  turn family savings into social and industrial capital. Making  the best use of our rare sources of capital (in different  regions, different industries and different enterprises) is the  unshirkable historic responsibility of China's banking industry  for rejuvenating our nation.</p>

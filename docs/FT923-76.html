			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Observer: Fundamental George Soros, the Hungarian-American investment guru, has just hired another economist who knows Capitol Hill and the international economic policy-makers circuit as thoroughly as he understands Wall Street. Robert Johnson, a foreign exchange specialist from Bankers Trust in New York, is also a former chief economist of the Senate Banking Committee and is the sort of forex expert to make chartists nervous. In the recent Euro-turmoil, it is those plugged into the policy-making scene who have been able to make the most of the central banks' discomfiture - and hedge funds, such as those in the Soros stable, have increasingly been on the look-out for economists who can span both worlds. It is also the hedge funds in particular that are understood to have had a field day in the past few weeks - though Johnson is of course not prepared to give anything away on that score.</p>

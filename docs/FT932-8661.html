			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Letter: ERM totally discredited Sir, Following further devaluations of the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo the exchange rate mechanism has been totally discredited as an instrument of policy. It should now be clear that attempts to impose linked, or semi-fixed exchange rates on groups of currencies within a global market of floating exchange rates is a perilous interference with market forces. The exchange rate mechanism is unable to cope with differential economic growth rates among its monetary constituencies. European governments must now decide whether to adopt fixed or floating exchange rates. Governments may wish to adopt exchange rate target bands to finesse policy objectives but these must be confidential or the speculators will have their day.

			<p><P> April 23, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MIKE PENNER: DECENT DRAFT STILL A BIG DEAL TO THE RAMS  </P> <P> The Rams always traded better than they drafted, a double-edged sword that came  back to wound and then suture on Sunday, all within the span of a few hours.  </P> <P> For the first three rounds of the 1990 NFL draft, Coach John Robinson announced  his team's selections with all the enthusiasm of a man required to tell his  family he'd just been transferred to Yuma.  </P> <P> Robinson on No. 1 pick, Washington center Bern Brostek: "We chose him because  we felt like he was the best offensive lineman there."  </P> <P> Robinson on No. 2 pick, Notre Dame safety Pat Terrell: "We did not feel there  were any corners worthy to be picked there."  </P> <P> Robinson on No. 3 pick, Oregon running back Latin Berry: "We're going to use  him as a kick returner and a defensive corner. . . . We're taking a risk. We're  giving him a year to learn a new position. It could be a reach, but with that  kind of speed and that kind of person, it's worth the risk."  </P> <P> Robinson didn't size up the draft so much as sighs it up. He had reason to be  underwhelmed. Two out of three selections were gambles and the last time the  Rams rolled the dice without a safety net -- also known as Draft Choices for  Dickerson -- they came up snake eyes.  </P> <P> Mike Schad and Donald Evans.  </P> <P> Brostek flunked more than one pre-draft physical because of a congenital back  condition that left him with three defective disks at the base of the spine.  </P> <P> Berry, an undersized running back with great speed and no moves, is the kind of  project not often found in altitudes as high as the third round. In asking him  to convert to cornerback, the Rams are asking Berry to learn a position he has  never played.  </P> <P> Only Terrell could be termed an impact player. Of course, for most of Sunday,  his impact was the latest postponement of the Jerry Gray-to-free-safety move, a  grand plan that may never get off the ground.  </P> <P> "An hour ago, Jerry Gray was a safety-corner," Robinson said as he announced  the drafting of Terrell. "Now, he's back to corner-safety."  </P> <P> Robinson lamented his inability to draft or trade for a competent cornerback.  "Ongoing," is how he described the talent search. "I don't have much confidence  that it's going to happen on draft day. It might go into training camp."  </P> <P> Or at least into Sunday evening.  </P> <P> Two hours later, Robinson sauntered into the press room at Rams Park, beaming.  "We've just traded our fifth-rounder to the New York Jets for Bobby Humphery,"  he said.  </P> <P> Robinson grinned again.  </P> <P> "He's a left corner."  </P> <P> And a good one. Humphery, a six-year veteran, started every game for the Jets  the past two seasons. Ram defensive coordinator Fritz Shurmur said the coaching  staff reviewed film of 13 NFL cornerbacks -- affordable cornerbacks in the  mid-size price and talent range -- and claimed Humphery was the top of the  crop.  </P> <P> "This gives us the experience that we want," Robinson said. "He's the corner  that fits us. This is a great deal for us."  </P> <P> And for the cost of a fifth-round draft choice.  </P> <P> Robinson was asked if the price was right.  </P> <P> Robinson simply grinned that burglar's grin of his.  </P> <P> Enough said.  </P> <P> It was the trade that saved the day. With Humphery pairing with Darryl Henley  at cornerback, Gray can resume Operation Safety, returning to his natural  position, the position that made him All-American at the University of Texas.  At the same time, Terrell and Berry can learn their wares in reserve roles.  Berry, particularly, will need the time.  </P> <P> The trade also frees up Greg Bell, the two-time 1,000-yard rusher who had been  the team's primary trade enticement in the cornerback market. Now, Bell can be  used elsewhere, perhaps in exchange for a 1991 draft choice or packaged for  some pass-rush assistance, something the Rams ignored in Sunday's first three  rounds.  </P> <P> Most of all, though, the trade salvaged the draft. Before Humphery, the media  knives were poised to slice again.  </P> <P> On draft day, these guys love the long ball. Just close your eyes and air it  out. Maybe our side will catch it.  </P> <P> Supposedly, Pete Rose is the one with the gambling disorder. What, then, is the  word for the Rams' affliction? While the draft clock ticks away, you can't keep  the Rams away from the blackjack table -- and, worse yet, you can't keep them  from hitting 17.  </P> <P> The reason the Eric Dickerson trade was so great for the Rams was that it gave  them the wherewithal -- six extra choices -- to sate their whims and fancies.  Waste a No. 1 on Gaston Green? No problem. Just circle back a few slots later  and scoop up Aaron Cox.  </P> <P> But they squared their account with the Colts last year, meaning they would  have to enter this draft alone. No more insurance policy. No second chances  permitted.  </P> <P> So the Rams went about their business their traditional way, flailing away, and  still might live to tell about it.  </P> <P> In 1986, it was Houston and Jim Everett. In 1987, it was Indianapolis and the  draft-choice giveaway. And in 1990, it's the New York Jets and Bobby Humphery.  </P> <P> By now, it's no trade secret. The Rams always have survived and thrived on the  kindness of strangers.  </P></p>

			<p>920325 FT  25 MAR 92 / Aid of Dollars 400m pledged for Zambia Drought-stricken Zambia, one of the world's poorest and most indebted countries, yesterday received pledges from western donor countries of more than Dollars 400m in balance of payments and emergency imports support, William Dawkins reports from Paris. The pledges, which were made at a meeting of the World Bank consultative group on Zambia, are a significant increase on previous years' aid. They cover the country's financing requirements for the year so far, not including the extra costs of the drought. Zambia needs Dollars 1.7bn of external aid for the year as a whole.</p>

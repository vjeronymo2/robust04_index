			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The press agency of the Slovak Republic has issued a  program statement by the signatories of the Alternative of  Political Realism within the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  [HZDS]. The signatories gave a briefing on their initiative to  members and deputies of the ruling movement at today's session  of the HZDS deputies' club in Casta Papiernicka.    They propose to form a government with the participation of  the HZDS, the Party of the Democratic Left, the Christian  Democratic Movement, the Slovak National Party, and the Alliance  of Democrats--without personal participation of the chairmen of  the parties and movements in question. They also propose to  invite experts without party affiliation to join the government.    The statement issued by the Alternative of Political Realism  says that its signatories consider it inevitable to return to  the original democratic principles.    This text was signed by 10 HZDS parliament deputies. The  Alternative was formed within the framework of the HZDS.</p>

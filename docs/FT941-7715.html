			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Sales decline at three top Japanese brewers Japan's three leading brewers saw a fall in non-consolidated sales for the year to December as last year's unusually cool summer and the prolonged economic downturn stemmed consumer demand for beer and other beverages. However, profits were mixed as streamlining efforts helped Asahi, while Sapporo also saw earnings rise on the back of new beer brands. Kirin, the industry leader, saw declines in profits for the second consecutive year in spite of a rise in its pharmaceutical sales. Beer sales fell 1.5 per cent to Y1,307.6bn (Dollars 12.3bn) while its drugs division posted a 37.7 per cent rise in sales to Y25.6bn. The company saw a 3.3 per cent fall in after-tax profits to Y36.2bn. For the current year to December, Kirin expects pre-tax profits to rise 5.2 per cent to Y81bn due to lower material costs on a 3.9 per cent sales rise to Y1,400bn. On a consolidated basis, the company posted an 8.4 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year to last December to Y87bn on a 1.7 per cent decline in sales to Y1,574.8bn. Rationalisation helped Asahi increase profits in spite of its first sales decline in 14 years. Non-consolidated operating profits for the year to last December climbed 8.7 per cent and after-tax profits rose 9.6 per cent to Y4.4bn. However, the rise in pre-tax profits was trimmed to 4.6 per cent at Y14.6bn due to equity-linked bond redemptions worth Dollars 1bn. The company also booked a loss of Y1.6bn by liquidating its subsidiaries. For the full year to next December, Asahi expects a 2.1 per cent rise in parent pre-tax profits to Y15bn on a rise in sales to Y780bn. Sapporo was the sole brewer to see an expansion in beer sales last year thanks to new brands including low calorie beers. The company reported a sales and pre-tax profits rise for the fourth consecutive year. After-tax profits rose 48.9 per cent due to a fall in corporate taxes. For the full year to December, Sapporo expects profits to remain flat at Y11.1bn on a 4.2 per cent rise in sales to Y595bn.</p>

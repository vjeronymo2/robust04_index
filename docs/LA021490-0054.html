			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON STATE;  </P> <P> TEACHERS WALK OUT TO AIR PAY DEMANDS  </P> <P> Chanting that they refused to "work for peanuts anymore," at least a thousand  teachers marched through downtown Seattle as more than 13,000 instructors  across Washington state staged a one-day walkout to draw attention to their  demands for a pay raise. The walkout by a quarter of the state's 43,000  teachers gave about 200,000 public school students a day off that will have to  be made up.  </P></p>

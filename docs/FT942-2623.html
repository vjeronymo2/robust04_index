			<p>940618 FT  18 JUN 94 / Firms warn on conflict of interest: Fears over role of investigating accountants grow in receivership debate Two firms of chartered accountants yesterday added to the criticism of the process by which investigating accountants appointed by banks to examine ailing companies can then take on the role of receiver. Kingston Smith, the 28th-largest firm, said there was a 'clear conflict of interest' and that a negative report from an accountant which led to receivership made it impossible for the firm to remain objective. The comments followed those on Thursday by Mr John Jackson, chairman of Brown &amp; Jackson, the owner of the loss-making Poundstretcher retail chain. Mr Jackson called the practice 'objectionable' and called for an inquiry by the Bank of England and the accountancy bodies. Mr Michael Snyder, Kingston Smith's senior partner, said: 'We have had a number of clients to whom accountants were appointed and played it safe (by recommending receivership). It has been a real problem.' He said there was a tendency for banks to instruct the largest firms, the investigators from which 'are most likely to be insolvency experts with the prospect of a future receivership in their minds'. Mr Simon Rees, senior partner of Rees Pollock, a London-based practice, said: 'There can be a conflict of interest and there is certainly a public perception.' He said there was a tension because investigating accountants were generally paid by directors of an ailing company, but reported to a bank. However, Mr Derrick Woolf, joint head of corporate support services at accountants Levy Gee, which specialises in insolvency work, said: 'We would never get another job from a bank if we recommended receivership when it was not necessary.' Mr Allan Griffiths, vice-president of the Society of Practitioners of Insolvency and a partner with Grant Thornton, said receivership was recommended in only a small proportion of investigations. He added that it would prove very costly and more destructive to a business if its banks had to appoint as its receivers a separate firm which lacked knowledge of the company.</p>

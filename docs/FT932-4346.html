			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Survey of Sheffield (7): New research links with industry and commerce - The area's universities have a key role AS in many other British cities, the universities in Sheffield are playing a growing role in developing the regional economy, an inevitable result of government pressure on institutions of higher learning to be more businesslike in running themselves. This has meant looking for sources of finance other than government grants. In turn, this has led to closer links with industry through research and study contracts. But it also owes something to the phenomenon that with the shrinking of manufacturing, the universities are becoming important players in new service and high technology sectors, both as employers and businesses in their own right and as trainers and teachers of skills for new as well as traditional industries. Sheffield now has two universities. The University of Sheffield was created in 1905 out of the Sheffield Medical School, Firth College and the Sheffield Technical School. This university has a staff of 4,017, which makes it the third largest employer in the city after Sheffield City Council with 25,000 and Sheffield Health Authority with 12,800. There is also Sheffield Hallam University which until last autumn was Sheffield Polytechnic. Sheffield Hallam employs 2,559. Between them the universities have over 20,000 full time students and over 30,000 part-time and full time. Ms Denise Annett, head of communications at Sheffield Hallam, dates the strong growth of the university as a business institution not from the change to university status last year but from its release from local government control in 1989. 'It was then that student numbers and, accordingly, income, really began to climb,' says Ms Annett. 'With 20,000 students, income in 1991-92 was Pounds 70m, 46 per cent from national funding.' There has been a significant increase in income from other sources since 1986/87, albeit from a low base. Whether as a increasingly independent institution or an adjunct of local government, Hallam has always had a strong vocational bias. Ms Annett says: 'Courses in our 12 schools are drawn up in consultation with both local employers and national employer institutions. We run a lot of sandwich courses and we're always on the lookout for sponsorship and funding. We want our students to go into jobs when they leave here. In hiring staff we try and ensure a strong teaching background.' Research is not spurned altogether, although research and consultancy only accounted for 4 per cent of income in 1991/92. There is a Metals Research Institute. It earned Pounds 2.5m through consultancy and other projects in 1991/92. Various of the schools also undertake research and consultancy - the business school is undertaking a project on the coalfield closures for a nearby local council. The school of leisure and food management is involved in tourism and leisure projects. Other ways that Sheffield Hallam University is involved with the local community include close links with the local training and enterprise council and the Sheffield Development Corporation - 'we are usually included when there are delegations to London to see ministers or government departments,' says Ms Annett. In contrast to Sheffield Hallam, the University of Sheffield emphasises both teaching and research. In his foreword to the 1991/92 annual report, Professor Gareth Roberts, the vice-chancellor says: 'It seems inevitable that an even more diverse system of universities will emerge during the nineties. The University of Sheffield can expect to be in the top echelon of institutions that combine teaching and research in almost equal measure.' The university has 30 research units grouped in the eight faculties. There are also three trading companies and 19 specialist advisory services for industry and commerce operating within the university. Research grant contract income was Pounds 23m in 1991/92, an increase of 19 per cent over the previous year. This was out of a total income of Pounds 119m in 1991/92. The university has strong links with the local economy through its research programme. In order to take this process further the university last month launched the University of Sheffield Regional Office. This will provide a focal point for the establishment of partnerships with local private and public sector organisations. One of the first tasks for the Regional Office was to set up Plus the acronymic title for Project Link University of Sheffield. It is a scheme which helps businesses and public sector organisations such as hospitals to harness specialist expertise through collaborative student project work. Dr Marilyn Wedgwood, director of the regional office says: 'Undergraduates and post-graduates will work on project topics which bring practical benefits to organisations. Project topics are identified by the organisation and students complete the project as part of their work.' It is still early days for Plus, but a directory of subjects shows that out of 300 topics available for post graduates, some 175 are in the field of landscape, 45 in computer science and 120 in the field of leisure. The regional office is looking at ways the university can involve itself in local economic regeneration and how it can establish fora and clubs. This should help the university to become more closely involved in the Sheffield economy.</p>

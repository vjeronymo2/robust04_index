			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Three cheers to KTTV for showing "The Andy Griffith Show" twice a day.  </P> <P> Fans like me tape the shows to keep. Unfortunately, the station must be  desperate for commercial time. It edits the shows severely. The worst part is  they don't show the end of the program. It's like listening to a wonderful joke  with the punch line omitted.  </P> <P> Kenton L. Moody, Los Angeles  </P></p>

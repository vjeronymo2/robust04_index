			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Lockheed wins Dollars 65bn fighter project: Consortium secures first part of record Pentagon deal for new stealth aircraft A CONSORTIUM led by Lockheed yesterday won the contract for the next generation of US stealth fighter aircraft, expected to be worth Dollars 65bn (Pounds 38bn) over the next two decades - the biggest-ever aerospace contract. The Dollars 12.1bn first part of the contract, awarded by the Pentagon, is for the development of the aircraft, of which 650 are planned to be built. It was won in the face of fierce competition from a consortium led by Northrop. Lockheed's partners in the consortium for the advanced tactical fighter (ATF), are Boeing and General Dynamics. Pratt &amp; Whitney, part of United Technologies Corporation, will build the aircraft's engines. Yesterday's announcement was a severe blow to Northrop and its partner McDonnell Douglas, the largest defence contractor in the US. The two companies had spent about Dollars 1bn and more than four years trying to secure the contract. McDonnell responded to the announcement by saying it would cut its workforce by 500 by the end of the year. Northrop said it expected to shed 200 to 400 jobs soon. Analysts believe the project may determine the future shape of the US aerospace industry. It will consolidate Boeing and Lockheed's strong position and is likely to boost the two companies' earnings. Mr Gary Reich, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, has increased his 1992 earnings estimate for Lockheed by 25 cents a share to Dollars 5.40, saying the contract should add 55 cents a share to net earnings in 1993. Last night Mr Jerry King, Boeing executive vice-president, said the contract would not result in significant earnings until the mid-1990s. Pratt &amp; Whitney also cautioned that the contract would have no impact on its production operations until the late 1990s. General Dynamics estimated that its share of the revenues would total Dollars 20bn over the programme's term. The aircraft is to be a faster version of the F-15 Eagle fighters, and will be capable of evading enemy radar. Mr Donald Rice, the US air force secretary, said Lockheed and Boeing had submitted the lowest bid. 'The ATF will balance stealth, supercruise and advanced avionics in a highly manoeuvreable fighter that will ensure that our pilots get first look and first kill,' said Mr Rice. It would ensure American air superiority well into the next century, he added. The Pentagon's decision was the second blow this year for McDonnell Douglas, which had to take a large write-off against fourth-quarter earnings after the Pentagon decided in January to cancel its A-12 stealth attack aircraft contract, a potential Dollars 50bn programme. McDonnell Douglas has already started to wean itself of its dependence on the Pentagon and has started to focus more on its commercial aircraft operations.</p>

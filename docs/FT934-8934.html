			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / International Company News: Economic slump boosts Japanese suit makers JAPAN'S discount suit makers saw interim profits for the six months to September surge as consumers turned to cheaper products due to the prolonged economic downturn. Aoyama Trading, the leading manufacturer and retailer of office workers' blue suits, reported a 34.5 per cent jump in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y12.2bn (Dollars 114m) on a 38.7 per cent rise in sales to Y76.6bn. After-tax profits soared by 41 per cent to Y7.2bn. The company, which is known for its aggressive discounts, has been actively launching new outlets throughout the country. It opened a store in the luxury shopping area of Ginza in Tokyo this year. For the full year to March, Aoyama expects a 15.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y35bn on a 32.5 per cent increase in sales to Y150.9bn. Aoki International said its interim pre-tax profits rose by 8.3 per cent to Y5.3bn, helped by an expansion of sales outlets. Half-year sales advanced by 10 per cent to Y36.1bn, while after-tax profits rose by 3.5 per cent to Y2.5bn. The company said sales at existing stores were stagnant because of the bad summer weather, but it saw an increase in demand for its original design items. For the full year to March, Aoki expects a 20.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y13.6bn on a 16.4 per cent advance in sales to Y94bn after the planned launch of 21 new stores. Sankyo, the Japanese drugs company, said pre-tax profits for the half year to September rose by 11 per cent to Y39.7bn due to firm sales and cost-cutting efforts. The company posted a 2.7 per cent increase in sales to Y206.2bn and a 27 per cent rise in after-tax profits to Y17.2bn. For the year to March, the company expects a 9.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y77bn, while sales are expected to remain almost flat at Y399bn.</p>

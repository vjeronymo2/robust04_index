			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Cola wars bubble up in Japanese market Cola wars have spread to Japan. Coca-Cola Japan, the subsidiary of the US soft drinks company, is feeling the squeeze on the shelves as lower priced retail brands gain popularity among Japanese consumers. Facing greater competition from cheaper colas sold by leading supermarkets, the company has imported 300,000 cases of Coca-Cola from the US to sell at reduced prices in supermarkets and fast food outlets in the greater Tokyo area. The move comes as large Japanese supermarkets and discount retailers are offering consumers cheap non-branded or imported colas. Although the bulk of Coca-Cola is sold through vending machines in Japan, the company's sales through retailers are steadily being eroded. Ito-Yokado, a leading supermarket chain, has tied up with Cott, the Canadian beverage company, and two other US bottlers to produce soft drinks. The retailer sells a 354ml can at Y78 (51p), 29 per cent cheaper than the usual can of cola, while Daiei, the nation's largest supermarket operator, has started to sell its own brand cola made in the US at Y39. The Coca-Cola bottlers, the distributing wholesaling companies to which Coca-Cola Japan supplies beverages, have started distributing the cheap imports to be sold at a retail price of around Y70 per can, 36 per cent lower than Coca-Cola's usual retail price, for a limited period this summer. Private labels are already a familiar phenomenon in Europe and North America, where consumers have increasingly become more concerned about getting good quality at a low price than about the name on the product. In the soft drinks sector, tough competition from Cott in the US recently prompted Pepsi-Cola to warn of flat profits in its second quarter, causing its share price to plummet. Cott's annual sales have climbed from CDollars 43m to CDollars 665m (Pounds 310m) in the past five years. Over the same period, its share of the Canadian take-home soft drinks market has grown to 28 per cent. Now it is spreading into the US, Australia, South Africa and - after signing a distribution agreement with Cadbury Schweppes of the UK - into Europe. In the UK, a private label cola supplied by Cott to Sainsbury, the biggest British food retailer, has taken more than half Coca-Cola's sales through Sainsbury's stores. Now, for the first time national brand names are facing competition from cheaper retail brands in Japan. Frugality has been a trend among ordinary Japanese, whose pockets have been hit by the prolonged domestic recession. Also, the higher yen and expansion of retailers have lowered the price of imported private brands. Retailers' private brand products now range from food to mens' suits to electronic appliances. And although retailer brand sales still only account for about 10 per cent of the retail market, in some cases they have won over national brands. For instance, orange juice prices have declined sharply recently due to Daiei's private brand orange juice imported from Brazil, initially offered at half the price of other national brands. Coca-Cola Japan was dismissive of the impact cheaper private brands were having on its market share, since sales through retailers amounted to 1 per cent of overall sales. However, an official at a bottler noted the trend towards cheaper prices in Japan and said the company was testing the quality of the imports before possibly distributing Coca-Cola made in the US on a regular basis.</p>

			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TAXPAYERS GET 2 EXTRA DAYS TO FILE RETURNS  </P> <P> Lucky taxpayers. The deadline to file federal and state income tax returns for  1988 is two days later than normal because the regular April 15 deadline falls  on the weekend.  </P> <P> Last-minute filers have until midnight Monday to mail their returns.  </P> <P> The Internal Revenue Service regional center in Fresno and the Franchise Tax  Board in Sacramento are braced for the late rush. So is the U.S. Postal  Service, which brings returns to the Fresno service center in tractor-trailer  trucks this time of year.  </P> <P> "Prior to the peak season, we get three mail drops a day, and during the peak  period that goes up to eight or 10 a day," said Marty Gomez, spokesman for the  IRS service center.  </P> <P> By the end of last week, the Fresno IRS center had received 5.9 million returns  from residents of Central and Southern California and Hawaii. That is just over  half the 11.4 million expected this tax season.  </P> <P> At the tax agency in Sacramento, 7 million 1988 state returns had been  processed as of Thursday, and 13 million are expected by the end of the tax  season, spokesman Jim Reber said.  </P> <P> For the first time, California taxpayers are required to attach a copy of their  federal return when they send their state return.  </P> <P> The state will be offering perplexed taxpayers help Saturday from 8 a.m. to 5  p.m. People in Northern California can call 800-852-7050, while people in  Southern California can call 800-852-5711.  </P> <P> For help with state returns, California residents can call 800-424-1040.  </P></p>

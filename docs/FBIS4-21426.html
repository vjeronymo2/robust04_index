			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 7 KYODO -- A government panel Thursday  [7 April] began formulating industrial guidelines for  environmental protection, panel officials said.    An organ of the Industrial Structure Council, an advisory  body to the international trade and industry minister, held its  first meeting to prepare a set of industrial rules for  protecting the earth's environment in such areas as industrial  wastes and chemical pollutants such as carbon dioxide emissions.    A report to be announced in early June will address the  importance of sector-by-sector responsibility by Japanese  businesses for the disposal of harmful chemicals and byproducts  throughout all stages of business activities from materials  purchases to manufacturing, distribution and the end-use of  products, ministry officials said.    The report will also call for businesses to establish  technologies to enable secondary use of both industrial and  household waste.    The panel will hold three more meetings before releasing the  report entitled, ``An Industrial Vision of the Environment,'' on  8 June.</p>

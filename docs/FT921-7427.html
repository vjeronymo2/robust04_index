			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble to new lows - Week in the Markets THE COFFEE markets in both London and New York have been tumbling this week in the face of overwhelming supplies and no prospect of a renewed international coffee agreement. Robusta prices on the London Futures and Options Exchange (Fox) began the decline on Monday when the New York arabica market was closed for the Presidents' Day holiday. The retreat rapidly accelerated on Tuesday afternoon in London, when New York re-opened only to fall to the lowest levels for 17 years. On Tuesday the London May contract closed at Dollars 851 a tonne, down Dollars 23, while New York's March contract lost more than 2 cents to close at 66.7 cents a lb. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London broker, pointed out that most market watchers were revising their crop forecasts upwards for this year. 'The only thing that can push prices up now is a crop disaster or an International Coffee Organisation accord.' The Colombians, who were reported recently as saying their crop would be 16.7m bags (60 kilos each), on Thursday restated that they expected a crop of 16.2m bags, giving the market something of a lift. They have also re-emphasised at a US coffee convention in Florida that they are keen to make progress towards a renewed coffee pact. According to Reuters, the Colombian president will put pressure on President Bush for more support on the coffee pact when the two meet later this month in Texas for a summit meeting on drugs. Earlier this month an ICO working party failed to come up with any fresh ideas on a future pact. The coffee market has been in free fall since the ICO export quota system collapsed in July 1989. The Brazilians - seen as the main stumbling block to progress  - have yet to make up their minds whether they want an agreement with economic clauses. Brazil, the world's biggest producer, is heading for a coffee harvest this year of nearly 28m to 30m bags. As New York prices were tumbling on Tuesday towards 'a bottomless pit,' one New York trader commented: 'Eventually it will reach such a level that producers will be forced into action.' The London May contract closed yesterday at a new low of Dollars 838, down Dollars 25 on the day and Dollars 50 on the week. On the London Metal Exchange confusion over the situation in the CIS continued to dominate trading. On Monday some analysts suggested that traders were using this as cover to squeeze the aluminium and nickel markets. The three-month nickel price was Dollars 165 up at the close at Dollars 8,195 a tonne after touching a six-month high of Dollars 8,245 a tonne, while three-month aluminium traded up to a seven-month high of Dollars 1,340 a tonne. Analysts agree that Russian metal exports to the west will fall this year but remain high enough to continue causing headaches for western producers. They disagree, however, on the severity of the fall. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at Merrill Lynch, believes Russian exports might fall by a third this year, mainly because of problems caused by new taxes and an eight-week backlog for licences, which has more or less brought exports to a halt. However, Mr Neil Buxton, of Metal Bulletin Research, believes that while exports will not match last year's levels, they will remain 'very high by historic standards. There will be a lot of metal for the relatively sluggish western European economies to absorb.' Adding further to the confusion were remarks made in London by Mr Anatoly Filatov, chairman of Norilsk, Russia's main nickel producer. He insisted that delays in nickel shipments have not been caused by bureaucratic delays and export tariffs, but because prices were too low. Mr Robin Bhar, of Carr Kitkat &amp; Aitken, pointed out that LME nickel stocks rose by 540 tonnes on Tuesday and by a further 450 tonnes yesterday to total 19,734 tonnes, giving the lie to concern over CIS exports. The market was also talking of a further 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes of unregistered Russian nickel already in Europe. He suggested that investment funds know that the market has been characterised by thin dealing. 'It's very easy to get the market moving,' said Mr Bhar yesterday, 'but in order to sustain it you need the consumers.' Yesterday cash nickel closed at Dollars 7,970 a tonne, a fall of Dollars 60 on the week, while three-month was Dollars 8,030. Cash aluminium closed at Dollars 1,295 a tonne, up Dollars 7.50, while three-month was Dollars 1,319.50.  ---------------------------------        LME WAREHOUSE STOCKS  --------------------------------- (As at Thursday's close)                 tonnes Aluminium  +7450 to 1086625 Copper     +3050 to 308550 Lead        +400 to 131975 Nickel      +450 to 19734 Zinc      +12500 to 195350 Tin         -335 to 12885  ---------------------------------</p>

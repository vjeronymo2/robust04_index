			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kaizer Nyatsumba, politcal correspondent] </F>   [Text] The South African Defence Force [SADF] has again  postponed its meeting with the PAC's [Pan-Africanist Congress]  Azanian People's Liberation Army [APLA], whose top leaders are  already in the country for the talks.    In a statement yesterday, the SADF said the meeting,  scheduled for this week, would now take place next week, almost  a month before the country's first all-inclusive election.    Sources said the PAC and APLA leadership was angry with the  latest postponement of the talks, which were to have taken place  as early as December, had it not been for a series of  postponements.    The sources said this would put a severe strain on the  organisation's suspension of its armed struggle and  unnecessarily delay important discussions on the formation of a  new army.    In its statement yesterday, the SADF said the meeting "will  be exploratory in nature, aimed at determining whether there is  scope and potential for further discussions."    The meeting, over whose venue there was still some haggling  earlier this week, was to have been the first face-to-face  encounter to take place in the country between the two old foes.    Both previous meetings were held outside the country.    THE STAR understands that the SADF wanted the meeting to  take  place in Pretoria, while APLA leaders -- some of whom arrived in  the country on Sunday -- insisted on Johannesburg as a venue.    The top APLA leadership -- including Dan "Romero Daniels"  Mofokeng -- have been in the country since APLA commander Sabelo  Phama's funeral in Transkei last month.    Those APLA leaders who arrived in the country on Sunday are  Mopedi Ntabeni, Willie Nkonyeni and Andile Motlhabane.    They have been granted limited indemnity.    However, THE STAR understands that they will soon be given  complete indemnity.</p>

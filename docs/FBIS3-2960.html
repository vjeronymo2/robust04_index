Advocated by Chinese senior leader Deng Xiaoping, the  tree-planting movement has been developed quickly throughout the  country. More than 500 million people planted 2.4 billion trees  last year.    Presently, all the barren hills in Guangdong, Fujian and  Hunan Provinces have been covered with green trees. Both the  forest areas and forest reserves of the country have increased  over these years.    China recently made new plans to promote the afforestation  movement. Some 100 counties are designated as key areas to be  afforested.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tegucigalpa, 9 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The Central Bank of  Honduras [BCH] today announced strong control measures on the  U.S. dollar exchange system so as to stabilize the value of the  lempira, which has dropped by 13.5 percent in relation to the  official exchange rate of 7.27 lempiras per dollar in the past  few weeks.    BCH President Hugo Noe Pino said that the pressure on the  local currency and the economy is caused by "speculation" by  private exchange brokers, and that these brokers "are a source  of exchange instability."    The BCH keeps the official exchange rate at 7.27 lempiras  per  dollar as a means of taxing imports, but the dollar is sold at  the rate of 8.41 lempiras on the black market, making it  impossible "to estimate a balanced average," Pino said.    He said "strong" measures will be taken to control the  foreign currency market. He declined to mention the regulations  that will be added to other monetary decisions.    The government implemented control in late May on 50 percent  of the U.S. dollars the exchange system accumulated. The  government forces exchange brokers to sell 40 percent of their  dollars to the BCH, according to experts, so as to bolster  international reserves and to be prepared to face foreign debt  amortizations.    Pino said the BCH will announce next week the new monetary  measures that will effect stability and an inflow of Honduran  exporters' dollars presently deposited in foreign banks.    Authorities estimate approximately $1.5 billion belong to  Hondurans who are waiting for monetary stability before  transferring the money to Honduras are deposited in U.S. banks.    The assembly plant industry, which brings between $70  million  and $100 million annually from exports, will have to report its  dollars to the BCH, Pino said.    Honduran dollars are transacted through the formal banking  system, the exchange brokers, who buy and sell dollars  exclusively, and the black market, which the central banking  system does not regulate.</p>

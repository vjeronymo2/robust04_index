			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Reduced support for Iran president IRANIAN President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani won a second four-year term yesterday with a reduced vote that underlined the waning popularity of the country's Islamic revolution, Reuter reports from Tehran. But Mr Rafsanjani saw the result as a vote of confidence in his economic reform plans. 'That a considerable majority of people supported the programme is a great asset for me and my colleagues that would encourage us to execute the rest of the programme with confidence,' he said in a message broadcast on radio and television. Diplomats described the result and the low turnout as a near-humiliation which could severely limit the president's authority. Final results of Friday's poll, announced yesterday, gave the 58-year-old cleric 10.6m votes, or 63.2 per cent of the vote, compared with 94.5 per cent in the 1989 election. The turnout was 57.6 per cent, showing that economic hardship made many voters indifferent to calls from the ruling clergy for a mass display of faith in the 1979 revolution. It meant that Mr Rafsanjani, running against three no-hope challengers, won endorsement from fewer that 11m of the 29m Iranians eligible to vote. The big surprise was Mr Ahmad Tavakkoli, a former labour minister who now edits the economic section of Tehran's right-wing daily Resalat. His campaign attacks on economic mismanagement captured 23.8 per cent of the votes. Diplomats said the weakened Mr Rafsanjani may now be more reluctant to push through with efforts to curb radicals who continue to foment militancy at home and abroad.</p>

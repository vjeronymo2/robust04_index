			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Gerfried Sperl: "A European Sensation"] </F>   [Text] Support for European Union [EU] membership, which  has been sensationally high by European standards, is first and  foremost an enormous political success for the grand coalition  and a personal boost for Alois Mock. The Social Democratic  Party of Austria [SPOe] and the Austrian People's Party [OeVP],  Franz Vranitzky and Erhard Busek, have achieved the main  objective of their government and no longer have to waste any  time dwelling on the past: Their election campaign for the  parliamentary election in October should focus on clear ideas  for the future and avoid narrow-minded polemics.    Even more so, since this Sunday [12 June] also brought a  defeat for Joerg Haider, who wanted to turn 12 June into a day  of voting out the Vranitzky government. He failed  spectacularly. Particularly in urban areas, which is where the  Freedom Party of Austria [FPOe] sees great potential for  support, 75-percent majorities in favor of the EU were quite  frequent -- with the number of opponents in many cases not  rising beyond the share of the electorate held by the FPOe, the  Greens, and Communists. This allows another interpretation of  the result: Even those less well-off and the less-educated  hardly fell into the trap represented by the slogans of fear  launched so violently by TAEGLICH ALLES -- a sign of political  matureness, as was the high voter turnout, which was not the  result of weather conditions.    Nevertheless, no one should believe that the advance of the  FPOe has now been stopped or even that the SPOe and OeVP can now  be sure of defending their share in the fall election. It is  probably true what Vranitzky and his government team pointed out  on television again and again: The EU referendum was not the  right vote to give someone "a good lesson," because the parties'  performance should be evaluated in the fall. This was  understood by Austrians, and they were capable of  differentiating. They have given the FPOe leader something to  think about. Nevertheless, the Austrians may well go for  escapism this fall by, for example, confirming the same Joerg  Haider once more as the bad boy of this republic in the fall.    Of equally high importance is the effect of this result  internationally. It looks as if Austria has finally recovered  from the setbacks of the Waldheim years. Such clear EU votes  are rare, which is why the Austrians will be able to present  themselves in Brussels with a rather high degree of  self-confidence. There are two more aspects: First, the EU  referenda in the two Scandinavian countries and in Finland will  undoubtedly be influenced by the Austrian yes, while in  Switzerland the debate on Europe will flare up again. Even more  so since Switzerland yesterday voted against participating in UN  peace missions. Its international reputation will suffer and  the polarization between "internationalists" and "isolationists"  will grow.    Second, our neighbors -- the Czech Republic, Hungary, and  Slovakia -- will understand the result as a support for their  ambitions to be able to join the EU at the turn of the century,  which would offer them better protection against Russian  ambitions, which might flare up again at any moment. Austria  therefore has a leading role in these former "satellite  countries."    Despite all these positive points, one should not ignore  responsibility toward those Austrians who voted no. After all,  they are not only fearful people or egocentrics. Many excellent  scientists, numerous critical artists, and a considerable  percentage of worried farmers (just to name a few groups) asked  questions that have to remain on the political agenda.    The oft-cited maturity of the citizens must be complemented  by openness on the part of the government in taking account of  criticism in its EU policy and the readiness of the media to  publicize the arguments of EU opponents.</p>

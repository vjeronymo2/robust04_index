			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / World Trade News: New gas turbine 'most efficient' Westinghouse Electric of the US has raised the temperature in the highly-competitive power station market by launching a new gas turbine claimed to be the world's largest and most efficient, writes Andrew Baxter in London. The 230MW turbine creates a challenge for rivals in the power generating equipment industry. Customers are looking for larger gas turbines and can save millions of dollars of fuel costs through greater thermal efficiency. The US group's new turbine, the 501G, is designed to serve markets which require electricity at 60 hertz (cycles) - North America and parts of Asia. With a steam turbine added to create a combined-cycle system, the turbine is expected to provide a net efficiency of 58 per cent. The Westinghouse turbine was developed in collaboration with its technology partners Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and FiatAvio of Italy. Westinghouse and Mitsubishi will both make the 501G, with the US company using its North American manufacturing network and MHI its Takasago works. Both expect to ship the first machines in 1996.</p>

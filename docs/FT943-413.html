			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / US warns Wellcome on plant standards Wellcome, the UK drug company, has been warned by the Food and Drug Administration, which controls the sale of prescription medicines in the US, about manufacturing shortcomings in its main North American plant. Wellcome shares fell 19p to 659p in spite of the company's assurances that the FDA's concerns were 'fully addressed' at a meeting between the company and the FDA earlier this month. Wellcome said the warning referred to the monitoring of manufacturing processes rather than to products themselves. It also did not cover the manufacture of pills, which make up most of the company's sales and 'probably more than 90 per cent' of the output of Zovirax, its top-selling anti-viral drug. Sales of Zovirax in the year ending June 1994 were almost Pounds 900m. FDA conducts lightning inspection of all manufacturing plants licensed to make drugs for sale in the US. Warning letters are not especially unusual, but Wellcome has not received any since 1979. Wellcome's plant in Greenville, North Carolina, is one of only two that makes virtually all the active ingredients in Wellcome's medicines. The other is in the UK. The company said that after the meeting with the FDA on September 8 it 'put in place immediate corrective measures. We are currently in talks with the FDA to develop a long-term strategy to ensure that standards are maintained.' People, Page 16 Lex, Page 20</p>

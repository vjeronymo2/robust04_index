			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Survey of Nigeria (6): Blueprint for change IF NIGERIA'S renewed commitment to economic reform takes root, much of the credit will go to the participants at a remarkable summit in the federal capital of Abuja. For three days in February leaders from the public and private sector, joined by officials from international development agencies and senior diplomats, conducted a rigorous appraisal of the economic health of the nation. 'Your mission,' President Ibrahim Babangida told them in his opening address, 'is to chart an appropriate strategy and help to put in place other reforms which are still needed to fully restructure our economy.' The summit, intended to become an annual event, was the brainchild of Chief Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's transitional council and a prominent businessman. Inspired in part by President Bill Clinton's pre-inauguration economic conference in Little Rock and encouraged by Nigeria's business community keen to assist one of their own, Mr Shonekan struck an ambitious note: 'We can lay the foundation for a more buoyant economy for the 1990s and beyond.' The two days that followed were marked by a sombre analysis of the country's economic crisis, coupled with enthusiasm about Nigeria's potential. Participants extolled the virtues of the free market, called for less government intervention, and advocated measures to attract local and foreign investment. Group discussions focused on monetary and fiscal policies, debt management, capital markets, law and order, and Nigeria's image abroad. What emerged was a blueprint for change, which will be the subject of further debate and consultation at regional gatherings and at suitable venues abroad. Copies of the summit report (which includes the main speeches, as well as a list of participants that reads like a who's who of the business sector) are now available.* Bringing together such a range of participants at short notice was in itself no mean achievement. But in the weeks that followed the limitations on the transitional council's capacity to implement the Abuja blueprint have become increasingly evident. A post-summit session is due to take place in Lagos tomorrow at which a frank appraisal of progress - or lack of it - is expected. * Report on the First Nigerian Economic Summit, NES Organising Committee, PO Box 51204, Falomo, Lagos.

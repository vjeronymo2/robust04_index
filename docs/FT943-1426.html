			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / South Africa holds its breath over Zulu split: As Shaka's descendants square up, Mark Suzman looks at the bigger issues around the power struggle Shaka, the 19th-century founder of the Zulu kingdom, was an African Napoleon who, like his European contemporary, used his military genius to forge a new empire. In the process he caused tremendous political and economic upheaval throughout the southern African region. As South Africa's 9m Zulus decide whether to observe today's Shaka Day, an annual commemoration of the murder of Shaka by his brothers in 1828, millions of other South Africans will be hoping the occasion does not mark the start of renewed violence in the KwaZulu/Natal province, and, by extension, cause serious damage to the spirit of consensus and reconciliation that has characterised the country's politics since its elections in April. Although the event has been held since 1954, this year is the first time Shaka Day does not have the blessing of the Zulu monarchy. Earlier this week, King Goodwill Zwelithini announced he was cancelling the ceremonies and called instead for a period of peace and prayer to be observed by Zulus countrywide. The decision was apparently precipitated after Inkatha supporters stormed the royal palace in Nongoma on Monday night after a meeting between the king, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, home affairs minister and leader of the Inkatha Freedom party which has political control of KwaZulu/Natal, and President Nelson Mandela. The discussion had been called to resolve a controversy over the king's apparent invitation to Mr Mandela to attend the Shaka Day celebration - a move which Chief Buthelezi objected to, ostensibly on the grounds that protocol had not been followed. After making his announcement, however, the king set the stage for open confrontation between his supporters and those loyal to Inkatha. Dismissing the king's call, Chief Buthelezi said the monarch had no authority to cancel the occasion, which belonged to 'the Zulu nation as a whole'. As a result there is now serious concern that today's celebrations will lead to outbreaks of violence between Zulus honouring the king's cancellation request and those who have chosen to support Chief Buthelezi's stand. In a province where thousands of people have been killed over the past decade in internecine clashes between Zulus loyal to Inkatha and Zulus loyal to the African National Congress, such fears may well be justified. Prior to the elections, the king had been associated with Inkatha, an explicitly Zulu nationalist organisation that has been dominated by Chief Buthelezi since its formation in 1975. Since April, however, the two rulers have been steadily drifting apart and King Goodwill's attitude to the ANC has thawed notably. After his Shaka Day declaration, moreover, King Goodwill declared his desire to stay above politics, and dismissed Chief Buthelezi from his honorary role as traditional 'prime minister' to the monarchy, apparently replacing him with a former regent, Prince Mcwayizeni Zulu, who is a member of the ANC. This move strikes at the heart of Chief Buthelezi's power base. For decades he has played on, and largely created, Zulu nationalist ideology to consolidate his own power base. In the elections he ruthlessly exploited tribal fears to drum up support. Central to this message is the association with Shaka, from whom both Chief Buthelezi, who is the king's uncle, and King Goodwill himself, claim direct descent. Over the years, Shaka Day has evolved into the central focus of Zulu nationalist ideology, and Chief Buthelezi and the king have traditionally presided jointly over the formal ceremonies at the Shaka monument in the town of Stanger. Dressed in traditional leopard-skin robes, and presiding over hundreds of assegai-wielding impi regiments and thousands of ululating women, Chief Buthelezi has traditionally used the event to extol Shaka's greatness, and, by extension, his own as the modern-day successor to the warrior monarch. By withdrawing from the celebration, the king, as the living embodiment of the monarchy established by Shaka, severely damages the event's credibility. However in doing so, he has played his strongest card, while Chief Buthelezi remains able to use both the regional government and Inkatha's powerful organisational and patronage network to consolidate his support. As a result, while some prominent ANC-supporting Zulus (not in the past known for their royalist sympathies) have declared themselves in favour of the king's stand, it appears that the chief has so far managed to retain the allegiance of most of the conservative tribal chiefs who comprise Inkatha's core constituency. Nevertheless, the situation remains fluid and to try and calm tensions, both President Mandela and Mr Frank Mdlalose, KwaZulu/Natal regional premier, have made a public call for all Zulus, whether observing the ceremonies or not, to mark the day as one of 'unity and reconciliation'. Meanwhile, the army has been called out to monitor the situation and the king has been evacuated from his palace by national troops and taken to an undisclosed location for the weekend.</p>

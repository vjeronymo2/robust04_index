Addressing the DYP [True Path Party] party meeting, she said  that during her visit to Bosnia on Feb 2 with Pakistan's Premier  Benazir Bhutto, she has seen the naked thruth of the situation.    Ciller said it is essential that the people living there  should be protected and the massacre ended, either by lifting  the embargo or by air operation.    "Turkey is ready to do every thing to help implement NATO  decision and to end this targedy which is taking place right in  the center of Europe," she added.    NATO agreed on Feb 9 to order air strikes against Bosnian  Serb forces besieging Sarajevo unless they withdraw artillery  and other weapons or put them under UN control within 10 days.    The 16 NATO member anbassadors agreed at a meeting in  Brussels that there would be no extension of the ultimatum and  no further warnings.    Serb heavy weapons would have to be withdrawn at least 20 km  (12 miles) from the centre of the besieged city, where 68  helpless civilians were massacred and 200 wounded on Saturday  when Serb mortar turned a market place in central Sarajevo into  a pool of blood.</p>

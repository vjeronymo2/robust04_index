			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tehran, Feb. 1, IRNA -- The daily `TEHRAN TIMES'  Tuesday recommended the newly-selected Algerian president to  unconditionally release Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj if he  wishes to show sincerity regarding a national reconciliation.    General Liamine Zeroual was selected by the Algerian High  Security Council as the new president Sunday.    The English daily said that Zeroual enjoys a good reputation  compared to the five members of the current unelected collective  presidency. "Nevertheless, his presidency cannot bring  legitimacy to the Algerian regime."    Noting that the Algerian problem is of a politico-military  nature, the editorial said "Algeria's efforts to destroy its  domestic opposition and to accuse other countries of interfering  in its internal affairs have met with failure.    "If Zeroual truly wants a national reconciliation...He  should  realize that his time to legitimize his own presidency and the  Algerian Goverment is limited.    The process of legitimization must take place soon or the  current conflict would blow up into a full-fledged civil war,  the daily added.    "This legitimacy must be approved by the people of Algeria,  not by Paris or Washington," wrote the editorial.</p>

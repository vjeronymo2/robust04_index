			<p><P> April 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EARNINGS  </P> <P> New York Times Co.: The diversified media and forest products company reported  first-quarter profit of $35.5 million, down 26% from a year ago. Revenue held  steady at $423 million. The results included higher local advertising revenues  at television stations in the Broadcasting/Information Services Group but lower  advertising volume at its namesake newspaper and a decline in Magazine Group  earnings due in part to development costs related to Snow Country, which began  publication in the third quarter of 1988.  </P></p>

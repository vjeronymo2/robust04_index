			<p>921204 FT  04 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Rate cut hope revives SHARP rises in the pound yesterday, and a rebound in gilts following Wednesday's auction, enabled short sterling to continue its climb back towards the level which would signal further interest rate cuts writes Peter John. Short sterling for March delivery, the contract which has become the lead indicator for the direction rates might take, was sold very heavily down to 93.19 on Monday. That showed a divergence of nearly seven percentage points from 100 and suggested to some that the current cent base rate was here to stay. Since then, the contract has picked up steadily as increasingly gloomy news from mainland Europe has pinpointed the UK as a potential safe currency haven. Buying of sterling, especially from Germany was seen yesterday and the pound's attractiveness encouraged short sterling dealers to mark up the contract by nine basis points at the start of trading. March continued firm throughout the day and closed only two basis points off the day's high at 93.54 with 24,000 lots dealt. December, which is now only reacting to technical factors, opened at 92.78 and ended the day six better at 92.84 with nearly 10,000 lots dealt. Meanwhile liquidity shortage levels among the clearing banks returned to normality following wild swings earlier in the week. The Bank of England said it would offer the money market an early round of assistance after forecasting a liquidity shortage of around Pounds 900m. Among the main factors affecting the position were the take-up of treasury bills and paper maturing in official hands, which were expected to drain Pounds 350m from the system, bankers' balances below target, which would take out Pounds 250m, exchequer transactions, which would remove Pounds 135m and a rise in note circulation which would withdraw Pounds 160m. The Bank later provided the money market with Pounds 615m of early assistance, buying bills for resale to the market on December 30 at an interest rate of 6 15/16 per cent. The help took pressure off overnight rates which opened at 6 9/16 per cent and came back to around 4.5 per cent by the close. The Bank provided Pounds 500m in the afternoon, buying Pounds 477m of band one bills and Pounds 23m of band two bank bills, both at 6 7/8 per cent and bringing total help to Pounds 1.115bn. This compared with a raised forecast shortage of Pounds 1.15bn.</p>

He held a meeting  with the participation of presidium members of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council and the leadership of the secretariat. They  decided to hold on 12 January a joint meeting of the Supreme  Council standing commissions.    As Matviyenko noted, the urgent convening of the meeting is  connected with the Kravchuk and Clinton meeting and in  particular with the possibility of signing, on 14 January in  Moscow, a document on issues of disarmament. Since, in the  opinion of some deputies, the signing of such a document by  Kravchuk is a direct violation of current legislation and  Ukraine's Constitution and contradicts many points of the  conditions to the ratification of the START Treaty of 18  November, Ukraine's Supreme Council should draw up a single  position on these issues.</p>

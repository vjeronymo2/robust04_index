			<p>941031 FT  31 OCT 94 / Company News This Week: Pharmaceuticals future holds the spotlight - Boots Speculation over the future of Boots' pharmaceuticals division is expected to overshadow sharply improved interim figures from the retailing and drugs group on Thursday. Although the company is expected to highlight an increase of about 33 per cent in first-half profits, analysts are likely to focus on the outcome of the year-long review of the drugs business. The review was prompted by last year's withdrawal of the heart drug Manoplax, which left a gap in products under development. Boots officials insist they are under no pressure to sell the business, which remains both profitable and cash generative. Options include disposal, merger or a joint venture. Rumours that disposal was the favoured choice were heightened earlier this year when Boots issued a confidential sales memorandum for potential bidders. While confirming it is in discussions with a number of companies, the group remains coy about its intentions. Names touted include Zeneca, Britain's third-largest drug group, and Medeva, the acquisitive drugs company. Their interest is understood to have waned in recent months, only to be replaced by speculation on possible bids from Knoll, the BASF subsidiary, and Menarini of Italy. The attraction is the pharmaceuticals division's lucrative distribution and marketing operations in the US, rather than the UK research and development facilities. Interim pre-tax profits are forecast to have risen from Pounds 174.6m to about Pounds 233m. Last year's figures were depressed by a Pounds 35m charge to cover the Manoplax withdrawal and a Pounds 5.1m write off on Asilone, an antacid product. The chemists' chain, however, is expected to remain the most profitable division. Analysts are looking for an increased interim dividend of about 5.5p, against 4.9p last time.</p>

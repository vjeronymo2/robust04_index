			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Survey of The Food Industry (3): Mitsubishi's exotic palate  -A takeover with a difference PRINCES, based in Liverpool for more than a century, is as British as fish paste and tinned salmon. After two years under Japanese ownership, none of that has changed, although Princes is now also as Italian as conchiglie pasta and as Danish as marinated herring. What Princes does not betray, so far at least, is any trace of a Japanese accent either in its management style or its product range. Perhaps more interestingly, Mitsubishi Corporation's acquisition of Princes in January 1989 was not the bellwether for a flock of similar Japanese purchases. When Nestle sold Princes to Mitsubishi in January 1989, the transaction was widely hailed as one of the first Japanese acquisitions in the European food industry. What is remarkable more than two years later is that it has remained a singular event; there has been no comparable deal since then. The reasons remain hard to fathom, although all takeover activity has waned in the European food market since then. Mr Jim Grover of OC&amp;C Strategy Consultants, London-based food and drink specialists, suggests Japanese buyers are very brand-conscious but have been inhibited by high asking prices. Mitsubishi was Princes' third owner in less than a year. Buitoni, the Italian pasta manufacturer, had bought Princes from J Bibby &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural group, in the 1970s, to marry authentic foreign food in a fast-growing sector with traditional, but mature, British products. But the Buitoni family sold out to Mr Carlo De Benedetti in 1984. When he could not generate enough growth out of the business, he sold it to Nestle of Switzerland in 1988. When Nestle unpacked its shopping basket after the deal, it decided that Princes' collection of tinned products, even though it carried one of the largest grocery brands in Britain, really was not worth shelf space in its pantry. The emergence of Mitsubishi as the ultimate buyer raised belief in itself at Princes, according to Mr Stephen Clegg, marketing director. 'Mitsubishi bought Princes not because it was part of a package but because they really wanted it.' Princes already did business with Mitsubishi in a small way; the Japanese company's tuna-canning plant in Mauritius was one of its suppliers. A coincidence, Mr Clegg said. Two years on, Princes retains considerable operating autonomy within the group. There is little hands-on involvement from the parent company. Princes' board has only one Japanese member, Mr Tak Akiyoshi, co-ordinating director, who handles communications between Liverpool and Tokyo. Princes, which has only one employee based outside the UK, does tap into Mitsubishi's global network for weather forecasts, help on commodity trading and information on product sourcing. However, it retains full responsibility for all decisions, including quality control, says Mr Clegg. Quality control and security of supply are central to the success of Princes, whose modus operandi would be recognisable to its founders, a Mr Simpson and a Mr Roberts, who began to import tinned salmon and lobster from Canada in 1880. With expected turnover of more than Pounds 200m this year, Princes is still overwhelmingly an importer of canned goods. Its only UK-manufactured products are meat and fish spreads and pasta sauces, made in Southport. Together they account for only 4 per cent of turnover by volume and 6 per cent by value. 'Our strength is our sourcing,' says Mr Clegg. 'Unless you're able to source from a wide variety of locations, you can be caught out.' It now buys products from 40 countries and works closely with suppliers to improve their standards. Crab meat, for example, used to be imported from North America. But costs rose so much that Princes had to shift to Thailand, where it persuaded suppliers to wrap the crab meat in parchment within the tins to prevent discoloration. Similarly, as South African fruit became less politically acceptable, Princes turned to Greece for its tinned peaches. It found, however, that quality often failed to come up to scratch, so it worked with five canners to improve the selection of fruit and the printing and affixing of labels. The need to ensure that its tuna is caught in a 'dolphin-friendly' manner, without the use of high seas drift nets, made Princes impose tough standards on all canneries it uses around the world. None can handle drift-netted tuna at any time if it wants to keep Princes' business. Some of Princes' leading suppliers do not need any external pressure to reach or maintain standards. The Dutch company Van der Laan makes its canned meats, a market in which Princes is the UK brand leader even though it entered it only in 1982, and Saeby Fiske in Denmark supplies mackerel and herring. New products are critical for growth because so many of Princes' old favourites are in mature or declining sectors. UK demand for fish and meat pastes, for example, has halved in the past 10 years, and neither Princes nor its rivals is committing much effort to reversing the trend or fighting for market share. 'One of the characteristics of this market is inertia,' comments Mr Clegg. 'I hesitate to call it loyalty.' Princes is focusing on creating new segments and niches in growth markets. Tiny pots of fishpaste may be out of favour, but Princes has launched chilled spreads and slicing sausages. It is becoming difficult, moreover, to find Princes herring or mackerel that has not been adorned with an 'added value' sauce. The old-established Trex brand of vegetable shortening has been opened as an umbrella over a new International Collection* of exotic oils like pistachio and toasted sesame. The latter, again by coincidence, is supplied by Mitsubishi. The exit from Buitoni left Princes with a gap in its portfolio because retailers had come to identify it with a range of authentic Italian food. It now imports pasta made by Federici, a century-old family-owned company in Umbria, and makes sauces under the Federici name in Southport. It might seem that another entrant is the last thing needed in a pasta sauces market fiercely contested by industry giants such as Unilever (Ragu), Mars (Dolmio) and Nestle (Buitoni) and private label producers. But Mr Clegg sees a role for Federici's pasta-and-sauces package among more timid shoppers: 'Less assured consumers have a desire for authenticity.' There is no doubt, in any case, that Mitsubishi got the real thing, in terms of a solid and growing UK grocery brand, when it acquired Princes. And it made clear from the beginning that it would back the right European deals with deep pockets. Mr Clegg is unperturbed by the lack of action since then, knowing his Japanese parent is playing a patient hand but will not hesitate when the time comes. Mitsubishi has a saying: 'If it's worth doing, it's worth doing today.' The European food industry should keep its eyes peeled for that signal. *Management Page, FT, March 14 1991.</p>

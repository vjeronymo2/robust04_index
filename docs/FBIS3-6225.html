"We were relieved when the inspections finally took place,  so  we can't but feel concern over the current situation," Hata told  a press conference after a cabinet meeting.    Hata was referring to reports that the IAEA inspectors were  barred from certain activities in inspecting North Korea's  nuclear facilities.    On Monday, an IAEA source said the North Koreans placed some  restrictions on the activities of the seven-member team, though  the agency's spokesman declined to comment on the details of the  inspection.    Also, in Monday's edition of the CHUNGANG ILBO, a major  South  Korean newspaper, an unidentified government official was quoted  as saying the team was barred from removing samples of nuclear  materials from one facility for laboratory tests.    If such restrictions took place, or if it is confirmed that  nuclear materials have been diverted for military purposes, the  IAEA will convene a special meeting to consider referring the  matter to the U.N. Security Council for further action.    An IAEA spokesman said a decision on whether such a meeting  is called could be made within this week, depending on the  content of the inspection team's report.    The spokesman said the IAEA team had concluded its schedule  of inspections of North Korea's seven declared nuclear  facilities.    The IAEA inspections, which began March 3, were the first  allowed by North Korea in about a year.    The team is scheduled to depart for Vienna via Beijing on  Tuesday.</p>

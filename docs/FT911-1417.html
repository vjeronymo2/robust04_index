			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family: Management shake-up at Budgens Institutional shareholders last week forced a shake-up in the management of Budgens, the supermarket chain. A meeting called by institutions - including IEP Securities, Electra and Gartmore - holding 27 per cent of Budgens' shares decided the terms on which John Fletcher should leave as chairman of the company. The shareholders said they were forced into the action by Budgens' extremely poor track record. Its share price has dropped from 252p in 1987 to only 41p by Thursday's close, and the company did not pay an interim dividend in February this year.</p>

			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Polish copper deal signed UNIONS AT KGHM, Poland's copper producing combine yesterday signed a wage agreement granting an increase of nearly 30 per cent from the beginning of next month. The deal, which follows of a five-week strike in the summer, grants the unions most of their demands. The stoppage was suspended in August to give the authorities time to modify wage control legislation and wage controls have now been eased for exporters. Mr Andrzej Machalski, a member of the KGHM board, said yesterday that the combine, which employs nearly 40,000 people, could not be modernised without foreign capital. He added, however, that talks with foreign investors could not start until next year, when the combine will have been restructured. Mr Machalski confirmed that the Western Mining Corporation of Australia had offered to invest USDollars 500m in the enterprise. Asarco, the US metals producer has also offered to manage the company for three years before making a capital investment offer.</p>

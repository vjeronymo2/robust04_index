			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 25 (KNS-KCNA) -- Chief vice-chairman of  the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of  Korean Residents in Japan (Chongnyon), Ho Chong-man, called an  emergency press conference in Tokyo on April 25 regarding the  forcible search of the Osaka Prefectural headquarters and  branches of Chongnyon by the Japanese police, at which he read  out a statement in the name of the Chongnyon Central Standing  Committee.    The statment said:    At about 07:20 on April 25, the Osaka Prefectural police  brought 56 mobile cars with more than 1,300 policemen to the  prefectural headquarters of Chongnyon and made a forcible search  of the headquarters' hall after creating an atmosphere of terror  around the headquarters.    On the other hand, the Osaka Prefectural police forced the  same search at branches of the Osaka Prefectural headquarters of  Chongnyon.    The massive crackdown on the headquarters and branches of  Chongnyon were the first of their kind in 39 years after the  formation of Chongnyon. This shows how openly the Japanese  authorities are suppressing Chongnyon.    Drawing attention to the fact that the Japanese reactionary  authorities got more frantic in suppressing Chongnyon when  nuclear row against the DPRK was being intensified, the  statement said:    The Japanese Government must renounce at once its hostile  policy towards the DPRK and repressive policy against the Korean  residents in Japan. We demand that the Japanese Government and  police stop immediately their unjustifiable suppression of  Chongnyon and apologize for it.    We regard the illegal crackdown this time as a grave  provocation against the Korean people.    On the same day, O Hyong-chin, vice-chairman of Chongnyon  and  chairman of its Osaka Prefectural headquarters, called a press  conference and denounced the crackdown by the Japanese police.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Swan Hunter loses Pounds 50m order from Oman to French shipyard PROSPECTS for Swan Hunter, the struggling Tyneside warship builder, have suffered a further blow with the loss of a crucial Omani order to French competition. The Cherbourg shipyard, Constructions Mecaniques de Normandie, said it signed a firm contract yesterday to build three large patrol craft for Oman's navy. The contract, worth about Pounds 50m, is expected to lead to orders for up to five more vessels of the same type. CMN also disclosed that it is among the companies which have expressed a tentative interest in buying Swan Hunter. The Tyneside shipyard, in receivership since May, was counting on winning the Omani order to enhance its attractiveness to potential buyers. It now has no shipbuilding orders on its books beyond the completion of work on three Type 23 frigates for the Royal Navy. Failure to win the Omani order has set back hopes of selling the company as a shipbuilder. Union officials said it was likely to cost 100 more jobs from a workforce of 1,700, already cut by 700 since May. Joint receiver, Mr Gordon Horsfield of Price Waterhouse, said the news was 'obviously a disappointment' although not unexpected. He indicated that Swan Hunter was unlikely to win orders of this type until a buyer was found for the yard. Mr Alastair Balls, chief executive of Tyne and Wear Development Corporation, said he feared the lost order would have a 'domino effect'. CMN, which employs 500 people, is the sole shipbuilding interest of Soffia, a French-owned construction group. Mr Pierre Belmer, CMN spokesman, said the company had secured orders for a number of vessels in recent months. CMN had spare capacity in Cherbourg, but had an expansion-minded management. Mr Belmer said CMN would be in a position to take a decision on Swan Hunter at the start of 1994, although any deal would be for part of Swan Hunter, not for the company at its present size.</p>

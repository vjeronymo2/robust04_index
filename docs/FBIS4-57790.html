			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Manuel Alvarez Cedeno] </F>   [Text] Cecilia Alegre, Panamanian member of the Canal  Commission, has described as positive the recommendations made  by President Bill Clinton establishing a series of changes to  the law that regulates the canal in order to permit its orderly  transfer to Panama on 31 December 1999. Clinton sent to the  U.S. Congress a series of recommendations on the Canal  Commission legislation, including one on tolls.    Alegre said the initiatives are positive because most of  them  include the majority of the recommendations made by the Canal  Commission's Board of Directors to the U.S. Administration a few  months ago. "I would say that, in general, they are positive  because they change the Commission to meet the needs of the  canal traffic, making it more flexible for maritime commerce  demands, giving the board more power to make needed changes, and  better preparing the Commission for the transition," she added.    The Canal Commission is a U.S. federal agency whose board of  directors is made up of five North Americans and four  Panamanians. According to the 1977 Torrijos-Carter Treaties, the  canal will be totally in Panamanian hands on 31 December 1999.    Alegre said the Canal Commission presented its  recommendations to Leon Panetta, director of the U.S. Office of  Management and Budget. The majority of Clinton's recommendations  "agree with ours," Alegre reiterated.    Clinton recommended that the process to establish tolls be  carried out by the Canal Commission, not the U.S. president.</p>

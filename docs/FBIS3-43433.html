			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Yaounde, 7 Jan (AFP) -- The occupation of two  Cameroonian islands in the Gulf of Guinea by Nigerian troops is  considered by Cameroon "for the moment, as going beyond the  boundary limits and not as a hostile gesture," sources close to  the government disclosed today in Yaounde.    According to evidence emanating from Southwest Province, the  occupation since 3 January of the two islands by 500 Nigerian  troops reportedly followed an incident in that region between  Cameroonian gendarmes and Nigerian fishermen.    Well-informed sources reported that there were Cameroonian  troop movements toward Diamant and Jabane islands while two  vessels of the Cameroonian Navy patrolled the area.    Without creating undue sensation about the incident,  Cameroon  has taken the situation seriously, according to sources close to  the government. However, the Cameroonian authorities had still  not reacted officially to the occupation of the two islands by  this morning.    The arrival in Yaounde on the afternoon of 6 January of  Nigerian Foreign Affairs Minister Babagana Kingibe and Commerce  Minister Melford Okilo has also not been officially announced.  The two Nigerian officials are scheduled to be received by  President Paul Biya.</p>

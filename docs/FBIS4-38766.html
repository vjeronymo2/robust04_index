			<p>BFN     [Text] The principle of Ukraine's staying outside any  military blocks laid down in its military doctrine adopted last  year is in need of reconsideration, Ukrainian Defense Minister  Vitaliy Radetskyy told a news conference in Kiev Wednesday. He  pointed out that "today no state can defend itself on its own."    Radetskyy's news conference was devoted to the results of  his  visit to NATO headquarters from May 25 to 27. During his visit,  Radetskyy submitted a presentation document on Ukraine joining  the Partnership for Peace program to NATO. Ukraine joined the  program in February 1994 when Ukrainian Foreign Minister  Anatoliy Zlenko signed a framework agreement with NATO.    Commenting on the situation in Crimea, Radetskyy said that  the Ukrainian Defense Ministry had "sent not a single soldier to  Crimea recently." He said that the bulk of military hardware  which had been delivered in the recent past to Crimea belonged  to the Black Sea Fleet.    Radetskyy criticized Crimean President Yuriy Meshkov's  personnel policy, saying that 80 percent of his surroundings  were former Ukrainian servicemen citing as an example Interior  Minister Valeriy Kuznetsov and Security Service Chairman  Vladimir Lepikhov.    Radetskyy declined to comment on Ukraine's position at the  talks on dividing up the Black Sea Fleet infrastructure, saying  these complicated issues were being discussed by Russian and  Ukrainian delegations in Sevastopol. At the same time, he  pointed out that the division of vessels had been completed.    According to Radetskyy, the Russian part of the Black Sea  Fleet will be stationed on the Ukrainian territory as fleet of a  foreign state.</p>

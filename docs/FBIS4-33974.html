			<p>BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 10 Jun (NOTIMEX) -- Cuba's ambassador  to Mexico Abelardo Curbelo has said that the visit Mexican  President Carlos Salinas de Gortari will make to Cuba Monday "is  an expression of a political nature."    In an interview with NOTIMEX, the diplomat did not rule out  the possibility of some cooperation agreement, which may include  the oil sector, being signed as part of the Mexican president's  activities during his six-hour visit to the island.    The diplomat said: "The essence of (Salinas') meeting with  Fidel Castro is to increase the ties of friendship that exist  between the two countries in all fields."    Curbelo added: "This minisummit is an expression of a  political, not economic nature, but I will not deny that some  kind of cooperation agreements, such as the one Mexpetrol  negotiated with Cuban firms to send Mexican crude oil to the  Cuban refinery, could be signed."    Curbelo explained that the negotiations process between a  Cuban firm and Mexpetrol, a subsidiary of Mexican Petroleum, was  reached between the two enterprises, without government  participation.    The diplomat said Cuba and Mexico are continuing  negotiations  in sectors such as telephone, tourism, and others "about which  we prefer not to talk and which we keep quiet about in order not  to obstruct them."    Curbelo said the Cuban Government permits the participation  of foreign capital -- from Mexico as well as from other  countries -- and agreements do not depend on the presidential  visit or official events because the agreements are among  enterprises themselves.    The ambassador noted: This is why the signing of agreements  do not depend on a deadline or a meeting. If we find that an  agreement can be signed Monday, however, it will be done in a  symbolic way.    Curbelo explained that Cuba is seeking oil agreements with  various nations to stabilize oil supplies "based on market  conditions and not on preferential price treatment, which is not  our objective right now."    He said plans for securing stable oil supplies must be based  on the Cuban economy's capacity and efficiency within the  framework of world market conditions. "These are our  objectives," he said.    If preferential prices are granted, he explained, this will  depend on the other countries, on the possibility of them buying  Cuban products, and on Cuba's export capabilities.    President Salinas will visit Cuba Monday. He will stay there  six hours and review the bilateral agenda and issues of common  interest with Fidel Castro.    President Salinas will attend a dinner hosted by Castro, and  later he will travel to Colombia where he will participate in  the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, which will be attended by the  presidents or heads of state of Spain, Portugal, and 21 Latin  American countries.</p>

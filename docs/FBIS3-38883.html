With these words Chancellor Helmut Kohl commented on  the recession at the forum "Safeguarding Germany as a Business  and Investment Location," organized by Economics Minister  Guenther Rexrodt in Bonn. The majority of the structural  problems that we have to settle today have "nothing whatsoever"  to do with German unity. In the next tax reform, clear priority  must be given to families with children. Safeguarding Germany's  attractiveness as a business location includes improving the  climate for progress and technology, Kohl pointed out. The  chancellor sees reason for "realistic optimism." Rexrodt  stressed that the inflexibility that is currently prevailing  might ultimately mean the end. [as published]</p>

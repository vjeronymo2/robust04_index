			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Militia Colonel V. Chernyshev, Ukrainian </F> deputy minister of internal affairs and chief of the Main  Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea, by Oleg  Mashchenko; place and date not given: "My Militias Will Keep Me  Safe?"]    [Text] The proverb about too many cooks spoiling the broth  is well known. We have not reached this number of law  enforcement organs yet; for now there are just two of them.  However, a common citizen may easily get a black eye on a dark  street (or even a well-lit one).    Services that are called upon to protect our peace and quiet  have ended up dragged into the "tug-of-war" between Simferopol  and Kiev against their will. The position of the Crimean  authorities with regard to the edicts of L. Kravchuk has been  repeatedly covered in the mass media organs.    We suggest that the readers familiarize themselves with the  opinion of Militia Colonel V. Chernyshev, Ukrainian deputy  minister of internal affairs and chief of the Main  Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea.    [Mashchenko] Apparently, it would be legitimate to first  learn some more detailed information about you personally.    [Chernyshev] I, for one, am a native of Crimea. I was born  and grew up here. I am an ethnic Russian. During the 22 years  that I have served in the internal affairs organs, I have worked  for 14 years on our native peninsula, in Bakhchisarayskiy and  Belogorskiy Rayon departments, in various operational and  command positions, including as chief of the rayon militia. In  recent years, I have served as deputy chief of the department of  Administration of Criminal Investigations and as first deputy  chief of the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs [MVD] Main  Administration of Criminal Search.    [Mashchenko] With a view to filtering out all manner of  rumors and fantasies associated with the reorganization of the  MVD of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, I would ask you to  explain to the readers what the basis for the decisions in  question was.    [Chernyshev] I would like to note right away that not a  single violation of the legislative acts in effect in both the  Republic of Crimea and Ukraine was allowed to occur in the  process of creating the Main Administration of Internal Affairs  in the Crimea. If we turn to specific documents then, on the  basis of Article 114-5, Point 7 of the Constitution of Ukraine,  the president of the state is entitled to establish, reorganize,  and liquidate ministries, departments, and other organs of state  executive power in the territory of Ukraine. This is precisely  why a reorganization, rather than the breakup of the MVD as  certain politicians paint it; the Main Administration of  Internal Affairs is a prerogative of the president of Ukraine.  The edict of L. Kravchuk dated 18 May of this year is an  absolutely lawful document.    The crime situation that has remained extremely tense in the  Republic of Crimea in recent years was the foundation for this  step. Everybody is still talking about quite a number of bloody  crimes committed here with the use of automatic weapons. The  fact that some subunits, such as the waterway and railway  militia that performed their official duties directly on the  territory of the autonomous republic were actually managed from  Kiev and other cities of Ukraine rather than by the Crimea MVD  played quite a role in the reorganization of the Crimea MVD. The  efforts of absolutely all Crimea law enforcement organs will now  be coordinated by the Crimea Main Administration of Internal  Affairs. The management of the militia will be in the strictest  compliance with the letter of the law in view of the fact that  previously the organs of internal affairs, obeying "pointers  from on high," on occasion had to perform functions that are not  characteristic of them. At the same time, the confirmation of  Reserve Major General V. Kuznetsov in the nonexistent position  of minister of internal affairs was conducted in gross violation  of legislative acts currently in effect. According to Article 7  of the Ukrainian Law on the Militia and Point 8 of the  Regulations on the Republic of Crimea MVD, such an action must  mandatorily be coordinated with the Ukrainian minister of  foreign affairs.    [Mashchenko] Valeriy Serafimovich, how can you as a  professional characterize the actions of Major General V.  Kuznetsov in the course of leading the internal affairs organs  on the peninsula?    [Chernyshev] Mr. Kuznetsov is certainly a strong-willed,  decisive person. This is not just my personal opinion but also  that of the leadership of the Ukrainian MVD. However, we should  note in particular that top-notch specialists who have an  excellent knowledge of their jobs have been valued the most at  all times and in all positions, to say nothing of leadership  positions. Reserve Major General V. Kuznetsov does not have the  special training that is necessary even for the rank-and-file  employees of the internal affairs organs. He is not a lawyer; it  is hard for him to make the only correct, legitimate decisions  commensurate with the existing situation without any experience  in work in the law enforcement organs and without the knowledge  of legal legislation. This is not his personal fault.  Undoubtedly, the militia must not be politicized. Incompetence  brings about, putting it mildly, ill-conceived steps. Let us  look, say, at the directive of General Kuznetsov dated 21 May on  arming the personnel of the reorganized ministry and the  internal affairs organs of the Crimea with automatic weapons and  issuing bulletproof vests to personnel. Later followed the  command to capture the unarmed servicemen of the Ukrainian  National Guard who were on patrol in the vicinity of the TV and  radio center in Simferopol, provide reinforced guard details for  the buildings of the Supreme Soviet of the Crimea, banks,  executive committees, and other important facilities. Unverified  (?), simply put false information was the basis for making this  crucial decision. It is easy to guess what the consequences of  the actions of "Berkut" combatants, armed with assault rifles in  the downtown of the main city of the Crimea, could have been.    Irreparable events did not occur due only to the  self-control of the militia personnel and servicemen of the  National Guard of Ukraine. I would like to stress the need to be  aware of the fact that the control of armed law enforcement  units that continuously operate among the civilian population  and accomplish the tasks of protecting public order and  combating crime differs fundamentally from the rigid nature of  commanding the troops whose most significant mission is to  engage in combat.    [Mashchenko] As an official, you must trust only the facts.  Nonetheless, allow me to ask you a question that derives from  rumors. They are talking about the alleged discontinuation of  funding for the internal affairs organs of the Republic of  Crimea, the forthcoming reshuffle of the cadres, and cutbacks in  positions. What is the actual situation?    [Chernyshev] I can state with the full weight of  responsibility that these are instigative lies. The receipt of  monetary funds from the Ukrainian MVD has not ceased. The  account of the Crimea Main Administration of Internal Affairs  has already been opened; the administration is being funded in  amounts sufficient for ensuring its regular operations. This  means that the payment of monetary allowances and other  allotments to the personnel of the Crimean militia will be made  in full, just as before.    No unsubstantiated replacements of any kind will be made in  the cadre staff. I will personally prevent any reprisals against  functionaries fantasies on whose account currently interfere  with their regular work.    The objective of individuals who spread such disinformation  is as clear as can be: to create an unhealthy, nervous situation  within the ranks of the internal affairs organs. They are trying  to set personnel against lawful decisions of the Ukrainian  president, the Cabinet of Ministers, and the Ukrainian minister  of internal affairs. A decision on these issues has also been  made by the Ukrainian Collegium of the MVD. It says  unambiguously that the staff positions of the reorganized  Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Crimea will be  kept in full within the structure of the Crimea Main  Administration of Internal Affairs. The ranks and volume of  position pay for our personnel will remain the same.    Only the positions of minister and deputy ministers of  internal affairs are not envisioned on the staff of the Main  Administration of Internal Affairs in the Crimea. Just as  before, social protection guarantees envisioned by legislation  in effect cover all personnel.    In summary, I would like to address all personnel of the  internal affairs organs and residents of the Republic of Crimea,  taking advantage of the present opportunity. I understand full  well the complexity of the situation in which you are finding  yourselves when they are trying to hold the militia hostage to  someone else's political ambitions and confront it with the  unnecessary choice of "who to obey?" Everything possible should  be done in order to prevent the law enforcement organs from  getting involved in political games; just as before, it is  necessary for these organs to remain calm and restrained.    At present, our main task is to make a deliberate, offensive  effort to step up the fight against crime, and to uncover and  put the harshest end to the activities of organized groups of  malefactors. Our citizens and the guests of the beautiful land  of the Crimea should be confident of their security, which the  militia must guarantee for them. I would like to ask my  comrades-in-arms to remain faithful to your oath and the  tradition of the internal affairs organs.</p>

			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: A risky strategy and threat to Japanese partnerships (2) Sir, British Aerospace may well be crowing at the sale of Rover to BMW. Corporate Britain, however, should be far more apprehensive. Corporate Japan views its long-term corporate partnership arrangements very, very seriously and Honda has surely honoured its part in the resuscitation of Rover from a basket-case to where it stands today. It may therefore be a long time before any other corporate giant in Japan signs a similar, so-called long-term partnership agreement with any other flagship of British industry.

			<p><P> December 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOWL OFFICIAL MAKES IT OFFICIAL: GOTTFRIED FIRED AS COACH AT PITT  </P> <P> It took an official of the John Hancock Bowl to confirm the firing of Mike  Gottfried as University of Pittsburgh football coach Friday.  </P> <P> "This is the first time we've had a team coming but no coach," said John  Folmer, chairman of the team selection committee for the bowl, which will match  No. 23-ranked Pitt against Texas A&amp;M on Dec. 30. "I think a great deal of  (Gottfried), and I'm disappointed the people of El Paso won't get to meet him.  But (Pitt officials) told us (the team) will be there, and life goes on."  </P> <P> Although Pitt officials again refused to confirm Gottfried's firing, the coach  was told Thursday by Athletic Director Ed Bozik that he could either resign and  accept a buyout on his five-year roll-over contract or be fired.  </P> <P> Gottfried, who did not have a losing record in four seasons with the Panthers  but had feuded with Bozik over academic matters, refused to quit and abruptly  ended the meeting.  </P> <P> After the meeting, Folmer was told that Gottfried would not coach the Panthers  in the bowl game.  </P> <P> Assistant Athletic Director Larry Eldridge said a news conference clarifying  Gottfried's status could be held today or Sunday.  </P> <P> Pitt has not said whether any of Gottfried's assistants, including offensive  coordinator Paul Hackett, would be considered as a replacement.  </P> <P> Gottfried's departure came on the same day Pitt announced it would adopt  academic guidelines stronger than those called for under Proposition 48. Pitt  will require prospective student-athletes to have a 2.3 grade-point average and  a minimum 750 Scholastic Aptitude Test score. The NCAA requires a 2.0 average  and a 700 score.  </P></p>

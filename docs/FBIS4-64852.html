			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "White Paper </F> Must Be `At the Centre of Discussions' at Corfu Summit --  Delors"]    [Excerpt] The European Commission is expecting the Corfu  Summit of 24 and 25 June to be a frank and serious exercice  under Article 1093 of the Maastricht Treaty, by which the EU  Member States consider their economic policy as a question of  common interest and coordinate these policies between them. The  time has come to launch "true coordination of macroeconomic  policies" which does not yet exist. This is what President  Delors told Parliament in his statement on the forthcoming  European Summit. He added that it will be necessary, in Corfu,  to "keep the white paper at the centre of discussions and  economic and social debates." Public opinion would not  understand if the Summit did not adopt a concrete programme to  be implemented immediately and financed by the major networks,  said President Delors who said he hoped there would be an end to  the "ridiculous polemic on the question of knowing whether the  Community may or may not borrow, as if this was the first time  it had borrowed." The group chaired by Mr. Christophersen must  reach a conclusion, and there must be an annexed document in  Corfu with a list of concrete projects, added Mr. Delors. He  pointed out that the report of the other group set up in the  context of the white paper, the Bangemann Group is "almost  ready." Employment must remain the white paper's top priority,  stressed Mr. Delors, and the Commission should propose new  initiatives, not only in Corfu but also at the December summit  meeting in Essen and after.

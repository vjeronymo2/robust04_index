			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Sebastiano Messina: "Berlusconi's `Mentor' </F> Spadolini"]    [Excerpts] Rome -- It is true, [Forza Italia leader]  Berlusconi is, as a matter of fact, thinking of a "guarantor"  who would dispel any suspicions that he may mix his private  interests with his official duties -- and it is precisely  [former Senate Speaker] Giovanni Spadolini's name that he has in  mind. The leaks published by LA REPUBBLICA about the long  conversation at the Quirinale [president's palace] between the  head of state and the man who by now is regarded as his nominee  for the premiership were confirmed yesterday evening by  Berlusconi spokesman Antonio Tajani.    A few lines, whose meaning is very clear: "Forza Italia  Chairman Silvio Berlusconi is currently exploring a number of  solutions to the question of guarantees, on the assumption that  he might be entrusted with the task of forming the new  government. One such possibility is that of an impartial  guarantor. If we think in terms of a figure above suspicion and  offering the guarantees of objectivity, independence, and  honesty, we can only think of men of Giovanni Spadolini's  stature."    A guarantor is therefore part of the Knight's [Berlusconi  nickname] plans. But what real powers will he have? Ever since  Silvio Berlusconi left [President] Oscar Luigi Scalfaro's study,  promising Italians that, together with a list of ministers, he  will also bring his "guarantee formula" to the Quirinale, the  guarantor dilemma has become the real knot of the crisis. This,  even more than the Viminale [Interior Ministry] and even more  than federalism, is the last hurdle between the Knight and the  Palazzo Chigi [government seat], the last formality before being  crowned "premier" of the second republic. [Passage omitted]    The opposition, that is to say, the alignment that raised  the  problem of guarantees, smells a rat. "This guarantor story  looks very much like a piece of mockery, an attempt to hoodwink  Italians," [Segni Pact] Mariotto Segni remarked. Speaking on  behalf of the Greens, [Greens' Coordinator] Carlo Ripa di Meana  went as far as referring to a swindle: "Recently we have had our  share of pasteboard guarantors, and of constantly infringed  rules and practices. Now the idea of a superguarantor (whether  Spadolini or someone else makes no difference), whose legal  nature and authority are unclear, smacks of an attempt to betray  the citizens' trust." "It is a lot of hot air, an absurd formula  which makes no sense at all," PPI [Italian Popular Party] member  Saverio D'Amelio said.    Not even the League seemed very enthusiastic about the  possibility of a guarantor: "We would like to know what powers  such a guarantor would have," Francesco Speroni, the League's  floor leader in the Senate, warned, adding: "The real checks  will be political in nature, because Berlusconi is not going to  be Il Duce [Mussolini], only the prime minister. Of course, if  we ever have a government full of Fininvest men, the day they  constitute a majority and pass a decree-law for immediate  execution, then the problem will arise...."</p>

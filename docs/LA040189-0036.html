			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> L.A. COUNCIL ENDORSEMENTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles is a big city with big problems. Dirty air, clogged traffic, rapid  development, murderous gangs, not enough cops, overflowing landfills,  inadequate sewers and a housing squeeze are among the city's most pressing  concerns.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council must choose among competing needs. The best  members consider not only their own districts but the needs of the whole city.  Because of their experience -- and in one race the lack of strong challengers  -- we endorse the eight incumbents on the April 11 primary ballot.  </P> <P> In the 3rd District -- which covers the West San Fernando Valley -- Joy Picus,  58, a three-term veteran, deserves high marks for pushing through an ordinance  banning discrimination against women, minorities and Jews at private clubs.  Picus is knowledgeable about toxic wastes, the environment and personnel  matters.  </P> <P> In the 5th District -- which covers much of West Los Angeles and Sherman Oaks  -- Zev Yaroslavsky, 40, a four-term veteran, has worked to expand the Police  Department and has been active in planning issues. His vigorous leadership is  needed on the council.  </P> <P> In the 7th District -- which covers the Northeast San Fernando Valley -- Ernani  Bernardi, 77, spends public money as if it were his own. He challenges any hint  of exorbitance or waste and makes do with a smaller staff, a smaller car and a  more modest office than his colleagues. He faces two attractive challengers --  Lyle Hall, a veteran firefighter, union leader and lobbyist from Reseda who  outlines a strong vision for the district, and Jules Bagneris III, a bright  young minister from Lake View Terrace who offers forthright strategies for  crime prevention, jobs creation and housing stimulation. But, Bernardi, the  conscience of the council when it comes to spending, deserves another term.  </P> <P> In the 9th District -- which covers downtown, Little Tokyo and South Central  Los Angeles -- Gil Lindsay, 88, and a councilman since 1963, is justifiably  proud of the towering downtown skyline, but the gleam has not touched much of  the city's poorest district. Home to stable working-class black communities,  growing Latino neighborhoods and thousands of homeless people, the district  needs jobs, housing, more police and just about everything else. He has no  credible challenger.  </P> <P> In the 13th District -- which covers Hollywood, Silver Lake and Studio City --  Mike Woo, 37, a hard-working, first-term councilman, tempers his vision of a  vibrant Central Hollywood with support for reductions in the massive  redevelopment plan and concerns about runaway traffic. He depends on his  planning background when reconciling the district's growing anti-growth  sentiment with the growing need for more affordable housing and more jobs.  </P> <P> In the 15th District -- which covers San Pedro, the Harbor, Wilmington and  Watts -- Joan Milke Flores, 52, a two-term veteran, pushes for redevelopment in  diverse communities that would be otherwise ignored. She champions a more  even-handed delivery of city services and takes a keen interest in the Housing  Authority.  </P> <P> Two incumbents are unopposed. In the 1st District -- which covers part of the  Eastside, Mount Washington and Pico-Union -- Gloria Molina deserves reelection.  In the 11th District -- which covers the Far Westside, Tarzana and Encino --  Marvin Braude merits another term.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council governs on behalf of at least 3.3 million people  who live within boundaries that encompass 463.7 square miles. We believe  Molina, Picus, Yaroslavsky, Bernardi, Lindsay, Braude, Woo and Flores should be  returned to the council on April 11th.  </P></p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Total Foreign investors who hold 40 per cent of the French Total group may have been irritated by the way it unilaterally increased its share capital by 7 per cent and took cross-shareholdings in three other businesses. Indeed Anglo-Saxon annoyance may have partly accounted for the 2 per cent fall in Total's share price yesterday. But that is how capitalism works in France. In theory, shareholders should have little complaint about the financial and industrial outcome for Total. France's second biggest oil company will receive a net capital injection of FFr2.5bn, which will cut gearing by 7 percentage points to 24 per cent. There will be no dilution of earnings. Total will benefit from the sale of its peripheral uranium interests to Cogema and should reap considerable trading advantages through its link-up with Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez's energy subsidiary. Its stronger balance sheet will permit more aggressive exploration activities, perhaps in the North Sea and Indonesia. By pushing Lasmo's share price up 3p yesterday, the UK market guessed at an alternative route for development. Though the French government has nominally reduced its direct shareholding from 32 per cent to 5 per cent, it still wields considerable indirect influence. Many French companies currently heading for privatisation will doubtless see similar virtues in 'stabilising' their shareholder base, but Total's share price fall is a reminder that, in a global market, such behaviour carries a price.</p>

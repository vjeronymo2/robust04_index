			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / Arts: Today's Television Mondays tend to be disturbing on television - in a deliberate, thought-provoking, thoroughly worthy way. Tonight's double dose of perturbation starts with World in Action (8.30pm ITV). Those who are sceptical about the art of 'psychological profiling' will be intrigued by this encounter with Paul Britton, apparently nicknamed 'Cracker' by his colleagues (after the Robbie Coltrane character, I hasten to add). His role in the trial of Colin Stagg for the murder of Rachel Nickell sparked controversy about the role of this American neo-science. The whole practice comes over as a new and still untried toy open to abuses unless rigorously controlled. Control is desperately needed in the killing of wildlife in Nepal (among other places). In the Wild (9pm ITV) engineers a meeting between Bob Hoskins and the tiger. Regrettably perhaps, Hoskins' chances of survival are considerably healthier than the quadruped's. The programme ranges through the pressures on the big cats and reminds us that species have already become extinct in the past quarter-century.</p>

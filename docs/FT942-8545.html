			<p>940520 FT  20 MAY 94 / Greece acts to spur investment The Greek government yesterday attempted to divert attention from the plight of the drachma, still under pressure following the lifting of capital controls this week, by announcing a new investment incentives law. Mr Yannos Papantoniou, the economy minister, said the law was intended to help larger Greek companies become more competitive in European markets. Greece has had little success in attracting investment either in industry or tourism over the last decade, when total foreign investment amounted to less than Dollars 3bn. The announcement had no impact on financial markets where one-month interest rates remained at around 60 per cent. Dealers said the market was waiting for a comprehensive package of economic measures to tackle the rising public sector deficit, projected at over 17 per cent of gross domestic product this year.</p>

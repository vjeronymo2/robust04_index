			<p>921029 FT  29 OCT 92 / Observer: Bleeding hearts When a letter pleading for funds dropped on the mat last week from Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp, many US Republicans assumed that the self-styled 'bleeding heart conservative' was cutting loose from the sinking Bush ship to launch his own bid for 1996. But the missive turns out to be a carefully disguised gesture of loyalty towards a president who has repeatedly spurned Kemp's efforts to push a more aggressive domestic policy. What it does show is the depth of the Republicans' money troubles - which are further blighting a seemingly hopeless campaign. The Republican finance committee has apparently given up using Bush's name to haul in the loot. While Kemp's letter repeatedly warns how disastrous it would be for the Democrats to win, it mentions Bush just once, and then in the past tense. In the past two months, the normally flush Republicans have seen funds dwindle to a trickle; donors have started to hedge their bets by giving to the Clinton cause. Although the Republicans have raised Dollars 10m more than the Democrats since the beginning of 1991, they are now running so far short of previous totals that campaign managers are still having to schedule fund-raising appearances for Dan Quayle, who ought to be beating the bushes for votes, not money. Of course, if Bush loses, no-one could blame Kemp. . .</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the proposed amendment to the Indiana program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4&blank;Permit Approval or Denial <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Indiana has amended subsection IC 13&hyph;4.1&hyph;4&hyph;3(a) concerning the findings required to be made by the director of the IDNR prior to issuing a permit. New subdivision 3(a)(10) is added to provide as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) if any part of the operation would take place in a floodway (as defined in IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;3), the operation will not: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (A) result in unreasonably detrimental effects upon the fish, wildlife, or botanical resources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (B) adversely affect the efficiency; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (C) unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its submittal of this amendment, Indiana explained that the proposed language quoted above is being added to the Indiana program as a consequence of an amendment to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13. New subdivision 13(e)(3) is added to IC 13&hyph;2&hyph;22&hyph;13 to provide that operations conducted under IC 13&hyph;4.1 (Indiana SMCRA) are exempted from the need for a ``construction in a floodway'' permit issued by the IDNR, Division of Water. Instead, any activity in a floodway which is to be conducted as part of an operation regulated under IC 13&hyph;4.1 must be identified in the permit application to the Division of Reclamation. A determination must then be made by the Division of Reclamation that the environmental standards identified in the proposed language are met. This determination will then become part of the ``Findings Document'' which accompanies each of the Division's final permit recommendations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There is no direct Federal counterpart in SMCRA or the Federal regulations to the proposed amendment. As explained by Indiana in its submittal of this amendment, the purpose of this legislative change is to consolidate and streamline the permit system as well as strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work. Indiana further explained that any disturbance on a mine site is part of a much larger effort already being reviewed by the Division of Reclamation. Further, Indiana asserts that this change allows for a more thorough evaluation of the work when taken in context with the overall plan of operation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Director finds that the proposed amendments are not inconsistent with SMCRA and the Federal regulations. None of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions in the Indiana program. On the contrary, all of the approved provisions of the Indiana program remain in full effect. Further, the proposed provisions are not inconsistent with SMCRA sections 503 concerning State programs, and 505 concerning State laws. Therefore, the Director is approving the amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV. Summary and Disposition of Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federal Agency Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and 3 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various interested Federal agencies. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented on the amendment (Administrative Record Number IND&hyph;1378). The FWS stated that if the review of impacts to ``fish, wildlife, and botanical resources'' continues to be administered by the IDNR's Division of Fish and Wildlife, or other trained fish and wildlife biologists, the FWS assumes that the level of protection of fish and wildlife resources would not be changed from the current situation. As discussed above in the Director's Findings, Indiana explained in its submittal that the proposed amendment should strengthen the technical review of the floodway permit work since the review will become part of a much larger effort already being conducted by the Division of Reclamation. The change, Indiana asserts, will allow for a more thorough evaluation of the construction on a floodway. In his review of this amendment, the Director has concluded that none of the existing Indiana program provisions are rendered less effective by the inclusion of the proposed provisions in the Indiana program. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FWS further stated that the FWS does not anticipate any impacts to Federally endangered/threatened species as a result of the proposed revision. The Director concurs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Public Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public comment period and opportunity to request a public hearing was announced in the May 5, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 23176). The comment period closed on June 6, 1994. No one requested an opportunity to testify at the scheduled public hearing so no hearing was held. No public comments were received in response to this amendment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA;  </P> <P> BIKE LANE FUNDS SOUGHT  </P> <P> Despite some residents' concerns, the city will apply for funds that will  probably lead to the installation of a bicycle lane on 4th Street between San  Vicente and Wilshire boulevards.  </P> <P> With the application deadline near, the City Council directed the city staff to  seek $27,890 in Southern California Assn. of Governments funds to establish the  bike lane. The vote was 5 to 1, with Councilman Herbert Katz voting no.  </P> <P> A few residents of the 4th Street area objected, saying 4th Street has too much  traffic for a bike lane to be safe.  </P></p>

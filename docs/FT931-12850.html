			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Leading Article: Serious fraud A SERIES of recent trials has thrown grave doubt on the ability of the criminal justice system in England and Wales to handle cases of serious fraud. Trials have begun too long after the events to which they relate. Indictments have been excessively complex. Proceedings have stretched to inordinate length and cost millions of pounds before collapsing or ending in acquittals. Fiascos such as last year's Blue Arrow trial - in which all the defendants were eventually acquitted - have raised questions over the competence of juries to hear serious fraud cases. However the fault in such trials has lain more with the prosecution which overloads charge sheets and with judges unable to keep a grip on proceedings. In a report published yesterday, the Bar Council rightly urges the retention of trial by jury for serious fraud as for other serious crimes. Instead, it proposes reforms to streamline fraud trials and make them more manageable. These include efforts to clarify for the jury exactly what is at dispute in a trial. Non-contentious summaries of events might be distributed at intervals to keep jurors informed of how the case is developing. And the trial could be structured to focus closely on points of difference between prosecution and defence, so that the jury knows exactly what they have to decide. These recommendations are sound and since most could be introduced without new legislation, they should be implemented speedily. New legislation would be needed to give effect to the Bar Council's proposal to introduce a more specific offence of simple fraud to replace the catch-all charge of conspiracy to defraud. This would make the nature of charges clearer to jurors by specifying particular acts as fraudulent. It might also encourage more defendants to plead guilty, knowing exactly what they are pleading guilty to; a guilty plea to a conspiracy charge exposes the defendant to unpredictably severe punishment. Such guilty pleas - which save the courts time and money - might be further encouraged by the wider use of plea bargaining in serious fraud cases. While bargaining over charges goes on informally at present, it could be extended to sentencing. It should also be brought into the open as part of court proceedings under the supervision of the judiciary. Finally, the Bar Council suggests that only cases leading to a custodial sentence should be tried in court. Where the likely penalty for a serious fraud offence is a fine, restitution or disbarment, the regulator is better placed to deal with the case. This approach has much to commend it, although regulators would need to be more open in their proceedings to avoid charges that financial fraudsters were treated more leniently than other criminals. The Bar has set out an agenda for reform which has the merit of being simpler and therefore more realistic than other offerings. It should be acted upon.</p>

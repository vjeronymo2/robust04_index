			<p>920604 FT  04 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: The Danish blues The reaction in European markets to Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty was one of predictable alarm. The D-Mark strengthened within the ERM and bond prices in high interest currencies slid sharply. The rationale in both cases is that the swing vote of a few thousand Danes has diverted Europe away from monetary union and back to currency fluctuations and diverging inflation rates. But has it? Part of the answer depends on how far the motivation behind the ERM has been ideological rather than pragmatic. If governments saw the system as a precursor of a currency union ordained by history, it now stands a large chance of breaking down. If, on the other hand, the main justification for ERM membership was a simple desire to fight inflation by linking up with the D-Mark, the markets have less to fear than yesterday's reaction suggests. There will be no immediate crack in the system, inflation will remain under pressure and bond yields can continue to fall. Ironically, Denmark itself, which can actually meet the Maastricht convergence criteria, is almost certainly in the latter camp. So is the UK. Less clear is the position of France. Were its voters also to reject the treaty, the foundations of the ERM would almost certainly crumble, which perhaps explains why the French bond market took such fright yesterday. But as long as Mr Pierre Beregovoy is prime minister, there seems little chance of a let-up in the strong franc policy which has produced France's exemplary inflation record. There is thus a chance that calm will return to European bond markets as they regain their faith in the ERM. But investors in national markets may require a slightly wider premium over German government bonds than in the recent past, The lira, which has been sustained by little else than Italian commitment to monetary union, will remain under pressure. Danish bonds were already recovering from their lows by yesterday lunchtime. Maybe that should tell the gilts market that its fall, which saw the long gilt future drop by over a point, was overdone. Worry that the UK would be unable to attract sufficient inflows to fund the PSBR spilt over into the equity market as well. The UK government's funding problem, however, is one more reason why the UK is unlikely to abandon the ERM now. Indeed, continued pressure on sterling would create an argument for moving promptly to narrow bands - a fitting start to the UK's EC presidency during which the Major government will have to clear up the Maastricht mess.</p>

			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> MCFARLANE: REAGAN ASKED FOR SECRECY;  </P> <P> HID CONTRA FUNDING FROM CONGRESS, HE TESTIFIES AT NORTH TRIAL  </P> <P> Former President Ronald Reagan, approving the solicitation of U.S. allies in  1984 for aid to Nicaragua's Contras, directed that the project be kept secret  from the American public and Congress, former National Security Adviser Robert  C. McFarlane testified Friday.  </P> <P> Otherwise, McFarlane quoted Reagan, "we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in  front of the White House."  </P> <P> Appearing as the prosecution's star witness in the trial of former White House  aide Oliver L. North, McFarlane expressed his own doubts about the legality of  the operation in which he and North took part.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Possible Impeachment  </P> <P> McFarlane disclosed that James A. Baker III, then the White House chief of  staff and now secretary of state, suggested to Reagan that he could be  impeached for allowing the solicitation of allies for aid for the rebels.  </P> <P> But others in Reagan's inner circle -- including then-Vice President George  Bush -- unanimously concluded that Baker was wrong. They said that outside aid  could be sought, despite a congressional prohibition against direct or indirect  U.S. military assistance for Nicaraguan guerrilla forces, McFarlane said.  </P> <P> Wearing an almost perpetual frown and with his jaw thrust forward, McFarlane  emphatically stated in nearly four hours of testimony that Reagan never told  anyone to lie to Congress.  </P> <P> McFarlane, 51, a former presidential aide who pleaded guilty last year to  misleading Congress about White House assistance to the Contras and who was  sentenced a week ago to two years of probation and a $20,000 fine, was the  first witness at North's trial to testify about deliberations at the highest  levels of the Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> McFarlane, near the start of his testimony, which will resume Monday, was asked  by associate independent counsel John W. Keker, North's chief prosecutor:  "After committing these crimes, did you try to commit suicide?"  </P> <P> "Yes," McFarlane said, his face reddening in reference to a drug overdose he  took at home in February, 1987.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Asked About Lying  </P> <P> Later, in asking about Reagan's instructions to his staff, Keker said to  McFarlane: "Did you ever hear Ronald Reagan say: 'We should lie to the Congress  of the United States?' "  </P> <P> "No," McFarlane replied firmly.  </P> <P> "About anything?" Keker pursued.  </P> <P> "No," McFarlane repeated.  </P> <P> The principal charges among 12 felony counts on which North is being tried  accuse the retired Marine lieutenant colonel of giving false statements to  Congress and obstructing congressional inquiries by denying in 1985 and 1986  that he was aiding the Contras with military advice or with money from private  donors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Policy Decision  </P> <P> North's attorneys have said they will show that the former National Security  Council aide, who worked under McFarlane, was instructed by superiors to  conceal his activities from Congress as part of a policy decision.  </P> <P> Elaborating on his brief answers to Keker, McFarlane testified that Reagan  "never said: 'Lie to Congress.' "  </P> <P> Referring to aid solicitations from allies, Reagan "just said: 'Do not share  that information with the Congress,' " McFarlane said, acknowledging that the  House and Senate intelligence committees normally have access to any classified  information in government.  </P> <P> Once the top staff official of the NSC, McFarlane was asked by Keker -- with  the help of documents -- to describe a meeting of the NSC on June 25, 1984.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Baker View  </P> <P> "I recall Mr. Baker believed that if the President were to authorize procuring  money from third countries that that would be a violation of law and the  President could be so charged and impeached . . . removed from office,"  McFarlane testified.  </P> <P> But he said Baker's statement was "strongly countered" by others at the  meeting, including Bush, "and the conclusion was reached that it was not true."  </P> <P> NSC officials feared that if members of Congress learned of third-country  solicitations, they might be reluctant to restore U.S. aid for the Nicaraguan  resistance movement, McFarlane said.  </P> <P> When asked what instructions he had given North and other staff members in  1984, McFarlane said he repeated Reagan's wishes that "we were to do all we  could to keep the Contras alive and functioning until we could win a vote of  the Congress," which eventually came in 1986.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Other Activities  </P> <P> He said he never personally knew of activities to which previous witnesses at  the trial have testified: that North was deeply involved in fund-raising for  the Contras from wealthy U.S. citizens, that North conducted numerous  conferences with Contra leaders to give them military advice and that North  directed a covert weapons-purchasing and resupply effort for the rebel forces.  </P> <P> McFarlane acknowledged receiving reports from North about Contra activities,  but he said he simply assumed that North, like others in the U.S. intelligence  community, had his own information sources. "Perhaps I was derelict in my  duties," he said, asserting that "it didn't occur to me" that North was deeply  involved in operations.  </P> <P> But McFarlane said that on one occasion he asked North to find out the number  of a foreign bank account maintained by the Contras after "the ambassador of a  Middle Eastern country" (identified in 1987 congressional hearings as Saudi  Arabia) volunteered to provide $1 million a month as a good-will gesture to the  Reagan Administration.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Private Meeting  </P> <P> He said that Reagan later had a private White House meeting with "the head of  state of that country" (identified by Congress as King Fahd) and that the  nation increased its donation to $2 million a month. At least $24 million of  that money had flowed to the Contras by mid-1985, McFarlane testified.  </P> <P> In that year, he said, White House officials discussed the possibility of  getting U.S. charities to provide food and medicine for the Contras and Reagan  suggested forming a tax-exempt foundation to collect private money for weapons  and military equipment. McFarlane, in response to a question, noted that Reagan  is not a tax lawyer.  </P></p>

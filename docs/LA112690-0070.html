			<p><P> November 26, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOLIDAY TRAFFIC SNARLED AS STORAGE TANKS FULL OF JET FUEL BURN AT DENVER  AIRPORT;  </P> <P> AVIATION: FACILITY REMAINS OPEN, BUT UNITED AIRLINES IS FORCED TO CURTAIL  FLIGHTS. PALL OF SMOKE DRIFTS INTO THE CITY. HIGHWAYS IN THE VICINITY ARE  JAMMED.  </P> <P> Four storage tanks holding more than 2 million gallons of jet fuel caught fire  Sunday near Stapleton International Airport, snarling comings and goings at the  terminal as holiday travelers headed home after Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> A fire at a holding pond that had collected some of the spilled fuel was  extinguished with foam, but authorities feared it might reignite and spread to  another nearby 2-million-gallon fuel tank.  </P> <P> Firefighters had been trying to cool two 800,000-gallon tanks containing jet  fuel throughout the day, spraying them with strong jets of water, but they  caught fire about 10 p.m.  </P> <P> An attempt to snuff that part of the fire with foam failed.  </P> <P> Three firefighters were treated at Denver General Hospital for dehydration and  heat exhaustion and two others were treated for smoke inhalation at the scene,  but the fire caused no serious injuries.  </P> <P> Smoke from the blaze cast a pall over metropolitan Denver and caused visibility  problems on nearby Interstate 70, which remained open.  </P> <P> Norm Avery, a Stapleton spokesman, said the airport was open, but United  Airlines was forced to delay, cancel and divert flights because of a fuel  shortage.  </P> <P> United Airlines reported flight delays of up to four hours out of Denver,  affecting connecting flights at other major hubs, officials said.  </P> <P> There also were traffic jams outside the airport on one of the its busiest  days, when travelers were returning from the Thanksgiving holiday. Stapleton is  the nation's fourth-busiest U.S. airport as measured by numbers of passengers  traveling through it.  </P> <P> The fire was reported about 9:30 a.m. at the fuel tank farm about a half-mile  north of the Stapleton terminal and just south of I-70.  </P> <P> Also threatened were two tanks about 100 yards from the blaze that held 1.5  million gallons of jet fuel each, said Mike McNeill, a Denver Fire Department  spokesman.  </P> <P> The fire torched nearby utility poles and generated so much heat that  firefighters worked in 30-minute shifts near the flames.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 22, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HAVEL TOURS N.Y. 1ST TIME IN 22 YEARS;  </P> <P> VISIT: CZECHOSLOVAK PRESIDENT'S BREAKNECK PACE SIMILAR TO THAT OF HIS COUNTRY'S  REVOLUTION.  </P> <P> Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel was whirled around Manhattan today at a  pace similar to that of his country's breakneck revolution.  </P> <P> Havel met for breakfast at Gracie Mansion with Mayor David Dinkins and  playwrights Edward Albee, Wendy Wasserstein, Arthur Miller, novelist Kurt  Vonnegut and producer Joseph Papp.  </P> <P> It was Havel's first visit to the Big Apple since he attended the off-Broadway  opening of his play, "Audience," 22 years ago.  </P> <P> "It was the only year I had a passport," said Havel, who went from jail to  become the first non-communist president of Czechoslovakia in more than 40  years.  </P> <P> He told Dinkins that he spent "a wonderful evening" Wednesday on a tour of  Manhattan's East Village pubs with Czechoslovak film director Milos Forman.  </P> <P> "There was the same atmosphere, the same young people and the same music as in  Prague," he said. "There is something international about these kinds of  places."  </P> <P> After breakfast it was off to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where Havel,  followed by an entourage of reporters and Secret Service personnel, made a  quick 45-minute tour.  </P> <P> Havel said he was eager to see paintings by Jackson Pollock, Roy Lichtenstein  and Andy Warhol.  </P> <P> Havel then made stops at the house of Cardinal John O'Connor, and the Helsinki  Watch human rights group to receive two separate awards.  </P> <P> Havel told the audience of more than 100 at Helsinki Watch that he had been  trying for a long time to go to Moscow to discuss human rights.  </P> <P> "Some things have changed. Now I have an invitation from (Soviet President  Mikhail S.) Gorbachev," Havel said. "I will speak with him Monday and if you  want I will greet him for you."  </P> <P> The former dissident playwright, who spent more than five years in jail, looked  amused and surprised by the crowd of journalists who followed him from point to  point.  </P></p>

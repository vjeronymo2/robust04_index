			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Move on disabled employees deferred The government has backed down on plans to make employers contribute up to 50 per cent of the cost of special facilities for disabled employees. The proposal, by Mr David Hunt, the employment secretary, has been deferred for a year after representations from bodies, including the Royal National Institute for the Blind. They had warned that the measures would discourage the employment of disabled people. A revised scheme, called Access to Work, was formally launched yesterday by Mr Hunt. It will fund such measures as adaptations to premises, fares to work and the reader service for blind people. A cap of Pounds 21,000 has been put on the amount of help an individual can be given over five years. The announcement coincided with the publication of a study by the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux which said that tougher measures were needed to protect the growing number of people who faced discrimination at work and when looking for jobs. The bureaux said inadequate legislation, coupled with diminishing job security and a steady stripping away of workers' rights, had given employers increased freedom to act on prejudice, making it harder for some groups, such as disabled people and ethnic minorities, to get work. Ms Ann Clwyd, shadow employment minister, welcomed the government's decision not to introduce what she called a levy on employers.</p>

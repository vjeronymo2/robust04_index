			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Personal View: No case for subsidies to the arts Government sup-port for the arts is now regarded as a normal and desirable element of public expenditure in Britain. Central and local government together now spend Pounds 850m-Pounds 900m a year on the arts and museums: central government expenditure has increased 15-fold, in real terms, since 1950. But there is something odd about the arguments for this expenditure. The Arts Council believes public support is needed to replace institutional patrons and to encourage the development of the arts. But institutional patrons played little part in the development of the arts in Britain from the Reformation in the 16th century until the Arts Council was formed in 1946. As incomes grew, the theatre, music and visual arts - including innovative works - enjoyed the support of audiences and private buyers. The scene was, and is, different on the Continent, where princes had their court theatres and orchestras which passed into the control of governments when the princes lost their powers. Subsidised companies now attract most of the audience on the Continent, but unsubsidised theatres still account for the majority of the audience in Britain. Incomes and educational standards do most to determine demand for the arts. Both have grown faster in Britain in the last 45 years than at any other time; personal incomes are about 2.5 times their level in 1946 and 4.5 times their level a century ago. The demand for the arts today should therefore be much larger than it was in the centuries before 1946, in which the British cultural heritage was created. If the arts could flourish without subsidy then, they can flourish even better today. Subsidy therefore seems unnecessary. It also seems undesirable, because it gives politicians and public servants the opportunity to influence the development of the arts. Decisions about support are supposed to be delegated to the Arts Council, but ministers have recently shown increasing desire to influence funding. And, within the council, decisions are bound to be influenced by current orthodoxies. The audience for all forms of the arts is concentrated among the richer classes in western countries; in Britain, subsidies are concentrated on the richest area, London. Beneficiaries from subsidies to the arts are therefore likely to be richer than the taxpayers who finance the subsidy. This fact may explain why these subsidies are so strongly supported, but also suggests that they are socially inequitable. Although the Arts Council maintains that subsidy allows personal inclination rather than personal income to control access to the arts, subsidies to performing arts seem to have done more to improve quality and choice, and increase costs, than to reduce prices. Subsidies to museums, however, have allowed most British museums to maintain free access, a policy that makes less sense today - especially in London, where more than half the visitors to museums are foreigners. Government policy towards the arts therefore seems misdirected. Increasing the number of people who can enjoy the arts is a justifiable objective: but the best means of achieving this goal is to introduce students to the arts in school, not to dispense subsidies to the suppliers of the arts. Students might also be given vouchers for free or cheap access to plays, concerts and museums as part of the educational process. Direct subsidies from central government to arts companies should therefore be ended, while support to museums should be reduced. Some government subsidy is justifiable for museums, to help them to conserve the cultural heritage for the benefit of future generations and for their role in education, but the performing arts should be healthier if the government is not involved. Any direct subsidies to the performing arts should come from local authorities. If the electorate is prepared to pay the taxes to finance the arts, a referendum, in the Swiss manner, would be the best means of determining its willingness to do so. Voters would presumably foresee benefits from this expenditure. With subsidies from central government ended, there would be no need to retain the Arts Council and the Department of National Heritage. Responsibility for supporting museums and promoting the arts could be returned to the Department for Education. Subsidies to the performing arts could be run down over, perhaps, 10 years so the subsidised companies could adjust - a process that is likely to imply reducing costs and obtaining more charitable donations.

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / Finance and the Family: Builders put up a better showing - The Week Ahead The interim results season for construction and building materials companies starts in earnest on Wednesday when half-year figures are due from housebuilder Persimmon, contractor Mowlem, and Rugby Group, the cement company. Persimmon is expected to have increased first-half profits to about Pounds 14m (Pounds 9.7m), while some analysts reckon Rugby's profits will have grown from Pounds 30.2m to about Pounds 35m. Just as interesting as the figures, though, will be what Persimmon has to say about whether new house sales have started to pick up after a slow start to the summer. Forecasts for Mowlem, which sold its housebuilding operations following a financial reconstruction, vary wildly; some brokers suggest the company has remained in the red in the first half. The consensus view, however, is that it could have made pre-tax profits of about Pounds 4m following a Pounds 41.8m loss in the first six months of 1993. Provident Financial, the personal loan and consumer finance group, will report its interim results on Wednesday. Analysts expect an advance in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1994 to around Pounds 26m-27m, against Pounds 21.9m - an increase of between 18 and 23 per cent. The increase in the interim dividend is expected to be slightly lower, at around 15 per cent, taking it to 5.5p from the 4.75p reported last year. Williams Holdings is expected to announce interim profits of about Pounds 90m on Thursday. With a hefty chunk of business dependent on housebuilding, investors will be looking for signs of some pick-up in underlying trading in both the US and UK. The cashflow question which has plagued the conglomerate is likely to linger, albeit in the background. More importantly, after April's Pounds 267m rights issue, observers will want signs that the new, more conservative strategy of bolt-on acquisitions is working. The upturn in European vehicle sales and signs of recovery in the US automotive industry should lift first-half profits at T&amp;N by about 30 per cent at the motor components and engineering group. Interim pre-tax profits  -due on Thursday - are expected to reach Pounds 51m (Pounds 39.4m) as the group enjoys higher volumes and the benefits of previous re-organisation. Analysts warn, however, that investors will be seeking a 'significant payback' following Pounds 263m of capital spending in the past three years and a 92 per increase in the shares in issue since 1989. Reckitt &amp; Colman, the household products and toiletries group, is expected on Thursday to report a marginal increase in interim pre-tax profits to about Pounds 150m (Pounds 144m). Gains on the disposal of its European Colours business will push FRS 3 pre-tax profits to around Pounds 185m. The interim dividend is expected to rise by 8 per cent to 6.95p a share. Trading conditions in continental Europe and North America have shown next to no improvement since a cautious AGM statement in May pushed the shares down from 634p to a low of 558p in June. They have recovered since, however. Ladbroke, the hotels, DIY and betting group, is expected to announce interim profits before exceptionals of about Pounds 43m on Thursday, against Pounds 62.5m last year. The sharp decline is due almost entirely to the dismal performance from Texas Homecare, the DIY business. Most of the pain was taken at the year-end when the group was forced to re-state the division's profits. But underlying trading is still expected to have fallen further. The dividend is likely to be reduced from 4.92p to 2.5p, in line with the year-end cut. Rolls-Royce, the power generation and aero engines group, is expected to reveal a rise in pre-tax profits from Pounds 32m to between Pounds 39m and Pounds 46m for the first half of 1994 when it reports on Thursday. Also on Thursday, analysts expect Vickers, which makes Rolls-Royce cars and tanks, to have all but doubled pre-tax profits in the first half. Between Pounds 15m and Pounds 18m is anticipated, against last time's Pounds 8.3m. Behind the advance lies a better performance from the cars division, the possibility of good news on the global diesel engines market, and an upturn in the medical equipment division. The City is expecting Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, to turn in pre-tax profits between Pounds 65m and Pounds 73m on Friday for the six months to June 30, sharply up on last time's Pounds 46.3m. The outcome will probably be to the upper end of expectations, but precise forecasting is particularly difficult this time. Unlike last time, acquisitions such as Thames Television and Extel will be included - but not the demerged Royal Doulton and Camco, the oil services group. Schroders, the merchant bank, reports its first-ever interim results on Friday. Growth in mergers and acquisitions business, along with US expansion, should contribute to pre-tax profits of Pounds 100m. The interim dividend could be lifted from 4p to 4.5p.</p>

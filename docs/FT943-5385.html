			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Bank draws up plan to rescue union from financial collapse Bankers are working on plans to save Ucatt, Britain's biggest construction union, from financial collapse. The union, which has a Pounds 1.42m overdraft facility with the Unity Trust Bank, the trade union bank, is in talks on a drastic cost-cutting package that would include staff redundancies and the sale of union offices. Unity Trust Bank, which has been working closely with HW Fisher, Ucatt's accountants, hopes that an agreement resolving Ucatt's financial difficulties can be reached by the end of the month. The union has been finding it increasingly difficult to operate within its overdraft limit. It has been spending more than it can raise in revenue and will continue to do so next year. Ucatt's perilous finances have been causing deep concern throughout the trade union movement and Mr John Monks, general secretary of the Trades Union Congress, has been keeping in close touch with events. Some union officials fear Ucatt's difficulties could raise doubts about the viability of other unions that are struggling to bring costs into line with declining revenues. Yesterday, a senior Unity Trust Bank official said the rescue programme for Ucatt would be ready by the end of September. The union said it was confident it would overcome its financial difficulties. The bank has already ruled out one rescue plan this year because it was not drastic enough. At one point bank officials sought a guarantee from the Transport and General Workers union, which is in merger talks with Ucatt, that it would pay the wages of the construction union officials if necessary. Last year Ucatt suffered a net deficit of Pounds 844,000 against a deficit of Pounds 2.045m in 1992. Its overall spending was Pounds 5.560m but its revenues totalled just Pounds 4.639m. The union's net asset base dropped from Pounds 5.29m in 1986 to only Pounds 417,000 last year. Its investments have fallen from Pounds 3.548m to Pounds 46,000 in the past eight years. Latest estimates suggest only about 60,000 workers are fully paid-up members. Ucatt members are due to vote in a ballot next month on a merger with the TGWU. If they approve the proposal, Ucatt is expected to become a trade group inside the TGWU next January. However, TGWU officials are keen to ensure that Ucatt starts to carry through the rescue plan before then. Last week the TUC general council agreed to suspend Ucatt's Pounds 180,000 annual affiliation fee to the TUC to enable delegates to attend the congress that opens in Blackpool this morning. Ucatt officials said the union could not afford to pay its fee. The union could not take part in the Labour party leadership ballot earlier this year because of its financial difficulties. It is talking to Labour headquarters about a suspension of its affiliation fees for the party. Bankers take a hard look at Ucatt account, Page 8</p>

			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / World Trade News: Bush urges US Hispanic groups to lobby for Nafta PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday urged American Hispanic groups to 'sally forth' to Capitol Hill to lobby for his proposed North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) or risk a failure which would send an 'unconscionable' signal to South America. Mr Bush, who has played a big role in the administration's campaign for the Nafta, praised President Carlos Salinas of Mexico for 'taking that country that we all love and moving it in a direction that we can all admire.' It would be 'a terrible tragedy' if Congress failed to grant him the fast-track trade authority he needed for the negotiations. Fast-track gives the president a freer hand to negotiate an agreement which Congress cannot amend. The president has asked for that authority for the Uruguay Round, the Nafta, and his Enterprise for the Americas trade and debt initiative for Latin America. Mr Bush is expected to win the fast-track fight in the Senate but to have a harder time in the House of Representatives. A poll released yesterday of three-quarters of the House members found half saying they would vote against it.</p>

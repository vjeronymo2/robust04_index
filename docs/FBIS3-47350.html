Masaru Hayami, chairman of the Japan Association of  Corporate  Executives (Keizai Doyukai), made the request when he and other  leaders of his business lobby met with the prime minister over  breakfast, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura said at a  news conference.    Hosokawa told the business leaders that now is the crucial  time in Diet debate on a government-sponsored political reform  package aimed at rooting out corruption in Japanese public life.    Hosokawa has staked his premiership on enactment of the  package before the current Diet session ends on January 29.    The premier reportedly said he wants to make a judgment on  fresh pump-priming measures in line with talks of an economic  panel of the government and ruling coalition parties.</p>

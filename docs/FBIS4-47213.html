			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Vitaliy Voronov, chairman of the Legal </F> Development of Kazakhstan grassroots association and former  chairman of the Committee for Deputy's Powers and Human Rights  of the 12th Supreme Council, by Aygul Omarova; place and date  not given: "I Always Try To Speak My Mind"]    [Text] Vitaliy Ivanovich showed himself to be in the  previous parliament a most active, competent deputy that spoke  in defense of human rights. The Law "On Rehabilitation of the  Victims of Mass Political Repression" and decisions on the  possibility of a change of nationality and on the prohibition  against retirees being dismissed in connection with their having  reached retirement age were drawn up and adopted with his direct  participation.    [Omarova] Vitaliy Ivanovich, three months have elapsed. The  election passions have subsided and cooled. How do you evaluate  the election results today?    [Voronov] The election results came as a surprise neither to  me nor to my fellow thinkers. Part two of the "Marlizonskiy  ballet"--dissolution-elections--was performed precisely.    In organizing and conducting the elections and tallying  their  results the executive made practically no mistakes....    [Omarova] I don't know about you but I personally have the  impression that the elections were lost by the opposition three  years ago, when the Supreme Council adopted the law on the  administration chiefs....    [Voronov] Three years ago there was no question either of an  opposition or of administration chiefs.    It should not be forgotten that the institution of  administration chief was introduced on 18 January 1992 for the  "transitional period" up to 1995. But this system of state power  was subsequently enshrined in Chapter XV of the 1993  constitution. For this reason alone I voted against its  adoption....    There was no opposition then, nor is there such now....  There  can be opposition to some policy or program. The leadership of  Kazakhstan does not have an integral program.    Remember what became of the government's hefty Anticrisis  Program? A statement of economic policy for 1994 on one-fourth  of a page of newspaper!    [Omarova] Certain highly progressive deputies opted at that  time for the administrative positions offered by the president.  Everyone is free to choose for himself, naturally, but what had  changed? The legislators lost their best, and the executive  authorities did not, alas, acquire in their person new faces....  Yet we need to change the system....    [Voronov] Truly, the system of state power needs to be  changed. As long as there is a Gauleiter structure of  administration of the state and a personnel policy according to  the "shuffling of the old pack" principle is pursued and as long  as the authorities have an opportunity to adopt unlawful  decisions and perpetrate illegal actions (even  anticonstitutional actions such as the notorious Operation  Noose) with impunity, there will be no improvement in either the  economy or in policy....    Changing the system without the presence in society of  interested and powerful political forces, an independent press,  and the desire of the people themselves, on the other hand, is  impossible. Although the chief of state still has, in my  opinion, an opportunity to rely on healthy forces and rectify  the situation.    [Omarova] The elections to the Supreme Council and the  councils of various levels showed that the people are tired and  that the struggle for deputy's seats was conducted, in the main,  by three parties--the Union of Popular Unity of Kazakhstan, the  Socialist Party, and the People's Congress of Kazakhstan--and  also the trade unions, both official and independent. All the  other parties and movements managed to elect only individual  deputies. It is obvious that the lack of experience and the  absence of real leaders took their toll, or was it entirely a  question of the nomenklatura that, having consolidated, took  revenge for previous defeats?    [Voronov] I would not say so. The people are tired not of  elections, the people are tired of indigence, deception, and the  mockery of the authorities. And had ceased to believe in these  authorities. And it was a struggle not between parties and  movements but between the "power party" (to which of the  grassroots associations only the SNEK [Union of Popular Unity of  Kazakhstan] pertained) and all the rest....    The nomenklatura in Kazakhstan was never defeated. Just look  who is running the state currently. Eighty percent of that same  party nomenklatura that has become "market and anticommunist."  Individual failures are of no consequence.    It is another matter that even the nomenklatura is  heterogeneous and is itself torn by contradictions connected  primarily with access to the shareout of the "public pie" called  privatization.    [Omarova] Parliament has turned out to be quite variegated.  Can it justify itself? How professional is the Supreme Council  with this breakdown, when there are practically no lawyers or  economists?    [Voronov] Parliament should not be justifying itself....  Parliament should be performing its main functions: legislative  and supervisory. And performing them to a high standard.    Professionalism depends not on the presence of lawyers or  economists in the Supreme Council but on the work of  professional politicians in it. There are in Kazakhstan, I very  much regret to say, very, very few professional politicians  (regional and republican) of stature.... There are even fewer  people prepared for law-making activity.    The new parliament began work in violation of the  constitution, and not only its professionalism but also its  probity, more precisely, legitimacy, was thereby immediately  called in question.    I am talking about the fact that the Central Election  Commission and then parliament also recognized the authority of  all the elected deputies, despite the noncompliance by the  majority of them with the requirements of Article 68 of the  Constitution (all candidates undertook in their statement  consenting to run to abide unconditionally by the demands of  this article and to resign their positions).    In addition, according to the reports of certain deputies,  they have been invited into oblast administrations, where they  have been insistently advised against leaving their positions;  do not move to the capital but take leave to discharge your  deputy's obligations, which is anticonstitutional.    [Omarova] Whatever you may say about the masses, it is hard  to exaggerate the role of the individual. And we have to speak  about this. Whom among the deputies today might you cite as  leaders, who influences parliament's adoption of laws that are  vitally necessary for our society?    [Voronov] There are, in principle, many leaders, but  mentioning them by name is not the best thing to do.    The elaboration and adoption of laws needed by the people of  Kazakhstan can only be influenced by daily painstaking work in  the groups of deputies, factions, commissions, and committees.  What account the present formal leaders will give of themselves  in them is hard to say.... Perhaps they will, on the contrary,  perform a destructive role.    [Omarova] The president of the country has declared  repeatedly that reforms are progressing here. Perhaps parliament  also should have waited before adopting a decision on no  confidence in the policy of the government (read: the president)?    [Voronov] The institution of the presidency is now four (!)  years old here. The present president has been in the main roles  in the state for approximately 10 years. In such a length of  time many states, even postsocialist states, have achieved  pretty good results in reforms. The day when it will be  necessary to answer to the people is not far off, the 1966  elections are coming right up....    Soon our people, objectively more civilized than the  Americans in 1776, in my opinion, will also come to an  understanding of the proposition of the U.S. Declaration of  Independence of universal significance:    "All men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are  life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure  these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving  their just powers from the consent of the governed. That  whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these  ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and  to institute new government, laying its foundation on such  principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them  shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness...."    [Omarova] But market reforms objectively cannot fail to  encounter serious difficulties?    [Voronov] But the pilfering of the state treasury and the  natural resources, the arbitrary action and lack of  responsibility of the bureaucracy, corruption, "plunderization,"  and so forth--are these the market?    Can reforms leading to the constant deterioration in the  situation of the people be considered legal (that is, market)?  It is being suggested to the people that they rely only on  themselves, endure, tighten their belts, and such here.    If the country is sliding into the abyss, everyone should  suffer, and government officials should not be paid high  salaries. There should be no talk today about the prestige and  responsibility of public service.... In a destitute country  ministers should not be driving around in Mercedes but in small  cars and only on official business. Not flying in Boeings but on  regular scheduled passenger aircraft.... Neither Somalia nor  Vietnam permit themselves such things.    Why did the parliament of the powerful FRG discuss not so  long since the question of whether Chancellor H. Kohl's  automobile was not too expensive?    Even in the Chile of the times of Pinochet (under a fascist  regime) and now, when the country is developing rapidly,  officialdom has not permitted itself to "grab" Mercedes at  public expense because market reforms truly have been undertaken  there. Even now, according to eyewitnesses, there are fewer  imported cars there than in Kazakhstan (in Almaty even, perhaps).    It seems to me that the Supreme Council would be a big  market  supporter were it to bring under control and place within a  legal framework the super-market reforms of the executive. And  this is its sole chance of survival....    [Omarova] The first steps in this direction have already  been  taken, we recall the statement of the Supreme Council on  legislative policy. And this despite the fact that many people  were speaking about a "pocket," pro-president parliament.    [Voronov] Our long-standing forecasts that parliament would  not be a "pocket-presidential" parliament are being justified.  It is formed mainly by administration chiefs, who have long  objectively constituted a particular team. And this is why.    One process is, in principle, under way single-mindedly and  successfully in the state: the so-called privatization  undertaken by the State Property Committee. The administration  chiefs, however, have been distanced from it, and the numerous  conflicts between them and the territorial authorities of the  State Property Committee bear this out. And the chiefs (or their  people in parliament) have yet to have their "market" say....    [Omarova] And would you be having your say about this had  you  been reelected a deputy?    [Voronov] I always try to speak my mind and say what I and  my  fellow thinker-colleagues consider right. I spoke about this to  the president twice as his assistant, and I have not since been  admitted to him....    I am sure that my deputy friends will say all that needs to  be said from the parliamentary podium. Better than I could,  perhaps.    [Omarova] What should we expect from parliament? What is  your  forecast?    [Voronov] Forecasts are a thankless task. In my opinion,  before the 1966 elections there will be either another executive  or yet another "self-dissolution".... Although a dissolution,  most likely.    Parliament now is like a clean sheet of paper. It will not  assume our (12th Supreme Council) "sins." Nor will it assume the  sins of the executive.    With the constantly deteriorating position of the people it  will simply be forced to "play to the electorate," lest it be  swept away by a wave of popular anger, and, consequently, to  make claims against the executive (and the judiciary, for that  matter), which is not accustomed to rendering account. And we  are seeing this in an analysis of the first months of work of  the supreme legislative body.</p>

			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Observer: Jordan's crossing At long last a British union boss is hot favourite to take up a full-time post in an international organisation. Bill Jordan, current president of the AEEU electrical and engineering union, appears to have secured the necessary votes to become general secretary of the Brussels-based International Confederation of Free Trade Unions. This will come as a relief to the TUC which has been been lobbying hard to get a Brit into the job. The ICFTU was born out of the cold war in 1949 originally as an anti-Communist front for trade unions from the western world and for a long time it was concerned mainly in battling for free trade unions in the Soviet Union. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the ICFTU has been trying to find a new role championing trade union rights around the world. The 58-year-old Jordan loves globe-trotting - he was in India recently on a British trade mission. But the ICFTU is more than just a source of junkets for ageing union bosses. He believes it has a vital role to play, particularly in pushing for union freedoms in the developing countries. Jordan's departure will trigger a bitter power struggle in the AEEU. The first candidate to declare an interest in the presidency is executive member John Weakley, but leftwinger Jimmy Airlie is also getting in trim for the battle ahead.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / Swiss expect record SFr3bn budget deficit THE rapidly deteriorating state of Swiss public finances was emphasised yesterday with the publication of a forecast by the federal Finance Ministry of a record budget deficit this year of SFr3bn (Dollars 2bn), 50 per cent above last year's deficit and more than double the original forecast. The governments of most Swiss cantons and the larger local authorities have also plunged into deep deficits in the past two years because of the impact of the recession on revenues and spending as well as higher borrowing costs. By international standards Swiss public finances are still strong. Outstanding debt of all three levels of government is about 35 per cent of gross domestic product and their combined budget deficits are equivalent to only 2 per cent of GDP. However, economists have been expressing growing concern about the tendency of governments at all levels to take on more spending responsibilities even though the Swiss people, who have the final word on tax changes via plebiscites, have tended to reject proposals for higher taxes. The Finance Ministry said that federal spending would grow more than 7 per cent this year to about SFr38bn, mainly because of higher outlays by various ministries. Meanwhile, revenues were growing at only about 4 per cent, and were expected to end up to SFr1bn below the SFr31.9bn budget. The higher budget deficit together with increased financing needs of the unemployment insurance fund has forced federal government borrowing to rise threefold this year to SFr9bn. The ministry said last week it was projecting a higher than previously forecast 1993 deficit of around SFr3bn. Mr Otto Stich, the finance minister, estimated in October that the 1993 deficit would decline to SFr2.47bn.</p>

			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD;  </P> <P> MARCOS SETTLEMENT SOUGHT  </P> <P> Philippine President Corazon Aquino has sent a senior adviser to New York to  talk with lawyers for deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos about settling  claims that he stole huge sums from the island nation. She said Mateo Caparas  will attempt to verify Manila newspaper reports that Marcos "sincerely wants to  discuss a settlement" of demands for the return of up to $10 billion that he is  alleged to have stolen during his 20 years in office. Caparas is chairman of  the Presidential Commission on Good Government. Marcos, 71, who has been  hospitalized since Jan. 15 with pneumonia and bronchial asthma, and his wife,  Imelda, are living in exile in Hawaii. They face a trial in federal court in  New York on fraud and racketeering charges.  </P></p>

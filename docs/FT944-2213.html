			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / A new life for old Manhattan: Richard Waters on Giuliani's plans to revive New York From the grey canyons of Manhattan's old financial district, the World Trade Center's soaring twin towers can be glimpsed only fleetingly. The contrast between this new financial world and the old is a stark one. With their small and irregular floor plans and low ceiling heights, the buildings in this area around Wall Street are unsuited to the big, open-plan trading areas sought by modern banks. Partly as a result, lower Manhattan is in decline. While the island's midtown area - the world's biggest office property market - booms, downturn has been stuck in a prolonged slump. Office vacancy rates have climbed steadily, to 23 per cent, despite the recently ended boom in financial markets which drove the profits of US investment banks to record levels in three successive years. On Thursday Mr Rudolph Giuliani, the city's Republican mayor, announced plans intended to reverse the slide. Included are proposed tax breaks, new transport links and changes to zoning laws that together could encourage more businesses to move to the city's old financial heart - or at least stop occupants leaving. The tax breaks would consist of a five-year reduction in property taxes for new or renewed leases on buildings put up before 1975. There would also be tax incentives for construction of new 'smart buildings', which incorporate the most up-to-date information technology, or for renovations of old ones. At the same time, planning restrictions on a building's height or the distance it is set back from the street would be relaxed, while limits on converting old buildings for residential use would be abolished The efforts to improve transport links include a feasibility study into a new express corridor for taxis on one of the crowded avenues linking midtown with downtown. Also, by next summer the Metropolitan Transit Authority will complete a study into extending commuter rail lines from Long Island and the suburban areas of Westchester County and Connecticut to downtown. Many parts of the mayor's plans, particularly those relating to tax income, will require the approval of the City Council. The issue is expected to arouse considerable antagonism, given that New York has been through a financial crisis this year and faces a continuing shortfall in tax income - and given that the beneficiaries of any renewal of the downturn area will include the wealthy banks inhabiting modern developments.</p>

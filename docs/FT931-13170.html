			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / Kouchner urges Aids testing Mr Bernard Kouchner, the French health and humanitarian action minister, yesterday urged all citizens who had been operated on or received a blood transfusion in the last 10-15 years to get themselves tested for Aids and hepatitis, Reuter reports from Paris. France is still recovering from its worst modern health scandal, in which more than 1,200 haemophiliacs were infected with Aids after receiving transfusions from contaminated blood stocks in the mid-1980s. Mr Kouchner also said he did not intend to run for parliament in elections this March. Mr Kouchner told France 2 television he wanted time out to work for the world's oppressed. Asked about his role in the elections, which opinion polls predict will give the conservative opposition a decisive win, he said he would take part in the government's campaign but nothing more.</p>

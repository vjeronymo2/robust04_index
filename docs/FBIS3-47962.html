The Keidanren expects the government to take measures  without  interruption, said Hiraiwa, who visited this western Japan city  to attend a meeting of regional business leaders.    No effective economy stimulus measures have been taken since  Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa took office last August, he  said.    He urged the government to reduce corporate taxes along with  income tax cuts in view of flagging corporate expenditures.    Hiraiwa said it is inappropriate to discuss employment  security and wage hikes as a matter of option.    Both are important problems and the Keidanren will continue  to make efforts to realize both, he said.    Hiroshi Saito, vice chairman of the federation and chairman  of the world's leading steel maker Nippon Steel Corp., who was  present at the meeting, called for income tax cuts at least two  years ahead of a consumption tax hike.    He proposed the floating of national bonds to secure funds  for the tax cuts.    It is confusing to talk about pump-priming measures and a  revision of the tax system in the long run at the same time, he  said.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA NO LONGER EXPECTS THE MOON  </P> <P> The first landing on the moon, 20 years ago, was supposed to point a path to  the future. Today we are living in that future, and that feat appears as part  of the heroism of the past.  </P> <P> Despite President Bush's announced support for establishing a base on the moon  and sending a manned mission to Mars, such ideas are likely to remain in the  realm of plans and programs rather than of policies and funded projects. There  are excellent reasons why. The Apollo moon-landing program, for all its  self-conscious futurism, stands as a monument to vanished attitudes of its  time. These attitudes dealt with government and with technology, and stand in  sharp contrast to what we expect today.  </P> <P> Apollo had its start in the early 1960s. At the time, there was sweeping  enthusiasm for the ideal of government that brought Apollo into being. The  ideal was that our government should feature a charismatic leader as President,  who would push forward in a widespread program of governmental activism. John  F. Kennedy gave America the very embodiment of this ideal, and the Apollo years  -- the decade that followed his death -- can readily be viewed as a search for  someone to replace him. Kennedy not only initiated Apollo but made it a  centerpiece of his Administration.  </P> <P> Today, however, our expectations have changed. We are far less likely to give  our hearts to vibrant and exciting new leaders, or to put our hopes in grand  governmental programs with names like "New Frontier" or "Great Society." With  Republicans having a virtual hammerlock on the White House, it is doubtful that  John Kennedy could even be elected today. The contrast between George Bush and  Kennedy illustrates something important: Americans no longer expect their  Presidents to give them everything, including the moon.  </P> <P> A second major attitude that drove Apollo, and which we no longer hold, was  that government action could usher in the future. Government agencies would  seize the opportunities of the time, lavish massive funding on them, and bring  them into bloom. In particular, government could identify the most promising  and significant new technologies, such as space flight, and turn dreams into  realities.  </P> <P> Today, however, we put our hope not in government but in small companies and  entrepreneurs. We expect that the technologies of the future will emerge, not  through programs in Washington, but from the work of inventors in centers such  as Silicon Valley. There is little interest today in "industrial policy," which  was a Wash-ington catchword only a decade ago: Thenotion that government should  select technology's winners and losers. This idea was at the core of Apollo.  </P> <P> Apollo was pursued amid a widespread concern over national goals. In the '60s,  opinion-makers often asserted that the nation should spend its effort and  treasure on the pursuit of specific achievements: going to the moon, abolishing  poverty, winning the war in Vietnam. Today we appreciate that the world is too  complex to be neatly encapsulated in such government plans, and few such  proposals come forth.  </P> <P> Apollo also went forward amid a vague but widely held expectation that space  flight would be the key to the future. Today, electronics holds the hope that  formerly attached to astronautics -- and the difference between a desktop  computer and Cape Canaveral illustrates the difference between these  technologies. No entrepreneur could build a rocket for the Cape, but no federal  program could put a computer on the desktop.  </P> <P> Apollo also engendered the expectation that there would be major follow-up  efforts of similar scope. The closest comparable activity was Synthetic Fuels  Corp. of Jimmy Carter's Administration. This was a lavishly funded effort to  seize the future by pursuing a new technical goal: that of producing gasoline  and other synthetic fuels from coal. This project was soon abandoned under  Reagan, and few lamented its demise. Though far less dramatic than Apollo, it  drew from the same mind-set and exemplified the same attitudes.  </P> <P> Why, then, will we not soon return to the moon or go to Mars? We will not do  these things for the same reasons we will not fight an overseas war or launch  far-reach-ing new efforts aimed at social change. Our expectations are  different, more modest -- and more realistic.  </P></p>

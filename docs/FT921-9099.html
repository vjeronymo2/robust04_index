			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / International Company News: Metals group begins flotations METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the German mining and industrial group, plans shortly to float off 20 per cent of the shares in Buderus, one of the companies it bought from Feldmuhle Nobel. It is considering two other such stock market moves this year. Analysts estimate the three deals could raise around DM500m (Dollars 312m). Metallgesell-schaft has said it intends to float a minority of the shares in Lurgi-Umwelt, its environmental engineering unit. Also under consideration is the flotation of a minority in Dynamit Nobel, also bought from Feldmuhle. Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, said Buderus, whose activities include building materials, heating and kitchen equipment, and stainless steel goods, made record profits in 1991. As well as Dynamit Nobel (explosives and plastics), the DM1.45bn purchase from Feldmuhle included Cerasiv (industrial ceramics). Part of Buderus's investment plans involve a plant in Gera, east Germany, to help meet demand for heating equipment. Mr Schimmelbusch did not say how much the capital increase would raise. Metallgesellschaft will retain 80 per cent of the shares. The group has followed a policy of floating off minority stakes in important industrial and mining activities. One quoted subsidiary is Kolbenschmidt, the motor components maker whose profits slumped last year. Mr Schimmelbusch said some of Kolbenschmidt's piston production would be transferred from Germany to lower-cost France and Brazil to improve profitability. Kolbenschmidt's poor performance was one reason for the group's sharp drop in profits last year; others were low non-ferrous metals prices and start-up costs of new smelters.</p>

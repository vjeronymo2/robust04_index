			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / International Company News: Japan's chip makers step up capital spending Japanese semiconductor makers are stepping up capital spending on manufacturing facilities to meet growing demand from the computer and home electronics markets. NEC, the second largest maker of semiconductors in the world after Intel of the US, plans to increase capital spending on chip production this year to Y110bn (Dollars 1.1bn). It had earlier set spending at Y90bn. Fujitsu is also increasing capital spending by Y18bn while Mitsubishi Electric is considering raising investment in order to meet an expected surge in demand in years ahead. Meanwhile, Toshiba, which is Japan's second largest semiconductor maker, announced that a joint venture semiconductor manufacturing company it has with Motorola of the US, is investing about Y27bn in a new facility in Japan to make microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits (ASICs). The increased investments reflect the strong demand for semiconductors from not only the computer market but the home electronics and audio visual markets in Japan, the companies said. 'Our factories are being squeezed to the pip,' said Mr Mark Pearce, of NEC. The move in the PC market towards advanced computers and the introduction of new operating software have increased demand for memory chips, NEC said. The new operating software, for example, uses more than ten times the memory required to run earlier software. At the same time, however, demand for semiconductors from home electronics makers has also been strong particularly for microcontrollers that go into products such as mobile phones, air conditioners, washing machines and other household appliances. The trend reflects both the growing use in such household appliances of microcontrollers and a recovery in consumer spending.</p>

			<p><P> March 30, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> AIR/SPACE AMERICA DEMOTES ADMIRAL IN BID TO KEEP TROUBLED AIR SHOW FLYING  </P> <P> In a move apparently intended to bolster its chances of recapturing city  permission to hold a 1990 air show, Air/Space America has relieved retired Rear  Adm. Bill Walsh of financial responsibilities and demoted him from president to  vice president for operations.  </P> <P> Bob Wilson, former San Diego congressman, chief executive officer and one of  the founders of the organization, said Thursday that Walsh requested the change  of duty to reduce his working hours. Wilson insisted that the change in title  is not a demotion.  </P> <P> "This is a forward step we've been planning for some time, and we're taking it,  and it's going to work to our advantage," he said.  </P> <P> Several San Diego City Council members have pointed to a $4.2-million debt from  the 1988 aerial extravaganza at Brown Field as one of the reasons for their  Feb. 7 decision to revoke the organization's permit to stage a similar show  next year and withdraw $300,000 in city support.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reconsideration Due  </P> <P> At least one councilman, Ed Struiksma, has said he is doubtful about supporting  the organization's bid for another show with Walsh in charge. Councilman Bob  Filner has also said that he sees no reason to reconsider Air/Space America.  </P> <P> "It's true that some of the council members have indicated . . . that he's the  problem," Wilson said. "But it's very easy to say that without knowing the  man."  </P> <P> The decision comes just weeks before Air/Space America is scheduled to request  that the council reconsider its closed-door vote to cancel the air show. The  hearing will be conducted in open session April 10.  </P> <P> Air/Space America is competing with an unnamed, rival group of aerial showmen  that has proposed taking over the show. The group is led by four men who  organized components of the show for Air/Space America last year, but have  since broken away from the organization.  </P> <P> Air/Space America has hired two men to handle finances along with Wilson, who  also will take a more active role in organizing and promoting the show. Walsh's  position is a new one that puts him in charge of arranging the show's events,  Wilson said.  </P></p>

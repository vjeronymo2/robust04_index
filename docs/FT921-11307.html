			<p>920201 FT  01 FEB 92 / UK Company News: SEP Industrial down to Pounds 303,000 The widening impact of the recession in the UK and increasingly in overseas markets hit SEP Industrial Holdings, the USM-quoted engineering products group. In the year ended September 30 1991 sales fell from Pounds 58.3m to Pounds 49.5m - and were Pounds 10m below budget - leading to a decline in pre-tax profit from Pounds 2.33m to Pounds 303,000. The group's prime customer base in the vehicle and construction industries was particularly badly affected, said Mr Paul Formby, the chairman. However, he looked for a significant increase in the current year, the scope and extent being dependent on the timing of any improvement in the manufacturing division. And that justified payment of a dividend - 0.2p against 1.04p. Earnings per share for the year fell to 0.48p (3.07p).</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MAYORS CALL FOR MORE FEDERAL AID  </P> <P> Cities deserve more federal aid because they supply the labor and the tax  revenue that keeps the nation going, some of the nation's urban mayors said  Sunday.  </P> <P> "Cities are our nation's marketplaces, not only for business, but also for  ideas," New York Mayor David N. Dinkins said.  </P> <P> "If we choke off our cities by denying them the resources they need to function  efficiently, the marketplaces will disappear."  </P> <P> Dinkins and a dozen other mayors spoke at a news conference to kick off a  two-day conference on urban issues, such as combating drug abuse, improving  education and paying for costly infrastructure such as bridges and roads.  </P> <P> Boston Mayor Raymond L. Flynn said cities are not getting enough federal aid to  support drug education.  </P> <P> Many of the mayors, most of them Democrats, said the federal government is  neglecting urban areas. In 1980, federal funds made up 19.4% of New York City's  budget. Now that share is 9.7%, Dinkins said.  </P> <P> Last week, Dinkins announced a cut of 5,400 city jobs to close a $388-million  budget gap.  </P></p>

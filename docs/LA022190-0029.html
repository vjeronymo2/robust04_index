			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEACE DIVIDEND REINVEST IT;  </P> <P> A LIFELINE TO GET US OFF THE ROCKS;  </P> <P> AMERICA NEEDS A WHOLESALE CONVERSION, NOT JUST CUTBACKS, OF ITS COLD WAR  ECONOMY.  </P> <P> America is twiddling its thumbs as it begins to debate the freeing of possible  modest resources from future military budgets. Maybe some, says President Bush,  but not much. Maybe more, say others, by the mid- and late-1990s. But the  opportunity comes from different sources and is more urgent and richer than  they realize. The issue is conversion -- creatively planned and on a large  scale -- not merely cuts.  </P> <P> The "peace dividend" metaphor is a false image; both words are wrong. A  dividend is commonly received in the mail by affluent people, at leisure, and  banked for future luxuries. The United States, however, is in serious distress,  sinking deeper into international economic mediocrity and debt.  </P> <P> Military conversion offers a lifeline, not just a bonus. Experts agree that  diverting research and development, capital and millions of workers to the  military has retarded the U.S. economy, as the Japanese and West Germany  successes show by contrast. Redirecting military resources offers the only  large, foreseeable new source of national competitive strength.  </P> <P> A large shift is possible and involves especially valuable resources for  science, new products, managerial excellence, new capital and plain productive  power. Though the resources are "only" about 7% of our gross national product,  they are critical to raising productivity. Getting them out of indulgent  military contracts and onto the open market is widely expected to sharpen the  productive mentality and methods of industry in a broader range of markets.  </P> <P> The second error is to believe that "peace" is new, that it arises only from  the changes in Eastern Europe. The awesome Soviet military assets are still  there, it is said, and any reversion to a new Stalinism would restore the Cold  War threat, catching us off guard. Better keep our military large and "strong,"  just in case.  </P> <P> A wide body of new research shows that the threat of military conquest or  nuclear blackmail has been virtually nonexistent since at least Stalin's death  in 1953 and probably since 1943, when the tide turned in World War II. There  has never been a real possibility that nuclear missiles would force our  "surrender," or that Soviet tanks would roll across Western Europe. The age of  conquest for true national gain ceased with Adolf Hitler; indeed, his failure  proved the point beyond any serious doubt.  </P> <P> Yet militant "anti-communism" prevailed, and the military sector drained huge  flows of resources from the economy. Ironically, the weapons themselves became  the main source of danger, from the risks of mad or mistaken attacks. They did  not "keep the peace," which already existed between the superpowers.  </P> <P> In the Kafkaesque world of Cold Warriors, strength caused economic weakness,  "allies" (the Philippines, Turkey and others) drained vital national resources,  weapons for "security" caused insecurity, and parts of the U.S. economy became  hooked on the narcotic of uncompetitive military spending.  </P> <P> U.S. leadership is now in the addict's stage of denial. They say that there is  no problem, that the military extravagances of the 1980s were necessary to  intimidate the Soviets, that the wastes were really modest and that no major  changes are needed and so on. These attitudes are blocking us from the obvious,  rich solutions. We need to advance to the cure phase, where withdrawal is rapid  and a new life is carefully constructed, free of the military drug.  </P> <P> This is the Administration's historic opportunity. Other leaders dream about  such a chance, where virtually everybody can be a winner. Bush has it in his  hands, but there are disturbing signs that nothing is being done.  </P> <P> The task is twofold: first, to understand the magnificent scope of this  opportunity, which has been there all along during the functionless Cold War;  second, to mount a comprehensive New Era program for redirecting critical  resources.  </P> <P> This prodigious opportunity is immediate, like an 80-yard pass when the home  team is behind late in the game. Will Bush and Congress fumble, as it now  seems? Do they understand the urgency, the opportunity? The future of 250  million people hangs on their actions.  </P></p>

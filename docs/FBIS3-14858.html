			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by ITAR-TASS correspondent Yuriy Romantsov] </F>   [Text] New York, 1 Mar -- After arresting the CIA employee  Aldrich Ames and his wife on a charge of spying for Russia a few  days ago, the Washington authorities might have concentrated  their attention on finding the answer to this question: how can  it be that somebody managed to steal secrets from Langley, the  holy of holies of U.S. special services? That, incidentally, is  what the administration is being strongly advised to do -- and  by those who themselves headed the special services in the past.    But Washington decided that it was far more important to  "punish" Moscow as quickly as possible (Moscow, mind you, and  not Ames or those in the CIA who allowed this failure to occur).  They announced the expulsion of the Russian diplomat, Aleksandr  Lysenko. Lysenko was asked to leave purely because of the  position he held at the Russian embassy (he was accredited to  Washington as an intelligence officer and dealt with cooperation  between the two countries' special services), and not because he  was in any way implicated in the "Ames affair". No accusations  have been levelled against him.    Is it any wonder, after this, that James Morris, an American  diplomat who worked as a counsellor at the U.S. embassy in  Moscow, now has to leave the Russian capital far earlier than he  intended to? He has been given seven days to leave. However,  to be more precise, Morris was not a diplomat, but a CIA officer  holding a diplomatic passport. One would rather not use  expressions like "an eye for an eye" or "a tooth for a tooth,"  but it would have been incomprehensible for the American  demarche to go unanswered, to go without "reciprocation".    Washington is implying that it is now time to put this  entire  incident behind us. White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers,  expressing regret about the expulsion of Morris, said: "We do  not expect any further diplomatic moves." Vice President Albert  Gore stressed that relations between the United States and  Russia "ought not to be determined by such incidents."    This is both heartening and encouraging. It is, indeed, time  to close the curtain on this affair, but once the fly-wheel has  been started, it is not always easy to stop it. Certain people  in the United States, including a number of congressmen, are  exploiting the "Ames affair" to say that Russia should not be  assisted and that a closer look should be taken at its  "behavior." Certain people are already portraying Russia's  peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, which helped to stop the  bloodshed, as an "imperialist scheme."    One is reminded of the euphoria that there was in Washington  over the fact that neither ideological rivalry nor confrontation  would any longer determine relations between the two greatest  powers on earth. Moscow was just as happy about this, but  different judgements are now appearing more and more frequently  here. Here's a quote from the journal `Nation': "The rivalry is  continuing. Now and in the future Moscow will play the role of  geopolitical superpower, whose interests, history and character  run counter to the interests of the United States."    Naturally, the interests of the United States and Russia, as  two sovereign states, can and will diverge, but there is  obviously no point in seeking out and then enlarging the cracks.  Instead one should seek and build on points of contact. The  hullabaloo which has been raised over the "Ames affair" is  hardly likely to facilitate this.</p>

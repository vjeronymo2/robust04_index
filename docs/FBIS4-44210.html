			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Rinaldo Gianola on remarks Fiat Chairman Gianni </F> Agnelli made to journalists in Cernobbio; date not given:  "Agnelli Reserved on Berlusconi: `But I Would Vote For Him  Again'"]    [Text] Cernobbio -- The government "has certainly done  little, even though its initial measures are in the right  direction." "The recovery of the automobile market in Italy is  nonexistent." "The improvement of the economy in Europe is not  itself capable of resolving the problems of unemployment and  public finance, which is causing an extremely critical situation  in Italy." Fiat Chairman Gianni Agnelli came to Lake Como to  take part in the seminar organized by the Council for  Italian-U.S. Relations, and took the opportunity, both in his  speech and when talking with journalists, to express his opinion  about the political and economic issues of the moment. From the  Berlusconi government's first moves to the failure of the Corfu  summit, and from the recovery to the restlessness of the  financial markets.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Mr. Agnelli, how do you judge Mr.  Berlusconi's first moves?    [Agnelli] He certainly has not done much yet, but the first  measures are in the right direction...    [LA REPUBBLICA] Including in the direction of a reform of  public finance? Is there not a danger that the necessary  corrective moves will be postponed too long?    [Agnelli] The sooner they implement the reform, the better  for everyone. Of course, it must be said that this government  has only existed for 45 days; it has been distracted by the  European elections and has not been able to do much.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So would you still express a vote of  confidence in it?    [Agnelli] Definitely, yes, just as I would grant it to other  governments, from an institutional viewpoint.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Is Fiat experiencing a recovery?    [Agnelli] A distinction must be drawn: The recovery of the  automobile market is weak in Europe, but it is nonexistent in  Italy, on which, as is well known, Fiat depends to a large  extent.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So should there be incentives to facilitate  sales?    [Agnelli] It is not up to me to discuss such matters.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Do you think that the recovery that is  emerging in Europe could spread and grow stronger?    [Agnelli] The overall climate seems calmer, but we must  consider how to strengthen the recovery, how to set in motion a  strong and lasting recovery. The spontaneous improvement  envisaged for the second half of 1994 and for 1995 does not  itself seem capable of resolving the two structural problems  assailing Europe -- the worrying level of unemployment and the  public finance situation.    [LA REPUBBLICA] Are there any solutions in the short term?    [Agnelli] There are no miracle solutions to unemployment,  and  there is now widespread agreement that Europe's inability to  curb the loss of jobs stems from structural factors such as the  great rigidity of the labor market and the excessive extent of  the welfare state. If Europe wants to create new job  opportunities it must have the courage and the determination to  tackle these problems, to impart flexibility to the economic  system and to carry out a proper and incisive reform of the  welfare state.    [LA REPUBBLICA] From an industrial viewpoint, what is the  way  to support the recovery?    [Agnelli] Europe must continue along the path of pay  restraint; it must support investments, especially in the major  infrastructure networks; it must take action against rigidities  and bottlenecks that present sufficient mobility of production  factors and especially of labor, so as not to create obstacles  to the prompt adaptation of production to the variability of  demand.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The sudden declines in the international  markets indicate great alarm about economic prospects, about  trends in inflation and interest rates.    [Agnelli] It is essential to issue strong and clear signals  to the markets. Negative expectations threaten to influence  Europe's recovery, precisely through an increase in the cost of  money. Although it can be said that the worst period of the  crisis is now behind us, the recovery is not only modest, but  still seems very unsteady and based on policies that enjoy  little confidence on the part of the markets.    [LA REPUBBLICA] The Corfu summit ended without an agreement  on the next president of the Commission. Is that a worrying  sign?    [Agnelli] They will meet and discuss it again. For us  Italians, it does not seem to me to be a major problem whether  the candidate is Dutch or Belgian. Personally, I would choose  GATT Secretary General Peter Sutherland for his professional  qualities.    [LA REPUBBLICA] So is there not another split within the  European Union?    [Agnelli] British Prime Minister Major has suffered so many  blows at home that he wanted to gain some satisfaction abroad by  blocking the choice of the new president.</p>

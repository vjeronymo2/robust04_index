			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Take GATT"] </F>   [Text] The version of the Dunkel draft that the European  Union and the United States have agreed upon will for all  practical purposes be the final treaty the director general of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, Mr Peter Sutherland,  will present to the rest of the world. International trade is a  fearsomely technical subject. This may be why the P.V. Narasimha  Rao government seems to have believed GATT could be quietly  slipped through Parliament without fuss. Given the Dunkel draft  touches on such emotive subjects as medicine, seeds and textiles  this was a remarkable bit of wishful thinking on the part of  South Block. The consequences of this attempt to avoid debate  has been an intellectual vacuum now filled by emotional rhetoric  and irrational fears. Much of the scaremongering about GATT by  leftwing critics is wholly unfounded, particularly the claims  regarding seed patents. Thanks to official silence about what  GATT will really mean it is the bogeys that have come to  dominate the popular vision of the Dunkel draft.    It is necessary India sign on the dotted line in Geneva next  April. Among other things it is essential to the survival of  economic liberalisation. Leftists who believe India should  strike out on its own echo the hoary economic xenophobia that  has given India over 40 years of splendid stagnation. Any  international agreement impinges on a country's sovereignty. The  question is what benefits will accrue to India from signing the  GATT treaty. Because India is only marginally plugged into the  world economy it will initially gain little and lose less  because of GATT. However the world's largest trade treaty opens  many doors. A nation with intelligence and perspicacity can  benefit hugely. China alone is expected to reap some $40 billion  in exports over the next decade. There is no reason India cannot  drink from the same trough. It needs only to put its own  economic house in order and be less fearful of the outside world.    India's long isolation from the global economy has meant  trade is still looked upon as something akin to colonialism.  From Adam Smith onwards it has been shown that the exchange of  goods and services between nations is a two way street, mutually  beneficial. Victorian England and the US enhanced rather than  diluted their national standing by being merchants to the world.  Burma is the dingy example of a trade me not. What makes GATT  important to a nation still finding its export feet is that it  provides regulations, ensures a modicum of fair play and allows  for independent adjudication in case of disputes. Outside GATT  is a wild and woolly realm of unilateral sanctions and embargos.  The West holds all the cards in the latter scenario. China, for  example, accepted a patent regime much stricter than that  present in the Dunkel draft because it negotiated a bilateral  agreement with the US. The two sides were so mismatched Beijing  left with its "sovereignty" in a sling. India needs to  comprehend globalisation is not a mantra that will change  reality by mere repetition. It requires a commitment to meet  the standards and norms of a world that has raced far ahead.  Catching up requires hard work, not histrionics.</p>

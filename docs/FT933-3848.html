			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Cheap thrills are not enough: Britain may be turning into a bargain basement but consumers want quality and convenience On Monday, it was newspapers, as The Times reduced its price from 45p to 30p. On Tuesday, it was credit cards, as Save &amp; Prosper launched a Visa card with an interest rate 7 percentage points lower than most of its rivals. On the same day, Mercury offered free evening and weekend calls in London on its new mobile phone network. Before that, there was the holiday price war, the lager price war, and last year the DIY price war. Britain, it seems, has become a bargain basement. Consumers already used to hearing that the UK is emerging from recession may wonder why there should be so much price-cutting activity now. Are businesses positioning themselves to increase market share as the recovery gathers strength? Or do cuts reflect the continuing squeeze on profitability? Will consumers, who rebounded quickly from the 1980s recession, emerge more cautiously from the 1990s slowdown, forcing manufacturers and retailers to compete fiercely on price for the rest of the decade? The picture is mixed, and companies are introducing cuts from a variety of motives. An important priority for some is to defend market share in the face of a rush of competition. The UK's largest superstore chains, for example, are being confronted by rapidly expanding discount stores, which sell a limited range of goods at very low prices in no-frills surroundings. The big chains are responding by localised price-cutting, and introducing new, lower-price products. Usually these are so-called 'tertiary brands', cheaper and lesser-known alternatives to big-name and stores' own brands. The chains are also making increasing use of 'multi-buy' promotions, such as three for the price of two. A recent price survey by Verdict, the retail market research group, found that for a basket of 40 common groceries, taking the cheapest item, in each case, the price had fallen by 8 per cent across 12 national grocery chains since last September. The price gap between superstores and discounters had closed to 6 per cent from 12 per cent. Increasing sales of retailers' own-label and other cheaper brands has put pressure on many well-known manufacturers' brands, which normally sell for substantial premiums. On April 2, Philip Morris slashed the US price of its cigarettes to defend the falling market share of its premium Marlboro brand. Other US brand leaders, including Procter &amp; Gamble, Kraft and Quaker Oats, have had to cut prices or at least shelve planned increases. Although no UK branded producer has been obliged to cut prices as deeply as Marlboro, prices have recently come under attack in a different way - from imports. Tesco obtained supplies of Stella Artois, the Belgian premium lager, through its French subsidiary Catteau instead of through Whitbread, which brews the lager under licence in the UK, and which has established it as a premium brand by marketing it as 'reassuringly expensive'. This allowed Tesco to sell the lager 25 per cent more cheaply than when it was sourced from the UK. Whitbread has since agreed to supply Stella to Tesco in continental-style packaging, although at the same price as before. Observers, however, believe Whitbread, as well as Courage, which brews Holsten under licence, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, licensee for Becks, may be forced to cut prices as Tesco and J Sainsbury plan further promotions of imported continental lagers. Many consumers are voting with their feet and shopping for beer and wines in continental Europe, where prices are lower since import restrictions have been relaxed. So, while some companies have been forced to cut prices to compete, others have chosen to do so to try to win market share, or to establish themselves in a new market. The price cuts by The Times this week and by The Sun in July were both gambles designed to arrest declining circulations and increase market share. The Sun is said to have increased its circulation by about 300,000 as a result - but most observers believe this is not enough to cover the lost revenue. The reduction at The Times, considered by many a premium product, was more controversial. Initial reports are that it has boosted circulation by more than 30 per cent, taking it above 400,000, but some industry commentators fear it has damaged its image. The publicity surrounding both price cuts, however, seems to have stimulated the market, with competitors also showing increased sales. The move this week by Save &amp; Prosper, which announced a steep drop in the rate of interest on a new Visa credit card, was a similar attempt to win market share - but by a minnow rather than a big fish. S&amp;P has 100,000 cards in issue against Barclay's 8.8m and National Westminster bank's 4m and does not disguise its motive of gaining a larger share of the market by doubling the number of its cardholders. 'We think competition for lending will increase and thought it better to move in early,' said S&amp;P. New entrants to markets will often undercut their competitors to establish themselves. Mercury, which launched its One-2-One mobile phone service in the London area this week, did that. One-2-One is offering free local calls to customers in the evenings and at weekends, in a bid to open the consumer market to mobile phones for the first time. Price-cutting campaigns, where several companies compete, can 'kickstart' a slow market. The recent holiday price war is a good example. Thomas Cook's 10 per cent price cut last month was matched by competitors such as Lunn Poly, Pickfords Travel and Hogg Robinson. The chains say the discounts have given them their best start to summer bookings ever. Lunn Poly says it has sold more than 300,000 summer 1994 holidays so far, 150 per cent more than at the same time last year. But the low-margin structure of the industry means a 10 per cent cut across the board is unsustainable in the long term (it represents most of the commission that travel agents receive from tour operators) and the promotions end today. While sporadic discounting to protect or enhance market share has been common during the recession, there is a growing view that retailers, in particular, will have to become increasingly price-orientated during the 1990s. Sir Geoffrey Mulcahy, chairman of the Kingfisher group, has warned that consumers are demanding more convenience, wider ranges and improved service  -all at lower prices. The result is that profit margins will fall. Successful companies must get into the 'virtuous circle' of cutting gross margins and prices, thus increasing volumes and market share, and then using higher profits to drive down prices still further. Sir Geoffrey is trying to steer the Kingfisher group in this direction. B&amp;Q, Kingfisher's DIY chain, has moved away from sporadic deep discounting which provoked a DIY price war last year. Instead, it has adopted a policy of 'everyday low prices', permanently reducing the cost of 500 product lines. Marks and Spencer, the UK's most profitable retailer, is also taking a longer-term view. Last autumn it launched an 'outstanding value' campaign which involved freezing the price of three-quarters of its clothing range and reducing the price of the remaining 25 per cent. The company says it is committed to using productivity improvements to hold prices down. There are several factors supporting Sir Geoffrey's forecast that price competition will be more savage in the 1990s than in the 1980s. Even when the UK emerges fully from recession, the consensus is that consumer spending will grow at only about 2 per cent a year, compared with the 7 per cent it touched in the late 1980s. Moreover, demographic changes will affect spending patterns, with the number of consumers in the high-spending 15-34 age group forecast to drop by about 1m during the decade, while the number in the more thrifty 35-59 group increases by more than 2m. Virtually all new retailers arriving in the UK are discounters. These include warehouse clubs, which sell a range of goods from corn flakes to car tyres at bargain prices in enormous sheds; 'category killers' - such as Toys R Us, Ikea and PC World - highly efficient superstores which sell a wide range of goods within a particular market segment at discount prices; and factory outlet malls, which gather together clearance outlets selling factory surplus or end-of-line stocks. Many retail observers believe these formats will find a ready audience among consumers who have just lived through the worst recession since the second world war and have grown more price sensitive. The view that customers are motivated by price above all is not, however, entirely borne out by research. Mr Jef Harris, chairman of market research group Harris International Marketing, says that of the 50,000 grocery shoppers it interviews each year, only 20 per cent rate price the most important factor when deciding where to shop. About 70 per cent say convenience is most important (the proportions have reversed since the late 1970s and early 1980s). Only 30 per cent believe the supermarket or superstore where they shop is actually the cheapest available to them. That means 70 per cent of customers choose shops which they believe are not the cheapest, because other considerations are more important. That view is backed by research by the Henley Centre, which has found low prices alone are far from being the main factor influencing consumers. Both research groups agree that as more women work full-time, and as real incomes continue to rise and retail spending as a proportion of income falls, customers will be increasingly motivated by convenience, by the desire to save time, and by better value for money. Mr Eric Salama, joint managing director of the Henley Centre, told a retailing conference earlier this year: 'The link between price and quality is breaking down. Customers are beginning to expect that they can get higher quality goods without necessarily paying for them.' For 1990s consumers, therefore, simply cutting prices is not enough. Shoppers are not concerned just with buying the cheapest - they want good-quality products, but at competitive prices and accompanied by good customer service. That is the real challenge for manufacturers and retailers. Additional reporting by Andrew Adonis, Scheherazade Daneshkhu, Guy de Jonquieres, John Griffiths, Michael Skapinker, Ray Snoddy</p>

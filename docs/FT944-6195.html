			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Government Statements): Benefits from change of ownership to be withdrawn - Unused tax relief Proposals to reduce the loss of corporation tax which can occur when an investment company with unused tax reliefs changes hands were annnounced by the Inland Revenue. It said the proposal would yield about Pounds 30m in 1996-97 and subsequent years, 'and will prevent further loss of tax from any increase in this activity'. The proposal is that tax relief be withdrawn 'for management expenses and charges carried forward where the ownership of an investment company changes and: there is a major change in the nature or conduct of its business, or its business revives, having become small or negligible before the change, or there is a significant increase in the company's capital; or an asset is acquired from a company in the purchasing group after the change in ownership and disposed of shortly afterwards'. The new rules apply to changes in ownership on or after today, except where the change occurs under a contract entered into before today. 'In some cases, investment companies with unused tax reliefs carried forward (management expenses and charges) have been bought, and new investments have been put into them, in order to use the tax reliefs against income and capital gains generated by those investments. 'Income and gains made under one ownership are thereby sheltered from corporation tax by excess tax reliefs generated under a different ownership, despite the fact that the company may be carrying on a different business and/or operating on a different scale after the change of ownership. 'In other cases, a purchasing group of companies passes an asset into the newly acquired investment company, then sells it, setting the unused management expenses against the chargeable gain. 'In this way, a gain about to be realised by the group is sheltered from corporation tax. 'The Chancellor's proposals are intended to limit the circumstances in which unused tax reliefs can be used following a change of ownership. They mirror existing provisions which apply to trading losses, capital losses, and surplus advance corporation tax when ownership of a company changes. They use the same definition of 'change of ownership', and apply similar tests in determining the availability of certain reliefs during a period which contains a change of ownership. 'One provision operates to deny any use of excess management expenses and charges (such as interest payments) at the date of the change of ownership for periods after that change. It takes effect in any of three different circumstances: where, during a three year period, a company has both a change of ownership and a major change in the nature or conduct of its business; where a business has become small or negligible before a change in ownership, and is significantly revived following the change; where there is a significant increase in the capital of the company in the year before the change, or the three years after the change. 'A second provision applies where an asset has been acquired via a no gain/no loss transfer from another group member after the company's change in ownership, and has been disposed of within three years of that change. It prevents the company from setting excess management expenses and charges from before the change in ownership against chargeable gains on the asset concerned. 'Management expenses and charges are allowed when they are paid or disbursed, unlike trading expenditure which is allowed as it accrues. The proposal also applies to accrued management expenses and charges so it will apply where management expenses or charges have been accruing in the company to be sold and are only paid after the change of ownership. These proposals will not apply to life insurance companies.'</p>

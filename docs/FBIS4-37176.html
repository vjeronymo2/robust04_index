			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] President Alpha Oumar Konare, president of the  Republic of Mali, and the delegation accompanying him arrived in  Tripoli this evening on a visit to the Great Jamahiriyah.  [passage omitted]    President Alpha Oumar Konare made a statement to JANA on  arrival in which he said:    [Begin Konare recording, in French with superimposed Arabic  translation] It is with great pleasure that I am paying this  visit to fraternal Libya. It is normal that we hold  consultations regularly on all problems of concern to us. I was  here in Libya a few months ago and I felt all the interest and  friendship that Libya and its high-ranking officials devote to  Mali. It is with the will to further consolidate these  relations that I am here with an important delegation. There  are no taboo subjects between Libya and us, and we have a common  desire to protect our countries' interests. I am convinced that  this visit will further consolidate the very good relations  between us. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

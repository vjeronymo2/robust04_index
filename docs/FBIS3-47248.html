			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Jan. 11 (YONHAP) -- The government will seek  to increase corporate investment overseas through increased  foreign exchange loans from the Bank of Korea to head off  pressure for increasing the money supply in the overseas sector  and strengthening the won against the U.S. dollar, as the  overall balance of payments position is expected to improve from  last year's surplus of 6.5 billion U.S. dollars to 10 billion  dollars this year.    The balance of payments comprises current transactions  (international trade of goods and services) and capital  transactions (international trade of securities and debts).    To increase foreign-exchange loans for increased corporate  investment overseas, the Bank of Korea will improve the terms,  including lower interest rates and longer repayment periods than  foreign bank loans, Economic Planning Board officials said  Tuesday.    The introduction of foreign commercial (bank) loans will be  limited to those importing equipment needed in infrastructure  expansion projects.    The settlement period for imports on a deferred payment  basis  will be extended and the ceiling on export advance receipts will  be raised to increase trade on a short-term credit basis, the  officials said.    To expedite overseas investment, the number of corporations  eligible to invest overseas will be increased, restrictions on  real estate investment abroad will be eased and support will be  given to those investing in agricultural and resources  development projects overseas.    The number of institutional investors eligible to invest in  foreign capital markets will be expanded, along with an increase  in their overseas investment ceiling, while the Bank of Korea's  swap system, whereby investors buy foreign exchange from the  central bank with resale agreement, will be expanded for  increased investment in the foreign securities market.    In addition, the export-import Bank of Korea's funds  supporting exports on a medium- and long-term credit basis will  be increased, restrictions on settlement of current transactions  in foreign exchange will be eased and rules governing the  raising of funds denominated in foreign currencies in the  countries where a company operates will be improved to their  advantage.</p>

			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Life gets tougher The summer season of new business figures has shown just why the life insurance sector has underperformed the stock market by 20 per cent in the last year. The 30 per cent fall in sales of life and pensions policies reported yesterday by Refuge - which prompted a 5 per cent fall in the shares - was especially poor. In addition to public distrust of the industry as a whole, the company had to retrain its sales force to keep the regulator happy. But bending over backwards to please the regulator is becoming a way of life. With full disclosure of sales commissions around the corner, pleasing customers is not going to get easier. Increased sales of unit trusts are scant consolation. Margins earned by companies on this type of investment business are unlikely to match with-profits or pensions policies. The flow of unit trust business could also dry up, or even reverse, if the stock market enters a bear phase. In the long run, life companies could become more geared to the investment cycle and less solidly defensive than hitherto. Changes in business mix and lower overall sales will take time to filter to the bottom line. Profits and dividend growth will be supported for some time by maturing life policies sold in the 1980s or before. On a yield premium of 30 per cent to the stock market average, and with dividend growth effectively underwritten, the sector will find support. But it cannot live off its fat forever. A sustained rally in the shares looks unlikely indeed until the new business prospects are clear.</p>

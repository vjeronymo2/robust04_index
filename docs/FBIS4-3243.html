			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 19 (CNA) -- The U.S.-based TRW Space  and Electronics Group Monday [18 April] was awarded a contract  to build the ROCSAT-1, Taiwan's first satellite for scientific  research and communications scheduled to be launched at the end  of 1997.    The contract was signed by Hu Ching-Piao, vice chairman of  the National Science Council (NSC) and Bruce Gerding, vice  president of the civil and international systems division of TRW  Space and Electronics Group.    The ROCSAT-1, carrying a price tag of NT$ [New Taiwan  dollars] 1.6 billion (U.S.$59.26 million), is the first of a  series of planned procurements for the development of Taiwan's  space system capabilities, Hu said.    The NSC and TRW also agreed that the contract will become  void if TRW fails to acquire an export license from the U.S.  Government within 60 days, Hu said.    As technology acquisition is a predominant factor in  international procurements, Hu said, a technology assistance  agreement (TAA) is integral to the ROCSAT-1 contract. TAA's are  necessary for the export of high technologies from the U.S.    Officials of the Redondo Beach, California-based TRW said  they are confident they will receive the TAA in three to five  weeks.    Once the TAA is secured, the NSC's national space program  office will send 24 engineers to TRW to participate in the  design, development, manufacture and testing of the satellite, a  space program official said.    The NSC began the ROCSAT-1 procurement project in December  1993. Four foreign companies, including France's Matra Marconi  -- a group comprising French and Israeli aircraft industries --  Germany's Dornier, France's Alcatel, and TRW submitted bid  proposals.    Under a NT$13.6 billion (U.S.$509 million) space program,  Taiwan plans to have three satellites in orbit by 2006.    TRW, a leading space/defense contractor to the U.S.  Government, has developed and launched 175 spacecraft and more  than 500 scientific payload instruments in the past 35 years,  according to TRW officials.</p>

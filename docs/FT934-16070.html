			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / Central Line hit by one-day strike THE FIRST of a planned series of one-day strikes on London Underground's Central Line was held yesterday by the RMT rail union, cutting services by more than half. The action was over the dismissal of two workers who have now been re-employed by London Transport although in different jobs. A working party has been set up to look at the disciplinary procedures covering Central Line staff. The union executive meets today to discuss the dispute. A further strike is due next Thursday.</p>

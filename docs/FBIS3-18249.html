Woltjer returned from Israel on  Thursday [24 February] and is the draftsman of the European  Parliament's (EP) opinion on the peace talks.    After his three-day visit to the Occupied Territories and  Jerusalem, Woltjer came to the conclusion that the EU should put  more pressure on Israel. He proposed that the EU should use  both the association agreement and its financial protocols with  Israel -- involving millions of guilders in loans -- to  influence the peace process.    "Everything must be done to improve the appalling living  conditions of the Palestinians in the Occupied Territories,  otherwise the Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement is doomed to  failure," Woltjer said. In April the EP will debate the current  state of the peace agreement.    "The European Commission then will be asked to increase the  pressure on Israel," the Netherlands MEP announced. He spoke of  "positive-critical" pressure on Israel, because in his opinion  the rapprochement policies of the Rabin government were the only  correct ones. "Rabin must be helped against the pressure of the  army and the opposition," he said.    In the meantime the EP has formed an ad hoc delegation for  Palestine including all the European parties. This delegation,  led by Claude Cheysson and Woltjer, wants to monitor how the  Commission is fulfilling the promises made to the Palestinians  since the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO.    Woltjer returned from his mission to the territories  occupied  by Israel "with little euphoria." He blamed the Israeli  Government for the bloodbath in Hebron. "They are responsible  in the Occupied Territories," Woltjer said. "With my own eyes I  have seen how Jewish colonists walk round everywhere armed. The  government allows that and therefore, as the ruler in the area,  it is also guilty."    According to what he saw, the Palestinian population as yet  has seen nothing positive from the Israeli-Palestinian peace  agreement. The perspectives for an Israeli-Palestinian detente  were very poor, he said. The Palestinians in the Occupied  Territories indeed will gain more say over tourism, health care,  and education. "But if they want to build just one hospital  they have to ask the army for permission, because 60 percent of  the land has been nationalized by Israel," Woltjer said.    He questioned the viability of Gaza, where Israel is  demanding a safety zone which includes approximately half the  Gaza Strip and also "accounts for the most usable land."  Woltjer accused Israel of sabotaging the export of Palestinian  agricultural and market gardening products.    The EP has demanded that the possibilty exist for these  products to be exported directly to Europe. "But in practice,"  Woltjer said," the Israelis carry out detailed security checks,  the costs of which are then passed on to exporters. This makes  the earnings of the exporters very small." Therefore the  building of a harbor in an autonomous Gaza is an "absolute  necessity."    The EU has made approximately one billion guilders available  for the Palestinian refugee camps and, among other thins, it  finances education centers. But Israel is blocking the import  of materials, because Jerusalem wants the Palestinians to pay  sales tax on deliveries. "Europe and Israel are arguing about  the issue," he said.</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Observer: Pr-U turn Has Mick Newmarch, the Prudential's outspoken boss, lost his voice? The most vociferous critic of the proposed Personal Investment Authority has been maintaining an uncharacteristically low profile since publication of the PIA's prospectus on Monday. One theory is that, by leaving some daylight between his previous utterance and his post-prospectus comment, Newmarch may be rehearsing how to do a U-turn without attracting undue publicity. Alternatively, he may just be pausing for dramatic effect before refusing to sign up. All the same, the sooner Newmarch starts barking again the better. The insurance industry wants to hear from its leader.</p>

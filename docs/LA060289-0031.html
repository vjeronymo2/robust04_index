			<p><P> June 2, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DAVID NELSON ON RESTAURANTS: PERIODIC SPICING-UP OF MENU GIVES PIRETM THE TOUCH  IT WAS MISSING  </P> <P> The Piret's story is one of the more convoluted sagas in our regional  restaurant lore.  </P> <P> The original Piret's introduced the city to French cafe food when it began  serving a menu of pates, composed salads and bistro classics in Mission Hills  in 1978. To many, Piret's was a kind of gustatory prologue to the widening of  dining options that ensued through the 1980s.  </P> <P> To a degree, Piret's did for San Diego restaurant patrons what Julia Child did  for home cooks by making a complicated cuisine accessible and familiar. In the  words of one observer, "Piret's made everything possible." That seems a fair  assessment because Piret's smoothed the path for the purveyors of nouvelle and  California cuisines, and for such unusual new entries as Gustaf Anders, which  in local terms seemed almost Martian when it opened in 1981.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Grew Into a Chain  </P> <P> Under the guidance of proprietors Piret and George Munger, the restaurant  expanded into a chain with five county locations as well as outlets in Orange  County and Beverly Hills. A shaky financial situation, however, resulted in its  sale in 1986 to Vicorp, which controlled a number of restaurant chains and  which itself divided and spawned a new, San Diego-based firm called Paragon  Restaurant Group. Within a relatively brief time, the more marginal Piret's  locations were closed or sold, the handsome downtown outlet was converted into  a Boathouse (now itself mercifully gone), the Mission Hills cafe was purchased  by former Vicorp executive Jeanne Driscoll and the Mungers reacquired the  Encinitas and La Jolla Village Square locations.  </P> <P> To reestablish their presence at the Encinitas cafe, the Mungers added an art  gallery and revised the name to PiretM Bistro Gallery. The menu remained the  same, however, and, after a while, began to seem old and stale -- a restaurant  that had been an innovator seemed too cozy in its niche to rouse itself and try  something different.  </P> <P> The recent introduction of new, periodically revised menus at PiretM has given  the place the gastronomic equivalent of a good redecorating job. Some familiar  items remain, such as the charcuterie (French delicatessen) salads and  thoughtful designer pizzas. But these can be regarded simply as a background to  the contemporary French preparations and a number of dishes inspired by the now  chic Southwestern cuisine.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Cafe Mood Retained  </P> <P> The cafe mood has been retained by reserving large sections of the menu for  appetizers, soups, salads and simple dishes, but the list of formal entrees  also has been made more interesting and comprehensive. Prices seem a touch high  at the starter end and relatively low for the entrees. As at so many places  these days, the cost of a dinner for two will vary wildly according to the  combination of items selected; only the most formal restaurants continue to  dictate a minimum check by expecting patrons to order a complete dinner.  </P> <P> The appetizer list gets off to a smashing start with a plate of baked oysters  in a cream sauce enriched with Stilton cheese and bacon. The inclusion of lemon  juice in the sauce cuts the overall richness and reminds of the presence of the  oysters under their gaudy and remarkable cloaks. An eggplant and garlic terrine  (in this case, a light, pate-like loaf) in a fresh tomato sauce comes off even  better, thanks to the surprise attack on the taste buds by cinnamon and either  cayenne or chili peppers. This dish admirably combines sharp, sweet and pungent  flavors.  </P> <P> Other choices in this department include grilled fresh asparagus with a  lemon-flavored soy sauce (this makes a light, refreshing starter or snack) and  gravad lax (Scandinavian-style cured salmon) with mustard sauce and cucumber  salad.  </P> <P> The kitchen also does very well with soups, as any sincere and well-intentioned  bistro should. The red lentil puree is sharpened with a dose of masala (an  Indian spice mix that gave birth to the Occidental curry powder) and enriched  with smoked ham, and is a sturdy, savory soup. A cabbage soup offered as one  evening's special seemed rather wintry for this time of year, but was likeable  anyway for its full-flavored broth and bits of tender cabbage.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Host of Filling Salads  </P> <P> Many of the salads can easily double as main dishes, including the spit-roasted  chicken with vegetables and aioli (garlic mayonnaise), the grilled salmon salad  and the chicken, walnut and apple salad with Waldorf dressing that, if it  contained celery, would be a Waldorf salad with chicken.  </P> <P> The pizza and pasta list continues to include the "breakfast" pizza, so named  because George Munger likes to eat it cold at breakfast. With its cheese,  tomato sauce and pepperoni topping, it remains the most classic of the lot and  is indeed quite tasty. Examples that go further afield include a pie decorated  with lamb sausage and grape leaves, and a Mexican-style combination of roast  chicken, avocado and tomatillo salsa.  </P> <P> Among the pastas, the linguine with rosy slices of grilled lamb filet, feta  cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, olives and Madeira sauce, all scented with  rosemary, is a combination that would be Greek to the Italians, as it is to us.  This dish may be pungent and is not recommended to the timid, but it is also as  delicious as it is unusual.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Expanded Entree List  </P> <P> The expanded entree list begins on a Southwestern footing with chicken and corn  bread with yellow red bell pepper coulis (a type of puree), and sauteed slices  of turkey breast with an herbed tomatillo sauce. It becomes more generally  American with Munger's Meatloaf, a sturdy loaf dressed up with caramelized  onions and bordelaise sauce that was, unfortunately, too like the school  cafeteria classic. Overloaded with filler, it had a tough, grainy texture and  something of a steam-table flavor.  </P> <P> Among much happier offerings were a classic and classy pepper steak that could  be -- and was -- cut with a fork, and a plate of choucroute garni, or deeply  savory sauerkraut garnished with a healthy variety of sausages. Fish is offered  on a daily list, and a sauteed slab of salmon was respectable, if not  ravishing, under its light sauce of white wine, shallots, lemon and butter.  </P> <P> Piret's always prided itself on its lengthy selection of homemade desserts and  continues the practice with the new PiretM menu. In addition to such well-made  standbys as chocolate mousse and creme brulee, there is a tray brimming with  pastries, most in the chocolate mood that seems to hold the sweet-eating public  enthralled at present. One of these days, someone is going to rediscover  coconut, fruits and Bavarian creams. The chocolate truffle cake is every bit as  rich as it sounds, however, and the cherries jubilee tart cleverly engages  cherries, custard, chocolate and nuts in a good, toothsome crust.  </P> <P> The wine list, which includes a long selection of wines by the glass, also  continues to be excellent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> PiretM BISTRO GALLERY  </P> <P> 897 1st St. (in The Lumberyard), Encinitas  </P> <P> 942-5152  </P> <P> Lunch and dinner served daily  </P> <P> Credit cards accepted  </P> <P> Dinner for two, with a glass of wine each, tax and tip, costs $30 to $65.  </P></p>

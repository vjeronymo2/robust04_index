			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Dr. Kim Chol] </F>   [Text] Turning cooperative ownership into all-people  ownership is a historic event which completely changes the  farmers' socio- economic relations.    In his classic work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural  Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has comprehensively elucidated,  based on his scientific analysis of the inevitable demand of the  development of socialist society and the reality of the rural  economy of our country, the theoretical and practical problems  arising in the successful realization of the work to turn  cooperative ownership into all-people ownership.    The respected and beloved leader Comrade Kim Il-song has  taught: We must solidify and develop the agricultural  cooperative economy and successfully realize the work to turn  the cooperative ownership into all-people ownership.    Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is  an  inevitable demand of the development of socialist society.    Socialism means society based on collectivism. The economic  basis of socialist society is cooperative ownership and  all-people ownership which are both socialist ownership.  Collectivism demands that all social relations, including the  ownership relations, develop continuously in the common interest  of the entire society.    Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is  an  enormous social change, but this change is different from  remaking the private ownership into socialist ownership because  it is the development of cooperative ownership--which is the  lower form of socialist ownership--into all-people  ownership--which is the higher form of socialist ownership.  Cooperative ownership--the lower form of socialist  ownership--must develop in such a way as to enhance its level of  socialization, and it must ultimately be turned into all- people  ownership--the higher form of socialist ownership. When  cooperative ownership is turned into all-people ownership and  all the workers work incorporated into the unitary economy of  all-people ownership, the communist principle of "one for all  and all for one" will be satisfactorily embodied, thereby  realizing the classless society.    Turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership is  an  important problem in the development of the socialist rural  economy of our country today.    Under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, we  have vigorously carried out the ideological, technological, and  cultural revolutions in the rural areas in our country according  to the basic principle for the solution of the socialist rural  problems set forth in the rural theses, closely combining  all-people ownership and cooperative ownership and continuously  enhancing the role of all-people ownership. The chuche  agricultural guidance system with the county cooperative farm  management committee as its basis has been firmly established,  its function and role enhanced, and the managerial and  operational standard of cooperative farms improved nearly as  much as the standard of advanced industrial enterprise  management. With the active material and technological  assistance of the state to the agricultural cooperative economy,  production relations between industry and agriculture have been  strengthened, all people ownership and cooperative ownership  have been organically combined, and the material and  technological means of all-people ownership accounted for an  overwhelming share in agricultural production. At the same  time, all cooperative farms firmly developed in the direction of  large-scale all-people ownership system farms.    In our country, all the agricultural workers are firmly  united in comradeship, helping one another; large-scale major  nature-remaking projects--unimaginable in terms of private farm  economy or small-scale economy--are underway in the rural areas,  thus making the agricultural production develop at a high speed  continuously. This not only demonstrates the superiority of the  socialist rural economic system based on collectivism, but shows  that the conditions are coming to maturity in our country  whereby cooperative farms are gradually converted into  all-people ownership farms.    In his work, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught  that the work on turning cooperative ownership into all-people  ownership be carried out gradually in conformity with the degree  of maturity of all the conditions and possibilities.    Under a condition which is yet ripe ideologically,  materially, and technically, hurriedly turning cooperative  ownership into all-people ownership would prevail the unsound  ethos of living idle in rural areas, thus dropping the  agricultural productivity and laying a big obstacle in the path  toward overall socialist construction.    The fundamental conditions for turning cooperative ownership  into all-people ownership will enhance cooperative farmers'  level of ideology and consciousness and will strengthen the  material and technical foundations of the cooperative economy.    What is important here is the work of revolutionizing  farmers  and assimilating them into the working class by remolding their  ideologies. Farmers' ideological consciousness works very  importantly in the development of ownership relations. The work  on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership can  never be realized without remolding farmers' ideological  consciousness.    Originally, the existence of cooperative ownership along  with  all-people ownership is closely connected with the farmers' low  ideological consciousness level, and their technical and  cultural level compared to that of the working class. This is  because ideological remnants of individualism and egoism in the  heads of farmers are very conservative and are unlikely to be  erased in a short time. Leaving these intact, the work on  turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership will not  only fail, but, even if it succeeds, it will bring about evil  effects.    By raising the farmers' level of ideology and consciousness,  we should let farmers become deeply aware that their individual  interests lie in that of society and group and that their  worthwhile life and happiness can be found in the prosperity and  development of the socialist fatherland and in the prosperity of  cooperative rural areas. We should also let them display high  patriotic zeal and devotion. When these are fulfilled, we can  then say that the important conditions for turning cooperative  ownership into all-people ownership has been prepared.    Consolidating the material and technical foundations of the  cooperative economy is one of the important conditions for  turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership. The  material and technical foundations of the agriculture is weaker  than that of the industry.    Since remolding the people's ideological consciousness is  connected with material foundations, and society's production  relations are related with the degree of productivity  development, consolidating material and technical foundations is  an important problem rising in the work of turning cooperative  ownership into all-people ownership.    The rural technical revolution's four tasks--irrigation,  electrification, mechanization, and chemical application--set  forth in the socialist rural theses have been basically carried  out in our country. In doing so, we have laid solid foundations  for modern agriculture and made a remarkable progress in the  struggle to industrialize and modernize agriculture. We should  further expand and consolidate the accomplishments achieved  until now. We should also industrialize and modernize  agriculture, and develop the farming method and land cultivation  system so as to gradually eliminate the differences between  industrial and agricultural labor and to resolutely increase the  production efficiency of agricultural labor. With these  conditions fulfilled, we can then say that solid material and  technical foundations have been prepared for turning cooperative  ownership into all-people ownership.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song's illumination of the  fundamental conditions for turning cooperative ownership into  all-people ownership in his work comes as a guiding principle  for triumphantly carrying out the work without any slightest  deviation or turns. In his work, the abundant and profound  experiences of the great leader, who led socialist rural  construction at the van for a long time with uplifted banner of  chuche are summed up, and our party's solid will to lead our  rural area into the one road of socialism is contained.    In his work, the great leader Comrade Kim Il-song also  expounded in detail the question on how to carry out the work on  turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership.    What is important here above anything else is that the work  on turning cooperative ownership into all-people ownership be  carried out with the county as a unit.    Carrying out the work on turning cooperative ownership into  all-people ownership with the county as a unit is related with  the role and position assumed by the county in the socialist  rural construction. In our country, the county is the base for  linking the towns with the rural areas in all spheres of  politics, economy, and culture, and serves as the basic unit for  the direct leadership and management of the rural economy. A  county has the farm machine stations, farm implement factories,  irrigation administration offices, and other state enterprises  which serve the rural economy, and equipment and farming  materials are supplied to cooperative farms with the county as a  unit. Therefore, cooperative ownership must be transformed into  all-people ownership with the county as a unit. Even after  cooperative farms are converted into the state farms of  all-people ownership, the rural economy must be developed on a  county basis.    The forms and methods of converting cooperative property  into  all-people property, too, must accord with the socialist rural  economic system of our country and the specific situation in our  rural communities.    Since a well-organized agricultural leadership and  management  system has been established with the county as a unit in our  country, the most reasonable form and method is to convert  cooperative farms in the county into state farms under  all-people ownership and let the county undertake their unified  guidance and management. This will make it possible to manage  satisfactorily the farms which have come under all-people  ownership, using and strengthening further the comprehensive  leadership and management system of the rural economy and the  material and technical means that serve agriculture, which have  already been prepared in counties.    In a county of moderate size where the level of management  of  the county cooperative farm management committee and cooperative  farms is high, all the cooperative farms and the state  enterprises that serve agriculture in that county may be merged  into a state farm with the former cooperative farms made its  branch farms and the former enterprises its workshops.    The general farms, which have been organized as model units  in Sonbong and some other counties through the merger of not  only agriculture but also local industry, goods distribution,  education, culture, health care, and all other local  administrative and economic functions, must continue to operate,  further improving their management. Even after cooperative  ownership is converted into all-people ownership, all state  farms should be managed under the self-balancing system and the  socialist principle of distribution should be thoroughly  implemented.    In particular, it is important to set up ways to avoid  possible deviations and loss and in the course of transforming  cooperative ownership into all-people ownership and must  smoothly carry out the task.    Also important in the work of turning cooperative ownership  into all-people ownership is making the county play an important  role as the base linking town and rural areas and as an  all-embracing unit of leadership and management to the rural  economy.    Therefore, it is necessary to build up the county, further  develop local industry, and improve education, culture, health  care, and public welfare. The county must expand and strengthen  the enterprises and the production establishments serving the  rural economy to speed up the development of agriculture. All  the counties must make it their major task to develop  agricultural production and improve the living standard of the  rural population, and must push forward the socialist rural  construction.    In his classic work "For the Ultimate Solution of the Rural  Problems Under the Banner of the Socialist Rural Theses," the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song has set forth concrete tasks  and means arising in the work of turning cooperative ownership  into all-people ownership. This comes as a militant banner for  the ultimate solution of the rural problems and the complete  success of socialism.    All party members and working people should traverse the  road  of the socialism of our own style, the road elucidated by the  great leader Comrade Kim Il-song. By doing so, they should  brilliantly accomplish the historic tasks of eliminating the  differences between towns and rural areas, eradicating the class  distinctions between working class and farmers, ultimately  solving the rural problems, and realizing a classless society.</p>

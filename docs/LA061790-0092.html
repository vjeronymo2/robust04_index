			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> 200 MARCH IN WILMINGTON TO DENOUNCE GANGS, DRUGS  </P> <P> About 200 people chanting "Follow me! We're gang and drug free!" marched  through Wilmington Saturday in what supporters hailed as their largest showing  yet in support of grass-roots efforts to combat drugs and gangs.  </P> <P> More than half the marchers were children toting yellow balloons that lent a  festive appearance to the rally. But the jovial atmosphere belied how serious  they and their parents were about their mission.  </P> <P> Angie Torres, a fifth-grader at Wilmington Park Elementary school, said one of  her cousins -- a gang member -- died of a drug overdose two years ago. "I saw  what happened," she said, "and I don't want that to happen anymore."  </P> <P> The march was organized by the Community Reclamation Project, a federally  funded pilot program launched in February, 1989, to encourage cooperation among  neighborhood agencies that focus on gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> Although the group has organized six other rallies -- in Carson, Lomita, Harbor  City and Wilmington -- since October, Saturday's march in Wilmington was the  first time that organizers brought an entire community together to make a  stand, said Natalie Salazar, the project's executive director.  </P> <P> A few Wilmington neighborhoods have been so besieged by gangs and violence that  some residents have been unable even to get newspapers to make deliveries to  their homes, she said.  </P> <P> In an attempt to turn the tide, groups of schoolchildren for the past several  months have been walking through their neighborhoods asking local businesses to  help distribute pamphlets about the dangers of gangs and drugs.  </P> <P> "For a lot of businesses in hard-hit areas, it was a first step" toward  eradicating the problem, Salazar said.  </P> <P> Saturday's rally was smaller than organizers had expected, but they said any  showing at all was a victory for the area because "a lot of people are scared  to do anything that has to do with gangs," Salazar said. "They think that by  coming out, that's going to mark them for retaliation. But we have to lower  that fear factor, and the only way we can do it is to get more people out."  </P> <P> To symbolize a sense of unity, two groups of demonstrators -- most wearing  gang-neutral yellow T-shirts and toting signs and balloons saying "Rise up  against gangs and drugs!" -- started marching at opposite sides of the  community. They met about 1 1/2 hours later at Wilmington Town Square on Avalon  Boulevard and I Street for an hourlong rally that included speeches by  residents and community leaders.  </P> <P> Among the marchers was Salvador Almanza, 9, who said he frequently sees gang  members near his home "go into people's houses, stay about 20 minutes and then  get in their car to leave."  </P> <P> When asked what he thought they were doing, he replied: "Probably doing drugs."  </P> <P> Dee Wiggington, 40, who organized a local chapter of Mothers Against Gangs two  months ago, said many parents deny that their children are involved in gangs,  even after the children show obvious signs of involvement.  </P> <P> "If the parents in the community started taking control and responsibility for  their own kids, you wouldn't have this problem," she said.  </P> <P> The Community Reclamation Project opened shop with a $1-million federal grant  and was slated to last 18 months. A $70,000 grant from the Los Angeles County  Probation Department two weeks ago allowed the group to continue its efforts  through the end of September, Salazar said.  </P> <P> Although the pilot project has focused on Lomita, Harbor City, Wilmington and  Carson, project officials are hoping their work with local agencies will serve  as a model for gang-infested communities nationwide, Salazar said.  </P> <P> Ralph Chadwick, president of the Wilmington Chamber of Commerce, which helped  sponsor Saturday's event, said community marches may not have an impact on  hard-core gang members. But he added, "If just one person changes his mind, if  just one person decides not to join a gang or not to use drugs, you're doing  something worthwhile."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii on Friday [24 June] shunned calls for specific figures and  dates on a consumption tax hike to offset income tax cuts in a  planned tax reform.    "As financial authorities, we want a conclusion that will  not  lead to untreated issuance of deficit-covering bonds," Fujii  told reporters after a cabinet meeting.    But, apparently backing off from recent comments he made  directly urging specific figures and dates, Fujii did not  elaborate on reported discussions between the coalition parties  and the Social Democratic Party (SDP) to put off the decision on  the scale and dates for the tax hike.    The proposed offsetting tax hike has become the  controversial  policy issue for the SDP considering returning to the coalition  government which fell to a minority rule after the party seceded  from the coalition in late April.    The tax reform plan of continuing tax cuts and hiking the  consumption tax was proposed separately on Tuesday by panels of  the government and the ruling parties without figures and dates  for later political decision.    Meanwhile, Fujii also checked top-level political  developments by urging the tax reform be made into bills by the  end of this month to enact into law by the year-end.    "We must keep the deadline," he said, referring to Japan's  promise made in the March market-opening package.    Turning to currency exchange rates, Fujii described the  statement by U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen as "meaning  heavy."    The statement, issued Wednesday, a day after the dollar  plunged against the German mark and the yen, said, "we continue  to be in close communication with our G-7 (Group of Seven)  partners, and we continue to be prepared to act as appropriate."    Asked why the United States is not jointly intervening as it  did in May, Fujii said, "we are taking all possible measures at  every level."    The U.S. dollar tumbled below 100 yen in New York on Tuesday  for the first time in the postwar period to hit a global low of  99.85- 99.95 yen. It is now trading nervously around 101 yen  with dealers saying that the market is testing the G-7 accord  for joint moves to stem excess volatility.    They said the Bank of Japan alone has made noticeable  intervention against the yen's rise.</p>

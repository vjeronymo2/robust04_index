			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [CHINA DAILY commentary: "Three-Prong Strategy"] </F>   [Text] A keynote of the deliberations in the sessions of  the National People's Congress [NPC] and the Chinese People's  Political Consultative Conference [CPPCC] is the correct  handling of the relationships between reform, development, and  stability, that is, to strike a balance of the three so that  they will promote each other.    Participants at the sessions share the view that stability  is  a prerequisite of reform and development for, without political  and social stability, nothing can be achieved.    On the other hand, reform and development constitute the  groundwork of stability for, unless reform and development are  pushed forward vigorously, stability can hardly be firm and  enduring.    The economy has developed remarkably fast in the last two  years. Meanwhile, however, the inflationary pressures have  mounted and bottlenecks have formed in certain fields.  Therefore, the planned growth rate for this year has been  reduced to 9 percent from last year's 13.4 percent.    This cut is necessary because painful experience in the past  has taught us that growth, when it comes too fast, without  regard to economic laws and with no real benefit, is false  growth that will eventually become a burden.    Development must be steady and healthy with a  well-coordinated and rational industrial structure and an  efficient mechanism for economic operations.    Several essential reform measures in key economic sectors  have already been introduced. Their impact will certainly be  strong and far reaching.    These reforms are being carried out as the economy continues  to grow fast. They should constitute a great driving force for  development rather than a hindrance. We should always be on the  alert and take prompt action to iron out any problems that may  crop up.    It is clear that a stable political and social climate must  be maintained if the aforesaid reform measures are to be  implemented smoothly.    Participants in the NPC and CPPCC sessions have offered  valuable suggestions to ensure the success of this year's  reforms and consolidate the country's present stable scene.  Several issues have drawn their intensive attention.    Last year while the income of urban residents increased 10.2  percent, that of their rural brothers increased only 3.2  percent. This shows the rural people are at a great disadvantage.    Price hikes and inflation immediately affect the lives of  the  people, particularly those in towns and cities.    The government has adopted concrete measures to combat  inflation and rein in prices.    The recent decision to monitor and strengthen supervision of  prices for 20 basic necessities and service items for the people  is an apt example.    Then there is the issue of corruption. The crackdown on  corruption has been given much publicity since last year and has  so far achieved notable results. This has enhanced the image of  the Party and the government in the eyes of the people at large.    However, corruption is still a serious problem and resented  by the man in the street. There must be no let-up in the fight  against corruption and for a clean government.    A proper settlement of these and some other issues will  provide, by and large, a stable environment for the  accomplishment of this year's tasks.    We believe the blueprint mapped out by the NPC and CPPCC  sessions will win wholehearted support of the whole nation and  we hope 1994 will be a fruitful year for China's economic  development and drive towards a socialist market economy.</p>

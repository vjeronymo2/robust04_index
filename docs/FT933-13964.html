			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Observer: Legal beagle Whatever the outcome of the legal battle shaping up in Germany between General Motors and Volkswagen over the defection of executives to VW, it's unlikely to damage the reputation of one of GM's brightest stars, 50-year-old Harry Pearce. Pearce heads GM's legal department and he likes nothing better than a good fight. He won his first GM battle honours back in February when he took on the NBC television network. In a masterly two-hour press conference, he produced compelling evidence that NBC had rigged a fiery crash of a GM truck and he eventually won a public apology from the network. Now he's been handed another juicy legal battle where he can once again show his mettle. How other corporate lawyers must envy him. But Pearce is much more than GM's top lawyer. Last November, when a palace revolution shook up GM's top management, Pearce was the surprise choice to become executive vice-president responsible for the group's two non-automotive operations - Electronic Data Systems and GM Hughes Electronics - both very large businesses in their own right. His elevation underlines the more open, creative approach to management ushered in by November's upheaval. For, while GM's top executives tend to be long-time company employees, many of whom have worked their way up on the finance side of the business, Pearce is an attorney and only joined the group in 1985. Before that, he was working in obscurity as a trial lawyer based in one of America's most rural states, North Dakota, where he grew up. On one occasion, he so unnerved a witness that the man began eating his tie.</p>

			<p>910422 FT  22 APR 91 / International Company News: Actimo to buy Canadian chain ACTIMO, a private French property group, plans to buy Pascal, the Canadian hardware chain which is in receivership, for an undisclosed price. Furniture and hotel supply businesses which also operate under the Pascal name will remain in the hands of the Pascal family. The hardware business had annual sales of CDollars 200m (USDollars 173m) before running into trouble last year. Varity, the Canadian car parts, diesel engine and farm equipment group, says existing shareholders will retain all their rights when it moves headquarters from Toronto to the US later this year. Varity will set up a US holding company, Varity Corp, registered in Delaware, but with headquarters in Buffalo, NY. The assets of the existing Canadian company will be amalgamated with the new company and the Canadian company will be wound up.</p>

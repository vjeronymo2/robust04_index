			<p><P> June 23, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 250 ARRESTED AT ABORTION CLINIC  </P> <P> It was an interesting newspaper on June 11. The lead story on the front page  was about hundreds of pro-democracy activists being arrested in the People's  Republic of China ("400 Arrested as China Gears Up to Choke Off Dissent"). The  lead story in Metro dealt with hundreds of anti-democracy religious fanatics  being arrested by the Los Angeles Police Department.  </P> <P> It appears that despite the strenuous efforts of religious fundamentalists and  their conservative Republican supporters, the United States is still  functioning in the manner in which our Founding Fathers intended.  </P> <P> MICHAEL DAVIDSON  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

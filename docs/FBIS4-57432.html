			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Olivar Bodan] </F>   [Text] "Recontra" Chiefs Jose Santos Rodriguez, alias  "Cascabel," and Julio Cesar Benavides, alias "Pajarillo," whose  men seized Quilali last Saturday, will occupy the posts of  delegate and deputy delegate of the Government Ministry in San  Rafael del Norte, Jinotega, according to an agreement reached  yesterday in a meeting between rebel leaders and Government  Minister Alfredo Mendieta.    Ranking National Police chiefs will hold a Commanders  Council  today, to study the government measures, which have sparked a  negative response in the police ranks. "How are we going to be  subordinate to criminals?" asked a source close to the  institution.    Sergio Caramagna Valinotti, chief of the Support and  Verification Commission (CIAV-OAS), who was present at the  meeting between the ministers and the "recontra" leaders,  reported they had also agreed to allow 11 "recontra" chieftains  to reenter the Walter Mendoza Academy next Friday. The  chieftains had abandoned the academy "to protest" the dismissal  of "Cascabel" and "Pajarillo" from the police forces.    Murderers and Criminals [subhead]    According to the Information and Study Office, the National  Police expelled the recontras because they were criminals and  had deserted the police ranks. Furthermore, it denied that  those men would return as "the functions of policeman and  criminal do not coincide."    According to police files, the men under "Cascabel" set fire  to two motorcycles and are the ones who murdered Captain Miguel  Guido Quiroz, First Lieutenant Jose Agurcia Garcia, and soldiers  Antonio Castillo Perez and Andres Zuniga, among other crimes.    Mendieta explained that the recontras who will reenter the  forces will work at police stations in the northern part of the  country and said it had been a "very satisfactory" meeting as it  showed how Nicaragua had advanced to solve problems "peacefully  and through dialogue." The meeting was not attended by any  National Police representative. The meeting was held on the  fifth floor of the Silvio Mayorga Building at 1100 yesterday  morning. The recontras used Minister Mendieta's private  elevator to get to the meeting.    Present at the meeting were Deputy Government Ministers  Frank  Cesar and Joaquin Lovo; Jose Angel Talavera, alias "Chacal," and  his brother Esteban; and Mateo Guerrero, president of the  Nicaraguan Human Rights Association (ANPDH). The members of the  FN-3-80 [3-80 Northern Front] traveled to Managua expressly to  meet with government officials after the recontras refused to  talk with El Jicaro Police Chief Subcommander Marcos Ruiz last  Sunday, to find a solution to the conflict.    Military sources have confirmed that the seizing of Quilali  had been peaceful and that the rebels had not used weapons. The  recontras held the town's main entry and exit points and the  offices of Telcor, the municipality, the Agricultural and  Livestock Ministry, and Ecodepa [expansion not known].</p>

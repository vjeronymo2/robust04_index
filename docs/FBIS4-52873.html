			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of  the South Korean National Democratic Front (Hanminjon) published  a letter on May 9 exposing the truth behind the fast breeder  reactor "Monju" of Japan, a Seoul-based radio Voice of National  Salvation reported.    It said:    What Japan seeks in its nuclear design is not to merely join  "the nuclear group" but become a nuclear power. The way of  achieving this goal is to develop destructive devices in secrecy  and, at the same time, produce and stockpile large quantities of  fissionable materials behind the "non-nuclear" curtain. Japan  sees the decisive key to the fulfilment of its nuclear design in  importing large quantities of plutonium and developing a fast  breeder reactor which can breed the imported plutonium.    The Japanese authorities started the development of the  prototype reactor "Monju" with the investment of 600 billion  yen in 1985 and began charging "Monju" with plutonium as its  nuclear fuel in June, 1992, and finally put it into full-dress  operation on April 5 this year, despite repeated accidents.    Not content with this, Japan plans to enter "the age of a  full- scale fast breeder reactor" by developing a conventional  reactor through the stage of a demonstration reactor.    As for the fast breeder reactor whose development the  Japanese authorities are hastening, it has been scrapped in most  countries because its safety and economic advantage have not  been guaranteed in the world. Worse still, "Monju" is a time  bomb fatally fraught with three factors of dangerous accidents.    Japan has already developed a destructive device which can  explode in a one-ten millionth of a second and then started the  development of a super-high speed destructive device which can  explode in a one-one hundred millionth of a second long ago.    So, the operation of "Monju" which can breed plutonium 1.3  times the amount of the charged materials means a leap in the  conversion of Japan into a nuclear power.    Japan's development of the fast breeder reactor and its  surfacing as a nuclear power which pose a great nuclear threat  to Asia and the rest of the world can never be allowed, the  letter said, and continued:    The Japanese ruling quarters must draw a lesson from  Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the nuclear victims, renounce the  design to become a nuclear power, stop the operation of "Monju"  and promptly give up the mass production and stockpile of  plutonium.    The United States must direct efforts to checking Japan's  moves to become a nuclear power, feeling fully responsible for  the fact that it offered to Japan an excuse for nuclear  armament, groundlessly charging the DPRK with "nuclear arms  development," and connived at Japan's nuclear development.    Hanminjon calls on the governments, political parties and  organizations of the Asian-Pacific nations and other countries  of the world hoping for denuclearization and peace and  international organizations to invigorate the struggle for  checking Japan's scheme to become a nuclear power.</p>

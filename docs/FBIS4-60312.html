			<p>BFN     [Text] A military source at the command of the Armed Forces  of the Democratic Republic of Yemen has ridiculed a statement  issued by a so-called responsible source at the Transport  Ministry and broadcast by Sanaa radio this evening. The source  stressed that the al-Ahmar gang is now in a difficult military  position because it is incapable of threatening any of the air  or sea ports of the Democratic Republic of Yemen. He confirmed  that the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of Yemen are in  total control of all the harbors and airports in this Republic  and that they can fully guarantee the security and safety of  these harbors and airports and provide the necessary services  for ships and aircraft which call there.    The military source commented on the statement by a  responsible source at the Transport Ministry to the effect that  the Sanaa government is not responsible for damage or losses  that might occur to any foreign company. The military source  said that the government led by the al-Ahmar gang is no more  than a smuggling and terrorist gang. It cannot ensure the  safety of any foreign company just as it is incapable of  protecting the security of the country and its citizens. The  source concluded by saying there are a number of companies and  individuals who have been subjected to looting, plundering,  assassination, and kidnapping before the eyes and ears of the  security forces of that corrupt authority.</p>

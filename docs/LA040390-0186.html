			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOCKEY PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> KINGS LIMP INTO CALGARY, LEAVE GRETZKY BEHIND  </P> <P> With the injured Wayne Gretzky a doubtful participant, the battered Kings open  the NHL Smythe Division playoffs Wednesday night against the defending Stanley  Cup champion Calgary Flames.  </P> <P> Gretzky, sidelined after absorbing a hard check from Alan Kerr of the New York  Islanders on March 22, is one of six injured Kings. That's hardly encouraging  considering the Kings' 8-4 loss to the Flames in the season finale Sunday night  and a healthy Los Angeles team's playoff loss to Calgary last season in four  straight games.  </P> <P> "At this point, we do not expect to have Gretzky back in the lineup on  Wednesday," Coach Tom Webster said Monday before the Kings -- without Gretzky  -- left for Banff, Alberta, to prepare for the first-round series.  </P> <P> "I've no idea when Wayne will return," Webster said. "We just have to take it  day by day."  </P> <P> Team officials say Gretzky, who won his eighth NHL scoring title this season,  has spasms and a hyperextension of the back. But they haven't ruled out the  possibility, however remote, that he may play Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "Wayne continues to be treated in Los Angeles, and remains on a day-to-day  basis," team physician Dr. Steve Lombardo said.  </P> <P> The other injured Kings are forwards John Tonelli, Dave Taylor and Steve Kasper  and defensemen Larry Robinson and Tom Laidlaw. All missed Sunday's game.  </P> <P> "We do expect to have Robinson back, hopefully Tonelli and Kasper, too," said  Webster, himself recovering from an inner ear operation. "But both Tom Laidlaw  and Wayne Gretzky are big question marks."  </P> <P> Gretzky, who likened the Kerr check to being rear-ended in an auto accident,  had 40 goals and 142 points this season. Those were the worst numbers he has  posted since getting 137 points as a rookie in 1979-80.  </P> <P> His absence would be a severe blow to the fourth-place Kings, whose 75 points  this season surpassed only the Islanders' 73 among the NHL's 16 playoff teams.  </P> <P> "Gretzky is the best player in the world," Kings goaltender Mario Gosselin  said. "With him in the lineup, it changes the way the other team plays against  you."  </P> <P> Despite the injury, some of the Flames wonder if the questions concerning  Gretzky might be a ploy to throw them off their game.  </P> <P> "It could be," forward Theoren Fleury said. "The only guys that know are the  Kings. We can't be worried if he's going to be playing or not. We have to focus  on us and how well we're going to play."  </P> <P> The first-place Flames, whose 99 points are second-best in the league, will  host the first two games of the best-of-seven series. After Friday night's  second game at the Olympic Saddledome, the series shifts to Inglewood, where  games three and four will be played Sunday and next Tuesday. The teams would  alternate sites for games six through seven, as needed.  </P> <P> That rotation also would hold for the other Campbell Conference series.  </P> <P> In the other Smythe Division series, Winnipeg opens at Edmonton, where Gretzky  led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups in 1980s.  </P> <P> In the Norris Division, regular-season champion Chicago is host to Minnesota  and Toronto visits St. Louis.  </P> <P> The Wales Conference playoffs start Thursday night, with the second game in  each series set for Saturday. Games three and four would be Monday and next  Wednesday.  </P> <P> The Boston Bruins, whose 101 points led the league, are at home against  Hartford to open the first round in the Adams Division. Montreal, a loser to  Calgary in the Stanley Cup final last year, opens at Buffalo.  </P> <P> In the Patrick Division, the Islanders open at the New York Rangers.  </P></p>

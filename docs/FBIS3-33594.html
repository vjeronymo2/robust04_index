Congress approved the FSE with just  one change.    [Begin recording] [Reporter Luciane Bacellar from Brasilia]  The FSE was approved by 402 votes of the 500 congressmen present  for the voting. Only one change was made: The government lost  its power to reduce the bank PIS [Social Integration Program]  contribution.    Congress approved the FSE but it has yet to decide whether  to  implement it immediately. The voting may take place this  afternoon. The administration needs 293 votes to implement the  FSE immediately. The date of the session at which the bill will  be promulgated will be decided later. Only then will the FSE be  implemented and will Minister Cardoso go ahead with the second  phase of his economic plan: the Real Value Unit, URV.    [Senate Speaker Humberto Lucena] Congress must first  conclude  its work so that the minister can do his part. If the amendment  is approved we will immediately call a session to promulgate it  because it must be promulgated at a plenary meeting. [end  recording]</p>

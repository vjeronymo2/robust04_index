			<p><P> May 3, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEWS;  </P> <P> GENERALLY TEPID BUSINESS . . . OR AN INSPIRED COMIC WEAVE?;  </P> <P> A STAGING PLOY ENABLES THE IRVINE COMMUNITY THEATER PRODUCTION OF 'HOW THE  OTHER HALF LOVES' TO EFFECTIVELY CONTRASTS TWO COUPLES' OPPOSING STYLES -- WITH  HILARIOUS RESULTS.  </P> <P> Alan Ayckbourn uses a simple but inspired theatrical device in "How the Other  Half Loves": He allows two households to coexist simultaneously on the same  stage.  </P> <P> As they come and go in a comic weave, the similarities and differences in their  morning routines and marital skirmishes are succinctly and humorously revealed.  Before long, we learn that these opposite pairs, the upper-class Fosters (Frank  and Fiona) and the lower-class Phillipses (Bob and Teresa), have more than a  passing acquaintance: Frank is Bob's boss, and Bob has had a midnight fling  with Fiona.  </P> <P> Another couple enters the story as a result of the lies Bob and Fiona tell to  conceal their indiscretion. William and Mary Detweiler become the hapless  guests at separate but simultaneous dinner parties given by the Fosters and the  Phillipses, and the ingenious interplay of these two social disasters confirms  Ayckbourn's reputation as a concocter of mirth.  </P> <P> The Irvine Community Theater's production is remarkably sleek and clean. The  director, Beth Titus, keeps the story line clear and the pace at an even trot  (though a gallop or two would have been nice, especially in the potentially  hilarious dinners scene).  </P> <P> As the Fosters, Tom Titus and Lorraine McWilliams play well together. Titus  brings a charming bluster to Frank, although he swallows too many of his words.  McWilliams has a natural elegance that suits Fiona and a theatrical flair that  doesn't require as much mugging as she seems unable to resist. Brenda Pruitt  and J. Brad Riker create a cardboard shrew and bully as Teresa and Bob, but  they're big and broad and they keep it moving.  </P> <P> Mousey Mary Detweiler is played by Lori Whitney with a sweetness untempered by  self-doubt. And as William Detweiler, Michael O'Connor gives the most honestly  comic performance, provoking a couple of very satisfying laughs.  </P> <P> 'HOW THE OTHER HALF LOVES'  </P> <P> An Irvine Community Theater production of Alan Ayckbourn's comedy.

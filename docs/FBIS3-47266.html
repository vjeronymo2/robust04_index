			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The revolutionary  economic strategy of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK] is an  absolutely correct policy of economic construction based on a  scientific penetration into the actual conditions of the  development of the national economy of Korea, the lawful  requirements of the economic development of socialism and the  changing domestic and international situation.    Dr. Chong Kwan-yong says this in an article contributed to  NODONG SINMUN today.    He explains the reasons why the revolutionary economic  strategy of the WPK is correct as follows:    The first reason is that the strategy makes it possible to  radically improve the people's standard of living in a few years  to come and bring the advantages and vitality of Korean-style  socialism into fuller play.    To this end, state investment in agriculture, the light  industry, foreign trade and other sectors related to the  people's living will be increased and the nation's fund,  materials and equipment be directed first of all to the  development of agriculture and the increase of the production of  consumer goods and export products.    Today when the heavy industry has a solid foundation, the  agriculture-first, light industry-first and foreign trade-first  policy is a firm guarantee for steadily consolidating and  expanding the nation's economic foundation as a whole and  improving the people's standard of living.    The revolutionary economic strategy of the WPK is a popular  one because it indicates the road of rapidly developing all  sectors of the national economy which are complicatedly  interlinked by placing the desires and interests of the people  in the centre and finding the master key in that direction.    Another reason is that the strategy makes it possible to  consolidate the self-reliant foundation of the economy so that  we may live on our own strength under the new, changed situation;    It is the invariable principle of the WPK that we live on  our  own strength, firmly defending the honor and dignity of  socialism under any circumstances. We must make full material  preparations to live on our own strength if we are to defend and  accomplish the cause of socialism in face of the vicious  offensive of the allied forces of imperialism aimed at  isolating, blockading and stifling the DPRK.    The strategy makes it possible to continuously develop the  coal and power industries, rail transport and the metal industry  while concentrating on agriculture, the light industry and  export products. Thus it will strengthen the chuche orientation  and self- reliance of our economy and firmly ensure that our  people live on their own strength under any circumstances.    Another reason is that the strategy makes it possible to  secure a new base for reaching higher levels of socialism.    It is very timely and correct for our party to have set the  three years to come as a period of adjustment. And the policy  of concentrating on agriculture, the light industry and foreign  trade is so wise that we can secure a new base for higher levels.    The strategy is, indeed, patent proof of the wise guidance  of  the great leader President Kim Il-song and the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il who victoriously lead the building of the  economy, turning adversity into a favorable condition and  misfortune into a blessing with their rare wisdom and  clairvoyant scientific insight.</p>

			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULINARY SOS: RAPSCALLION OIL-FREE SALAD DRESSING STYLED AFTER PRITIKIN DIETARY  IDEALS  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: The Rapscallion Seafood House and Bar in Irwindale serves a delicious  oil-free salad dressing they call Pritikin dressing. I have looked in the  Pritikin recipe books but can't find it.  </P> <P>  -- MARLENE  </P> <P> DEAR MARLENE: The dressing is the creation of executive chef Chris Logan at  Rapscallion. "This is my understanding of what a Pritikin dressing should be --  something made with no oils, fats or sugars," he explained.  </P> <P> RAPSCALLION'S NO-OIL DRESSING  </P> <P> 1 sweet red pepper, cut up  </P> <P> 1 green pepper, cut up  </P> <P> 2 medium tomatoes, cut up  </P> <P> 1 bunch fresh basil  </P> <P> 2 cloves garlic  </P> <P> 2/3 cup pineapple juice  </P> <P> 1/4 bunch Italian parsley  </P> <P> 1/3 cup raspberry vinegar  </P> <P> 1/3 cup Dijon mustard  </P> <P> Dash dried thyme  </P> <P> Dash dried tarragon  </P> <P> Dash dried oregano  </P> <P> Dash white pepper  </P> <P> 1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce  </P> <P> Combine red and green peppers, tomatoes, basil, garlic, pineapple juice,  parsley, vinegar, mustard, thyme, tarragon, oregano, pepper and Worcestershire  in blender container.

Makes 4 cups.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: Some two or three years ago The Times published an excellent recipe  for salmon broccoli casserole using celery soup. I've lost the recipe and need  help.  </P> <P>  -- DIXON  </P> <P> DEAR DIXON: Well, you're out of luck with the recipe described, but I located  something similar using chicken in Mel Baldwin's "Down Home in L.A. Cookbook,"  a rather droll and amusing cookbook that can be purchased for $14.95 plus $1.50  postage by mail from Mel Baldwin, 1626 N. Wilcox Ave., Hollywood, Calif. 90028.  </P> <P> Baldwin is host of a radio food show. The recipe, says Baldwin, came from  Clifton's Cafeteria, where the food is "down home" in flavor and style. Like  Baldwin himself.  </P> <P> CLIFTON'S CHICKEN BROCCOLI CASSEROLE  </P> <P> 8 chicken breast halves or 2 pounds medium boneless chicken breast halves with  skin  </P> <P> Salt  </P> <P> 1 bay leaf  </P> <P> 3 to 4 onion slices  </P> <P> 3 cups fresh broccoli florets and tender top stems, cut in 1-inch pieces  </P> <P> 1 small onion, finely chopped  </P> <P> 5 stalks celery, diced  </P> <P> 1 small green pepper, diced  </P> <P> 6 tablespoons margarine  </P> <P> 1/2 pound mushrooms, sliced  </P> <P> 12 ounces cream cheese  </P> <P> 1 cup chicken broth or stock  </P> <P> Pepper  </P> <P> 1 (8-ounce) can water chestnuts, drained  </P> <P> 1 cup coarse bread crumbs  </P> <P> Place chicken in enough cold water to cover. Add 1/4 teaspoon salt, bay leaf  and sliced onion. Cover and bring to boil. Simmer 20 minutes or until  fork-tender. Reserve broth and set aside.  </P> <P> Remove skin from chicken and cut into 1 to 1 1/2 inch pieces.  </P> <P> Steam broccoli, covered, in small amount of salted water 3 to 5 minutes until  tender-crisp. Drain and cool.  </P> <P> Saute chopped onion, celery and green pepper in 3 tablespoons margarine until  vegetables are slightly transparent. Add mushrooms and cook few minutes longer.  </P> <P> Reduce heat to low. Add cream cheese and cook until melted. Add broth to thin  sauce to desired consistency (about 1 cup). Add salt and pepper to taste.  </P> <P> Mix chicken, broccoli and water chestnuts with cream cheese vegetable sauce.  </P> <P> Turn into buttered casserole. Top with bread crumbs and dot with remaining 3  tablespoons margarine. Bake at 325 degrees 30 to 45 minutes or until heated  through. Makes 10 servings.  </P> <P> Note: Salmon or other fish fillets may be substituted for chicken.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: With the holidays so close, could you print a recipe for Cranberry  Bread Stuffing that can be baked in a casserole?  </P> <P>  -- YEONNA  </P> <P> DEAR YEONNA: Certainly. You can stuff an eight- to 10-pound bird with the  stuffing or place it in a greased baking pan and bake it 30 minutes.  </P> <P> CRANBERRY BREAD STUFFING  </P> <P> 1 1/2 cups cranberries  </P> <P> 4 cups dried bread cubes  </P> <P> 1/2 cup melted butter or margarine  </P> <P> 3 to 4 tablespoons sugar  </P> <P> 1/2 cup grated or finely minced onion  </P> <P> 1/2 cup finely diced celery  </P> <P> 1/2 teaspoon dried marjoram  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon salt  </P> <P> 1 teaspoon ground sage  </P> <P> Dash black pepper  </P> <P> Dash dried mace  </P> <P> Dash dried thyme  </P> <P> Dash dried oregano  </P> <P> 1 clove garlic, minced  </P> <P> Puree cranberries in food processor. Place cranberry puree in saucepan with  bread cubes, butter, sugar, onion, celery, marjoram, salt, sage, pepper, mace,  thyme, oregano and garlic.  </P> <P> Mix well and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, about 10 minutes. Cool  before stuffing bird or meat. Makes enough stuffing for 1 (8- to 10-pound)  turkey.  </P> <P> DEAR SOS: I seem to have lost my recipe for a pumpkin roll with a cream cheese  filling. Can you help?  </P> <P>  -- READER  </P> <P> DEAR READER: Good timing.

It was a family favorite and made it many times. I have tried  to duplicate the recipe to no avail. Can you help?  </P> <P>  -- MRS. A. J.  </P> <P> DEAR MRS. A. J.: Certainly.

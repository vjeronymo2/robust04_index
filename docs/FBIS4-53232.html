			<p>BFN     [Text] Opposition parties yesterday criticized harshly Kim  Chong-pil, chairman of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party  (DLP), who made a remark justifying the May 16 military coup in  1961.    The major opposition Democratic Party (DP) charged that Kim  distorted history by calling the May 16 coup a "military  revolution."    "It is absurd for the chairman of the DLP, which alleged it  succeeded to the spirit of the April 19 Revolution, to say that  it succeeded to the May 16 military coup, too," Pak Chi-won, DP  spokesman, said.    He further said, "Kim's remark was a mockery against  history,  a deceit against the people and a challenge to President Kim  Yong-sam, who concurrently heads the DLP."    Saying that the Pak Chong-hui regime self-disintegrated  because of inner contradictions of dictatorship, Kim Su-il,  spokesman of the splinter United People's Party, said, "Kim  Chong-pil should retire from the political world."    In a lecture to students in a high school in Seoul Friday,  Kim said what he terms the May 16 revolution was planned and  carried out to develop the nation's economy above all else as a  precondition for enhancing democracy.    The late President Pak, then an Army major general, and his  military followers including Kim ousted the then democratic  government led by Prime Minister John M. Chang through a coup on  May 16, 1961, and took power.    The Chang government was founded based on the student  revolution of April 19, 1660, which overthrew the Syngman Rhee  dictatorship.    Last November, President Kim, who was inaugurated in  February  1993 after about 30 years of authoritarian rule by military  general-turned-presidents, defined the May 16 incident as a  military coup while the April 19 uprising was termed a  revolution.</p>

			<p>940617 FT  17 JUN 94 / FT Guide to World Cup Football (1): It's the spectacle that counts - Barring surprises, the trophy will go to one of a handful of top teams / Introduction Many countries may be satisfied with lesser achievements along the way but it has been clear from the start that only one of half a dozen countries had a chance of grasping the World Cup itself. This is the 15th World Cup competition. Football and the political and economic environment have changed since 1930. Fifty-eight countries have appeared in the finals. They include countries whose names no longer appear on the map - Netherlands Antilles, Yugoslavia, East Germany, unified Korea. This time the competition sees the debut of Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Russia and the return of a single Germany. Thirty-eight countries have at one time or another won a game in the World Cup finals and 20 have reached a semi-final. But when the ball stops rolling the same names crop up. Only six countries have won the World Cup. England won it once. The other five have won it 13 times between them. England are missing this time, as are Uruguay (population: 3m) which won in 1930 and 1950. The other four - Italy, Brazil, Germany and Argentina - have won a total of 11. The winners this time could again be drawn from their ranks. Germany and Argentina contested the last two finals. Germany, as West Germany, have been in four of the last five finals. Over the last two decades, even as former amateur nations in Europe and teams from Africa have become stronger, the gang of four has tightened its grip on the World Cup final. Apart from them, only the Netherlands have ever reached any of the last six finals and they lost twice. - Time and again in the last 24 years talented teams have gone home cursing their bad luck or bad form in key matches - England, the USSR, the Netherlands, Spain, France and, for the last five World Cups, Brazil - while Italy or Germany or Argentina have lifted the trophy. Argentina and Germany, it has sometimes seemed, could turn up with teams of bus drivers and still reach the final. Germany have been in three penalty shoot-outs and won them all. Argentina have won both of theirs. On their way to their three finals Argentina have won six games by a single goal. They beat the Dutch 3-1 in extra time. En route to their four recent finals the Germans won eight times by one goal. Other than Argentina and Italy only Austria, in 1978, have knocked them out in one of the last six World Cups. Regardless of how well they play and the strength of the opposition, Germany and Argentina always seem able to win. This is not just good fortune. Nor is it a question of national character or a certain style of playing. Argentina, torn between two footballing traditions, show that. In 1966, perennial World Cup failures and convinced that the world was conspiring against them, they defeated themselves in the quarter final against England. Yet the same rugged, single-minded defensive tactics, which led Alf Ramsey to dub them smugly as animals', took a less-gifted but more disciplined Argentinian team to the 1990 final. What happened in between was that a very different type of Argentinian team, committed to relentless attacking play, guided by a football romantic C sar Menotti and drawing strength from the home crowds, ended 40 years of frustration and won the 1978 World Cup, proving that Argentina was worthy of victory. That conviction has not yet left them. In 1982, Italy suddenly discovered themselves in the fifth game of the competition. After four indifferent matches they found their form against a marvellous Brazilian team, won 3-2 and went on to win the cup. But that sour taste of unfulfilled promise has been Brazil's lot in the last five World Cups. - The supreme self-confidence of a team can disappear rapidly, too. England went to Mexico in 1970 as holders, certain that they would play Brazil in the final. That certainty filled their play until the quarter final in Leon. As West Germany came from two goals behind to win in extra time they left a scar on the psyche of English football that has yet to heal. It was visible again four years ago when a succession of haggard English players trudged forward at the end of the semi-final in Turin to take the worst penalties of their lives. And yet Italy was seen as a success for English football beyond the nation's cowed expectations. Likewise the Irish lost happily in Rome in the quarter finals having progressed further than they dared hope. In Italy, the Spaniards, the Yugoslavs and the Romanians all succumbed to vertigo in the later rounds. Worst of all, the USSR waited until their last group match before producing a dazzling 4-0 win over Cameroon. Cameroon still advanced and the USSR went home dreaming of what might have been. There will be similar tales this summer. There are neurotic teams with talent - Russia, Brazil, Colombia and Italy. There are less able teams who know with absolute clarity how to make the best of their resources - Ireland and Norway. There are teams whose aims are limited. There are plenty of maybes. Brazil can win if their defence does not fall to bits. Italy could win if their attack clicks. Nigeria could spring a surprise if they can add to their undoubted talents the kind of team spirit for which Cameroon are famous. If Ireland or Belgium can scrape a few goals they could turn up in the semi-finals. The Irish start brimming with confidence following their 2-0 away win over Germany. - But only two teams arrived in the US knowing they can win. They are Germany and Argentina. It would be nice if someone punctured their confidence. Germany look vulnerable. They are an ageing team, particularly in attack and the expectation at home seems to have grown more strident, more demanding. But, as they showed in 1954 (when they defeated Hungary in the final), 1984 and 1988, they know how to beat superior opposition. But even the Germans may not overcome another unalterable World Cup tradition. When the competition is held in the Americas a Latin American team wins. That means Argentina, as tough as in 1990 but now with an added secret ingredient: an attack. The playing also tends to be better at World Cups staged in the Americas. There are more star players than four years ago. The Argentinians, Brazilians and Colombians have more flair. Even some of Europe's traditional grinders - Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Romania and Bulgaria - have acquired extra sparkle. The Nigerians offer the promise of both captivating football and ruthlessness. Here there are further grounds for hope. Fifa plans to fight the scourge of defensive football by rewarding wins in the group stage with three points, although this will not stop teams playing for penalties in the knock out. It hopes to fight the cynical take-it-in-turns fouling of creative players that knee-capped the World Cup in Italy, by instructing referees to be tougher. Referees habitually respond to such directives by getting their retaliation in early. They brandish lots of yellow and red cards in early matches then, after managers and journalists complain, lose their nerve in the knock-out matches fearing that, if they send off a parade of big-name players, Fifa will not back them. Even so, we can still hope that cynicism will be confounded and that if Diego Maradona, himself winner of Fifa's fair play award in 1986, hoists the cup over his head, he will be able to echo the timeless sentiment of players and managers and proclaim: football was the winner'.</p>

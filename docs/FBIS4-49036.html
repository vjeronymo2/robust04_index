			<p>BFN     [Text] Washington, May 2 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Chinese  Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua held talks with U.S. Secretary of  Commerce Ronald Brown and Secretary of Energy Hazel O'Leary  separately here today on the prospect of cooperation in the  fields of economy, trade, science and technology.    According to Chinese sources familiar with the talks, the  two  sides reached identical views that China and the United States,  as two big countries with decisive influence in the world, share  extensive common interests and objectives and that the building  of good relations between them is not only in the interest of  the two countries and peoples, but also contributes to the world  peace and stability.    Secretary Brown was quoted as saying that encouraging  progress had been achieved in many important areas of U.S.-China  relations. The United States, he promised, will continue to work  for developing long-term economic and trade ties with China.    Secretary O'Leary told her Chinese guests she always  considers U.S.-China relations as being full of potentialities  and that the two countries are long-term partners of economic  and trade cooperation.    The Chinese vice-premier said that a good foundation has  been  laid for the development of cooperation between the two  countries in the fields of economy, trade, science and  technology. As China is speeding up the establishment of a  socialist market economy, the Chinese market is holding out an  ever greater potential, which is also becoming a reality. This  will provide broad prospects of cooperation for the two  countries.    If things go well in Sino-U.S. relations and man-made  trammels are removed, their economic and trade cooperation will  be further expanded, the Chinese vice-premier added.    Secretary Brown was said to have reaffirmed during the talks  that the United States is firm in its support for China's  resumption of its seat as a founding member of GATT.    The Chinese sources said that the two sides also discussed  specific issues regarding the expansion of cooperation and they  agreed that the candid, pragmatic and friendly exchange of views  they had today was very useful.</p>

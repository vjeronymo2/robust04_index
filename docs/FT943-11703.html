			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Japanese to sue over ITC ruling Nippon Steel and Kawasaki Steel plan to file suit against a ruling issued in May by the US International Trade Commission (ITC) that the two companies were selling electrical steel at unfairly low prices in the US, Reuter reports from Tokyo. They plan to take the suit to the Court of International Trade and the filing would be in early August, Kawasaki said. Upholding charges by some US steelmakers, the ITC has imposed a punitive tariff of 31.08 per cent on Japanese exports of grain-oriented electrical steel.</p>

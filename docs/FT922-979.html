			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Embattled state premier steps down MR Nick Greiner, premier of New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, resigned yesterday five days after a finding against him by the Independent Anti-Corruption Commission, writes Emilia Tagaza in Canberra. He was replaced by Mr John Fahey, the industrial relations minister, who becomes Liberal party leader as well. The commission found Mr Greiner had acted corruptly in sanctioning the appointment of Mr Terry Metherell, an independent MP, to a senior public service job. Mr Greiner was forced to resign after three independent MPs who hold the balance of power in the state parliament had threatened to vote with the opposition Labor party in a no-confidence motion. Mr Greiner had offered to stand down until the Supreme Court ruled on his appeal against the commission finding and to resign if the court upheld the finding. The offer was rejected by the independents. Two other ministers also resigned yesterday: Mr Tim Moore, the environment minister, who the commission found had helped arrange the appointment to the public service job, and Mr Michael Yabsley, the tourism minister, who had said he would quit if Mr Greiner resigned. Mr Metherell, has also quit the public service position.</p>

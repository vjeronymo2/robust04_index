			<p><P> May 15, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> REDS WIN AS LARKIN REHEATS  </P> <P> Barry Larkin cooled off briefly after a blazing start this season, but the  Cincinnati Red shortstop is getting hot again.  </P> <P> Larkin extended his hitting streak to 10 games Monday night at Cincinnati with  a game-winning, bases-loaded single in the Reds' 5-3 victory over the  Pittsburgh Pirates.  </P> <P> The Reds, whose .303 team batting average leads the major leagues, overcame a  three-run, first-inning deficit to maintain the best record in baseball (22-7).  </P> <P> Jack Armstrong (6-1) gave up seven hits in six innings. Randy Myers, who  relieved Rob Dibble in the eighth, pitched two innings to get his seventh save.  </P> <P> Walt Terrell (1-2), who is 1-4 against the Reds in his career with an 8.07  earned-run average, allowed six hits and five runs in 1 2/3 innings. The  Pirates entered the game with major-league leading 2.61 staff ERA.  </P> <P> Also on Monday, Cincinnati second baseman Mariano Duncan was put on the 15-day  disabled list with severely pulled muscles in his right side. Duncan was the  Reds' top hitter, with a .382 average that ranked second in the National  League.  </P> <P> Infielder Paul Noce was called up from Triple-A Nashville to take Dincan's spot  on the roster.  </P> <P> San Diego 5, Philadelphia 1 -- Andy Benes pitched a two-hitter for his first  major league complete game and Joe Carter and Tony Gwynn each hit two-run  homers at San Diego.  </P> <P> Benes (3-3) allowed singles to Darren Daulton and pinch-hitter Curt Ford in his  17th major league start. The right-hander struck out five and walked four.  </P> <P> Carter homered off Pat Combs (2-3) in the third inning. Gwynn, who was three  for four, homered off Don Carman in the fifth.  </P> <P> Atlanta 3, Chicago 2 -- Francisco Cabrera made his first major-league run  batted in an important one, driving in the winning run with a pinch-hit single  in the eighth inning at Atlanta.  </P> <P> It was Cabrera's first at-bat after the Braves purchased his contract from  triple-A Richmond earlier in the day.  </P> <P> Reliever Dwayne Henry (1-1) earned the victory. Charley Kerfeld got Ryne  Sandberg to ground out with the bases loaded for his second save.  </P> <P> Andre Dawson hit his ninth homer and Sandberg had his sixth for the Cubs.  </P> <P> San Francisco 4, New York 2 -- Bob Knepper allowed two runs in 6 2/3 innings at  San Francisco to beat the Mets for the second time in a week.  </P> <P> Will Clark's two-run homer was his fifth for the Giants, who won for only the  third time in 14 home games this season.  </P> <P> Knepper (2-1), a 35-year old left-hander, is 3-0 with a 1.69 ERA against the  Mets over the last two seasons.  </P> <P> Steve Bedrosian earned his fifth save.  </P></p>

			<p>920720 FT  20 JUL 92 / Anti-Mafia judge killed by car bomb THE MAFIA intensified its intimidation campaign against the Italian judiciary yesterday by assassinating Mr Paolo Borsellino, the most senior magistrate fighting organised crime. He and five bodyguards were killed by a huge car bomb in Palermo, capital of Sicily. At least 15 people were injured. Mr Giuliano Amato, Italy's prime minister, promised a tough response to those who were 'at war with with the state'. He said: 'I am certain that the government, parliament and judiciary will respond with the necessary unity of intention and strength.' Last night Italy's three biggest trade unions called a general strike in Sicily for the day the victims are buried. Mr Borsellino was leaving a block of flats after visiting his mother when the bomb, planted in a Fiat 600, was detonated. Police said more casualties would have occurred had it not been a Sunday afternoon when the city was largely deserted. This was the second time in two months that the Mafia had struck in a spectacular manner against the judiciary. On May 23, Mr Giovanni Falcone, the leading figure behind the judiciary's fight against the power of the Mafia throughout the 1980s, was assassinated with his wife and three bodyguards. Mr Borsellino, who was Mr Falcone's closest friend, was widely seen as the main candidate to become Italy's new 'super-magistrate' dealing specifically with organised crime. The new Amato government had pledged to make the fight against organised crime a priority but the Mafia struck at a time when the government's attention was focused on deteriorating public finances. Significantly, the Falcone assassination also occurred at a delicate moment when parliament was dithering over who to elect as Italy's next president. For several days the authorities in Sicily have been in a state of alert over the possibility of an attempt on the life of a prominent public figure. Mr Borsellino said after the Falcone killing that he was aware he was in the sights of the Mafia. The Mafia had never forgiven him, along with Mr Falcone, for initiating the important trials of the 1980s, which demonstrated that the Mafia was a well-structured organisation of criminal families. Yesterday Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister, urged Mr Amato to call an extraordinary session of parliament to push through anti-Mafia measures approved by cabinet last month.

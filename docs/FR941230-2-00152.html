The program tests a specific intervention strategy for reducing and controlling illegal drugs and related crime in target neighborhoods and fosters healthy development among youth from drug- and crime-ridden neighborhoods. Multiservice, multidisciplinary, neighborhood-based programs are established to provide a range of opportunities and services for pre-adolescents and their families who are at high risk of involvement in illegal drugs and crime. Simultaneously, the criminal and juvenile justice systems are targeting resources to reduce illegal drug use and crime in the neighborhoods where these young people reside. OJJDP funds are used for the delinquency prevention component of the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Center has received funding from a number of foundations that has been matched by OJJDP and BJA. Based on the proposals submitted, six communities were selected to receive funds beginning in fiscal year 1992 to implement programs over a three-year period. Seattle, Washington; Memphis, Tennessee; Bridgeport, Connecticut; Austin, Texas; Savannah, Georgia; and Newark, New Jersey. Foundation and government funding ranging from $500,000 to $1 million was allocated to each community. The program will be implemented by the current grantee in the six communities. OJJDP funds will be transferred to BJA to implement the program under a BJA Grant. No additional applications will be solicited in fiscal year 1995.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Interventions To Reduce Disproportionate Minority Confinement in Secure Detention and Correctional Facilities (The Deborah Wysinger Memorial Program)_$300,000 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> National data and studies have demonstrated that minority juveniles are overrepresented in secure facilities across the country. In response to this problem, OJJDP issued regulations in 1989 requiring States participating in the Formula Grants Program to gather and assess data to determine the existence of disproportionate minority confinement and, if it existed, to design strategies to address the problem. As of February 1993, 42 States had completed the required data analyses, with all but one determining that minority juveniles were overrepresented in secure facilities. Analysis of the data indicated that minority youths are disproportionately represented at each point of decision making in the juvenile justice system. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This competitive Special Emphasis program would provide funds to States, local units of government, and nonprofit organizations to demonstrate effective interventions designed to eliminate the disproportionate confinement of minority juveniles in secure detention or correctional facilities, adult jails and lockups, and other secure institutional facilities. Activities appropriate for funding under this initiative would include such programs as:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Training and education programs for law enforcement and juvenile justice practitioners.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

"Our F-16's are  equipped for bombings, but they are not provided with smart  weapons, i.e. computer-controlled homing missiles, which  demonstrated their usefulness during the Gulf war," he explained.    "Even if other allies would provide our Air Force with this  sort of high-tech weapons, it would still be impossible, because  our pilots are not familiar with these weapons." In recent  years, the Belgian Air Force mainly specialized in  reconnaissance and defense missions.</p>

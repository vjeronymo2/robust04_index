			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 1 April (MTI) -- Russian Prime Minister  Viktor Chernomyrdin and Hungarian Prime Minister Peter Boross  signed a Hungarian-Russian deal to settle former Soviet debts to  Hungary on Friday [1 April]. An accord on eliminating double  income and capital taxation was also signed by the two prime  ministers.    Foreign Economic Minister Bela Kadar and his Russian  counterpart Oleg Davidov signed the minutes on the second  session of the Inter-Governmental Trade and Economic Cooperation  Committee, as well as a protocol on mutual goods deliveries for  this year. Industrial Minister Janos Latorcai and his Russian  counterpart Vitaly Mikhailov signed a protocol supplementary to  the 1966 agreement on establishing a nuclear power plant.  Transport and Telecommunications Ministers Gyorgy Schamschula  and Vladimir Bulgak signed a memorandum on cooperation in  telecommunications and postal affairs.    President Arpad Goncz was present. Boross said Russia had  agreed to take back used fuel cassettes from the Paks nuclear  power station. (This needs no approval from Russian  legislators.)    Chernomyrdin felt the new agreements marked major progress  in  Hungarian-Russian relations.    He welcomed the idea of as many as possible Hungarian  entrepreneurs taking part in Russian privatization. He also  praised the no-double-taxation agreement, expected to help  two-way trade grow from last year's $3.5 billion to $7 billion  this year.    Asked whether debt repayment included arms deliveries,  Boross  said negotiations were under way on the question but details  still had to be clarified by military experts.    Chernomyrdin confirmed that Russia would like to repay part  of its debts by supplying military technology, of which a list  had already been presented to Hungary. "Russia could supply  enough of these 'commodities' for Hungary to finally become a  debtor," Chernomyrdin said.    The Russian prime minister recalled that the Hungarian Army  used to buy mainly Soviet weapons, and expressed Russia's  willingness to continue these deliveries.    Asked if arms spending was not just money down the drain,  Boross said the Hungarian Army is only defensive. Hungary's  single purpose for maintaining an army is to prevent war. The  size and level of the Hungarian Army show that it only has a  security function.    Chernomyrdin said Russia welcomed Hungary's full European  Union [EU] membership bid. The Russian Federation also hopes to  join and hopes that Hungary, as a full EU member, will back  Russia.</p>

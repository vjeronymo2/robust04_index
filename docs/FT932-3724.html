			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: Debt crisis at Ferruzzi deepens FERRUZZI, the embattled agro-industrial and chemicals group, has failed to meet payments on some of its financial commitments since the end of last month. The failure indicates the depth of the crisis facing Italy's second biggest private-sector company. The news, contained in a letter from the company to its five main bank creditors, triggered a collapse of almost 6 per cent, to L760.1, in the shares of the Ferruzzi Finanziaria (Ferfin) holding company yesterday. Investors have given vent to growing fears about the group's ability to remain afloat in its present form. The falls came as a key ministerial committee in Rome met for a second day to discuss recent proposals by the Bank of Italy to allow commercial banks to take equity stakes in industrial companies. Approving the measure is vital for a widely-canvassed, but still unofficial, plan for creditor banks to swap Ferfin debt for equity to go ahead. The surprising disclosure about Ferfin's liquidity problems came in a letter, leaked to the Sole 24 Ore business newspaper, from the company to the creditor committee. Among other things, the letter reveals that Serafino Ferruzzi, the ultimate holding company and wholly-owned by members of the Ferruzzi family, headed by Mr Arturo Ferruzzi, had debts of about L1,000bn (Dollars 684.5m) at the end of last year. In a sign of the gravity of the situation, the Ferruzzis, who control about 48 per cent of Ferfin, state their readiness to put up their Ferfin shares as collateral to the banks. The Ferruzzis also declare their readiness to step back from group management and to freeze their equity holdings, as well as to open Serafino Ferruzzi to outside shareholders if necessary. A separate letter from Ferfin to the creditor banks confirms the listed company's readiness to hand over control to the bank creditors. The letter says all the group's boards of directors were ready to stand down in favour of bank-appointed alternatives, as is senior management. Ferfin's letter says it will freeze all strategic decisions, such as acquisitions, subject to approval from the banks. It also invites the five banks to bring in other institutions, particularly foreigners, into the creditors' committee. 'Our company believes the present situation, which cannot be tackled using internal resources, requires an urgent restructuring of the whole group, including the injection of fresh cash. The controlling shareholders of our company are not able to supply the financial resources necessary to put such a programme into effect'. Ferfin, which has grown ambitiously since the mid-1980s, last month announced record losses of L1,519bn and net debts of L15,123bn. Total group borrowings approach L31,000bn. Montedison, the main industrial operating subsidiary, lost L1,244bn in 1992. Shares in Montedison largely resisted the downward trend yesterday, with a fall of just 0.5 per cent decline to L975. However, the equity collapsed in after-hours trading, with a fall to a low of L880 before recovering slightly. The drop was matched by a precipitous fall in the price of Montedison's non-voting savings stock, which closed 2.5 per cent down on the day at L505 before falling further to L452 in after-hours trading.</p>

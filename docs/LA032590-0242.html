			<p><P> March 25, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WHY HE BOUGHT ECLIPSE, NOT LASER  </P> <P> I gather from your March 4 article entitled "Mitsubishi Calls Iacocca Promos  Just Sour Grapes" (that) Lee Iacocca can't seem to understand why car buyers  prefer the Mitsubishi Eclipse to its sister car, the Plymouth Laser. He states  that except for the nameplates, the cars are identical, so buying the Japanese  version is "not right."  </P> <P> Perhaps I can enlighten him a shade.  </P> <P> Last May, I thoroughly compared both the Eclipse and its twin, the Laser. In  the turbocharged versions, the two cars are not identical. The Eclipse came  standard with a deeper front air dam and a functional rear spoiler that  stabilizes high-speed performance and gives the car a more aggressive, sportier  overall look. The Laser lacked these additions.  </P> <P> Needless to say, I later bought the Eclipse but would have been happy to buy  the Laser had it come with these additions.  </P> <P> I fear the same situation will befall Iacocca when the new Dodge Stealth and  Mitsubishi 3000 GT come out this fall. Although mechanically identical, the  Mitsubishi version benefits from a slightly sleeker, more integrated-looking  body. Unfortunately, I believe these small differences will sway many potential  Dodge buyers to the Mitsubishi version.  </P> <P> Iacocca has to learn -- the small details do count.  </P> <P> JOHN M.

			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Departments battle to run jobseeker's allowance Officials at two Whitehall departments - social security and employment - are locked in battle over who will control the new jobseeker's allowance, which will replace the system of unemployment benefit. The allowance, to be introduced in April 1996, has been jointly promoted by both departments. A final decision on which of them is to administer payments has yet to be taken and could involve the transfer of a budget worth several billion pounds from social security to employment. With departments in the process of deciding what legislation they will push to have included in the 1994-95 parliamentary session, the DSS has included the bill introducing the allowance on its list of submissions. But the Department of Employment is understood to be keen that it should be the lead department in steering the bill through parliament - putting it in pole position to administer the new allowance afterwards. Winning the argument - described by one official recently as 'quite a scrum'  -would have a dramatic impact on the employment department's annual budget of Pounds 3.7bn, probably more than doubling it. The dispute is given added piquancy because of the ministers at the heads of the two departments involved. Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and Mr David Hunt, employment secretary, come from opposite ends of the Tory party's political spectrum. At present, however, the row is said to be confined largely to officials. The Budget outlined plans for unemployment benefit to be merged into a new jobseeker's allowance. The new allowance - the level of which has not been set - would be paid for six months, after which recipients would switch to income support. Under the present benefit system, most people over 18 who become unemployed receive weekly unemployment benefit of Pounds 44.65 in the first 12 months before switching to income support. In 1992-93, the government spent a total of Pounds 9.3bn on the unemployed, with a large proportion being paid out in the form of unemployment benefit and income support. Both unemployment benefit and income support currently come out of the Pounds 80bn DSS budget. It has long been accepted in Whitehall that the unemployed should be served by one department rather than two as at present. One factor in the employment department's favour is that the DSS's main legislative priority is likely to be pensions reform.</p>

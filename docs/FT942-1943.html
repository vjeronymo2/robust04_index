			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Mexico rebel chief warns of civil war Sub-comandante Marcos, the Zapatista rebel leader in the state of Chiapas, has warned of an imminent civil war in Mexico unless there is a 'democratic transition', according to an interview in La Jornada newspaper. Without offering any evidence, Marcos claimed that armed groups across Mexico were ready to rise up against the government if there was not a democratic opening, and that there would be 'war not between two armies but between many armies'. The rebel leader's comments appear intended to destabilise the political system before the August presidential election, and boost his own importance. As such they represent a further hardening of the Zapatistas' rhetoric since they turned down the government offer of peace 10 days ago. The government has refused to negotiate national political issues with the Zapatistas, although many of the rebel demands for democratic reforms have been met indirectly. Mr Ernesto Zedillo, the candidate of the ruling party, has openly criticised Marcos, saying on television that a 'minority group cannot impose its will' on the rest of the country. The kidnappers of Mr Alfredo Harp Helu, joint head of Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest bank, have threatened to kill him unless his son, his lawyer, and a representative of the Catholic church appear by tomorrow on Mexico's main television news programme and agree to pay the ransom. Mr Harp Helu, one of Mexico's wealthiest men, was abducted in March.</p>

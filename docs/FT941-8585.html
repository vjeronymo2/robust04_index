			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Markets Report: Buba relaxes policy The Bundesbank yesterday surprised the market by announcing a 0.5 per cent cut in the discount rate, confirming the outlook of lower interest rates in Europe, writes Philip Gawith. Although initially received with euphoria, the market later took a more cautious stance with the manner of the rate move raising the prospect of a fairly slow fall in rates. Although the Bundesbank cut its discount rate to 5.25 per cent, it left its key repo rate unchanged at 6 per cent. The effect of this is to improve the climate in Europe for the easing of monetary policy, without offering much indication as to the pace at which this will take place. The German example was followed by the Dutch and Belgian central banks, which both eased policy without making substantial cuts in rates. The D-Mark weakened across the board in Europe. It closed in London at FFr3.394 compared to FFr3.407 on Wednesday, and at L968.7 against the Italian lira from L974.1. Sterling finished in London nearly a pfennig higher at DM2.5559, from DM2.5471. The dollar was relatively unaffected yesterday by the German rate reduction and the release of a raft of promising economic data. It ended in London at DM1.734, a pfennig up from Wednesday's DM1.7219 close. It also rose against the yen, to Y104.325 from Y103.550. In New York, however, the dollar slipped back to finish at DM1.7222 and Y104.20. Mr Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at UBS, said the Bundesbank had been afforded a 'window of opportunity' to ease policy by good inflation figures and the recent strength of the D-Mark. He argued, however, that the decision had been predicated on a recent 'deterioration in atmosphere in bund markets and in European bond markets in general'. Investors were getting restless about the slow pace at which German monetary policy was easing. Many had bought German bunds earlier this year in anticipation of making capital gains as interest rates fell. If this were to translate into large-scale selling, the result would be to drive up long-term interest rates, an indicator the Bundesbank watches closely, and jeopardise future investment plans. Frustration in the bund market was threatening to spread into currencies too. Mr Chertkow said that earlier in the week market movements had resembled those of July last year, with the market being purely technical in orientation and removed from economic fundamentals. He said yesterday's move had probably averted this scenario. Mr Avinash Persaud, head of currency research at JP Morgan (Europe), said the Bundesbank had wanted to reassure markets that it had not departed from its long-term path of lower rates, in spite of concern over the unresolved IG Metall wage dispute and the expectation of poor January money supply figures. He said the effect of cutting the discount rate was to put a floor under the bond markets. The market's reaction yesterday to the headline announcement - a rate cut - was euph-oric. But when it later transpired that the repo rate had not been changed, disappointment set in and some of the gains in the bond and futures markets were given back. In Europe, Belgium cut its equivalent of the repo rate by only 15 basis points. The Dutch left their repo equivalent - the special advances rate - unchanged, while trimming two other rates. Austria, which is not a member of the ERM, cut its discount and Lombard rates by  1/4 percentage point. The D-Mark maintained its strength fairly well against the dollar, although it was weaker against European currencies. Mr Persaud predicted that the dollar was likely to continue trading in a similar range against the D-Mark, especially as weather-affected US data would probably inhibit the Federal Reserve from tightening policy in the near term. US consumer prices came in better than expected as they were unchanged in January compared with market expectations of a 0.3 per cent increase. The trade figures were also good, the deficit narrowing to Dollars 7.41bn in December from Dollars 9.68bn in November. The deficit with Japan shrunk by more than 7 per cent to Dollars 5.302bn. Mr Steve Hannah, chief economist at International Bank of Japan noted, however, that the deficit was still a record size and that US politicians would probably use this number to advantage. Mr Chertkow said the dollar was still being driven by the US-Japan trade dispute and predicted that it would remain weak against most currencies until this had resolved itself. He said there was a perception in the US that talking up the dollar was a 'free trade' in the sense that it was unlikely to have any serious domestic repercussions. Clarity about US/Japan relations is likely to come later this month as it is sure to feature high up on the agenda for the G7 meeting on February 26. Conditions in the UK money markets were fairly easy yesterday after the Bank of England removed most of an estimated Pounds 2.1bn liquidity shortage in an early round of dealing. The Bank put Pounds 1.75bn of liquidity into the market through two repos at the prevailing interest rate of 5 5/32 per cent. The shortage was later revised up to Pounds 2.2bn and the Bank put a further Pounds 450m into the market.</p>

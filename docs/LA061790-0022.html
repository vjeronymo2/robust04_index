			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHINGTON;  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS SCRAMBLING TO RESTORE BENEFITS FOR OLDER WORKERS  </P> <P> True or false: Older workers enjoy the same benefits as their younger  counterparts.  </P> <P> True once. False today.  </P> <P> With a U.S. Supreme Court ruling last June, 20 years of legal precedent went up  in smoke. Although the court agreed that in matters of hiring, wages and  firing, age discrimination is against the law, it ruled that the same law does  not cover benefits, such as severance pay, employee group insurance and  disability income.  </P> <P> The case that returned the Age Discrimination Employment Act to the headlines  after two decades of occasional legal skirmishes involved June Betts, a former  speech pathologist for Hamilton County, Ohio. She was diagnosed with  Alzheimer's disease at age 58, yet managed to work until she was 61.  </P> <P> Her dedication led to her eventual problems. Under Ohio's public employee  pension plan, disability retirements are permitted only through age 60. Had  Betts retired earlier and taken disability pay, she could have collected $350 a  month. Because she waited, she receives only $158 a month, the usual  early-retirement pay.  </P> <P> "Ohio PERS (Public Employees Retirement System) is penalizing my mother for  working as long as she was physically and mentally able to work, by denying her  the benefits she has earned," Carolyn Betts, a daughter of June Betts, wrote in  a May 9 letter to President Bush.  </P> <P> Betts sued, arguing that the Ohio law was discriminatory. The lower courts  ruled in favor of Betts, relying on the "equal benefit or equal cost" rule  established by the Labor Department in 1969.  </P> <P> Since the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts and went against Betts last  summer, Congress jumped into the fray. Members from both parties are scrambling  to restore things to where they were before the ruling.  </P> <P> Sens. David Pryor (D-Ark.), Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) and James Jeffords  (R-Vt.), have proposed the older workers benefits protection bill. It passed  the Labor and Human Resources Committee in February and will arrive on the  Senate floor with 41 co-sponsors within the next month.  </P> <P> Reps. Augustus Hawkins (D-Los Angeles), Matthew Martinez (D-Monterey Park),  Edward Roybal (D-Los Angeles) and William Clay (D-Mo.) are sponsoring similar  legislation in the House, where they have garnered more than 100 co-sponsors.  The House bill is expected to come up for a vote after the Senate acts.  </P> <P> Both bills state that the age discrimination legislation prohibits bias in  employee benefits, and both reinstate long-standing "equal benefit or equal  cost" regulations. Both bills also would stop employers from using anything  other than retiree health benefits as an offset against non-age-related  benefits, such as severance pay.  </P> <P> "The pensions of America's workers are federally protected and this provision  will prevent employers from using pensions to deny other benefits to older  workers," said Pryor. "It will also act as an incentive for more employers to  offer retiree health benefits."  </P> <P> Although the Bush Administration initially supported the Betts' family's  efforts, filing a "friend of the court" brief and testifying before Congress on  their behalf, it has had a change of heart and threatened to veto the  legislation.  </P> <P> The legislation has the support of advocacy groups for the aging, such as the  American Assn. of Retired Persons, and major labor unions. Business and  industry groups, such as the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the U.S.  Chamber of Commerce, applauded the Supreme Court's action and are lobbying  heavily against both bills.  </P> <P> "We are strongly opposed to the legislation as it is written because rather  than provide increased benefit protection to older workers, we fear it would  ultimately result in fewer benefits to all employees," said Ed Gilroy,  associate director of employee benefits and compensation at the National Assn.  of Manufacturers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Repairing a Snafu in Minimum Wage Law  </P> <P> There is some costly confusion on Capitol Hill about a provision of the new  Minimum Wage Law. While raising to $500,000 a year in revenue the threshold at  which a business must pay the minimum, an old exemption covering interstate  commerce somehow disappeared. That means that for many enterprises, the  small-business exemption is no more.  </P> <P> As the law now reads, any employee engaging in interstate commerce must be paid  the federal minimum wage, regardless of the employer's annual revenue. That  means that the guys unloading a grocery truck that crossed state lines must  receive minimum wage. And the clerk who places a telephone order must be paid  minimum wage, as must the waiter who accepts an out-of-state credit card.  </P> <P> "In effect, this makes the small-business exemption useless, particularly in a  business like a restaurant, where 70% of the employees might be engaged  unwittingly in interstate commerce," said Mark Gorman, senior director of  governmental affairs at the National Restaurant Assn.  </P> <P> Help may be on the way. Rep. Steve Bartlett (R-Texas) is drafting an amendment  that he hopes will remedy the situation.  </P> <P> "It was clearly unintentional," he said. "The language of the statute was clear  that we were eliminating many of the complicated exemptions and replacing them  with a one-size-fits-all threshold of $500,000. I'm told by attorneys that it  was misdrafted and resulted in the practical elimination of the small-business  exemption."  </P> <P> Bartlett said he expects the amendment to pass easily.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chamber's Ambitious Educational Goals  </P> <P> The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has gone back to school: It has founded the Center  for Workforce Preparation and Quality Education.  </P> <P> The chamber hopes to find answers to the country's education woes on the local  level and provide a bridge between community business leaders and local  educators.  </P> <P> "For employers, a deficient education system means an ill-prepared work force,  a decline in product quality, and an inability to compete," said the chamber's  prospectus for the program.  </P> <P> The center has adopted the same goals for the year 2000 that President Bush  established last fall: Have all children start school ready to learn through an  expanded preschool program, such as Head Start; increase the high school  graduation rate to 90%; have American students rank first in the world in math  and science; improve the adult literacy rate to 100%; and rid schools of drugs  and violence.  </P> <P> Information is available through the chamber at 202-463-5525.  </P></p>

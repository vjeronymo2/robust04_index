In addition to the interview, the daily  also published an "Open Letter to the State Leadership of the  Republic of Bulgaria from the Leadership of the TDP in Bulgaria."    Kenan and Hamdi level criticisms against certain DPS  leaders,  accusing them of cooperation with the KGB and the Bulgarian  special services. At the same time, the leaders of the  unregistered TDP show concern for the fate of the Khazar Turks  and Muslims living in Georgia.

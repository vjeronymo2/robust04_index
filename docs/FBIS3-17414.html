Co-Authors of the Provocation  Stay in the Shadows": "A Joke of Yesterday's Dissident"]    [Text] On Thursday, 24 March, Gleb Pavlovskiy, a  well-known journalist and editor-in-chief of the VEK XX I MIR  [The 20th Century and the World] magazine, came to our editorial  board and said that the theory of the alleged coup, which, upon  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA's publication, has been keeping both domestic  and foreign mass media in suspense for a week already, was his  "working text," a "routine working fact-sheet -- a compilation  of open data, including reports of news agencies, primarily  TASS, POSTFACTUM, and RIA, and also press, radio reports, and so  forth."    Mr. Pavlovskiy told us that "the text was prepared by  various  people using a production line method..." It is analytical  material for official use only, and it found its way into the  hands of high- ranking officials and to newspaper editorial  boards without his knowledge. Mr. Pavlovskiy believes that the  "version" was stolen from his work table or from his computer  and was distributed by "well-wishers" with whom he is not  familiar.    Having neither the possibility nor any wish to verify the  authenticity of the details given by Mr. Pavlovskiy, the  OBSHCHAYA GAZETA editorial board believes that the theory he  divulged is scarcely more convincing than the scandalous  "Version No. 1." Mr. Pavlovskiy tells a lie in calling his  "working text" "a compilation of open data." The existence of a  group of coup plotters, their names, and the details of their  "conspiracy" are a wholesale fabrication of the "version's"  authors. The way the "facts" were presented is not reminiscent,  even remotely, of the drafting of a hypothetical theory. What  kind of theory is it if the names of those who are preparing a  coup d'etat are written in black and white? It looks much more  like an anonymous report to the competent bodies. The former  dissident (and, to our great regret, a member of OBSHCHAYA  GAZETA's editorial board) appears to have forgotten how much  blood the country had to shed because of such "analytical memos."    Presumably, the author of the theory is suffering from  exaggerated curiosity and was anxious to find out how his words  would echo. That is to say, he was guided by a pure  researcher's interest. But so foolish experiments are also too  dangerous in a country with a bad heredity.    It cannot be ruled out, either, that Mr. Pavlovskiy simply  wished to get embroiled in a scandal: how can one become famous  without a scandal? This could have been done in a more humane  way, however. But we do not think it necessary to go into the  personal plans of the "Version's" author. What's done is done,  and it stinks. The author's self-esteem may be considered to  have been flattered, though: his initiative (if it is really  his, of course) turned out to have many co-authors. After all,  someone has started distributing "Version No. 2" following  "Version No. 1." This means that is has come in handy for  someone. I would dearly love to learn for whom. The  provocation's co-authors are still hidden in the shadows.</p>

			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Iraqi oil refinery resumes output after three months IRAQ'S largest oil refinery at Baiji started production this week after being forced to shut for three months by allied bombing raids in the Gulf war, according to the Baghdad newspaper, Al-Thawra. The newspaper said the refinery in north central Iraq would reach its full capacity output of 200,000 barrels a day by the end of May after some of its installations were almost totally destroyed in the Gulf war. Allied commanders said they had destroyed 80 per cent of Iraq's oil refining capacity in the Gulf war although this figure was questioned. The Baiji refinery should be producing 100,000 litres of petrol, 3.5m litres of jet fuel and 4.5m litres of diesel by next week, the newspaper said. Almost all oil products are rationed although the Iraqi news agency said this week that the country would be able to meet its domestic fuel needs in the next few weeks. Iraqi oil consumption was running at 300,000 b/d before the war. The country remains barred from export by United Nations' sanctions and export pipelines through Turkey and Saudi Arabia are closed. President Saddam Hussein was pictured on Iraqi television on Sunday at the Daura oil refinery near Baghdad inspecting reconstruction.</p>

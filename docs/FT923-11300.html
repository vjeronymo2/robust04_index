			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Albert Fisher The initial 15 per cent jump in Albert Fisher's share price yesterday might seem a graceless farewell to the man who built the company's value from almost zero to nearly Pounds 800m in less than a decade. The snag was, of course, that Mr Tony Millar then presided over the collapse in its value to some Pounds 230m in the space of 15 months. Plainly, there is scope for new management to sort out what lies behind the company's recent history of spectacular accidents. But it may not work like that. The new chairman Mr Stephen Walls, recently deposed from Arjo Wiggins Appleton, evidently has larger ambitions than running a greengrocer. The day-to-day management of the company is to devolve to the two divisional chiefs of Europe and North America. There is talk of a strategic review, involving reshaping the company through acquisition or disposal. There is no talk at all on the more pressing question of the final dividend. The company is now drifting in a period of transition. Given that the previous problem for investors was precisely the lack of clarity on what was going on, that scarcely seems a recommendation for the shares.</p>

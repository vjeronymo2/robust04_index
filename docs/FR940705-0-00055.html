			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the final rules amend &sect;&sect;1.55(c), 33.7 and 190.10(c) to incorporate text which permits registrants to satisfy the requirements of rules 1.55, 33.7 and 190.10(c) by substituting the generic risk disclosure statement as set forth below, which will be published in a new appendix to part 1 of the Commission's regulations. The Commission also clarifies herein that the generic risk disclosure statement may be used in lieu of the special disclosure addendum to rule 33.7 in connection with transactions on certain foreign exchanges which do not collect the full option premium.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effect of Alternate Disclosure Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission is hereby permitting the generic risk disclosure statement set forth herein in appendix A to rule 1.55(c) to be used in lieu of the statements required by rules 1.55 (which incorporates the risk-disclosure contained in Commission rule 30.6 for foreign futures and foreign commodity options), rule 33.7 (domestic exchange-traded commodity options) and the special bankruptcy disclosures of Commission rule 190.10(c) related to the acceptance of non-cash margin.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The approval of the generic risk disclosure statement is not intended to alter disclosure requirements other than those specifically addressed. For example, the disclosure statement would be required to be delivered prior to the opening of the account and the acknowledgement and manner of delivery of the disclosure statement ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  as a separate written statement or in a booklet) would not be altered. The Commission also would not change the requirement that compliance with requirements related to providing customers with risk disclosure statements does not relieve an FCM or IB from any other disclosure obligation it may have under applicable law. <FOOTCITE>16</FOOTCITE>  Similarly, the single signature acknowledgment procedure contained in rule 1.55(d) would continue to apply <FOOTCITE>17</FOOTCITE>  as will the amendment to CFTC rule 190.10(c) eliminating the requirement that the prescribed disclosure concerning the treatment of non-cash margin in FCM bankruptcies be acknowledged. <FOOTCITE>18</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 16 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In addition to clarifying that firms have an obligation to disclose all material facts, the Commission also wishes to clarify that firms must comply with the disclosure obligations imposed by other regulatory authorities, U.S. or foreign.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission wishes to reiterate that the single signature acknowledgment format may  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> not <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  generally be used for the endorsements required by rule 180.3 with respect to arbitration and other dispute resolution agreements  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> except <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  with respect to Qualified Eligible Participants (QEPs) as defined in rule 4.7(a)(1)(ii) and for certain persons or entities specifically within the scope of rule 4.5(a).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  rule 180.3(b)(2) (as amended by 58 FR 17495 (April 5, 1993)). Nor would the single acknowledgment affect the obligation of an FCM or IB to obtain, by instrument separate and apart from the customer agreement, a customer's consent that the FCM may knowingly take the other side of a customer's order, or to transfer funds from a customer's segregated account to an account that is not segregated.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  discussion in 58 FR 17495, 17499 (April 5, 1993).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 18 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission notes that the generic statement discloses more clearly than the statement in CFTC rule 190.10(c) that cash and non-cash margin may be subject to the same treatment in the event of a firm bankruptcy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The distribution of the generic risk disclosure statement also could substitute for the special disclosure requirements related to futures-style margining of option premiums permitted on certain foreign exchanges.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

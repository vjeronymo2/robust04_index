			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Turkish ground and Air Force units and Kurdish  peshmergas affiliated with Democratic Party of Kurdistan leader  Mas'ud Barzani have launched a major operation against the  Workers Party of Kurdistan [PKK] militants in northern Iraq.  Some 40,000 troops and 3,000 commandos affiliated with the  commando brigade on Hakkari Mountain have penetrated 5 km into  northern Iraq. The joint cross-border operation, which was  launched by the Turkish military forces on Turkey's border and  the peshmerga units in northern Iraq, is supported by several  Turkish military aircraft and Cobra and Sikorsky helicopters.    Several military aircraft, which took off from the 2d  Tactical Air Base in Diyarbakir and the Erhac Air Base in  Malatya, have bombed the Besta Valley and the heights of the  Cudi, Gabbar, Herekol, Namaz, and Kupeli Mountains. Several  Super Cobra helicopters joined the operation at about noon  yesterday.    Elsewhere, a private vehicle was destroyed by a PKK mine  near  Emekciler village in Siirt at about 1600 yesterday. The  vehicle's driver and four village guards, who were his  passengers, were killed in the incident.    Three soldiers were martyred and three others were wounded  in  a clash between the security forces and a group of terrorists  near the Tur farming settlement near the village of Islam in  Diyarbakir's Kulp district yesterday. A terrorist was also  killed in the clash.    The security forces killed four PKK terrorists in the rural  areas of Igdir's Halfeli village, two terrorists in the forest  areas of Kars' Sarikamis district, and one terrorist in the  rural areas of Hakkari's Yuksekova district.    A group of terrorists attacked the Garzan-Besiri oil  pipeline  at about 2200 the night before last. The pipeline is operated  by the Turkish Petroleum Corporation's regional directorate in  Batman. No one was killed in the incident. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Feature comprising Vilnius report by Nikolay Lashkevich and </F> a report by Leonid Mlechin: "Lithuania Takes Fright and Changes  Foreign Policy Orientation; But This Is Not the Way to Help the  Russian Minority"]    [Excerpts] [Lashkevich] Lithuania was frightened by  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev's tough statement about vitally  important Russian interests in the CIS and Baltic countries.  Its anxiety was not allayed even by the minister's reassuring  interview on Ostankino TV.    The right is triumphant: Didn't we warn you about Russia's  true face? The papers are filled with near-panic headlines and  politicians are trading claims about "Russian imperialism" and  "Russian expansionism." An official Lithuanian Foreign Ministry  statement expressed Lithuania's rejection of the "near  neighbours" concept and concern at what it regards as  unwarranted accusations of violations of human rights and of the  rights of ethnic minorities in the Baltic countries (what has  Lithuania done?) and Russia's reluctance to abandon the practice  of exerting military pressure on these countries. [passage  omitted]    The anti-Russian mood has increased with the adoption of a  steely tone by Moscow diplomats concerned about the future of  the Russian-speaking population. Unfortunately, often it is the  local Russians who come off worst because Moscow only mentions  them when addressing lofty diplomatic matters.    [Mlechin report] The most unfortunate thing for Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev is not the fact that his speech at the  conference of ambassadors in the republics of the former USSR  was not interpreted in the way he would have liked. It is the  fact that no one actually doubted that the Russian minister was  now capable of threatening neighboring states. Two years or  even one year ago diplomats would have decided that there had  been some kind of mistake and would have sought clarification.  But this time they believed it.    The political complexion of the Baltic politicians is well  known: Most of them are their own people, who have no love for  Russia and expect nothing good to come out of it. At the same  time they dream of getting rid of the hundreds of thousands of  Russians who have ended up in the Baltic area in one way or  another since 1940. They are just waiting for an excuse to  shout: "Save us from Moscow!"    If the new tough-talking approach by Russian diplomacy is a  calculated step, how does Russia benefit? Does it frighten the  Baltric countries? That is not difficult. But why try to  frighten them? In the hope of making them more amenable? Of  changing the policy vis-a-vis the Russian minority? Of keeping  Russian forces and bases on their territory? Of making them  abandon the idea of joining NATO?    It is easier to achieve the opposite. "If Kozyrev is  switching to a policy of threats, then the only salvation from  that kind of Russia is behind NATO bayonets" -- that was the  conclusion in Riga, Vilnius, and Tallinn, and possibly in other  capitals as well.    How will this conclusion affect the position of Russians in  the Baltic republics? Any indiscreet word by Moscow is  interpreted as a direct threat, and hostility toward the Russian  minority increases.    Andrey Kozyrev was better placed than anyone else to foresee  this reaction. Once former Vice President Rutskoy and other  state-control dinosaurs [supergosudarstvenniki] were calling for  strong pressure to be brought to bear on those republics where  the Russian minority does not feel comfortable. At the time  Kozyrev said: The position of the Russian minority can only be  improved by getting on with the states in which Russians live.  You will not improve their lives by threats and force, let  alone military force. Russians in the Baltic countries can do  without being feared and hated.    Has Minister Kozyrev changed his tune? Why? Has the  reality of diplomatic practice scuttled his idealism?    Or is the minister caught up in domestic political games now  that he is a deputy as well? I asked the minister whether he  himself felt that he was gravitating more toward domestic  politics? The minister totally rejected this suggestion. But  there is already talk of "early Kozyrev" and "late Kozyrev,"  with less and less in common between them. Even the minister's  vocabulary has changed, and he now insists that he was the first  to say that all the neighboring foreign countries are a sphere  of Russian interests. Of course, on the one hand, only  inveterate dogmatists never change. On the other hand, U-turns  in politics are called a change of course.    If Minister Kozyrev thinks that in this way he will be able  to satisfy those who have not acknowledged the disintegration of  the USSR and the transformation of the union republics into  autonomous states, he is profoundly mistaken. As far as those  forces and parties are concerned, he has still betrayed national  interests.    The point is not that, by abandoning the "early Kozyrev"  principle, the minister risks losing the sympathies of those who  have always supported him. Presidential support is sufficient  for the minister to keep his post. The problem is that the  Baltic countries and East and Central Europe are becoming a zone  of anti-Russian activity. And it is the task of diplomats not  to cause friction between the country and its neighbors, but to  make them friends. The "early Kozyrev" managed this.</p>

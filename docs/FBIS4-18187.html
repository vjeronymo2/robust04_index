			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Text" of document Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas </F> submitted to Gustav Feissel, UN secretary general's assistant  special envoy in Cyprus, on 29 March -- all punctuation as  published]    [Text] Subparagraph 4 of Paragraph 38 of the UN secretary  general's report, dated 1 July 1993, says the following: "The  Turkish and Greek Cypriots will be able to enter the fenced area  in Maras [Varosha] freely and without any formality."    The Turkish Cypriot side showed goodwill by agreeing to the  addition of the words "safe travel to and from the fenced area"  to the first key issue in the talks that were held to establish  the key points for the implementation of the package of  confidence-building measures. (14 February 1994)    Regardless of the specific provisions, the UN documents  dated  9 and 21 March, which are referred to as nondocuments, have been  observed to contain an inclination to deviate from the package  of confidence-building measures and create a new dimension by  placing an area outside the fenced area in Maras (that is the  road between the southern perimeter of the fenced area in Maras  and the buffer zone that is under UN control) under UN  jurisdiction.    Placing the area between the southern perimeter of the  fenced  area in Maras and the buffer zone that is under the protection  of the United Nations under UN jurisdiction conflicts  fundamentally with the guarantees the UN secretary general and  his representatives have given several times to the Turkish  Cypriot side in Nicosia and New York.    Considering the contents of the package and the guarantees  of  the UN secretary general and his representatives, and acting  with the wish to maintain a positive and constructive approach  and remain open to the idea of cooperation, the Turkish Cypriot  side proposes the following:    A. The Turkish Cypriot side undertakes to create the  conditions that will enable the Greek Cypriots to travel to and  from the fenced area in Maras freely and securely, without  formality or obstruction.    B. The entry point of the road between the buffer zone that  is under UN control and the fenced area in Maras will be  controlled by Turkish Cypriot police units, which will guarantee  unrestricted, unobstructed, and safe travel.    C. No formality will be required whatsoever for travel to  and from the entry point referred to.    D. The UN observation post in the buffer zone that is under  UN control will be able to observe activity at the Turkish  Cypriot entry and exit point.    E. UN personnel who travel in the area between the southern  perimeter of the fenced area in Maras and the buffer zone that  is under UN control will be able to observe the unrestricted,  unobstructed, and safe travel on the road referred to.    F. The Turkish Cypriot side undertakes to put into effect  all appropriate measures that may be required to further  reassure the Greek Cypriots who travel to and from the fenced  area in Maras about their security.    Considering the fact that (1) the two sides in Cyprus have  undertaken to remain sincerely committed to the package of  confidence-building measures in "the arrangements that will be  made to resolve the problems related to the implementation of  the package," (2) the UN officials will submit a report to the  UN secretary general on the implementation of the package of  confidence-building measures every six months, and (3) the  detailed package that has been drawn up by the UN secretary  general establishes a balance between gains and risks, the  Turkish Cypriot side is convinced that the above-mentioned  arrangements, which will allow the Greek Cypriots to freely  travel to and from the fenced area in Maras without any  restrictions or obstructions, fully comply with the word and  spirit of the package of confidence-building measures that the  UN secretary general outlined in his report to the UN Security  Council dated 1 June 1993.</p>

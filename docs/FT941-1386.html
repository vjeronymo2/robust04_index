			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / People: Non-executive directors Watson &amp; Philip, the Scottish-based retail and wholesale food group, has appointed a new chairman, James Watson, who replaces the late Ian Macpherson. Watson &amp; Philip's chief executive, David Bremner, says that he prefers to describe Watson's role as part-time rather than non-executive, 'as he will be spending 50-ish days a year with the company, far more than one would expect from a non-executive chairman. Watson will be much more than a figurehead, which a non-executive title might imply.' Watson remains chairman of NFC; he is also chairman of the Institute of Management. Bremner says that Watson has no family ties with the business - the shared name 'is purely coincidental'.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Bonn fears a low turn-out: Voter apathy could help the extremists The leaders of all Germany's main political parties are watching the outcome of next month's European elections with considerable foreboding. They fear that the general mood of political disaffection, compounded by a widespread feeling that the European parliament lacks real power, will lead to a low turn-out. That in turn would boost the chances of the extremist parties, such as the far-right Republicans, of gaining the necessary 5 per cent of the votes required to win seats. In speech after speech across the country, both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr Rudolf Scharping, his Social Democratic challenger, urge their audiences to go out and vote, to keep the extremists out. The government's federal information office has joined forces with the European parliament, the German Bundestag and the European Commission to finance and launch a publicity campaign to encourage the maximum turn-out. Every conceivable publicity gimmick, from a Roger Rabbit-like figure in a cinema cartoon, through specially-printed telephone cards, to mobile vans touring through towns and villages, has been roped in to galvanise the electors. And yet most political observers remain convinced that many voters will either stay at home, or vote for protest parties, come June 12. 'People are saying they can vote again (at the general election) in October,' says Dr Karl-Rudolf Korte, of the Germany research group at the University of Mainz. 'There is so much bad feeling on so many domestic political issues, I am sure people feel that this time they can let off steam.' His gloomy forecast is not entirely borne out by the latest opinion poll (see table), which suggests a big swing back to the main 'establishment' parties, and only a marginal 1 per cent voting for the far-right Republicans. But no one quite trusts the polls. Last time round, the Republicans won no less than 7.1 per cent of the national vote, considerably better than the Free Democratic party (FDP), the minority partner in the ruling coalition. All the main parties have a big interest in reversing that trend, not least by ensuring the largest possible turn-out overall. Apart from overcoming apathy, the established parties share an obvious problem in limiting the protest vote. All of them - Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), Mr Scharping's Social Democratic party (SPD), and the FDP - are more or less committed to the cause of European integration. The German public, however, has been growing gradually more cautious, above all about the process towards economic and monetary union, and the exchange of the D-Mark for a single European currency. Restrictions on the import of cheap bananas from central America have not helped. Those who feel strongly enough about it have little alternative but to vote for a protest party. An extraordinary array of no fewer than 23 different groups has been given the go-ahead to stand in the elections, ranging from the Progressive Democrats (PDS), the former East German communist party on the left, to the Republicans on the right. There is also the Alliance of Free Citizens, founded by Mr Manfred Brunner, once chef de cabinet to Mr Martin Bangemann, the senior German commissioner in Brussels, to mobilise the anti-Maastricht vote. The best thing for the big parties will be if all these smaller ones pick up a few votes, but none succeeds in crossing the 5 per cent threshold. Mr Kohl, Mr Scharping, and Mr Klaus Kinkel of the FDP, are refusing to panic. All have restated their pro-European commitment. The CSU, on the other hand, has clearly shifted towards a more Euro-sceptical stance, for fear that it will lose its seats in the European parliament altogether. It has to win around 40 per cent of the poll in Bavaria in order to gain 5 per cent of the national vote, and Bavaria is the home base for both the Republicans and Mr Brunner. Mr Edmund Stoiber, the CSU strongman and Bavarian prime minister, has expressed open doubts about the ambition of creating a European 'federal state', and about the Maastricht timetable for monetary union. The other great unknown for the major parties is how the east Germans will vote in their very first European election. Germany will have 99 members of the 567 in the next Strasbourg parliament, including 18 extra for the new east German states. Most east Germans appear to regard the European Union with suspicion. Their greatest concern is that it should be rapidly opened to include their eastern neighbours - Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary in particular - to help them revive old trading ties. It is an open question how their doubt will translate into votes. The big parties have also signally failed to mobilise European, as opposed to domestic, political themes. Dr Korte cites the case of the European parliament's own campaign poster - a scantily-clad Europa riding a sturdy bull through a flaming ring of European stars, with a motto urging voters to the polls. The poster was withdrawn after vehement protests from feminists, over its lack of taste. 'As usual, there was no controversy about European policy. It was about women's rights,' he said. 'Even the European parliament could only stir up a domestic quarrel.'  ---------------------------------------- Opinion poll standings: European elections  ---------------------------------------- Result           1989     1994*  ---------------------------------------- CDU/CSU         37.8%      38% SPD             37.3%      41% FDP              5.6%       6% Greens           8.4%       8% Republicans      7.1%       1% Others           3.7%       3%  ---------------------------------------- * Emnid Der Spiegel poll May 1994  ----------------------------------------</p>

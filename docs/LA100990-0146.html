			<p><P> October 9, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC A FIRST FOR NEW THEATER;  </P> <P> PERFORMANCE: CONCERT "MAKES A STATEMENT" THAT POP IS APPROPRIATE ENTERTAINMENT.  </P> <P> Judy Collins' concert here tonight not only represents one of the first steps  in her return to major label status (see accompanying story), but also the very  first step into pop music presentation for the new Irvine Barclay Theatre.  </P> <P> The 756-seat hall on the UC Irvine campus will be devoted primarily to theater,  dance and classical music.  </P> <P> But Douglas Rankin, president of the Irvine Barclay, said that unlike the  Orange County Performing Arts Center, this will be a place for pop, folk and  folk-rock as well.  </P> <P> "Clearly we're not a pop venue, but I'll be experimenting a bit, to see what  works," he said. With Collins, who happens to be one of Rankin's personal  favorites, "we wanted to make a brief statement that this is a form of  entertainment we certainly consider appropriate for the hall. And as we get our  feet on the ground, we'll explore other opportunities."  </P> <P> So far, Rankin said, the only other performer with a pop background booked into  the Irvine Barclay is Corky Siegel, a singer, pianist and harmonica player who  in the '60s was co-leader of the Siegel-Schwall Band, a Chicago blues ensemble.  Siegel will be backed by a string quartet in his concert on Jan. 16, 1991.IKE  BOEHM  </P></p>

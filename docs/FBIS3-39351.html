			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Bosnia Needs More"] </F>   [Text] "The situation for the population continues to be  dramatic and unacceptable. There should be no doubt about the  firm determination of NATO and its member nations to act against  those responsible so that the resolutions of the UN Security  Council are respected and the suffering brought to an end. In  this context it is essential that the Bosnian Serbs lift without  delay the siege of Sarajevo and that the heights around the city  and the means of access are placed under the control of UNPROFOR  [UN Protection Force]."    So said the North Atlantic Council (NAC), on August 9 1993.  A week earlier it had decided "to make immediate preparations  for undertaking, in the event that the strangulation of Sarajevo  and other areas continues, ...stronger measures including air  strikes against those responsible."    Six months later, the siege has not been lifted. The heights  and means of access remain under Bosnian Serb control. The  "strangulation" of Sarajevo and other areas continues. So did  the shelling, more or less continuously until, last Saturday [5  February], one shell landing in a Sarajevo street market brought  the city's agony back to Western television screens and,  thereby, jolted NATO into...well, not action exactly, but a new  meeting and a new ultimatum.    "No one should doubt NATO's resolve," says President Bill  Clinton. On past form that is exactly what one should doubt.  True, this time there is a precise deadline. The Bosnian Serbs  have been given 10 days, not to end the siege of Sarajevo but --  "with a view to ending it" -- to withdraw, or "regroup and place  under UNPROFOR control" their heavy weapons located within 20km  (12.5 miles) of the city centre. After that, such weapons not  under UNPROFOR control will be "subject to NATO air strikes."  <H5>  Inhibiting factors </H5>   No further meeting of the NAC is required, and the "request"  from the UN secretary-general has already been received --  though "close co-ordination" with him, as the person to whom UN  commanders on the ground are answerable, will still be necessary.    Last year, the concern of UN commanders for the safety of  their troops was one of the main inhibiting factors. Now, it  seems, that factor has changed sides. General Jean Cot, the  overall UNPROFOR commander, and General Sir Michael Rose, the  commander in Bosnia, both favour a tougher line to restore some  credibility to their mandate. They see air strikes, or at least  the credible threat of them, as a useful, perhaps even  essential, element in that strategy. NATO's excuses for not  acting, if its bluff is called, are running out.    One familiar excuse has reappeared, in the shape of strong  protests from Russia. But Western governments can hardly allow  good relations with Russia, however desirable in themselves, to  be their only objective. And Russia, for its part, should  consider the effect on Western and Moslem public opinion if it  appears to aid and abet the Serbs in a policy of starvation,  massacre and conquest.  <H5>  Maximum Confusion </H5>   So the Serbs would be unwise to call NATO's bluff, and the  signs are they are not going to -- at least not directly or  immediately. They have promised to move their guns and observe a  ceasefire. But they are masters of prevarication. (Remember  their symbolic but tactically meaningless withdrawal from Mount  Igman last August.) It would be altogether in character for  them to move some weapons, invite UNPROFOR to take "control" of  others in circumstances which make UN soldiers effectively their  hostages, and then accuse the Bosnian government either of  breaking the ceasefire or of concealing some of its own weapons,  or both, so creating maximum confusion. It is equally likely  they will increase the pressure elsewhere in Bosnia, most  obviously on the Canadian garrison at Srebrenica.    Relief of the Canadians by a Dutch contingent had been  proceeding more or less smoothly. It seems incredible that  NATO's latest decisions make no mention of this, nor of opening  the airport at Tuzla, the two specific demands made by the NATO  summit exactly a month ago. If NATO had a strategy in Bosnia it  should have reiterated these two demands and made them subject  to the same deadline. The airport at Tuzla, especially, offers  the only real hope of relief for suffering civilians in central  Bosnia and thus also the only hope of restoring credibility to  the entire UN operation -- as the letter on the opposite page,  from the Oxfam representative there, points out. It is also  crucial to any strategy for maintaining even part of Bosnia as a  viable state under government control, which must be the  centrepiece of all peace plans and mediation efforts.    But NATO does not have a strategy. It has only a spasmodic  reflex of reacting to events under public pressure.</p>

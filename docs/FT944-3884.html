			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / Food and Drink from Italy: Where Parma ham is king Parma is home of the sweetest nosegay of spring, and this city, like its violets, is small, elegant and charming. I was captivated, on leaving the cathedral, to witness the unveiling of the baptistry after its cleaning. Workmen shouted and tugged. Plastic and tarpaulin shrouds draped over the scaffolding fell away gradually and the beautiful building emerged like a wet-winged butterfly from its chrysalis. Like Bologna and Modena, Parma was governed for generations by local nobility but the foods of Parma seem more sophisticated than those of Bologna and Modena - the pasta is more delicate, the pork products are more restrained. This may be due in part to long years of government by the Farnese family and to the subsequent influence of Maria-Luigia, Duchess of Parma. The duchess (daughter of Francis I, Emperor of Austria, and second wife of Napoleon) employed two French chefs from her days as Empress of France, as well as an Italian chef and pastry cooks from her native Vienna. These last introduced yeast pastry confections to Parma - lighter and more refined than Austrian patisserie. Cafe Torino in the centre of Parma is famous for them. Parmesan cheese - more specifically called Parmigiano-Reggiano to distinguish it from others in the same family - is one of the world's great cheeses. The real McCoy has the words 'Parmigiano-Reggiano' pinpricked all over the sides and a stencil giving the date of making and the maker's code to prove its excellent provenance. Cheeses that fail their exams (and Parmigiano-Reggiano is rigorously tested at various stages during production) have the proud legend 'Parmigiano-Reggiano' cancelled by ignominious Xs. Parmigiano is famed as a grating cheese, especially for dressing pasta, but increasingly I enjoy it as a table cheese - the less elaborate the context, the better it shows off its flavour. Shaved into flaky curls with a swivel-bladed potato peeler, it sets the gastric juices flowing as a first course salad, scattered over wafer-thin slices of bulb fennel dressed with olive oil and lemon. I also love it served at the end of dinner with quartered juicy pears. Or on its own instead of amuse-gueules with pre-dinner drinks. Emilians insist the king of cheeses should never be sliced. So cut, dig, chip or hack it into craggy wedges instead, using a purpose-made Parmesan knife (a bit like an oyster knife without the guard) that encourages the cheese to break into jagged splinters following the natural seams. The pig (which grows fat on whey left in the vat after cheesemaking) reigns supreme in the duchy of Parma. A notable feature of pork products here is how few extras they include. A little salt, some pepper maybe, but rarely more as the meat of local pigs has, by tradition, so much character of its own. Spalla, or shoulder, can make succulent, sweet, cooked ham but uncooked, cured meats are generally preferred. From Felino, just south of Parma, comes Felino salami, one of the most pleasing. The best coppa (a meaty muscle of neck fillet) is made near Piacenza. The marshlands of the Po valley north of Parma are home to exquisite culatello, made from the best part of the buttock. A rarer treat than Parma ham, it is whispered about and so highly prized by local cognoscenti that you are unlikely to find it outside the duchy. But Parma ham is king. DOC-controlled, each leg is branded with the five-point ducal crown of Parma and bears a seal stating the place and date of making so it can be traced right back to the farmer who raised the pig and the man who salted it. Like the individual identification of each and every Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, this shows proper pride in food production. The breezy hills round Langhirano, south of Parma, provide the ideal environment for curing Parma ham (the very opposite of the foggy stillness on which culatello production depends). The carefully selected legs, lightly massaged with salt, rinsed and partially smeared with lard, are hung for 10 to 12 months in wonderfully odiferous ageing rooms, shuttered or fully ventilated depending on the weather. The result is raw ham of elegant and distinctive savour, finely textured with pale lingerie-pink lean and a good ratio of fat. It falls silkily from the knife when carved. Outside Langhirano - in the shadow of Torrechiara, a 15th-century fortress - lies the Ristorante Gardoni. I was taken there for lunch after a morning watching and learning about the making of Parmigiano and Parma ham. A modest establishment, a splendid meal. We began with generous plates of local pork meats. There was excellent Felino salami; coppa; cotechino; smooth-grained and delicate spalla cooked on the premises; prosciutto di Parma of roseate hue in slivers as fine as a magician's handkerchief, the very best I have ever eaten; culatello, 'the noblest cut of all', softer textured, darker and more mellow than the Parma ham. For crunchy contrast there were ciccioli (pork scratchings) still hot from frying to draw the lard out of them. And glasses of chilled Malvasia Frizzante. Then came tortelli alle erbette, a dish of finesse and Parma's pasta speciality: pockets of egg pasta filled with ricotta and spinach (variations call for spinach beet or chard) lightly seasoned with nutmeg, the whole dusted with Parmesan cheese and dribbled with melted butter. I am afraid I cannot recall what came next. Maybe I skipped a course having feasted so well on the first two. But I remember cakes were served with a very sweet, elderflowery Malvasia Dolce for dessert. Finally, we sipped green walnut liqueur, another local speciality. Then it was high time for a siesta.</p>

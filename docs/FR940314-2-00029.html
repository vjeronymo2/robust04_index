			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Allegations of Sales Below Cost of Production  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Petitioners allege that Forges de Thy-Marcinelle, a potential respondent in the Belgium investigation, is selling the subject merchandise in the home market at prices below its COP. This allegation is based on a comparison of company-specific home market prices with the COP. COP was based on the costs of a comparable U.S. producer adjusted for known differences in the country of production.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the information presented, we have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the home market sales of Forges de Thy-Marcinelle are being made at less than COP. See Memorandum to Marie E. Parker from C.M. Miller dated March 4, 1994, which is on file in the Import Administration Central Records Unit. Accordingly, pursuant to section 773(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.51, we will initiate a COP investigation with respect to this company if it is named as a respondent in the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Petitioners also allege that specific potential respondents in the German investigation are selling the subject merchandise in the home market at prices below their COP. These allegations are based on a comparison of company-specific home market prices with the COP. COP was based on the costs of a comparable U.S. producer adjusted for known differences in the country of production, and/or company-specific information, and on the company's financial statements, when applicable. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the information presented, we have reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that the home market sales of the following German producers are being made at less than COP: Stahl-und Walzwerk Brandenburg GmbH, Saarstahl AG, and Thyssen Stahl AG. See Memorandum to Marie E. Parker from C.M. Miller dated March 4, 1994, which is on file in the Import Administration Central Records Unit. Accordingly, pursuant to Section 773(b) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.51, we will initiate COP investigations with respect to each of these companies if they are named as a respondent in the investigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alleged Dumping Margins  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The range of positive dumping margins of SWR from Belgium based on price-to-price and price-to-CV comparisons of USP to FMV alleged by petitioners, corrected for minor errors, is 5.69% to 52.34%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The range of positive dumping margins of SWR from Germany based on price-to-price and price-to-CV comparisons of USP to FMV alleged by petitioners, corrected for minor errors, is 2.77% to 72.09%.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Initiation of Investigations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have examined the petitions for SWR from Belgium and Germany, as amended, and have found that the petitions meet the requirements of section 732(b) of the Act. Therefore, we are initiating antidumping duty investigations to determine whether imports of SWR from Belgium and Germany are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value. If these investigations proceed normally, we will make our preliminary determinations by July 25, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ITC Notification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 732(d) of the Act requires us to notify the International Trade Commission (ITC) of these actions and we have done so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Preliminary Determinations by the ITC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ITC will determine by March 31, 1994, whether there is a reasonable indication that imports of SWR from Belgium and Germany are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry. A negative ITC determination in any of these investigations will result in its termination; otherwise, the investigations will proceed according to statutory and regulatory time limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice is published pursuant to section 732(c)(2) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.13(b). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: March 7, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Joseph A.

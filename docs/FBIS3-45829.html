The four-lane bridge, which will be 12 km long -- 8.5 km  across open sea -- will connect Nanao County, 160 nautical miles  from Taiwan, with the continental part of Shantou, one of the  earliest opened-up areas in China.    The bridge is part of the effort of Shantou to catch up with  the four "little dragons" in Asia -- Taiwan, Hong Kong,  Singapore and the Republic of Korea -- within 20 years.    The bridge and underwater pipes which will carry fresh water  to the island county will cost 1.2 billion yuan.</p>

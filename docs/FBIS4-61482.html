			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colonel General Vladimir Semenov by </F> Aleksandr Sidyachko under the "Hello!" rubric: "Peacekeepers  Getting Ready for Battles"]    [Text] The Russian-American peacekeeping forces exercises  scheduled for July at the Totsk training ground of Orenburg  Oblast are under threat of disruption. The State Duma has asked  Yeltsin "to look into the question of the wisdom of the  exercises," and the Foreign Ministry and the Defense Ministry  has been asked to think of holding maneuvers on the territory of  a NATO state. The Russian Federation president, according to  his press service's report, treated with "understanding the  parliamentarians' arguments" and recommended to the military to  hold additional consultations with the Americans "taking account  of both the postures of the Russian lawmakers and those voiced  by the public in this connection." OBSHCHAYA GAZETA  correspondent Aleksandr Sidyachko called Colonel General  Vladimir Semenov, commander in chief of Russia's ground forces,  to ask for his comments on the situation that has taken shape  around holding this operation.    [Sidyachko] Vladimir Magomedovich, the top lawmakers were  especially angered at the fact that the exercises are being  planned on the territory of Russia. They are inclined to  interpret them as a rehearsal of America's future invasion....    [Semenov] During last spring's Vancouver meeting of the  presidents of Russia and the United States, an agreement was  reached on joint peacekeeping actions of the two countries.  Then the Americans proposed, within the framework of military  cooperation, to hold a peacekeeping exercise on their territory.  But we declined. It would have taken several million dollars to  move the men and equipment across the ocean. We do not have the  money. As for a NATO country, we proposed this option to  Germany, where the U.S. 3d Infantry Division is stationed. The  Germans declined. And then we made a decision to hold the  exercises on the training ground of the 27th Russian  Peacekeeping Division in Totsk.    [Sidyachko] The majority of Duma men hold the opinion that  America is to pay all the exercise expenses for Russia. And  it's you pay your money, you takes your choice, you know....    [Semenov] This is not so. The Americans are to pay all the  expenses involved in the participation in the exercises of the  3d Infantry Division, food, renting the airfield, the landing of  planes with equipment included. As far as our 27th division is  concerned, these maneuvers were included in the combat training  plan as early as last year. Thus each pays only for himself.    [Sidyachko] Why these exercises at all?    [Semenov] I want to specially underline: they are going to  be command and staff exercises. More than 250 men are to take  part in them on each side. The Russian Armed Forces are to  contribute the staff of the 589th Motorized Rifle Regiment of  the 27th Division, the staff of the 2d Motorized Rifle Battalion  and one of its companies. The U.S. Armed Forces are to  contribute the staff of the 1st Brigade of the 3d Infantry  Division (20 men), the staff of the 1st Battalion of the 15th  Infantry Regiment (20 men), and Company "C" (101 men). The  equipment includes 50 wheeled vehicles and about 20 trailers.  No tanks, armored vehicles, field guns, and mortars are to be  used.    The objective of the exercises is to forge common approaches  to the planning and conduct of peacekeeping operations, to  practice the mechanism of coalition peacekeeping troop control.  The Americans have vast experience in holding such operations.  They will demonstrate the technique of separating feuding  sides, share their experience in escorting humanitarian freight,  in the performing of joint duties at checkpoints, in the  provision of aid to refugees. Today the world body has  recognized two types of peacekeeping actions: operations in  enforcing peace (for example, NATO bombing in Bosnia and  Herzegovina; they, as experience shows, are not effective --  A.S.) and peacekeeping operations where all violence toward the  indigenous population is ruled out. Practicing the second  option is indeed the objective of the upcoming exercises.    [Sidyachko] In the wake of the Duma's statement on where it  stands in regard to the exercises, how could you argue for the  need to hold them?    [Semenov] The United States justly believes that Russia will  also in the future have its interests in many regions in the  world and seek to exercise its influence on them. And here the  best way out would be to look for compromise solutions rather  than a standoff that will not benefit any side.</p>

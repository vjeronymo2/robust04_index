			<p>920812 FT  12 AUG 92 / Correction: Britannia Hotels Ltd IN A REPORT of the latest Labour Research Department survey of directors' pay (August 3), it was said that Britannia Hotels had made a loss of Pounds 8.5m at a time when its directors Mr Michael Morton and Mr Alexander Langsam had received a 98 per cent pay rise, taking their pay to more than Pounds 4m each. The LRD figure was incorrect. The company made a profit of Pounds 216,093 after payment of the increased remuneration to the two directors. In any event, as Mr Morton and Mr Langsam are the sole shareholders it is entirely up to them whether profits are distributed as dividends or salary. The FT apologises for any contrary impression given by its report.</p>

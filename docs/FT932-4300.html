			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Chinese leadership drifts and divides: Overheating economy hinders easy transition to life-after-Deng JUST TWO months after China's media hailed a showcase parliamentary session designed partly to bolster collective leadership, the best-laid plans for a smooth transition to a post-Deng Xiaoping era appear shaky. The continued absence from public view of Mr Li Peng, the ailing premier, intensifying concerns over Mr Deng's own health, worries over economic overheating, clear signs of factional manoeuvring within the leadership and a hesitant performance by the ruling Communist party, are all factors contributing to an impression of drift. 'I feel that things are quite unstable, almost like 1988. Things seems to be running away, lacking direction. The overwhelming impression is one of drift,' said a western official who monitors internal developments. While China's economy continues to rocket ahead, the political ground appears to be shifting and leadership foundations that Mr Deng had put in place seem more insecure; not that his choices of personnel to carry on his work ever inspired a great deal of confidence. Mr Li Peng's illness - he is believed to have suffered a heart attack in the last week of April - and thus his withdrawal from an active leadership role has merely served to expose flaws in the collective structure that the 88-year-old Mr Deng had hoped would be an enduring legacy. Among more revealing developments recently has been the conspicuously more assertive performance in Mr Li's lingering absence of Mr Jiang Zemin, China's party boss and recently-appointed state president. Mr Jiang, aged 67, whom Chinese propaganda has been referring to as the 'core' of the new leadership based on the seven-member politburo standing committee, is being accorded much more prominence in the government-controlled media. This has been accompanied by reports of him moving political cronies from his days as mayor of Shanghai into key positions in the central government, the security apparatus and the media. He has also intervened in the economic debate, urging restraint on growth and an intensification of the campaign against corruption and 'money worship'. In forthright comments on the economy he was trespassing into an area not previously in his domain, and which risked bringing him into conflict with the reformists patronised by Mr Deng. In a speech delivered on April 1, immediately after the annual session of the National People's Congress endorsed Dengist 'high growth' policies, Mr Jiang warned of 'major upheavals' unless the economy was reined in. He mentioned specifically dangers of inflation and a widening gap between rich and poor. His intervention - discussion about an overheating economy has been raging for months in the Chinese leadership - was not revealed until it was published in late May in a Chinese-funded Hong Kong magazine. His remarks were then given prominence in the mainland press, but, what is intriguing, the People's Daily put its report of Mr Jiang's speech beside an editorial calling for faster reform of the 'socialist market economy'. Such juxtaposition of apparently contradictory views on the central issue facing China tended to give credence to talk of divisions in the leadership, with the economy providing the battleground for a broader contest. In this uncertain period the military is assuming more than usual importance, and already there are signs that leadership contenders are courting key military personnel. Amid fears that the economic boom will bring about a political loosening, and thus an erosion of party control, political campaigns aimed at 'strengthening ideology', such as the present appeals to altruism, appear forlorn. 'I think they're very confused,' a western official said of party propagandists. 'It's almost as if they're trying to remind themselves of what communism is. They really have no new ideas. People don't want to hear about struggling hard. That's what they've done all their lives.'</p>

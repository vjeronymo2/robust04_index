			<p>Article   Type:BFN     Beijing Central Television Program One Network in Mandarin  at 1310 GMT on 6 February broadcasts the first of a 10-part  series consisting of nine lectures, and one question and answer  session, entitled: "TV Lecture Series on Several Current Major  Programs for Reforming the Economic System."    The first lecture, entitled: "The Great Significance and  Main Points of the 'Decision' adopted by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee," is given by Zeng  Peiyan, vice minister in charge of the State Planning Commission.    Zeng begins by briefly introducing the 10-part series, which  is cosponsored by the CPC Central Committee's Propaganda  Department and State Council's General Office, and is aimed at  helping viewers "accurately grasp the contents of the several  major reform programs currently going on in the finance and  taxation, banking, foreign trade, investment, and enterprise  systems." According to Zeng, the titles of the remaining eight  lectures are: The Industry and Business Tax System, The Foreign  Exchange Control System, Separated Financial and Taxation  System, The Banking System, Mechanisms for Price Formulation,  The Financial Investment System, The Foreign Trade System, and  The Modern Enterprise System. The final part in the series is a  question and answer session on the lectures.    As he turns to the subject of first lecture -- the decision  on establishment a socialist market economic structure -- the  vice minister underscores the "profound, practical, and  far-reaching historical significance" of the decision, hailing  the major CPC document as "a concrete expression of Comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese  characteristics" and "program of action for building a socialist  market economy." He cites the decision at length to explain the  development of productive forces as the basic task of socialism,  saying: "The socialist market economic structure is linked with  the basic system of socialism, and the establishment of this  structure is aimed at enabling the market to play the  fundamental role in resource allocations under macro- economic  control by the state." Hence, in the course of reform, he  stresses that we must "decide on the various steps of reform and  judge their success or failure by always adhering to the basic  criterion of whether they help develop the productive forces of  socialist society, enhance the overall strength of the socialist  state, and improve the people's living standards." He outlines  the contents of the decision, which consists of 50 sections in  10 parts involving reforms in various aspects of Chinese  economic life, as well as stresses the need for the CPC to  strengthen leadership in striving to initiate the socialist  market economy by the end of this century. Describing the  "basic features" of the decision, he notes its consistency in  summarizing experiences in socialist construction since the  PRC's founding and its emphasis on coordination between various  reform programs.    At 1350 GMT the vice minister concludes the lecture by  saying: The establishment of socialist market economy is a  pioneering undertaking unprecedented in history and it requires  tackling many extremely complicated problems. However, so long  as the Chinese people unswervingly adhere to Deng's theory and  the party's basic line, they can stand all kinds of tests and  successfully achieve the great goals of reform, opening to the  outside world, and modernization.</p>

			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Finding a monthly top-up for the coffers - The options open to investors seeking a regular income INVESTORS looking for income are having a rough ride in the present climate of low interest rates. Those needing monthly income will find it even harder to obtain good rates, since the choice is more limited. However, a year can be a long time to wait before an injection of funds for those retired or mainly dependent on savings for income. So, what are the best options open to those seeking monthly income? The choice depends on the amount of risk the saver is prepared to take, the length of time for which capital may be tied up and the degree to which capital may be run down in order to meet income needs. Mailesh Shah, of London-based advisers William Mercer Fraser, cautions: 'Investors should be concerned not only with the initial level of income from their investments but also with the prospects of that income increasing to keep pace with inflation.' Deposit-based investments are secure (if the institution harbouring them is sound). The returns do not usually depend on capital being tied up for long and they therefore represent a convenient way of holding money for most people. By contrast, equity-based investments involve risking capital. To get the best from the stock market, an investment usually needs to be left untouched for a long time to smooth out the market's ups and downs. For this reason, shares are theoretically not the ideal investment for a person seeking income. However, a class of funds - income funds - have been specifically devised to address this problem, with fund managers choosing companies which pay high dividends rather than those aiming primarily for growth. The snag is that dividends can always be cut. Those totally averse to risk will want to keep holdings in cash but many people could consider holding both forms of investment and there are a number of ways of doing so. Cash The simplest way of holding cash is in a bank or building society. Investors should be aware of prevailing rates of inflation to gauge the real rate of return being offered to them. The table, provided by Moneyfacts, shows the current highest rates on accounts offering monthly income. Many banks and building societies offer fixed-rate bonds and the table shows the most attractive currently available. However, since base rates are historically low at the moment, now is not the best time to lock in to fixed rates. For example, Halifax's five-year guaranteed reserve bond is paying 7.72 per cent gross, equivalent to 5.79 per cent net for a basic-rate taxpayer. This may be an acceptable rate at present, but if base rates go up within the next five years, it is likely to appear very unattractive, particularly if it is accompanied by a rise in inflation. Providence Capitol last year launched a building society bond which invests in the deposits of the top ten building societies and aims to give higher than average returns. It is a single-premium insurance bond which gives higher rate taxpayers increased flexibility. Guaranteed income bonds usually pay out annual income but some offer monthly income. The highest rates available on sums of Pounds 50,000 are shown in the table. Money is invested with an insurance company for a fixed period and, in exchange, the saver is paid a guaranteed rate of interest. However, Robert Leonard of fee-charging advisers Moores Marr Bradley does not recommend Gibs at present because of low interest rates. National Savings Income bonds pay monthly income but, as with the fixed interest products, current rates of seven per cent gross are historically low. The minimum investment is Pounds 2,000 up to a Pounds 50,000 maximum. Interest is paid gross and there is a three-month notice period for withdrawal of the capital. Equity-based products A number of insurance companies offer monthly income accounts although these may have been given a bad name because of the recent debacle over the advertising by Scottish Widows of its Monthly Bond. The bond's promise of 'up to 9.20 per cent net of basic rate tax fixed for five years' is being investigated by Lautro, the regulatory body for the insurance industry, as possibly misleading. The bond is what is known as a 'back-to-back investment' in which part of the capital sum goes into a temporary annuity, and the remainder into a Personal Equity Plan which attempts to grow enough to replace the capital lost in the annuity. Returns from the Pep cannot be guaranteed, which is why the advertisement may have been misleading; there is a real risk that investors may lose part of their capital. The concept of 'back to back' investment is a useful one, however. There are a number of choices when it comes to the investment to replace the capital. Apart from Peps, unit or investment trusts can be used, though these are relatively high risk. Leonard believes a with-profits bond would be less risky, while higher-rate taxpayers could consider a Business Expansion Scheme. James Higgins of fee-based advisers Chamberlain de Broe suggests combining the annuity with the recently-launched sixth issue index-linked National Savings certificate, which pays 3.25 per cent compound per annum over the retail price index, if held for five years. This has the virtue of being completely risk-free and carrying no charges, but the investor will be limited by the Pounds 5,000 maximum holding. Unit and investment trust funds usually pay out income annually but there are some that make monthly distributions, for example, the M&amp;G Treasury fund (see below). Higgins recommends the income shares of split-level investment trusts which distribute at various times of the year. He suggests constructing a 'ladder' of various shares, so that the investor could ensure that he receives regular income throughout the year. With-profit investments bonds can also pay out monthly but Shah of London-based advisers William Mercer Fraser says: 'High rates of withdrawal can lead to capital erosion. If withdrawals are taken for the with-profits bond, it is important that the market value adjustment does not apply to units encashed for that purpose.' The adjustment is a weapon of last resort used to cushion the blow to a unitised fund by lowering the value of the units if too many people withdraw from it.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- HIGHEST MONTHLY INCOME ACCOUNTS  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                    Minimum     Rate Institution                    Account     Notice  Deposit  percent                                                   (Pounds)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- VARIABLE ACCOUNTS (gross)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Britannia BS             Capital Trust    Instant    5,000     7.60 Bristol &amp; West         Balmoral Income     30 day    2,000     7.72 Scarborough BS                Ninety 3     90 day      500     7.02 Manchester BS            3 Year Income     3 year    5,000     9.34* Chelsea BS                  Premier V1    31/3/95   10,000     9.57**  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FIXED RATE ACCOUNTS (gross)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Exeter bank        Capital growth bond     1 year    5,000     7.00 Alliance &amp; Leicester   Fixed rate bond     2 year    5,000     6.50 Abbey National       Fixed rate invest                                   bond    1/12/94    2,500     6.50 National &amp; Provincial       Fixed rate                              reserve 2    31/3/95    5,000     7.00 Halifax BS          Guaranteed reserve     3 year   10,000     6.97                                            4 year   10,000     7.16                                            5 year   10,000     7.72  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- GUARANTEED INCOME BONDS (net)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alico                                      1 year   50,000     5.32                                            2 year   50,000     5.60 Liberty Life                               3 year   50,000     5.88 General Portfolio                          4 year   50,000     6.00                                            5 year   50,000     6.18  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Moneyfacts, *Rate guaranteed to 31/1/93. ** to 1/4/93.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

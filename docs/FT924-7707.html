			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases on options settlement THE settlement of November stock index options dominated activity, and share prices finished slightly lower on index-related selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 46.14 to 16,330.79, down 3.2 per cent on the week, after a low of 16,174.72 and a high of 16,457.17 just before the close. The index gained ground on buying by investment trusts in the afternoon, but lost steam in the last few minutes on arbitrage-unwinding and index-linked selling. Volume rose to 320m shares from 215m on option-related activity. Traders said some 200m shares changed hands in the first hour of the morning on activity related to the fixing of settlement prices of November option contracts. 'The rest of the day was very, very lacklustre,' said Mr Brian Tobin at SG Warburg Securities. Declines led advances by 510 to 414 with 181 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 4.64 to 1,242.24 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 0.78 to 1,001.48. Institutional and foreign selling depressed high-technology blue chips. NEC lost Y13 to Y627 and Fujitsu fell Y1 to Y510. Financials were lower on grim earnings prospects. Sumitomo Bank fell Y10 to Y1,700 and Nomura Securities lost Y10 to Y1,320. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker which announced a 83 per cent rise in interim pre-tax profits, surged Y200 to Y9,350. Investors were encouraged by the view of some analysts that the company's forecast of a 50 per cent rise in annual pre-tax profits was too modest. 'Theme' shares were traded actively among speculators. Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, rose Y20 to Y1,300 and Meiji Milk Products added Y23 to Y890. In Osaka, the OSE average gained 44.36 to 17,681.56 in volume of 17.1m shares. Bargain-hunting boosted pharmaceutical and machinery stocks, with Ono Pharmaceutical up Y160 to Y5,220 and Mori Seiki up Y100 to Y1,650. Nintendo, the video game maker lost Y50 to Y9,840 on profit-taking. Roundup PACIFIC Rim markets had a mixed day at the end of an eventful week. HONG KONG fell as fresh Chinese attacks on Hong Kong's moves to widen democracy sparked profit-taking that all but erased the gains of this week's record-setting rally. The Hang Seng index closed 80.55 lower at 6,366.56, up only 0.8 per cent on the week, in turnover of HKDollars 3.24bn. HSBC Holdings again led turnover at HKDollars 365m, falling HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 65.50 in the wake of its HKDollars 5bn placement on Wednesday. But Hongkong Telecom gained 15 cents to HKDollars 9.80 on active turnover of HKDollars 194m. AUSTRALIA closed a bearish week 3.8 per cent lower as the All Ordinaries index closed down 3.6 at 1,371.7, but off its early morning low of 1,368.9. Turnover was reasonable at ADollars 244.9m. SINGAPORE closed slightly higher after the government announced a healthy 5.6 per cent GDP growth in the third quarter. The Straits Times Industrial index rose 5.77 to close at 1,446.80, up 2.4 per cent on the week. KUALA LUMPUR closed mixed after further buying alternated with bouts of profit-taking. Falls in some major component stocks pushed the composite index down 1.61 to 650.62, unchanged on the week. SEOUL recouped early losses on a wave of institutional buying and the composite index gained 15.98 to 652.97, for a rise of 1.2 per cent on the week. TAIWAN's weighted index ended 15.38 down at 3,555.51, but rose 0.6 per cent on the week, as turnover fell to TDollars 5.18bn, a new three-year low. MANILA edged higher on bargain-hunting but some investors remained cautious because of the domestic electric power crisis. The composite index was 5.93 higher at 1,346.92, steady on the week.</p>

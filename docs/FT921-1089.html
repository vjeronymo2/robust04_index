			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / World Trade News: EC fears US steel trade clash THE prospect of failure to negotiate a new multilateral code for the steel trade by the March 31 deadline is causing concern in Brussels, which fears a rash of US anti-subsidy complaints against EC imports after that date. In autumn 1989, the US and the EC undertook to phase out so-called 'voluntary restraints' on steel imports by March 31 this year, provided a code under the Gatt could be worked out to prevent subsidies distorting trade in steel. There is now no hope of getting such international discipline agreed in Geneva by next Tuesday. The Community hopes for political agreement to prolong talks on the steel code, but is fearful of pressure by US steel companies on the Bush administration in this US election year to maintain some form of protection. The EC is a net exporter of steel to the US, with 7 per cent of the US market. After the US 'voluntary restraints' or quotas on EC steel expire next week, Brussels fears US steel-makers may ask Washington to impose countervailing or anti-dumping duties on EC imports.</p>

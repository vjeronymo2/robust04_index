			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Italian government faces collapse after Craxi immunity vote ITALY'S 52nd post-war government faced the threat of immediate collapse last night hours after being sworn in, pushing the country towards early elections. The threat sprang from an explosion of parliamentary rage, reflected in street demonstrations, over the surprise refusal by a majority of parliament to waive full immunity on Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to face corruption charges. The parliamentary vote favouring Mr Craxi provoked the immediate resignation of the one Green member of Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's cabinet and the more serious prospect of a withdrawal from the government of the three members of the formerly communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The trio includes Mr Vincenzo Visco, named as finance minister. The presence of the PDS in the government was negotiated with great difficulty by Mr Ciampi, who is also the governor of the Bank of Italy. It was the central element in his attempt to forge a consensus for electoral reform after he had been summoned to form a government. A cabinet statement said the government would seek a vote of confidence. The parliamentary vote was immediately seen as an effort by the Christian Democrats and Socialists, the main parties in the outgoing four-party coalition, to protect a political class discredited by the country's corruption scandals. There were suggestions that the vote on Mr Craxi was caused in part by an attempt by opposition members such as the Lombard League and hardline communists of Reconstructed Communism to embarrass the new government. Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, said he would urgently seek a meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro saying that the understanding on which PDS members had entered the government was that there would be backing for magistrates' requests for immunity to be waived in cases of corruption. Observers said that if the resignations of the three PDS ministers were accepted early elections would become inevitable - even before electoral reform had been introduced. Milan magistrates indicated they would take the matter to the constitutional court, foreshadowing a confrontation between parliament and the judiciary. Craxi faces his accusers, Page 3</p>

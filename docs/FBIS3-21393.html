The Prime Minister, Mr P.V. Narasimha Rao, who left here  this  morning for Bonn was highly satisfied with the response of  international corporate leaders. Some of them called on him  personally and told him that India was on their priority list  for foreign direct investments.    The most noteworthy feature is that this change in  perception  about India among global business leaders has been brought about  without the assurance of any further concessions. Both the Prime  Minister and the commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, who  spearheaded the discussions on India made it clear that India  would welcome investments, particularly in the infrastructural  sector, but it must be on India's terms.    The Prime Minister elaborated this at the closing plenary  session. Responding to Prof. Schwab, the founder of World  Economic Forum (WEF), who welcomed Mr Rao as a "philosopher and  statesman" and the man behind the process of transformation in  India. He said he owed the success of reforms to Nehru who had  introduced the concept of mixed economy.    He said the concept of market economy in the unipolar world  was fast becoming a dogma but India would not accept a  ready-made formula prescribed from thousand miles away. Reforms  had to be a programme of change with the human face. The  government had no right to throw out of job 10 million people  because somebody suggested it. The obvious reference was to the  developed world's prescription for restructuring the public  sector through privatisation, without caring for the  consequences. But the government had to take such a contingency  into account and make full allowances before launching the  scheme of change, Mr Rao explained.    The strategy of the Indian side in the panel discussion on  India was to explain why foreign investors should invest India  and leave it at that. Replying to a question on drug pricing, Mr  Mukherjee said while the policy would be reviewed, the  government would also have to keep in mind the objective of  health policy. As for drug price equalisation scheme, he would  not comment as the issue was subjudice.    Reacting to strong reservations on intellectual property  rights expressed by FMC Corporation of the United States, Mr  Mukherjee said India would go only to the extent of changing  patent laws as committed under the GATT agreement. To a question  if the government would change labour laws to promote foreign  direct investment, Mr Mukherjee's reply was that in the Indian  situation no unlimited power of hiring and firing could be given.    The Prime Minister who intervened towards the end, said that  he came to Davos "with an infinitely deeper sense of confidence"  than two years ago, about the course of reforms. The government  was considering what more could be done. But no step could be  taken without carefully assessing the possible results of such a  step. "We do not want to jump and break our legs," he said.    A number of chief executives of global companies called on  Mr  Rao and told him that they would like to step up their  investments in India. Among them was Mr Charles Cilmour,  vice-chairman of Ford Motors, who said that India might be made  a source for auto-parts and components to begin with to be  followed by a production base for Ford trucks and cars.    Others who met Rao were Mr Kenneth Ley, chairman of Enron,  Mr  Hezeltor, chairman of Dow Corning, a U.S. glass company planning  to invest in India, Mr Martin Liang of a large U.K.-based  construction company interested in building roads, highways and  hospitals, and Mr Charles Piggo of the U.S.-based Paccaor which  is manufacturing heavy trucks, and drilling equipment.    The Prime Minister's growing confidence was evident in the  manner in which he added a big rider to his overall statement  that reforms would continue. "We shall not do what we do not  consider necessary. We have to see the results and if more  changes are needed, we shall not hesitate to reorient the  policies," he said.    On the key question of foreign investment in India, Mr Rao  said he was satisfied. But wanted more foreign investment in the  infrastructure areas. The Prime Minister had clearly begun to  pick and choose the kind of investments he would like in future.  This was a privilege which he never enjoyed in the past two  years or he could not do so for India had not till then become a  credible option for foreign investors.    Delivering final address at the WEF annual meeting, Mr Rao  reiterated that India wanted to pursue its own model of economic  reforms, by striking a balance. "We do not like to follow  policies framed two thousand miles away and dictated to us," he  said. That was an assertion which Mr Rao never made in the past  and is a result of a growing confidence in the economic reforms  pursued by his government and the impact these have made on the  people and foreign investors.    The new found confidence was also evident from the manner in  which he strongly defended the bureaucracy against the charge  that it was delaying implementation of economic reforms. His  peremptory dismissal of a question on whether Hindu-Muslim  tensions affected investment in India is a clear sign that Mr  Rao will invite foreign investment, but without kneeling down or  bowing to pressures of unreasonable demands. "We are a  pluralistic society and Hindu and Muslims would continue to live  together for years to come. If there are clashes, we should  bother, not you," he snapped.    Even, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, showed such confidence while  recounting the various economic reform measures taken by the  government. "Our policy changes are not by accident. These began  from the eighties and as such are based on the bedrock of  experience," he said. But when it came to reforming the labour  market or introducing an exit policy for workers, Mr Mukherjee  firmly ruled it out on the ground that the government would like  to stay away from the policy of hire and fire.</p>

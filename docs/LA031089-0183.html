			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KENTUCKY U PROBES GIFT OF $20,000 TO ASST. COACHES  </P> <P> Kentucky basketball coach Eddie Sutton employed help from a friend in raising  $20,000 in outside income for two assistant coaches, a possible violation of  NCAA rules, the university has reported to the NCAA.  </P> <P> The Louisville Courier-Journal reported in today's editions it had obtained a  portion of the university's response to 18 NCAA charges of rules violations, a  response which has not been made public.  </P> <P> Sutton and assistant coaches Dwane Casey and James Dickey contend the outside  income was not a violation, but "the university does not agree" with that  interpretation, the response said.  </P> <P> After Casey and Dickey were turned down for raises by then-Athletic Director  Cliff Hagan during the 1987-88 season, Sutton told the pair he would attempt to  raise the money from outside sources, the response said.  </P> <P> Neither assistant coach reported the outside income to the NCAA because they  said it was not athletic-related income and therefore not subject to NCAA  rules.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Triggered by Discovery  </P> <P> The information was gathered as part of a university investigation of the  program ordered by David Roselle, Kentucky's president, after a package bound  for a Los Angeles-area recruit containing $1,000 in cash was discovered.  </P> <P> The response said Sutton used an unidentified "friend and booster of the  university's basketball program" to solicit $10,000 each for Casey and Dickey  from two unidentified businessmen who are supporters of the Kentucky program.  The money reportedly was for motivational speeches.  </P></p>

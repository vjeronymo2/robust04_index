			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [TIA "Khovar"-TASS report: "Eradicating Price Chaos"] </F>   [Text] A strict daily record of all fuels and lubricants  coming into the country through state and commercial channels  has been introduced in Tajikistan. From now until 1 May, only  the country's top ministrial and departmental chiefs can use  official vehicles. In addition, in order to eradicate price  chaos, a specially created republic commission has been tasked  with establishing maximum prices for fuels and lubricants. The  use of fuel by motor-vehicle transport has been restricted. All  these measures are prompted by the fact that large-scale sowings  have begun in the Republic and many farms are missing the  optimum deadlines owing to a shortage of fuel. The Ministry of  Agriculture has announced that this spring Tajik peasants are  allocating 280-285,000 hectares to the basic crop -- cotton --  which is somewhat in excess of last year's indicator.</p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: SBC forecasts no growth in profits for the year SWISS BANK Corporation, Switzerland's second-largest bank, yesterday forecast profit growth for 1992 would be flat. Mr Walter Frehner, the chief executive, said: 'We expect consolidated net profit for the full year, including extraordinary profit, to be close to the 1991 results'. The group had net income of SFr1.03bn (Dollars 735m) last year. Mr Frehner, who is to become chairman next April, held out the prospect of 'clearly higher earnings' in 1993, as interest and inflation rates subsided and many industrialised economies began to recover. The bank has embarked on projects to cut costs and improve revenue from its Swiss branch network. Provisions this year were likely to be 'only negligibly lower' than last year's SFr1.45bn. SBC posted a 7.7 per cent drop in gross operating profit to SFr1.24bn in first-half 1992.</p>

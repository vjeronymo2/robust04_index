			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Saving the royals THE insouciance of the House of Windsor takes my breath away, leaves me emerald with envy, for insouciance is the quality I rate above all others. I am not talking about the distaff side of the family and their banal cavortings, which should only be of interest to the bungaloid mentality. No, I am talking about the males. With all the hoo-ha of the past two weeks, you would have thought that the Queen would have grounded the lot of them, confined them to Balmoral, locked them in the snooker room and refused to let them out until they could suggest three good reasons why she should let them out. This she has not done, with the result that each morning they have been filmed by the cameramen scuttling out of Balmoral and up to the slaughtering fields, the moors and the streams, where - I shouldn't wonder - they dynamite the salmon and call in the Royal Air Force to dive-bomb the grouse. I am not saying that they do do, only that they might, though I expect they are fairly sporting and only ask for Vulcans, which can be out-manoeuvred (I have this on authority) by a lightning-witted grouse. What the Queen needs to realise is that there are numerous folk like me who are broadly in favour of monarchy, whatever its vicissitudes, but who are capable of being nudged in the opposite direction (the guillotine, republicanism) so long as members of her family continue to hunt, shoot and kill: to associate themselves with what Tolstoy, speaking of hunting, called 'evil legitimised.' So far this summer, Britain's newspapers, pandering to naff elements, have lingered with delight on pool-side romps and sighing princesses - strictly kid's stuff, fodder for the bungaloids. Only The Observer, of the papers I read, has raised its sights to a gamier issue: the legacy of feudalism and the scandal of land use and ownership represented by what Ian Bell, on August 16, called 'the Lesser Tweedy Aristocratic Prat in his natural habitat (the grouse moor), chirruping to his fellows, preying on the defenceless and strolling about as though he owned the place.' Usually he did own it; that was the trouble. It is not just grouse murderers for whom I nurse contempt. I loathe the whole business of hunting and killing. Many years ago, the FT's commodities editor and his trusty side-kick used to lie in wait for me in a dive close to the office where occasionally we repaired at the end of a strenuous day. They would buy me a cocktail. Then they would mention whaling, of which they greatly approved. Whales were a resource which floated around the oceans in order to be harvested. They knew that whaling sickened me. But my boiling point was low. They would drive me into emotionalism. It was very cleverly done. So I never won the argument. I would start to weep and shout. A taxi would have to be ordered; home I would be sent. I am now older and wilier. I totally eschew cocktails. My head is always clear. My boiling point has soared. And I am much better read, so that I am starting to win arguments whenever my path tangles with that of the nerds and twerps who play any sort of killing game. The Killing Game is the title of the best, most venomous essay on hunting you will ever need to read. It was written by Joy Williams and appears in The Best American Essays 1991 (Ticknor &amp; Fields). At the end of her essay, Williams says that 'hunters' self-serving arguments and lies are becoming more preposterous as non-hunters awake from their long, albeit troubled, sleep . . . Hunters are persecutors of nature who . . . wield a disruptive power out of all proportion to their numbers . . . Every year less than 7 per cent of the (US) population turn the skies into shooting galleries and the woods and fields into abattoirs. It's time to stop actively supporting and passively allowing hunting, and time to stigmatise it. It's time to stop being conned and cowed by hunters . . . time to stop thinking of wild animals as 'resources' and 'game,' and time to start thinking of them as sentient beings that deserve our wonder and respect . . . Hunters make wildlife dead, dead, dead . . . As for the hunters, it's long past check-out time.' I shall run off some copies and send them to Balmoral. A gesture like that could help save the House of Windsor.</p>

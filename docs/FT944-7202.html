			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / International Company News: Hungary hotel talks collapse amid row International investment banks in Budapest yesterday accused Hungary of scuttling the sale of Hungarhotels, the country's largest hotel chain. They also cast doubt over the country's commitment to privatisation. The row broke out as negotiations collapsed between Hungary's State Property Agency and American General Hospitality (AGH) of the US over the tender for 51 per cent in state-owned Hungarhotels. However, Mr Ferenc Bartha, privatisation commissioner, said: 'We are in negotiation . . . and the board will decide.' Western investors and their advisers were using the deal as a litmus test of the socialist government's intentions on privatisation. The controversy mars Hungary's efforts to sell shareholdings in telecommunications, electricity and gas utilities, and to raise Dollars 1.5bn over the next 12 months. AGH was last week named preferred tenderer after bidding Dollars 61m for the stake in Hungarhotels to beat a rival offer of about Dollars 45m from Intercontinental Hotels of Japan. However, the social security fund, led by allies of the socialist government, has mounted a campaign to stop the deal. Intercontinental also lobbied against the tender outcome, which would have left it without a flagship hotel in Budapest. The Hungarian negotiators demanded that AGH pay a 25 per cent premium, and investment bankers said they suspected the authorities wanted to force AGH to withdraw. It would require a climbdown by the State Property Agency at a meeting next week to save the deal. The government had previously promised to speed up privatisation and foreign investment. However, only one significant sale to western investors has gone through since the former communists returned to power after elections last May.</p>

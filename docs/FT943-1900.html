			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Pakistan and US put past behind them: Farhan Bokhari reports on fresh evidence of a thaw in relations The arrival in Pakistan of Ms Hazel O'Leary, the US energy secretary, at the head of a business delegation, is being regarded by both countries as adding further warmth to a recent thaw in relations. For Pakistan, a country that was on the verge of being declared a terrorist state by Washington less than two years ago, the visit presents an opportunity to leave behind the crisis in its relations with the US, triggered by the US aid cut-off in 1990. Although the aid suspension continues because of US objections to Pakistan's nuclear programme, both sides are trying to broaden their contacts. Earlier this month, the Clinton administration announced a Dollars 10m grant for Pakistan's social welfare programmes. Officials from both sides are also examining prospects for US soyabean oil sales of up to Dollars 20m. The president of the US Eximbank is expected to visit Pakistan before the end of the year to consider other investment proposals by US investors. The amounts involved are small compared to the more than Dollars 7bn committed by the US to Pakistan in military and economic assistance at the height of the cold war in the 1980s. But Pakistani officials consider that these developments take the two countries into a new era, ending the sense of conflict. 'It's always foolish to say a tough item does not exist,' said Mr John Monjo, the US ambassador to Pakistan, who conceded that the nuclear issue has presented difficulties for the two countries. 'The fact that now the two sides are engaged in looking for ways in which we can have a meaningful relationship in the post-cold war period, shows that we are out of the crisis mould,' said Ms Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan's ambassador to the US. Western diplomats and Pakistani officials, examining recent trends in relations said at least three factors have induced a thaw. First, Islamabad's secret nuclear programme has not progressed at a pace which could cause any distress, in spite of a recent claim by Mr Nawaz Sharif, the opposition leader, that Pakistan had produced nuclear weapons. 'The fact that Pakistan still has a nuclear programme which is not open to international inspection raises immense fears,' said one senior diplomat. 'But . . . there is very little conclusive evidence that there is a need to ring the alarm bells over a step-up in its pace.' Secondly, fears of Islamic fundamentalism spreading across the country have been put to rest after the Islamic parties received poor support in last October's elections. Finally, the aid suspension has been partly unsuccessful because Pakistan refused to ratify the non-proliferation treaty or accept any other international safeguards on its nuclear facilities, unless India would accept the same. Officials from both sides hope that US investments in Pakistan will help to strengthen diplomatic relations. Over the past 46 years, US businesses have invested Dollars 450m in Pakistan. Mr Monjo says Pakistan's recent economic reforms as well as this year's liberal energy policy, have together set the stage for attracting foreign investors.</p>

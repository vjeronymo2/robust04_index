			<p>BFN     [Text] The two-day provincial on-the-spot  experience-exchange meeting on deepening reform and employing  surplus workers ended at the Laiwu General Iron and Steel  Complex on the afternoon of 5 April. Li Chunting, deputy  secretary of the provincial party committee and vice governor of  the provincial government; and Chen Jianguo, standing committee  member of the provincial party committee and vice governor of  the provincial government, were present at the meeting.    Li Chunting stressed in his speech: According to the  requirements for deepening enterprise reform and changing  managerial mechanism, on the premise of ensuring social  stability, and according to different actual conditions, all  localities should adopt various forms and open various channels  to explore ways for arranging enterprises' surplus staff members  and workers, gradually set up an enterprise employment system  suitable to the socialist market economic system, strive to  change the enterprise managerial mechanism, upgrade labor  productivity, and comprehensively increase enterprises' economic  results. This is also the province's general guiding ideology  of arranging jobs for enterprises' surplus staff members and  workers.    Li Chunting pointed out: Reform, development, and stability  are the overall work situation this year. The economic work  should be submitted to and serve this situation. We should  persistently grasp reform and development with one hand and  stability with the other. This year, the state worked out a  series of major reform measures with enterprise reform as its  nucleus. Appropriately employing surplus personnel is an  important content of the enterprise reform as well as a  difficult and hot-debated issue. Realistically solving the  problems in this regard is the internal requirement for  deepening reform as well as an essential requirement for  accelerating the pace of development. A calculation shows that  so far, about 30 percent of the enterprises' staff members and  workers are surplus personnel. The problems in some enterprises  where production is totally or partially suspended are more  prominent. This situation, if not changed, will seriously  restrict and obstruct the deepening of enterprise reform and the  setup of the modern enterprise system. Simultaneously,  appropriately arranging jobs for surplus staff members and  workers is a need for maintaining social stability. Therefore,  we should enhance the sense of urgency and the sense of  responsibility and be determined to achieve the work in this  regard.    Li Chunting said: This year, the enterprise managerial  mechanism is being changed noticeably at a faster speed. The  failure to solve the problems relating to surplus staff members  and workers will affect reform and the trial implementation of  the modern enterprise system. Therefore, the enterprises  carrying out the modern enterprise system on a trial basis and  carrying out the shareholding system should simultaneously  expand the dynamics of reforming labor, employment, and  distribution systems and regard the employment of surplus staff  members and workers as an essential task. Simultaneously,  according to the actual conditions of enterprises, we should  study and explore effective ways and methods for arranging jobs  for surplus staff members and workers. According to advanced  and reasonable "dual standards," the enterprises with better  economic results should boldly and resolutely reduce the number  of surplus staff members and workers, solve the problems that  enterprises take on heavy burdens to develop social  undertakings, divorce themselves from the organizations  providing auxiliary service to enterprises, expand service  functions, and enhance the capability of assimilating labor  forces. The enterprises with general economic results should  combine the arrangements of jobs for surplus workers with the  enterprise structural readjustment and technological  transformation, reasonably distribute labor resources, and  vigorously develop the tertiary industry with less investment  and faster economic results. The enterprises suffering  long-term deficits are allowed to adopt such methods as  providing labor services, exporting techniques, and encouraging  staff members and workers to engage in individual management and  self-employment to arrange jobs for the surplus staff members  and workers.    Li Chunting stressed: The most realistic and basic way for  arranging jobs for surplus staff members and workers is internal  digestion. We should carry out the method dominated by the  arrangements by enterprises and supplemented by social  arrangements instead of the wait-and-rely-on method. In line  with the reform of employment, labor, and distribution systems,  we should rely on our own efforts to make development; develop  new entities, tertiary industry, and a diversified economy;  adopt various forms to encourage a portion of personnel to  engage in self-employment; and try every possible means to  distribute and arrange surplus personnel.</p>

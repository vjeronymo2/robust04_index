			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Appeal of participants in the workshop "Nationality Policy </F> of the Azerbaijan Republic: Problems and Prospects" to Geydar  Aliyev, president of the Azerbaijan Republic]    [Text] Today, when the Azerbaijan Republic is proceeding  along the path of independence and, particularly, when an  aggressive, ungrateful neighbor is encroaching on our  territorial integrity and national existence, great significance  is attached to the pursuit in the country of a prudent,  farsighted nationality policy. The further regulation of  interethnic relations and a comprehensive study of the problems  and the shaping of a precise nationality policy in this sphere  are, as a whole, a most essential factor conditioning the  durability of the statehood of democratic Azerbaijan, national  unity, and the civic solidarity of the peoples, national  minorities, and ethnic groups that reside on its territory.    The course of the workshop, in which scientists,  specialists,  social anthropologists, and political scientists representing  all the national formations that reside in Azerbaijan took part,  showed convincingly once again that all peoples, regardless of  their size and religious or national affiliation, are equally  responsible for the fate of the fatherland--the Azerbaijan  Republic--the liberation of our land from the Armenian  aggressors, and the country's membership of the ranks of  civilized states and sincerely approve the single-minded  activity that you, esteemed president, are pursuing in this  direction.    All these problems were the subject of wide-ranging  discussion at the workshop. Well-known political scientists,  sociologists, theologians, and representatives of individual  parties and cultural centers operating in the republic took part  in the speeches and the debates, and extraordinarily interesting  and topical proposals connected with the present state of  interethnic relations, the role of this factor in the process of  the building of a democratic, secular state, the establishment  of ties to compatriots living overseas, the reasons for national  conflicts and their solution by civilized methods based on the  rules of international law, the establishment of stability in  the country, and so forth were advanced. We believe that these  proposals will be taken into consideration in the realization of  the nationality policy of the Azerbaijani state and that  efficient use will continue to be made of the research potential  of our scholars working in the sphere of national relations.    Azerbaijan is a unitary state, and we call on all citizens  of  Azerbaijan, regardless of religious, linguistic, national, or  political affiliation, for close cohesion around this idea. We  assure you that the scientific community of the republic at  large condemns provocative actions sowing discord between the  peoples and thereby adding fuel to the fire of the enemy, will  fight such phenomena and mobilize all efforts for the  establishment of stability in Azerbaijan and an end to the  attempts to embroil the peoples, and will make a substantial  contribution to the building of a society of national solidarity  and free brotherhood.    Esteemed President! It was with a feeling of profound  emotion  and gratitude that we received your 12 April 1994 appeal on  television and radio to our people and the world. The present  social and political situation in Azerbaijan, the internal and  external political atmosphere, and the historical realities that  we have encountered were studied and explained to the world in  this historic appeal with profound political expertise and wise  responsibility. We wholly support your consistent and intensive  activity and the policy you are pursuing in the name of the  defense and preservation of the state independence and  territorial integrity of Azerbaijan and call on the whole  Azerbaijani people to render you the utmost assistance in this  sacred cause and to rally beneath the banner raised against  Armenian fascism.    Our salvation lies in unity!    Baku, 19 April 1994</p>

			<p>940603 FT  03 JUN 94 / Rail signalmen's seven-year itch The threatened paralysis of Britain's rail network by striking signalmen later this month has been provoked by an issue that has gone unresolved for seven years. It suggests that British Rail's new structure has a long way to go to clear the industrial relations legacy of 45 years of public ownership. The decisive four-to-one vote by signalmen for industrial action suggests that their discontent is much deeper than management had thought. In an 80 per cent turnout 2,351 backed disruption and only 566 opposed. But nearly 1,000 signalmen were not ballotted because they have left the RMT rail union. Yesterday Mr Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, the state-owned company set up in April to run British Rail's track and signalling after privatisation, said he hoped for 'a meeting of minds' before June 15, the date set for the first one-day strike. A second 24-hour stoppage is planned for June 22 and more could follow. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, has called for an urgent meeting with Railtrack to deal with the signalmen's grievances. It is expected within days. The signalmen are demanding an 11 per cent interim pay rise even before agreeing to enter negotiations over the restructuring of their pay system, first suggested in 1987. The union's demand for such a high wage increase may seem absurd in the present climate, with annual earnings settlements inching up to only about 2.5 per cent. The RMT says, however, that the signalmen have a special case. The union sent the signalmen's pay claim to the British Railways Board - responsibility for signalling moved to Railtrack on April 1 - in early February. It argued that the workers had agreed to the introduction of new equipment, had accepted extra responsibilities and cuts in the numbers employed on signalling work, but had not secured any improvement in their pay. Their claim accused management of wanting 'improved productivity on the cheap', adding that the signalmen had had 'to endure a steady erosion of their status and differentials in comparison to other grades'. The union argues that signalmen have to work an average 52-hour week to approach a reasonable level of earnings. It points to the erosion of pay differentials relative to other rail workers, including drivers and station staff, while a big earnings gap - of between Pounds 29 and Pounds 51 a week  -has opened up with London Underground signalmen. The RMT said: 'If the board concedes the interim payment, foundations can be laid for constructive discussions on restructuring, whilst at the same time a message will be sent to signalling staff that the board is serious about addressing our longstanding grievance.' It added: 'If this course of action is not taken, then the union is of the strong view that obtaining the agreement on restructuring that both the board and Railtrack want will be a difficult, if not impossible, task.' Railtrack has made some moves to improve the signalmen's position. On April 8 the newly-created company agreed to simplify signalmen grades, enabling some to receive rises of between Pounds 10.75 and Pounds 11.45 a week. All other staff on signalling grades were offered immediate payments of Pounds 100. Railtrack said: 'All we asked the union to do was to start talks on restructuring and for the minority of signalling staff still paid in cash to move to bank credit transfer.' The company says that no one wants industrial action and there must be negotiation. It wants to see the planned pay restructuring exercise completed by September 30. A new joint industry pension scheme is due to start in October and Railtrack has told its employees that 'to get the full benefits of that scheme we must agree basic pay rates before October. That needs co-operation on all sides'.</p>

			<p><P> November 23, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OH, THANK GOODNESS;  </P> <P> A CRASH, RECOVERY AND RACE TO THE FINISH LINE  </P> <P> In 1989, the Earth trembled, skies poured, killer winds howled, tankers spilled  and revolutions swept the globe. In Los Angeles, gang violence claimed yet more  victims and traffic seemed to grow ever worse. Still, amid the tide of  oft-tragic happenings, small rays of hope keep shining through. Here are a few  of many stories worth sharing on a day of feasting, family and friends. They're  enough to remind that it's still worth saying: "Oh, Thank Goodness."  </P> <P> For Shirley Muldowney, a national drag racing champion, winning another race  might not seem such a significant matter.  </P> <P> But her mid-October victory in the Fallnationals competition in Phoenix, her  first race win in three years, was special for Muldowney, who survived a  devastating car crash on a Canadian track in June, 1984.  </P> <P> The 250-m.p.h. wreck was so bad she was unsure that she would ever walk again,  let alone get on a track in her pink top-fuel dragster.  </P> <P> Muldowney, 49, underwent five major operations to rebuild her left foot and  repair her legs, pelvis, fingers and an almost-severed thumb; she endured more  than a year's worth of physical therapy before returning to racing in January,  1986.  </P> <P> "The win at Phoenix was worth it all," says Muldowney, who lives in Northridge  with her husband and crew chief, Rohn Tobler. "I'm thankful that I hung in  there, that we all did."  </P> <P> Reflecting on her remarkable comeback, she remarks: "I was hurt real bad, and I  knew it was going to be a long, long road. It was a lot of hard work and so  painful. . . . I really needed a light at the end of the tunnel and racing was  it."  </P> <P> Muldowney -- who shares the distinction with Don (Big Daddy) Garlits for  winning three National Hot Rod Assn. top-fuel championships -- was national  champion in 1977, 1980 and 1982. She is searching for a new racing sponsor but  is looking forward to seeking a fourth national championship next year.  </P> <P> "We were very excited at Phoenix," she says. "The last win I had was in '83,  but I didn't compete for 1 1/2 seasons. We were excited by the fact that we  found the winning combination we looked for for so long. . . . We had a  tremendous amount of bad breaks and bad luck. So this was a great win." LYNN  SIMROSS  </P></p>

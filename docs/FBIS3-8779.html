			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Lajos Fur, defense minister and chairman of </F> the Hungarian Democratic Forum, by Dezso Pinter; place and date  not given: "The Opposition Is Also To Blame for the Silence of  the Majority"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] What, in your  view, are the effects on society of the events at Hungarian  Radio?    [Fur] Visibly and regrettably, the developments in the radio  have an impact on political life. However, they certainly do  not have any effect on society. Dealing with these kinds of  internal affairs of an institution is the least of society's  problems. As for the allegation that the government is behind  the dismissals, I have to refute it most firmly.    [Pinter] What is your reaction to the view that, since you  were elected party chairman, you have subordinated all your  political activities exclusively to the propaganda of success?    [Fur] This view is unfounded and unjust. We are in a period  of assessment and we should not tolerate a situation in which  only our failures and mistakes are revealed to society. This is  not because it hurts us but because it creates a distorted  image, and only provides the voters with a basis for drawing the  wrong conclusions. Noisily and with demagogic methods rather  than arguments, our competitors are trying to take away from us  even those results that can be proved to have been achieved by  us since 1990. The barrage has persisted since the moment our  government took office, and it has had some effects. Our period  of being defensive has ended. We are not just advertising our  successes, we are providing information about the facts. The  economic decline began at the beginning of the 1980's -- partly  as a result of the radical change of external circumstances, the  south Slav war and the embargo, and the difficulties that went  with the change of regime -- it accelerated from 1990, but we  cannot talk about a slump. The year 1993 was the turning point.  At the moment, we can only talk about some development in  comparison with the beginning of the decline but this does not  yet mean the rise of the nation. The favorable tendencies of  1993 are continuing in 1994. A 6 to 7 percent inflation was  projected for January but the actual figure was 3.2 percent.  This is a fact. For some people, stating this fact is the same  as the propaganda of success, but for us, it is proof that we  are following the correct road.    [Pinter] Is it also not a fact that there are many people in  this country who have been left to fend for themselves and are  stumbling along this road with ever greater difficulty?    [Fur] It is. However, encouragement supported by the facts  is also meant for those who, as a result of their increasingly  desperate living conditions, feel that this government coalition  or this system has left them on their own. We do not want to  make the situation look better than it is, because it also is  depressing for us, but it is not paralyzing. We must not talk  about hopelessness.    [Pinter] Have you formed an opinion on the campaign behavior  of other parties?    [Fur] The opposition is mainly trying to gain social support  by damaging our reputation. They want to blame us for all the  troubles of the transformation. The favorite statement of the  Hungarian Socialist Party's [MSZP] chairman [Gyula Horn] is that  this government was characterized by unprecedented dilettantism.  Says he, who was formerly part of the power that was almost  completely unable to do anything to stop and reverse the  damaging processes. Under the rule of their great expertise,  only the negative things were accumulated. However, what is  really dangerous is that many people are making irresponsible  promises to the nation. Should they get into government, it  would soon be discovered that they have misled society, and this  would result in a formerly unseen -- mainly moral and economic  -- crisis for the country. Chaos could reappear where there  should be order.    [Pinter] Do you link the danger of this chaos with the fact  that various ideologies are gaining ground?    [Fur] The unshakably left-wing and liberal ideology that is  created at writing desks will prove to be a restraint on social  development. During the decades of socialism, we had the chance  to experience the true meaning of ideological obsession. An  invented theoretical system was forced onto reality. I caution  the country against a power whose thinking is so much within  theoretical limits. It is to be feared that the representatives  of a power like this would follow the example of the Bourbons  and we will find that they have not learned or forgotten  anything.    [Pinter] According to many surveys, the left wing has gained  significant support in recent months. When you formulate your  sharp criticism, are you not worried that, because of the terms  you use, you will find yourself irrevocably opposed to the  section of society that supports the left wing?    [Fur] My intention is completely different. I certainly do  not want to get into a conflict with anyone. As a believer, I  do not have hatred for anyone. It is always the political  thoughts and mentality that I criticize. I am concerned for the  country in case the left wing comes to power. This danger  exists because, after four decades of dictatorship, this way of  thinking -- and please do not forget: organization -- has its  traces in society.    [Pinter] Do you hope that the election campaign and your  arguments will change this?    [Fur] Undoubtedly, I believe in the power of words, and that  the expression of various realizations can divert thinking  people in the right direction. I am aware that people who have  very much committed themselves to the joint political action of  the MSZP and the trade unions, or the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ], which is drawing closer to the left wing double quick,  will not be much influenced by my arguments. It is almost as  important, however, to win the silent majority to ourselves.  They make up 50 percent of society in Hungary. [passage  omitted] They will decide the fate of the elections and what  side the country, which is unfortunately still very quiet, will  take. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] While you are constantly warning the country  against expecting miracles, is it not possible that the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF] is expecting a miracle as far  as its own fate is concerned?    [Fur] The only thing we trust in is that the country will  appreciate our results and efforts. There are encouraging signs  for this.    [Pinter] Are there any signs of this that you deliberately  do not talk about?    [Fur] We do not have secrets.    [Pinter] In your view, how successfully are the MDF  politicians, who face the country's public, serving the  intention to gain more ground?    [Fur] The MDF's national committee does not necessarily  agree completely with all statements. However, I am not aware  of major deviations. The slight differences, on the other hand,  are explicitly useful. For example, the MDF's liberal,  Christian, and conservative wings are still mentioned. I find  the term conservative more acceptable than populist-national,  which has been torn to shreds.    [Pinter] Do these tendencies actually exist?    [Fur] They do not exist as political tendencies. However,  we can say that our members have different ideological sources  of thought. Some were more affected by national liberalism,  others by Christian democracy, or conservatism. [passage  omitted]    [Pinter] Do you have any contact with Istvan Csurka [co-  chairman of the Hungarian Justice and Life Party, MIEP]?    [Fur] I do not.    [Pinter] And with the MIEP?    [Fur] No.    [Pinter] Do you see this the only natural state of affairs?    [Fur] I do.    [Pinter] Does your answer also mean that, regardless of the  election results and the political situation that arises  afterwards, there can be no common road for the MDF and the MIEP?    [Fur] It is impossible for this kind of road to exist. The  MIEP is attacking us in an astonishing style. It is outright  shocking that Csurka and Jozsef Torgyan [chairman of the  Independent Smallholders Party] participated in a joint  demonstration in the Sports Hall.    [Pinter] Was it this fact that shocked you or what was said  there?    [Fur] The fact that this joint appearance took place. What  the participants said was nothing new. In the past, we already  had the chance to be shocked at what they had to say.    [Pinter] In your view, is Csurka's and Torgyan's supporting  camp growing?    [Fur] Not at all. The followers come from a narrow social  group. Many of them are unable to process their injuries or are  psychologically broken, perhaps misled people.    [Pinter] Are you sure that the MDF membership has the same  views on Csurka's and Torgyan's politics and supporters?    [Fur] If there had been any supporters of these people in  our party, they would have left us and joined Csurka's and  Torgyan's parties. The unity and atmosphere of our seventh  national meeting should have convinced the doubters and those  who are sincerely concerned about our political line. Not one  of the 720 deputies who gathered there appeared as a supporter  of undesirable tendencies.    [Pinter] After the national meeting and your election as  party chairman, is your cooperation with Prime Minister Peter  Boross changing in any way?    [Fur] Only in the sense that our cooperation is even  stronger. I can say the same about [Deputy Chairman] Sandor  Lezsak, the other key character in our party. These three  people are operating without any problems. We will take care to  keep it this way. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] What do Boross's prime ministerial activities so  far mean for the MDF?    [Fur] A huge gain. Boross has brought a powerful pragmatism  into governing and politics in general. His legal training and  experience as a company leader make him very well informed in  the details of state administration. The membership expects a  lot of him.    [Pinter] What is your reaction to the loose and not very  clearly defined election cooperations?    [Fur] With some reservation and acknowledgment. The left  wing has obviously sorted itself out, while there is much  uncertainty at the liberals. We are not certain if the SZDSZ is  one of the left- wing parties. It shows itself to be one  because it is getting increasingly close to the idea of forming  a coalition with the MSZP. it is strange because a liberal party  by no means can belong to the left wing. I wonder if the  supporter of a social-liberal model can belong to the liberal  bloc.    [Pinter] Do you also have doubts about the line of the  Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz]?    [Fur] Not at all. There have been serious changes in the  Fidesz, the supporters of the social-liberal solution have left  the party.    [Pinter] In a situation when the coalition is being planned,  has this made the Fidesz a more attractive party for you?    [Fur] I can answer this when I see the election results. In  my view, a regular dialogue on various practical issues is  certainly possible. This could be very useful in the remaining  period of parliament.    [Pinter] Have you been surprised by the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] statements in connection with  the MDF in the campaign?    [Fur] I do not think it is right to try to blame the MDF for  the corrupt practices in privatization. They have also made  some other badly worded criticisms. Regardless of this, the two  parties, which are in close relationship, often fight for  completely identical goals.    [Pinter] Could relations between the MDF and the KDNP become  tense in the fight for votes?    [Fur] No. We see this campaign as a running race, rather  than a boxing match.    [Pinter] Does this understanding apply to all participants?    [Fur] It certainly applies to the current coalition  partners. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Are you not preparing to continue your activities  in opposition after the elections?    [Fur] This possibility does not exist in my conscious mind,  it might exist in my subconscious at most. On the basis of what  I can see now, I say that we will succeed. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] Do you expect we will have a parliament that can  give a stable government to the country until 1998?    [Fur] Only if the calm and sober political forces get the  majority. All other solutions hold out the danger of a  standstill and anarchy. We should not upset the country.    [Pinter] Do you think that this is what would happen if the  current opposition came to power?    [Fur] I do, equally in politics and the economy. The  country cannot take this risk.</p>

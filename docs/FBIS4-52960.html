			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 14 (YONHAP) -- Russia has presented its  idea of a multilateral security system in Northeast Asia and  asked for South Korea's cooperation, Defense Ministry officials  said Friday.    South Korean Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae received a  two-page letter during his visit to Moscow from his Russian  counterpart Pavel Grachev, who said that maintaining peace and  stability in Northeast Asia is an urgent issue.    Russia first proposed establishment of a regional  multilateral security system to neighboring countries in 1986  when Mikhail Gorbachev was president, but it is unusual for  Moscow to deliver a letter to the South Korean Government,  officials said.    The letter says that to maintain stability in Northeast  Asia,  countries in the region should observe military exercises in  neighboring states, notify others of large-scale military  movements in advance and establish a military dispute prevention  center, they said.</p>

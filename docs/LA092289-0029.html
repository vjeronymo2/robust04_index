			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ERIC DAVIS SAYS SAN DIEGO TOPS HIS LIST  </P> <P> Outfielder Eric Davis, unhappy and feeling unwanted in Cincinnati, says San  Diego tops his list of prospective new teams if the Reds don't re-sign him  after next season.  </P> <P> "The Padres are my No. 1 team right now," said Davis, who hit his 33rd homer  Thursday in the Reds' 11-7 loss to the visiting Padres. "Why? Because of the  ballpark they have . . . the talent they have over there, the chance to be  contenders for a long time (and) the organization.  </P> <P> "Those are things you look for when you're making a move."  </P> <P> It's not certain that Davis will leave the Reds when he becomes a free agent  after the 1990 season, but the power-hitting center fielder says he's ready for  a change if that happens.  </P> <P> "San Diego would be a great place to play," Davis said. "Ask a lot of players.  They'll tell you they would love to go to San Diego."  </P></p>

			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Private View: No black and white answers 'THE CROCODILE does not die under the water so that we can summon the monkey to his funeral.' Both animals are African, suggests this Akan proverb from Ghana, but each has very different customs. So what does 'being African' mean? Compare the answer of the Johannesburg housewife and the Hausa chieftain, and discuss. Or ask the professor from Harvard. He will say there is no African literature, no African culture, no African race, as such. It is not that these phrases are meaningless, but that, being based on tradition, myth or lies, they are usually useless and sometimes dangerous. And the same holds for the rest of humanity. Nineteenth-century scientific theories which held that race, culture and ability were somehow 'in the blood' have been discredited. Yet their influence continues to be felt: in the 'multiculturalism' controversy in the US, for example, in the resurgent racism in western Europe, in the nationalist wars in the Balkans and Caucasus. The Harvard professor is Kwame Anthony Appiah, a philosopher who lectures on Afro-American studies, and who illustrates the absurdity of the cruder categorisations. He is African: he was born 37 years ago in Ghana. His late father Joe Appiah, a leading lawyer, was a friend and later a critic of Kwame Nkrumah. His uncle, Otumfuo Nana Opoku Ware II, is king of the Asante. He is also English: his mother Peggy is the daughter of the former Labour Chancellor, Sir Stafford Cripps. During the holidays from his English public school, Bryanston, Appiah would go home to Kumasi in Asante. He also spent a lot of time with his grandmother, Dame Isobel Cripps, in the very English village of Minchinhampton, Gloucestershire. In the US, he is black - that is, when he is not white. On his first visit an FBI officer, on learning that he had flown in from London, told him to enter 'white' on the form. He is a Noel Coward fan, which he admits is a bit odd, given Coward's jingoist style. 'I suppose I like the funny mixture of reverence for English institutions and taking the mickey,' he said. 'It's a very English thing.' Appiah's mixed parentage is not his only qualification for exploring the race question. He went to Clare College, Cambridge, as a medical student, studied genetic theory then switched to philosophy, winning a double first and doing his doctorate in linguistics. The result is his fifth book, a difficult but provocative account of African culture called In My Father's House. I asked him if he ever asked himself what race he was. 'No. Other people have views about it. In America I'm black - that's how race works and I don't let that worry me.' In your book you don't use the word 'black' much, I said. 'No, I don't. I don't care too much about the terminology because I think all terminologies are misleading. In a world in which many of us are the products of marriages of people from different places, it makes less and less sense to feel one has to have an answer to that question. I feel very much at home in Gloucestershire, I have to say. I can go to the graveyard in Circencester and see graves of ancestors of 600 years ago. But I also feel very much at home in Ghana.' What colour would you call yourself? 'A useful term is 'a person of colour''. But you are just as much white as you are black. 'Yes, I know. But that's not how it works.' The asymmetry is a little unfair, isn't it? 'The asymmetry is tied up with ways of thinking I don't believe in.' Is it offensive? 'It depends who does it, and why. I mean, it's ignorant. But then people are constantly doing things to each other which are ignorant.' Appiah agreed it was inevitable that at some point he would write a book on the philosophy of race and culture. I asked him whether he had been able to tackle the subject objectively. 'I can't claim to be disinterested. I have a lot at stake. And it's important for people like me to think things through just to protect themselves and those they care about. But if I say something that isn't true or I make a bad argument I want to be told.' He said his research had thrown up some surprises: he said he was stunned to discover how large a part race thinking played in the development of literature in the US. Another surprise was how straightforward the biological facts were when you studied mankind from the inside instead of the outside. You claim there is no such thing as race, I said. Doesn't that fly in the face of commonsense? 'Yes it does.' What do do you mean by it? 'There are, of course, people who look different from each other - differences in skin colour, hair colour, the shape of the face - their gross morphology. Our modern conception of race was formed by great 19th-century scientists, including Darwin, in an attempt to explain these differences. The theory they came up with was that we are divided into a small number of groups and everything important about people flowed, biologically, from their membership of the group. That is what is not true. It's just not the case. 'There are massive similarities, and the key things that matter to us about people - ideas, religions, cultures, family - all turn out not to flow from biology at all. 'When people said race mattered, they meant Africans couldn't write sonnets or compose chamber music because it wasn't 'in the blood'. Anyone who knows anything knows now that's not true. But people don't widely enough appreciate how wildly wrong it is. They say 'Well, there's still character.' 'The fact is if you take a little child from Zaire and bring her up with an Irish-American family in Boston, so far as culture goes - with the exception that she'll have an experience of racism that the other kids in the family won't have - she will be as capable of doing all the things that matter as any other child.' Darwin and the rest might have been right, Appiah said. It was a sensible hypothesis at the time. But like a lot of 19th century science, it turned out to be wrong. What people really mean by 'race' depends on where they are: they might be talking about differences of colour, culture or just wealth. 'If races were real, the explanation would be the same everywhere, but it isn't. It's rather like witchcraft: some of the things people call witchcraft really do happen, but that's the one explanation I'm not going to give, because I don't believe in witchcraft.' Sociologists used to describe societies with large immigrant populations as 'multiracial'; today they prefer 'multicultural'. The relabel- ling has not eased the tension either in western Europe or the US. Appiah thinks the present fashion in the US for each ethnic group to discover a culture for itself and then to assert it politically is misguided - and racist. 'That's the way to perdition. On the other hand, the right-wing response that we should all buy into the one, monolithic, European-derived western tradition which has given us everything we have in America is equally false. It's just not true that everything in America has come that way. Think of jazz.' The issue was real enough, but most of the debate was bogus. 'If you sketch out this Noah's Ark view, in which you should have two of every kind, you can see it's crazy. 'What's going to happen? Are you're going to say: 'Sorry, you're Jewish and you can't marry that Catholic boy you've fallen in love with'? It's just not going to work. People are going to blur and blend, not just by intermarriage, but by being friends and co-workers and fellow students. 'So, inevitably - and one may regret this - there will be a certain homogenisation of global culture. In London now you can see Japanese Kabuki, which you couldn't 100 years ago. Not only can you see it, but with a bit of help you can make some sense of it. Just as the Japanese can now be visited by the Royal Shakespeare Company. 'Your own culture is changed. That doesn't mean we all become the same, any more than all the people in Minchinhampton, a tiny village, are the same. They all have different stories to tell.' What strikes him most about his black students at Harvard is how American they are, especially when a foreigner criticises their country. They should not be blamed, however, if, being so recently allowed into the elite white universities, they wanted to move the furniture around a bit. You say there is no black American literature. 'Put it this way. I don't think it is an interesting literary category.' You're a philosopher and half-African. Is there no such thing as an African philosopher either? 'Only in the geographical sense. I prefer to define one as someone who is concerned with philosophical issues as they relate to Africa.' Your book is quite hard to follow, I said. Can a philosopher like you really make an impact on an issue like this? 'Not by myself. I am now inclined to feel, having done the thinking, that the task is to tell it in other ways: so I talk on the radio and to policy people. 'The great hope of the European Enlightenment was that philosophers could work things out. It was Marx's idea and Lenin's too. And it hasn't worked. It hasn't worked for the same reason why democracy is a good idea. Nothing in social life really works unless a lot of people believe in it. Hearing from the mountain is not a way of coming to believe. 'I really do think - and this is much easier to say after the last two years in eastern Europe - that these are the problems of our time. The idea that our differences come from inside, that they flow from the blood, is a very dangerous way of thinking.'</p>

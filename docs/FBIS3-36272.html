Colonel General Nikolay Golushko, Director of Russian Federal  Counterintelligence Service, Answers IZVESTIYA Special  Correspondent Valeriy Yakov's Questions"]    [Text] This conversation had been repeatedly postponed,  but the arguments presented by the Federal Counterintelligence  Service [FCS] were so convincing that I frequently had to agree  with them. What indeed could you say when the president's edict  abolishing the Ministry of Security came as a surprise to the  actual ministry (at least that was what many of this  department's high-ranking personnel said) and the structure of  the new organization -- the FCS -- had to be developed virtually  from scratch?    Despite having a host of formal reasons for canceling this,  his first major interview in his new post, Nikolay Golushko  finally named a specific time and the conversation went ahead.    It was a frosty morning, and dapper men filed from the  subway  to the main entrance of the new Lubyanka building in a hurry to  start their working day and, judging by their numbers, personnel  cuts are not yet over here.    After studying my editorial ID card and that of the  photographer, the cheerful warrant officers at the entrance  asked us to wait for General A. Izmodenov, the director's aide,  to come down to get us. We went up to the fourth floor with  him. There was a deserted corridor with the traditional carpet  runner and locked doors on both sides bearing no name plates,  just numbers. The general suddenly opened a door that was hardly  different from the rest (apart from the fact that it was made of  metal and covered in leather of a different color) and we found  ourselves in a spacious reception room. The director's office,  the windows of which look over the courtyard, seemed huge at  first (when you worked out how many paces it is to the main  desk), but N. Golushko was already halfway to greet us and our  initial impression diminished.    There were a host of files of various colors on the desk.  The aide moved some of them, the biggest ones, to one side. On  the left there was a bank of telephones. The furniture and  light fittings were not luxurious, but very good-quality and  blended well with one another. You feel as if you are in an  ordinary modern department (although not a poor one), but by no  means inside a bureaucratic building with a scary past. The  Russian flag stood on the corner of the desk and behind the  director there was a picture of the president.    [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, the Statute on the FCS has  been adopted and approved by the president, but the crux of it  is still unclear; are we to see it as a guide for action and is  the Law on Federal Security Organs no longer valid?    [Golushko] The main content of the Statute on the FCS deals  with the formation of a new centralized special service which,  coupled with other existing structures, will have the duty of  ensuring the country's state security. It is a question of  creating this service in a radical, revolutionary way and top  officials from the Security Council and the president's  administration are involved in this work along with the leaders  of components of the Federation.... The Statute defines the  functional tasks of the FCS, which is transformed into a special  service and will in effect cease to be a law enforcement organ.    Acording to the Statute, the task of the FCS is to work to  expose, avert, and suppress intelligence-gathering and  subversive activity by foreign special services and  organizations and illegal encroachments on Russia's  constitutional system, sovereignty, territorial integrity, and  defense capability. The unified counterintelligence system  incorporates territorial and regional organs in republics,  krays, and oblasts and military counterintelligence organs in  the Armed Forces, Border Guard Troops and Internal Troops, and  other Russian Federation military formations. I would  particularly like to stress that, according to the Statute, all  FCS activity will be carried out strictly in accordance with the  requirements of the Russian Constitution and the law --  including the Laws On Security, On Organs of State Security, and  On Operational-Investigative Activity.    [Yakov] Today are there any of your deputies or collegium  members who are not members of these organs? What criteria do  you use to certify them apart from the wide-ranging concepts of  "sense of duty" and "loyalty to the motherland"? Has the  presidential apparatus certified anyone?    [Golushko] The certification commission headed by O. Lobov  is at work virtually every day from 1830 to 2200 or 2300 hours.  Yu. Baturin, S. Kovalev, N. Medvedev, S. Stepashin, and others  are on the commission. Standing orders have been formulated as  well as the procedure for introducing the members of the  leadership to the president. The commission has already  approved the appointment of over 20 leadership personnel after  conversations with them.    A commission has been set up to certify operational cadres,  including at local level. All this involves more than just a  formal examination of their CV's or personal affairs.  Conversations are held with every staffer who is being  considered for a leadership post. People who were tipped for  top roles are eliminated. The criteria include the following:  Job assessment, practical results over the last two years --  since 1991 -- and any penalties or breaches of discipline. We  see whether citizens have made any complaints about human rights  violations by the person concerned. Our people's willingness to  serve in any part of the country and work in the "hot spots" is  also appreciated. After all, we have always had representatives  of our central apparatus everywhere in addition to local  personnel. Last year two of our staffers died in Tajikistan on  an official tour of duty. Incidentally, Aleksandr Izmodenov,  who met you, spent two months working in Abkhazia, cooperating  with the special services, the leadership, and representatives  of the Foreign Ministry, and performing tasks in Russia's  interests. I could also cite many examples with regard to other  regions.    [Yakov] Nonetheless, Nikolay Mikhaylovich, how will the new  special service differ from the previous one if it still has the  same people holding the same ranks and working in the same  buildings with the same files, and the same agents?    [Golushko] What can I say? Only that the new generation of  security organs in the new Russia is most likely still at school  and studying at higher educational establishments.    We had a number of academy graduates, we have deployed 400  people, I think that these are the personnel responsible for the  future. But an operational worker or a counterintelligence  staffer, who generally has a knowledge of languages, does not  drop out of the sky so easily.    I do not think it right today to reproach our personnel for  the department's sins of old. They are not after all being  certified for the first time. A considerable number of people  were discharged after August 1991. The second phase occurred  when the Ministry of Security was being set up, a fairly tough  elimination policy was applied there too. Now yet another  certification process is under way.    [Yakov] Some 45 percent of Ministry of Security personnel  will be left out of the FCS and there is no guarantee that the  MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs] or the tax police will want  to take on your rejects. What does the future hold for them  then, which structures will grow stronger with their experience  -- criminal or commercial structures, the parties of Zyuganov,  Zhirinovskiy, or Barkashov?...    [Golushko] Every staffer's future is decided on an  individual basis. Some will retire on a pension, others will go  to the MVD, those with a knowledge of languages will go into  foreign intelligence. The coming certification process should  not be described as a "weeding-out process," much less should  citizens of the united Russian state be divided into "them" and  "us" according to party orientation.    We estimate that most professionals will continue working  in new jobs in the interests of Russia. Our former colleagues'  possible involvement in criminal structures can cause nothing  but regret.    [Yakov] The experience of the last few years provides  convincing evidence that coups d'etat and mass disturbances may  be provoked not only by foreign special services, but also by  Russian politicians. The Ministry of Security was unable to  prevent the previous disturbances and coups, which department  will now forecast and prevent such events?    [Golushko] In my view, one should not be so categorical in  assessing security organs' activity to prevent what you call the  "coups d'etat and mass disturbances" of the past few years. The  law prohibited the Ministry of Security from operating in  political parties and movements. However, top organs of power  were constantly briefed on all anticonstitutional, extremist,  and radical manifestations. Including on the "Barkashovites,"  long before the tragic events.    Today, in our view, one should not name a single organ that  will engage in "forecasting and preventive work." The  Commission for Public Security set up within the Ministry of  Security can coordinate law enforcement organs and the special  services, the FCS included, in order to perform similar tasks.    But political parties and movements must be monitored by the  Justice Ministry, as envisaged by the Law on Public Associations  (this pertains to the constant question of "political  investigation").    [Yakov] Counterintelligence presupposes the existence of an  enemy, whom your work is to "counter." But whereas previously  any pioneer activist could have been called the enemy of the  homeland, how will things stand now? Whom do you assume to be  your enemies in distant foreign parts and will you have enemies  in nearby foreign countries?    [Golushko] We are acting on a different principle and will  not organize our work on territorial or any geographical  grounds. Or on the basis of membership of a particular bloc. We  will combat those special services that are conducting specific  subversive activity against Russia.    [Yakov] What will you do with the NKVD, KGB, and Ministry of  Security archives; what principle will you use to divide them up  between the new special services?    [Golushko] A considerable proportion of the archive material  has been declassified by a special commission -- this includes  material on the czar's family, Bulgakov, Sholokhov, Florenskiy,  and Kozin. Systematic work is under way to transfer documents  that have no bearing on counterintelligence to the Russian State  Archive Service. There are plans for us to join other  establishments in declassifying material on scientific and  cultural figures during the totalitarian regime, on the state,  religion, the Korean war, and so on. And, most importantly, to  further review cases for rehabilitation.    [Yakov] There were only 19 investigators, conducting 400  cases, for the 60 vacancies in the Moscow Ministry of Security's  Investigation Department. The vacancies and cases are now being  transferred to the Prosecutor's Office, but investigators are  refusing to transfer, what lies in store for these cases and the  people under investigation?    [Golushko] Our special service is losing its role as a law  enforcement organ, it is being stripped of investigation  subunits, merely retaining inquiry functions [funktsii  doznaniya]. Therefore around 2,000 criminal cases being worked  on by the Ministry of Security (as of 18 January 58 cases,  including eight criminal cases, had been transferred to the  Moscow Prosecutor's Office, whereby 17 people had been arrested  and it has been agreed to hand over another 220 cases) are being  handed over to the General Prosecutor's Office and its organs at  local level. To date 62 out of 76 FCS territorial organs have  handed over material to the prosecutor's office. All military  counterintelligence cases have been handed over. As for  investigators, each will have an opportunity, if they so desire,  to continue serving in the FCS after they have been certified.    [Yakov] What lies in store for your former agents? You  cannot after all divide them up among the new services, it would  probably be easier to put them on ice until better times come  along?    [Golushko] Work with agents has of late been put on a legal  footing. You probably know that a law was adopted allowing us  to have confidential sources. It defined the rights and duties  of citizens who cooperate with state security organs. I do not  think that there will be any problem with them, especially since  the size of the agent apparatus has been considerably reduced  compared with the KGB.    [Yakov] So, the so-called operational reserve officers  [ofitsery deystvuyushchego rezerva] will still be working under  various "umbrellas"?    [Golushko] The institution of operational reserve officers  or the practice of attaching [prikomandirovaniye] special  service officers to ministries, departments, organizations,  establishments, and firms is not our invention, but is used by  all the world's special services -- and fairly effectively at  that. I can confidently say today that critical assessments of  the attached personnel are fairly rare and are often an  interpersonal thing. Our tactics for handling reserve officers  and attached personnel will meet requirements and the tasks that  the FCS can feasibly perform. Naturally, mindful of requests  from heads of establishments, departments, and firms.    [Yakov] The Lubyanka complex, secret rendezvous, training  centers, recreational bases, the Ministry of Security academy...  -- who will divide up this property belonging to the people,  how, and between whom?    [Golushko] The president's edict has assigned the federal  service crucial tasks, and the corresponding material,  financial, and operational base will be needed to resolve them.  What is more, the FCS safeguards the interests of intelligence  personnel, border guards, and the protection service [sluzhba  okhrany], and that is why we are not currently facing the  question of dividing up the material base.    [Yakov] Sizeable expenditure is needed for the upkeep of  this sizeable base and you probably already have estimates as to  the FCS budget for 1994. Following the 46-percent cut in  personnel, should we expect your budget to drop by roughly the  same proportion compared with the Ministry of Security?    [Golushko] Of course. Spending on cadre pay will drop  considerably.    [Yakov] What will be the resulting figure?    [Golushko] At the moment we do not have a budget and it is  hard for me to give you a thorough answer. As far as January at  least is concerned we were given funding in December based on  the number of staff.    [Yakov] A good answer. I would even say a significant  answer. Well then, could you be a little more specific and tell  us how much a middle-ranking FCS staffer and the director are  paid?    [Golushko] Let's ask now, just a minute. (He repeated the  question down the intercom, probably to a financial expert. The  following response came: "An operational worker at the center  earns 156,598 rubles, but I did not make enquiries about the  minister." Golushko laughed. -- V.Ya.). Well then, that's what  our pay is like. The director's pay is like that of any  minister. Plus an allowance for rank and years of service.    [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, your department recently made  the surprise revelation to the press that last year alone the  Ministry of Security arrested 20 spies and a number of top  bosses were discharged following a Ministry of Security report  on their contacts with foreign intelligence services. But no  names were given although the press was very keen to know who  these bosses were and the reason for their dismissal.    [Golushko] The former ministry of security did indeed expose  a number of spies working for the foreign special services. A  number of so-called "go-it-aloners" [initsiativniki] were also  uncovered. Criminal proceedings have been instituted against  some people and preventive-explanatory work carried out with  others.    Where possible, we provide the newspapers with specific  figures and information. I can tell you, for instance, that in  January the FCS arrested a Russian citizen whose activity was  doing damage comparable, from preliminary estimates, to that of  the Penkovskiy or Tolkachev case. (Shortly before this  conversation N.M. Golushko promised IZVESTIYA an exclusive  chance to talk about this case. But during the conversation he  regrettably confined himself to just a single sentence -- V.Ya.)    We realize that journalists and readers need clear facts.  But you must understand our position too, we can by no means  talk about everything in the interests of the cause, secrets may  be revealed in time.    [Yakov] Do you think that the FCS will be around for a long  time or until the next election when our next leaders will start  carving up the special services again, most likely in their own  political interests rather than the interests of the state?    [Golushko] Sad as it is to admit, but your question does  imply the corresponding answer. Although, as I have already  told you, there is nothing bad per se in the special services  being reorganized, and many highly developed countries are doing  this mindful of the global geopolitical changes.    But let us not predict whether the FCS will be around for a  long time or not. I think that everything will depend on how  the service actually proves its effectiveness in defending the  interests of the people and the Fatherland. And whether it will  be "small change" in politicians' actions and "cops the flak"  after they mess up.    [Yakov] Have you contemplated your possible retirement?    [Golushko] I see that as a natural process and I think that  the time will nonetheless come in our country when a change of  government will not be a supernatural event and the resignation  of individual leaders will cease to appear a tragedy.    [Yakov] Thus I see that you are mentally prepared for that  twist of fate. But what then -- will you write your memoirs,  take up political activity, set up an association to guard  banks, go fishing?    [Golushko] I will not be setting up any associations. As  for writing my memoirs, I have my memories. I know how state  security organs work. I have personally been involved in  operational work and in investigating a number of notorious  cases, and I have been well acquainted with very famous  people.... But I have not as yet made any specific plans in  this direction, I am not in the mood.    [Yakov] Have you deliberately omitted fishing? I  deliberately put that question to you in order to get some idea  of what you are like outside work.    [Golushko] Outside work I used to prefer reading. I was  familiar with and loved a great deal of poetry, in particular  Pushkin and Yevtushenko. I don't have any particular passions  apart from picking mushrooms. But I haven't seen any mushrooms  for about two years now.    [Yakov] Nikolay Mikhaylovich, Zhirinovskiy once said that if  he comes to power he will revive the KGB. If he does indeed  come to power, how soon, in your view, will he be able to turn  back the clock?    [Golushko] It is no longer possible to revive anything now,  the things that have gone have disappeared never to return. But  there could be completely new organs.</p>

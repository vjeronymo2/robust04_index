			<p><P> July 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> WHERE TO PLAY  </P> <P> Each of the San Fernando Valley's four hockey leagues comes with its own set of  rules, requirements and perks.  </P> <P> Though all require helmets and heavy padding, the use of face masks and eye  shields varies from league to league.  </P> <P> The skill level also varies. The National Novice Hockey Assn. has traditionally  been associated with beginners, whereas the Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. has  a reputation for fielding more advanced players. But both leagues have moved  into each other's territory. The NNHA now has Hockey America, an advanced  league. The Los Angeles County Hockey Assn. started L.A. Novice last season for  beginners.  </P> <P> League fees, which do not include the cost of equipment, are from the 1988-89  season. Most league officials said the fees will probably increase this year  because of hikes in insurance rates and ice rink rates.  </P> <P> What follows is a guide to the four leagues.  </P> <P> National Novice Hockey Assn.  </P> <P> The NNHA was organized in 1980 in Washington and moved to the Los Angeles area  in 1981.

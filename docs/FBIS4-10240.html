			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "First Delivery" newscast] </F>   [Text] Inhabitants of San Miguel and La Union Departments  have called this station to deny that Armando Calderon Sol  visited these departments as reported by a television station.  The televised report showed Calderon Sol campaigning in the  Belen neighborhood, at San Miguel's Student Center, and in El  Pilon, La Union Department.    Our sources, meanwhile, say they only saw Dr. Borgo  Bustamante and Guadalupe Sorto. On 6 April, Calderon Sol was  supposed to have met with members of the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal and Dr. Ruben Zamora at El Presidente Hotel, but he  failed to show up. Several government officials maintained that  the ruling party candidate was visiting eastern El Salvador, but  others said he was in the western region.    The public disappearance of the ARENA [Nationalist  Republican  Alliance] candidate, along with the designs of certain media to  show Calderon Sol in places he has not been, reinforce  unofficial reports that Calderon Sol is in a hospital outside of  the country. Diplomatic sources who asked not to be identified  noted that last weekend Calderon Sol had a nervous breakdown  that prompted him to severely beat his wife, Elizabeth de  Calderon Sol, and this is why he is in a hospital in New Orleans.</p>

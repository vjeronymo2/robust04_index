			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / A marketable Danger Man: Tony Blair tells Philip Stephens how economic efficiency and social justice could go hand in hand under Labour In six weeks Mr Tony Blair expects to be the next leader of the Labour party. Barring a freak electoral accident, he will be. Mr John Prescott will put up a good fight. Mrs Margaret Beckett is a shrewder, more able politician than she is given credit for. Both should receive a respectable degree of support in the cumbersome electoral college of MPs, party activists and trades unions supporters that decides the succession. But in its heart the Labour party has probably made up its mind. After 15 years in the political wildnerness, it shows every sign that it has rediscovered an appetite for power instead of protest. Mr Blair, a 41-year-old barrister who entered parliament only in 1983, will have fewer than three years to establish himself as a credible prime minister-in-waiting, and to present his party as a plausible alternative government. He has never travelled in a ministerial car. He was 26 when Mrs Margaret Thatcher launched her revolution. But he is as sure as any politician to be found at Westminster of where he wants to end up: in 10 Downing Street. He would hate the comparison but, like Mrs Thatcher before him, the MP for the former mining constitutuency of Sedgefied, County Durham, is a dangerous politician: dangerous because he embraces political ideas and ambition in equal measure. It is the perception of the soft-centred appeal of an Oxbridge-educated former public schoolboy to Labour's lost supporters in southern England that has propelled the media bandwagon in his favour since the death of Mr John Smith. But it is his fluent promise to recreate Labour as a party of ideas that alarms his embattled opponents in Mr John Major's cabinet. Let us not run ahead of events. Before he can contemplate a general election, Mr Blair must win the leadership. The result may be predictable (as far as anything can be certain even in the modern Labour party) but the battle will be important. It will be the most important test he has faced of the depth and resilience of his commitment to a different kind of socialism. It should tell us whether he has the capacity to translate his ideology into a message that the electorate can understand, whether he can give policy substance to his media soundbites. By the end of July, we should also have a clear idea of whether his party is ready to see social democracy supplant socialism. Sitting in his comfortable but ramshackle constituency home in the village of Trimdon, Mr Blair is enthusiastic about the project. He is nervous (who wouldn't be?). But he leaves the impression of a politician who is far more excited about the potential opportunities than daunted by them. In an interview lasting more than 75 minutes and ranging across a dozen issues, there emerge two or three central themes: Labour must embrace the future; it must stop confusing its basic, still essential, values with outdated means of implementing them; it must take the political fight against the Conservatives on to ground of its, not their, choosing. The words and phrases which recur most often are: individual, opportunity, education, values, dynamic market economy, social cohesion. Somehow he manages to knit them together without the seams showing. But there are flashes of acknowledgment, too, that Mr Blair's party is not yet quite as modern as he might like it to be - and that he needs the votes of traditionalists as well as fellow modernisers. So full employment, the standard raised by Mr Prescott yesterday at the start of his campaign, is not a commitment to be jettisoned. Nor is the pledge, cherished by Mr Smith, of a minimum wage. Instead, they will be implemented flexibly and with 'common sense', another of Mr Blair's favourite phrases. The interview starts with Labour's project for the country: 'First of all we need to develop the notion of a dynamic modern economy which is delivering opportunity to all its people and not merely to a limited number. 'It's got to have at its core, notions of social cohesion and social justice, a modern constitution for the country and a modern organisation for the party, which is capable of sustaining it not merely in opposition but in government. 'Its overarching theme, through what I call this process of national renewal, is the idea of economic efficiency and social justice, hand in hand.' Mr Blair warms to the theme: 'We must escape from the idea that has marked the Tory years whereby people believe you have to choose between an efficient economy and notions of social cohesion or social justice. 'In my view the central message of the modern Labour party is to reunite notions of individual aspiration with notions of a strong cohesive society so that the process of social improvement leads to self-improvement.' There you have it. At the heart of Mr Blair's philosophy is the notion that the individual prospers only in a strong society. Labour is the friend, not the enemy, of self-advancement. But doesn't that mean a wholesale rejection of Labour's past, the creation of a new social democrat party? Didn't some others in the Labour party try that with the SDP in the early 1980s? Mr Blair anticipates the question. 'The Labour party got into problems when, like many left-of-centre parties, it failed to distinguish between its values and principles - which I believe stem from an essential belief in the role of society and its relationship to the individual - when it started to confuse those principles and values with particular means of implementation, which might be relevant for a particular time but which then have to change from generation to generation.' It is a cumbersome answer. But the message is clear. The party's policies should reflect the modern application of traditional values. It should build on, not relive, its past. His solidly Labour constituents in Sedgefield have no quarrel with the idea that the party should want to give them a leg-up in society. Why should anyone else? And no, this does not make Mr Blair a left-leaning Tory: 'It is not merely a question of saying, if you like, you run a Tory economy, but there is a bit of compassion added in. 'The basic principle that distinguishes the Labour party from the Conservatives is that we are prepared both economically and socially to use the power of society in order to advance the individual. Call it social solidarity, call it what you will, but that basic principle is what differentiates the parties.' It all sounds plausible stuff. But where, as an inelegant American once put it, is the beef? What sort of economy would a Labour government led by Mr Blair run? Does he believe in markets? He does. 'We want a dynamic market economy. It is not merely that I, as it were, with hesitation, acknowledge that this is the way we have to go. I say that it is positively in the public interest to have a dynamic market economy.' Of itself, though, this is not enough: 'Where I differ from the Tories is in believing that merely by having a market economy you thereby encapsulate the entirety of the public interest in economic policy.' The market, it seems, is to be treated as a means rather than an end: 'There will be things the market simply cannot do and limitations to what it can achieve. But perhaps more importantly, in order to make that market economy operate efficiently in a modern world there will be social and public objectives that society as a whole will have to achieve.' He is cautious about what can be achieved through macro-economic policy. Holding down inflation matters: 'The purpose of any macro-economic policy should be sustainable growth and rising employment. It has to be sustainable over a period of time. It is in the interests of nobody that you have short periods of boom followed by long periods of bust . . . which is actually the hallmark of macro-economic policy over the last 15 years.' Labour's commitment to 'lifetime' education and training marks a recognition that crude demand management no longer holds the answers in a open, international, economy. The supply side counts. If it did not, people would not be talking about the economy bumping up against constraints while there were still nearly 3m people out of work. 'There is no long-term future for this country on an other basis than by having a highly educated, adaptable and flexible workforce. That will come primarily through education and skills. I don't think there is any greater priority than developing those areas.' It is here that Mr Blair gives a sense that he has carefully rehearsed his core message: he sees in his economic and social prospectus the chance for Labour to define a new political battleground. The script runs as follows: 'What I think we have to do in economic policy is set out in effect - this is the scale of the task - we have to set out a new economic agenda for what will be very shortly a new millenium.' That means: 'Moving beyond arguments about public versus private sector, market versus state, even regulation versus deregulation. These are arguments, where obviously there are difficult questions to be resolved, but they are not going to hold the key to whether Britain succeeds or not as an economy.' Instead: 'The key to whether Britain succeeds in my view lies first of all in developing individual potential through education and skills. It is absolutely central, because if we do not do that through enhancing opportunities at the workplace and by making sure those who are unemployed get the chance to work, we will be unable to modernise our economy.' Now Mr Blair is setting out his stall: 'Secondly, we need to develop at the workplace the notion of a modern industrial partnership so that employees and managers are working together, not set in some irredeemable conflict against one another.' The third item on this checklist is an industrial policy, but not an outdated one: 'The role of government is not about picking winners or whatever. It is about government enabling industry to make the best use of things like technology and research and development.' Partnership would also replace interventionism in the implementation of his fourth priority: the rebuilding of Britain's infrastructure. Building new rail links, and regenerating Britain's inner cities would be done in public-private sector parnership. Mr Blair has not finished. Fifthly, a Labour government would not ignore the social dimension to economic advancement, whether through education and training or through reform of the welfare state. He will not commit himself on specific measures in advance of the report of the party's Social Justice Commission, but he knows the direction in which the party should be going: 'That means, if you like, modernising the welfare state so that it becomes about economic opportunity for people, not simply about welfare dependency.' After 10 minutes Mr Blair is coming to the end of the list, and on this final point one suspects his words are directed as much at the expansive economic ambitions of some traditionalists in his own party as to a wider audience. The sixth plank in the new economic agenda is a 'recognition that macro-economic policy has got to be governed by principles of international co-operation. It is not possible in today's world to isolate ourselves from other economies and run macro-economic policy in a vacuum.' Labour must own up to reality, he might have said. Mr Blair sums up: 'These are the items which in my view will form a new economic agenda. Those are the things that governments should be concentrating on. These other issues - you know, a battle for territory between public versus private sector . . . that's just the politics of decades ago. And the public has long since moved beyond that.' It is time to take him on to slightly rougher ground. How do a blanket commitment to full employment and to a minimum wage fit in with this new modernism vision? Surely they are symbols of a collectivist past? Just this week the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development warned Europe of the need to de- not re-regulate its employment markets to provide the job opportunities he talks about. Mr Blair, predictably enough, is prepared for the questions. Some, on the modernising wing of the Labour party, would like the pledges to be put quietly to one side, if not dropped. But Mr Blair's contention is that they are, anyway, more flexible than outsiders have appreciated. When Mr Smith offered the full employment commitment at last year's Trades Union Congress, he drew an implicit link with the undertaking given by the then Conservative government in its 1944 White Paper. That document, Mr Blair reminds us, said: 'It should be one of the primary responsibilities of government to promote high and stable levels of employment - that is the definition of the goal of full employment.' He is entirely comfortable with that as a goal - what politician would not be? But there would be no commitment to put x million people back into work during a specific timescale: 'It's not a numbers game.' And then: 'I don't think anyone would suggest that this is something you can achieve overnight or that you won't still have frictional levels of unemployment. But the important thing is to make a start and do so with a commitment that it is a responsibility of government to ensure the conditions in which people get the chance to work.' Mr Blair chooses his words just as carefully when pressed on the minimum wage. The argument about regulation of labour markets has been polarised. His is the common sense approach. 'It is important that we have a balance between sensible regulation to provide a minimum set of fair standards at the workplace and legislation that does not load costs unreasonably on employers. The notion we have a choice either of inflexible social legislation or an entirely deregulated labour market is absolutely absurd.' Nor would Labour slavishly accept everything suggested by its European partners: 'You take the social chapter. What I always used to say about the social chapter is that it was right we should have binding principles and flexible means . . . that we should ensure that it is implemented in a way that is sensible and flexible.' As for the minimum wage: 'It is important to argue for the principle of a basic minimum level below which no one falls. Provided that it is done sensibly and administered in a sensible way, then what it does is to remove the most exploitative forms of low pay.' He will not put a figure on the level of any minimum wage. It would, anyway, have to operate flexibly. Young people on training programmes, for example, would not be covered. But 'it is foolish and old-fashioned to believe that if you have a level of fair treatment at the workplace, you are going to create a less efficent economy'. Mr Blair knows how to play off a sticky wicket. He does it again on tax and spending. No, he will not provide the FT, even before he has become party leader, with a list of specific pledges to be offered at the next election. But he will say that Labour would not be in the business of spending and taxing for the sake of it. And he will remind our readers of the Conservatives' record in order to refocus the debate where it properly should be - on the link between economic performance, taxation and spending. 'I think the two most significant statistics of the Tory years are that after 15 years of a government committed ostensibly to low taxation and cutting public spending we have tax and spending as a higher proportion of our national income than under the last Labour government.' In other words: 'We are running a high tax economy because we are running a low success economy.' So would Labour cut the burden? Well, Labour was committed to running a successful economy: 'The critical reason why we have failed is that we have not had the capacity or the skills to develop a modern economy that is capable of creating the wealth so that we can get tax rates down and yet have a level of social spending that is acceptable.' For good measure Mr Blair adds that Labour opposed the last round of tax increases: 'The critical task is to improve the performance of the economy so that the burden of taxation is reduced.' No hostages to fortune there. And that is another reason why Mr Blair is a dangerous politician. Along with the ideas and the ambition, there is discipline and self-control. The Conservatives may think they have worries enough without thinking about the next leader of the Labour party. They would be wrong.</p>

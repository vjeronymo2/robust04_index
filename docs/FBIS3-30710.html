Together with the Czech  Republic, Slovakia advocates shortening the term for removal of  customs and non-tariff barriers from eight to five years.    Economic ministers of the four CEFTA countries -- the Czech  Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland -- are expected to  approve speeding up the liberalisation of mutual trade on  February 4.    "We do not want to slide back to the times of COMECON  [Council for Mutual Economic Assistance], but want to revive  trade among Central European countries," Miroslav Adamis,  director of the Multilateral Cooperation Section at the Slovak  Ministry of Economy, told CTK today.    He said CEFTA's importance resides in liberalising trade,  even though it does not free financial flows, capital and  labour. It will thus enable its member countries to see what is  in store for them when they join the free market of the  12-member European Union.    The use of European Union rules on the origin of goods at  the  same time supports cooperation of enterprises from CEFTA  countries in penetrating Western markets.    "The CEFTA countries have not yet coped with the decline of  trade after the transition to accounting in freely convertible  currencies in 1991, when it turned out that our goods could not  compete with Western offerings," Adamis said.    "CEFTA's reviving influence did not manifest itself more  even  when further decline stopped. Last year's trade turnovers with  Poland and Hungary remained on the level of 1992. But this year  CEFTA can be expected to bring results," he added.    Around one-half of the trade turnover is fully liberalised,  according to Adamis, and the next stage of removal customs  duties will begin in July. Most industrial products will be  freed from customs duties before 1998. But even shortening the  original term for removal of tariff and non-tariff barriers from  eight to five years will not free all goods from the "protective  umbrella."    Adamis said he believed there was no political will to  accept  other countries to CEFTA, but that cooperation could be expanded  through bilateral agreements on free trade, especially with  Slovenia, Romania and possibly also with Turkey and Israel. The  Czech Republic remains Slovakia's main trade partner.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 11 KYODO -- A senior postal ministry  official indicated Monday [11 April] that the ministry is  considering punitive action against several television stations  because of their inaccurate reporting of election results.    Akimasa Egawa, head of the Posts and Telecommunications  Ministry's Broadcasting Bureau, said Japan Broadcasting Corp.  (NHK) and commercial television stations will be subject to  punishment.    Some unsuccessful candidates were reported to be assured of  election in the early stage of vote counting in the House of  Representatives election in July last year, he said.    Egawa said the existing law bars television stations from  offering biased reports to viewers.    In the general election, NHK and five commercial key  stations  provided erroneous reports in 19 cases, according to the  ministry.</p>

			<p>931112 FT  12 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: Sugar wrong about Labour in Europe Sir, Is Mr Alan Sugar (Letters, November 10) a politically motivated knave, a fool, or both? Or is he merely bringing the same level of competence to his letter writing as he does to his negotiation and management skills of Tottenham Hotspur FC? John Smith, leader of the Labour party, was at the same congress of the party of European Socialists as I, and presumably agreed the same manifesto as I had in my file: Mr Sugar's view of its commitments is both inaccurate concerning detail and tendentious concerning meaning. If he wants to write a more reflective piece on what is a very good common manifesto based on its real rather than imagined content I will happily supply him with a copy upon receipt of a stamped addressed envelope. In the meantime either his company or Spurs needs his care and concern more than the Labour party. Even if he feels compelled to venture into political advice, recent opinion polls suggest that the government needs wisdom - his or anyone else's - rather than other potential beneficiaries of his no doubt altruistic but nevertheless ill founded letter. John Tomlinson, 42 Bridge Street, Walsall WS1 1JQ</p>

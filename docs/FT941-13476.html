			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / World Stock Markets: Measured view of Japan's prospects The failure of the Japanese government to secure passage of the political reform bill through parliament last Friday came too late to affect the performance of that country's component in the FT-Actuaries World index. However, yesterday's sharp fall in the Nikkei average as a consequence of the bill's defeat could, barring an uptick later in the week, have a significant short term effect on the Asian markets in particular and the world in general. Nevertheless, many strategists remain confident about the longer term picture in Japan, with Nomura's Mr Nicholas Knight, for instance, making the point that an economic stimulation package still looks likely. 'Whatever their differences with regard to political reform, all (parties) are agreed upon the need for significant further economic stimulation, via a package containing substantial income tax cuts and further spending measures: a cut in the discount rate also becomes an immediate probability,' he says. Mr Albert Edwards at Kleinwort Benson also takes a more measured view of Japan's current political crisis. He notes that a number of fund managers have been making strategic moves into the market recently, and that others are likely to move in now as equity prices fall, thereby underpinning the Nikkei. 'I am still quite happy about things,' he said yesterday, 'since this sort of volatility is not a major surprise: we have seen the Nikkei reach 21,000 (in August 1993), then slip to 16,000 (in November 1993), before bouncing back to 19,000. What we have seen now is people unwinding positions on hopes that the reform package would be passed: those same people will return on a 12-month view, given expectations of further interest rate cuts and other fiscal incentives.' Volatility in Asia was also expressed last week in Malaysia, measuring the world's largest one-week decline, and contrasting with Hong Kong's similar but positive advance. Kuala Lumpur, comments Mr David Bates of Asia Equity, has been affected by worries over a provincial election in Subah and foreign exchange instability. However, it is also worth keeping in mind that Malaysia enjoyed a 50 per cent rise in local currency terms in the last quarter of 1993.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                   % change   % change                % change in local currency*       sterling* in US Dlrs*            -------------------------------------------------------------              1 Week  4 Weeks   1 Year  Start of   Start of   Start of                                            1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +0.75    +5.48   +52.17    +45.93     +36.55     +34.83 Belgium       +0.95    +1.53   +29.50    +33.71     +23.82     +22.26 Denmark       +0.48    +9.85   +41.37    +53.14     +43.38     +41.58 Finland       +2.28   +16.07  +120.25   +126.42    +111.40    +108.75 France        -0.58    +1.25   +29.67    +27.97     +20.68     +19.16 Germany       -2.45    -5.89   +30.89    +33.78     +25.58     +23.99 Ireland       +3.56   +12.65   +71.86    +73.44     +54.80     +52.84 Italy         +2.09    +0.55   +30.49    +44.10     +26.32     +24.73 Netherlands   +1.65    +3.89   +42.49    +44.51     +36.04     +34.33 Norway        +2.32   +11.58   +49.04    +53.84     +43.40     +41.59 Spain         +0.53    +3.68   +40.92    +54.94     +25.64     +24.06 Sweden        +2.45    +9.57   +51.43    +50.74     +33.86     +32.18 Switzerland   +1.83    +3.17   +47.46    +48.16     +50.02     +48.13 UK            +2.71    +3.23   +27.89    +25.32     +25.32     +23.75 EUROPE        +1.23    +2.07   +33.50    +33.94     +28.52     +26.90  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia     +2.17    +7.50   +42.73    +39.37     +44.23     +42.41 Hong Kong     +6.04    +3.67   +97.98   +111.71    +114.94    +112.23 Japan         +3.00    +9.55   +24.42    +20.34     +36.83     +35.10 Malaysia      -6.53    -9.82   +96.32    +93.65     +87.00     +84.65 New Zealand   +2.03    +8.60   +58.58    +50.53     +68.02     +65.91 Singapore     -2.09    -4.27   +54.53    +54.36     +59.86     +57.86  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada        +0.30    +5.76   +30.78    +27.43     +25.06     +23.49 USA           -0.14    +1.39    +8.28     +8.30      +9.68      +8.30 Mexico        +4.78    +3.75   +46.99    +47.83     +50.39     +48.50  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa  -2.50    +0.91   +49.65    +54.97     +72.98     +70.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX   +1.21    +3.78   +21.91    +21.06     +25.18     +23.62  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Based on January 21st 1993.

			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / Shake-up of board at Mirror Group MIRROR GROUP Newspapers is poised to announce that Mr David Montgomery, former editor of Today newspaper, has been appointed chief executive in a board reorganisation. The decision, which is expected to receive formal board approval this morning, prompted the resignation of Mr Joe Haines, an MGN non-executive director and the Daily Mirror's former political editor. Mr Haines last night described Mr Montgomery as 'a rightwinger who once campaigned for the Mirror to be boycotted throughout Ireland because of the Mirror's policy favouring a united Ireland'. After failing to disguise their initial shock at the appointment, senior Labour officials said they remained confident that the Mirror's traditional support for the party would be unchanged. The board changes, which include the appointment of a finance director and several non-executive directors next week, had the backing of MGN's bankers and Arthur Andersen, administrators of the collapsed private Maxwell companies which own a majority of MGN shares. The shares, suspended on the disappearance of Robert Maxwell, were re-listed in July this year. Mr Montgomery will replace Mr Vic Horwood, who is expected to remain within the group as chief executive of the Scottish Daily Record. Mr Bernard Tominey, commercial director, has left.</p>

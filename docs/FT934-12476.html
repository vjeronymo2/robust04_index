			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Survey of Technology in the Office (5): The promise of cost-savings - Video-Conferencing A SERIES of technological innovations beginning in the early 1980s ushered in the age of corporate two-way video-conferencing. The Gulf war in 1991 gave the medium a substantial boost as large companies, particularly in the US, turned to interactive video-conferencing rather than risk the threat of terrorism. Since then more compact, higher quality and cheaper systems have helped turn video-conferencing into an indispensable communications tool for many companies, government organisations and others. Now the first desktop personal-computer based video- conferencing systems have begun to appear and promise to transform office telecommunications in the late 1990s. Corporate converts to video-conferencing already include most of the Fortune 500 in the US and many large national and multinational companies in Europe. Cost-savings on business travel are one of the main reasons why corporate users are turning to video-conferencing. For example, British Aerospace claims it saved 980,000 on the cost of time and travel in the first year of ownership of two video-conferencing installations. Similarly, Rank Xerox calculated that it saved Pounds 2,700 per video-conferencing hour after installing equipment at its Welwyn Garden City site to link with seven of its sites in the US. Customers also report that video-conferencing can boost productivity, improve internal communications and enhance competitiveness. Estimates for the size of the world-wide video-conferencing market vary widely. There is, however, general agreement that the market is growing quickly and that this growth is set to accelerate over the next couple of years. North America is expected to remain the largest market accounting for up to 60 per cent of the total. Within Europe, the most developed markets are the UK, Germany and France, according to figures from Ovum, the telecommunications consultancy. At the heart of all video-conferencing systems is the video codec (coder-decoder) - the component that converts video pictures, sound and control information into a compressed digital form ready for transmission and reception over digital telecommunications lines. Greater silicon integration has enabled codec manufacturers to produce more compact systems at lower costs. This in turn has fuelled increasingly fierce competition between the system manufacturers and is one of the main driving forces behind the falling system prices and market growth. Another important factor which has helped boost equipment sales recently has been agreement on video compression and other world standards by the Geneva-based grouping of telephone companies, the CCITT. These standards have been adopted by all the leading codec manufacturers and ensure inter-operability between systems. THE leading video codec manufacturers include US-based market pioneer Compression Labs (CLI) which introduced the first commercially successful codec in 1982, its main rival, PictureTel, and Videotelcom (Vtel). European suppliers include BT and GPT. The market for video-conferencing equipment divides into three main segments according to Mr Mike Newman, managing director of Internet Videocommunications, the Bristol-based video-conferencing specialist and CLI's distributor in the UK. These are: Large group or studio systems usually installed for use by between six and 10 people at each end. These bespoke studio systems cost from about 30,000 upwards and are the oldest segment of the market - they are the systems which have typically been used by senior executives in large organisations. Although they will remain an important part of the overall market, growth will probably not be as spectacular as that of smaller systems. Small group systems, suitable for up to four people at each end. These compact or cabinet systems first appeared in the late 1980s and usually come on wheels so they are also called 'roll-around', 'roll-about' or mobile room systems (MRS). They represent a second generation of video-conferencing products made possible by the reduction in size and cost of equipment and are likely to be the fastest growing segment of the market over the next few years. For example, CLI's Eclipse system launched in February costs under Dollars 20,000 for a complete fully-assembled and ready-to-plug-in system including overhead graphics and other features until recently only found only on studio systems. Desktop or personal video systems provide one-to-one video-communications usually by adding a video camera and a plug-in video card to a personal computer attached to a digital telephone line or office network. CLI's Cameo Personal Video System, launched last year, is one desktop option and several others are under development. For example Olivetti, Europe's largest PC manufacturer, working with BT over the past two-and-a-half years, has developed the personal communications computer (PCC). The PCC integrates the functions of a video telephone with mainstream computer applications and can transmit voice, video, data, text, and graphics over a single ISDN line. Mr Mark Churchward, divisional manager in Olivetti's UK document management division, says with confidence, 'video on the desktop will revolutionise the way offices work.' Certainly most analysts believe that by the mid-1990s, desktop video will become the fastest growing segment of the video-conferencing market. 'A lot of products are emerging from the development stage,' said Ms Heide Aghnami of Dataquest, 'desktop systems really have a very good chance of success if you imagine the number of PC users in Europe.' Datapoint, another US codec manufacturer, has taken another, highly integrated, approach to providing video on the desktop by combining the functions of a PC and a video- conferencing system into a single workstation called Minx Link which can either work on a point-to-point basis or be hooked up to a local video network to provide multipoint video-conferencing. Analysts are much less enthusiastic about the short-term prospects for the small-screen video-phones - dubbed 'granny phones' - which are already on sale in a number of countries. Most see them developing mainly as a consumer electronics product rather than a business system and even then do not foresee substantial sales until prices come down considerably and picture quality is improved. In contrast, equipment suppliers say that interest in full video-conferencing systems in has never been stronger. 'Prices of equipment are falling and that is opening up the market,' says Mr Robert Ralphs, product manager for video-conferencing at Mercury which, like BT in the UK, also sells equipment alongside its network services. 'Video-conferencing is perceived as cutting costs and it seems to have thrived on recession,' he says. Because equipment is getting cheaper, the purchasing decision is moving down the management ladder - 'you don't necessarily need board approval now,' notes Mr Ralphs. Cheaper prices also mean wider use of video-conferencing equipment and greater access to equipment within large companies. Technical improvements have resulted in higher quality sound and pictures over lower capacity data lines. Meanwhile the wider availability of dial-up digital lines means that customers no longer have to own or lease expensive high capacity dedicated data lines which were not used all the time, or pre-book suitable telecoms circuits in advance. Today, the availability of standard digital office lines means that setting up a video-conference between two offices is no more difficult - or expensive - than making an ordinary voice call through a digital PBX.</p>

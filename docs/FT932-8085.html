			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Young &amp; Co slips 7.5% to Pounds 5.17m as operating margins decline HIGHER interest costs helped depress pre-tax profits at Young &amp; Co's Brewery, the south London-based real ale brewer, by 7.5 per cent from Pounds 5.59m to Pounds 5.17m for the year to March 27. Stripping out last time's exceptional profit of Pounds 244,223 on the sale of assets, the decline was 3 per cent. Turnover was Pounds 72.9m (Pounds 68.1m). Operating profits rose to Pounds 8.19m (Pounds 8.03m). Interest charges rose to Pounds 3.02m (Pounds 2.68m) mainly because of increased borrowings for the August 1991 acquisition of HH Finch, the owner of 22 pubs and six wine bars, and fluctuations in interest rates. The company said gearing at the year-end was unchanged at about 30 per cent. In April, Young raised Pounds 15m from a debenture issue partly to repay bank loans. Operating margins slipped to 11.23 per cent (11.79 per cent). Mr John Young, chairman, said: 'We offer lower prices. In the light of events we probably should have put them up but we try to offer better prices than our competitors. 'Recovery is slow and gradual. In the south and south-east, the recession is still biting quite hard.' He said the company's four hotels, opened on existing pub sites, were repaying their investment. The company is opening another on Monday in south London and has planning permission for two more. Mr Young said he thought the company would ultimately run seven or eight hotels. The board proposes a same-again final dividend of 7.5p giving a maintained total for the year of 14.5p. Earnings per share fell to 26.4p (27.51p).</p>

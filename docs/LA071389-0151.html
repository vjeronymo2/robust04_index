			<p><P> July 13, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> McCaw-Lin Talks Under Way: McCaw Cellular Communications said discussions are  continuing on the possible acquisition of Lin Broadcasting at a price higher  than its current bid of $110 a share. The Kirkland, Wash.-based cellular  telephone company, which originally bid $120 a share for Lin before a court  killed Lin's efforts to acquire certain valuable cellular interests, said it  has discussed other matters with New York-based Lin. Talks included the  possibility of acquiring certain Lin cellular interests or acquiring Lin at a  reduced price after the proposed spinoff of Lin's seven broadcast stations,  McCaw said.  </P></p>

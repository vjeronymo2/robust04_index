			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE STOCK index futures sector suffered one of its biggest one day falls this year leaving the December contract on the Footsie to trade at a discount to fair value for most of the session as the slide in sterling once again undermined market sentiment, writes Joel Kibazo. The opening level of the December contract was recorded at 2,550, which proved to be the high point of the session as early sellers and the poor performance of sterling led to a sharp fall to 2,518 within minutes of the opening. Attempts at a rally mid-morning met with resistance and December once again declined, falling to 2,483 by lunchtime, with sentiment hurt by the weakness in the gilts market. The afternoon saw a rally as Wall Street initially showed only a modest fall. That changed when Wall Street started declining sharply and was followed by a bout of what one trader called 'panic selling'. December finished at 2,460, some 20 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover reached 14,768. The options volume reached 40,670 contracts. The FT-SE option traded 20,761 lots while BT was the busiest stock option at 1,784 contracts.</p>

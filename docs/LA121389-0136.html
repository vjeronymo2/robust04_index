			<p><P> December 13, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY SCHOOL DRIVERS VOTE TO STRIKE  </P> <P> Employees of the school bus agency that serves eight Antelope Valley school  districts voted Tuesday to authorize a strike, complaining about stalled  negotiations and proposed reductions in benefits.  </P> <P> School bus drivers, mechanics and office workers at the Antelope Valley Schools  Transportation Agency, which carries about 17,000 students daily, voted 90 to  17 in favor of a strike.  </P> <P> They set no specific strike deadline, said Sharon Cottee, president of the  employees' union.  </P> <P> Agency workers are angry about proposals that would give management the ability  to unilaterally change drivers' work hours, delete guaranteed two-hour minimum  pay when they are called to work and substantially cut sick-time benefits, said  Cottee, a driver for five years.  </P> <P> "They're trying to take some things away from us that we've had since the  beginning," said Cottee, president of Chapter 652 of the California School  Employees Assn. The union group has represented agency employees since it was  formed in 1980.  </P> <P> The agency is operated by the Antelope Valley Union High School District and  seven elementary districts: Palmdale, Lancaster, Westside Union, Keppel Union,  Wilsona, Hughes-Elizabeth Lakes Union and Gorman.  </P> <P> The agency's three-year contract with its employees expired at the end of June.  The union was asking for a 10% pay raise, and the agency had offered only 5.5%,  but Cottee said pay was not a major issue of the dispute.  </P></p>

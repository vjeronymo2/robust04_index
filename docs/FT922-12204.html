			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / Conservatives aim for a further victory: Andrew Adonis assesses the main parties in the run-up to the local-government elections THE Conservatives will hope to repeat their general election success in the local elections to be held across England and Wales on May 7. Local elections are vehicles for mid-term protest and with the Tories about to enter their fourteenth consecutive year in office, the opposition parties are entrenched in town halls across the country. Only one of England's 36 metropolitan districts remains Tory. Labour has 69 per cent of all metropolitan district councillors, with the Tories reduced to 18 per cent. The Liberal Democrats have 10 per cent. Even in the English shires the Tories can claim to be only the largest minority party - with 38 per cent of non-metropolitan district council seats, against 30 per cent held by Labour and 19 per cent by the Liberal Democrats. In Wales the respective division is 8 per cent, 45 per cent, and 5 per cent, with Plaid Cymru holding 8 per cent of the seats. A host of safe Conservative parliamentary seats now embraces Labour or Liberal councils. It is not just metropolitan areas such as Bury, Greater Manchester, and Wirral, Merseyside. Labour commands an overall majority on the following 16 councils, yet failed on April 9 to take any of the 21 parliamentary seats they embrace: Basildon, Blackpool, Brighton, Erewash, Great Yarmouth, Langbaurgh, Lincoln, Luton, Milton Keynes, Reading, Slough, Watford, Waveney, Welwyn Hatfield, Worcester and Wyre Forest. The Liberal Democrats similarly failed to replicate local success in Congleton, Eastbourne, Hereford, Lewes, Poole, Taunton, Torbay and North Wiltshire. 'Our troops are over the moon about the general election: they expect to make solid advances in the locals,' said Mr David Trowbridge, the Tories' local-elections officer. Bury, Woking, Wolverhampton and Winchester are Tory targets. Tory gains are likely to be modest, however, since the seats up for election in May were last contested in 1988, a good year for the Conservatives. In 1988 the Tories were ahead in the national polls and made a net gain of six council seats. Labour gained 104 net, while the Liberal Democrats suffered a net loss of 75. Some gains by the Liberal Democrats at the Tories' expense are likely, given the centre party's post-1988 revival. They hope to make the small advances needed to take overall control in three councils: Brentwood and Colchester in Essex, and Harrogate. Liberal Democrats might also remove Tory overall majorities in North Herts, Basingstoke and Bath. Labour hopes to keep intact its existing base and translate general election advances into further gains. Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Peterborough and Portsmouth saw strong Labour performances on April 9, and the Tories are defending a strong 1988 showing in each. Even so, the council elections will be a low-key affair - and not just because of voter apathy and activist exhaustion. It is the 'light' year of the local electoral cycle: there are no elections in London, and only four of the 37 district councils in Wales and 114 of the 296 non-metropolitan districts in England are holding polls. All England's metropolitan districts are up for election. With only a third of the seats up for grabs in all the authorities polling, though, the scope for violent swings is small.</p>

			<p><P> January 2, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHP, POLICE ARREST 250 MOTORISTS  </P> <P> On what turned out to be an unusually quiet New Year's weekend, Orange County  police agencies ushered in 1990 by rounding up more than 250 suspected drunk  drivers and investigating sporadic reports of holiday gunfire.  </P> <P> The vast majority of the driving-under-the-influence, or DUI, arrests were made  by the Costa Mesa police, Santa Ana police and California Highway Patrol, who  conducted intensive crackdowns with roving patrols.  </P> <P> Most other Orange County cities, however, reported only a smattering of DUI  arrests during the three-day holiday, despite a new state law that, effective  Monday, lowered the blood-alcohol level for drunk driving from 0.10% to 0.08%.  </P> <P> Anaheim police said they made only four DUI arrests all weekend, even though  they set up sobriety checkpoints both Friday night and New Year's Eve and  questioned more than 1,500 motorists. Two years ago, by comparison, Anaheim  police arrested eight people on suspicion of drunk driving at a single New  Year's Eve checkpoint.  </P> <P> "I think that, hopefully, people are finally wising up and letting their  friends drive if they drink," said Anaheim Police Sgt. Frank Van DeWeerd.  </P> <P> In Huntington Beach, where police arrested three suspected drunk drivers, Sgt.  Luis Ochoa attributed the low number of arrests to a dense layer of fog that  blanketed many coastal areas and reduced New Year's Eve traffic.  </P> <P> "It was very, very quiet, which is unusual for us on New Year's Eve," Ochoa  said.  </P> <P> Despite the hazardous driving conditions, Orange County law enforcement  officials reported no upsurge in traffic accidents and no fatal accidents over  the holiday weekend. The fog extended as far inland as Fountain Valley, where  things were so slow that officers made only seven DUI arrests and were sent out  on just four complaints of wild parties.  </P> <P> "I've worked years past where we couldn't stop" all night long, Sgt. Don  Nielsen said.  </P> <P> The holiday was also comparatively quiet in terms of gunfire from holiday  revelers, a tradition in predominantly Latino areas of the county. Immigrants  from Mexico and other Latin American countries, police officials say, are used  to celebrating the new year with pistol shots into the air.  </P> <P> In contrast to past years, when hundreds of bullets rained down over vast  portions of Orange County, only police in Santa Ana and Westminster had any  significant shooting activity to report. Police attributed the apparent  downturn in shooting to an education campaign that included the distribution of  leaflets in Latino neighborhoods.  </P> <P> In Santa Ana, seven mobile homes "took a round through the roof" from falling  bullets, Lt. Greg Cooper said. Last year, by comparison, Santa Ana police  fielded 24 reports of property damage from holiday gunfire.  </P> <P> The only reported injury on New Year's Eve was to a pedestrian in Santa Ana who  suffered a graze wound to the leg from one of the falling bullets. But Cooper  said it was so superficial that the man did not require medical treatment.  </P> <P> In Westminster, police received five reports of shots being fired into the air  and recovered one pistol that had been discarded by a reveler as officers sped  to one of the scenes. No damage or injuries were reported.  </P> <P> "Compared to last year, it was almost like there was nothing going on,"  Westminster Police Lt. Bob Burnett said.  </P> <P> The busiest police activity over the New Year's weekend was generated by the  drunk-driving patrols instituted by the CHP and by police in Costa Mesa and  Santa Ana.  </P> <P> Costa Mesa police arrested 46 suspected drunk drivers during a nine-hour  enforcement program that began Sunday evening. The arrests, made by a 14-person  task force on roving patrols, topped last year's arrest total by 16, Sgt. Tom  Winter said.  </P> <P> "It was a very, very effective program," Winter said.  </P> <P> Those arrested were detained in Costa Mesa City Jail, which was staffed with  extra personnel to process records and paper work, Winter said.  </P> <P> Santa Ana police, also operating in roving patrols, arrested 55 suspected drunk  drivers during a special crackdown period between Friday afternoon and Monday  morning, Lt. Cooper said.  </P> <P> CHP officers arrested 101 motorists in the county during the same period, CHP  spokesman Keith Thornhill said. The arrest breakdown included 46 in the CHP's  Santa Ana district, 30 in the San Juan Capistrano district and 25 in the  Westminster district, Thornhill said.  </P></p>

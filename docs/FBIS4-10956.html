			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Adela Leal] </F>   [Text] Interior Minister Ramon Escovar Salom told the  Permanent Secretariat of the National Council for Defense and  Security [Seconasede] on 12 April the flow of illegal aliens,  drug trafficking, and transculturation constitute the greatest  threats to national security. Regarding the flow of illegal  aliens, Escovar said the "first problem" that must be tackled to  solve the illegal aliens problem is the Sectorial General  Directorate of Identification and Control of Foreigners [Diex],  which must be revamped.    Escovar made this statement at the opening of the First  Round  of Conferences on Security and Defense, organized by Seconasede,  which is being held on 12, 13, and 14 April. Escovar and other  prominent individuals are scheduled to participate at this  meeting.    During his speech, Escovar mentioned the subject of  Venezuela: its political situation and effects on security and  defense. Escovar said, among other things, national security and  defense have several serious and complex problems. The first  problem is the need to control the undetermined number of  illegal aliens in the country, a situation that creates several  problems.    He conceded there are irregularities regarding the  identification of foreigners. Many of these irregularities have  long existed and have done the country much harm. He said  emphatically Diex constitutes the first problem that must be  tackled. "That is what I am doing," he said categorically.  <H5>  Transculturation </H5>   In countries, such as Venezuela, weakened and troubled by  foreign debt, corruption, and disorganization, it is not enough  to invoke patriotic emblems and sing the national anthem when  referring to national sovereignty, but it is also necessary to  understand more profound aspects that affect sovereignty.    In this respect, Escovar said in addition to the  above-mentioned problems the country is threatened by the drug  problem, an unusual and highly dangerous one. Drugs and its  geopolitical ramifications have brought a new element to the  situation which, according to Escovar, has a nullifying effect  on society, its health and morals. Escovar warned that is the  scenario and those are the new actors.    Regarding transculturation, which seriously harms our  sovereignty, he said it reaches Venezuelans via satellite dishes  and the media.  <H5>  Political Reforms </H5>   Concerning reforms, he said the inclusion of the referendum  on impeachment must be one of the fundamental aspects to be  discussed during the discussion on constitutional reform,  scheduled to take place at Congress within the next few days.    "I do not think it is the only reform the country is  demanding, but in political matters the referendum on  impeachment is fundamental in making in-depth changes in  Venezuelan society," he said.    In this regard he said the country is anxious to  relegitimize  the system, which is "evidently losing legitimacy." At this  moment, he said, the discussion of constitutional reforms left  pending by the previous Congress is being accelerated. There is  a fundamental element, however, if we want to make a true  change, which is to incorporate citizens into the decisionmaking  process. This can only be achieved via a referendum.</p>

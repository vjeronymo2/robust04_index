			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Maastricht will not wait for UK, says Mitterrand: Ten nations determined to press ahead with 'construction of Europe' TEN OUT OF 12 European Community member states are determined to press ahead with implementing the Maastricht treaty on European union whether or not Denmark and Britain join them in ratifying the accord next year, President Francois Mitterrand of France said yesterday. In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Mitterrand insisted that the treaty would neither be renegotiated nor amended to secure Denmark's acceptance in a second referendum next year. He also claimed to have the support of a majority of other member states for this view. 'Rejection by the countries in question (Britain and Denmark) will not stop the construction of Europe . . . The old Europe of the Six plus Portugal and Spain find themselves completely on the same wavelength,' he said. Ireland and Greece have also ratified the treaty. 'We can't make an agreement minus a single currency, minus the central bank, minus a common foreign policy.' Mr Mitterrand said it would be legally possible to adapt the treaty - 'not in substance but in form' - to exclude Denmark in the event of another rejection by Danish voters. As for Britain, he added: 'I do not despair at all of seeing Great Britain adhere to the treaty that the head of its government signed.' While he refrained from comment on Britain's latest proposals for dealing with Danish objections to Maastricht, the French president's remarks signal a hardening of tone on this central question ahead of Friday's Edinburgh summit. They seem intended in part to increase the pressure on Mr John Major, the prime minister and current EC president, to speed up ratification of the treaty in parliament, rather than waiting for the outcome of another Danish vote in May or later. Such pressure, however, may complicate Mr Major's efforts to muster consensus at Edinburgh while struggling with his own backbench rebels, whom he has assured that he will delay completing ratification until after a second Danish vote. Mr Mitterrand, who is due to meet Mr Major tomorrow night before the summit begins, said it would not be 'catastrophic' if British ratification took another four months, but that Britain should not make its decision hinge on that of another country. Also in the interview, Mr Mitterrand: Expressed determination to resist pressure from his European partners over the recent EC-US deal on farm trade. He said he did not expect the issue to come up at Edinburgh, as negotiations on an overall settlement in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade were still continuing. He said France wanted a reopening of negotiations on agriculture with Washington. If there were no concessions on farm trade, however, he said France would have to act with 'great firmness' - while refusing to be drawn on whether it would use its veto. Reaffirmed his determination not to devalue the French franc, which has been under sporadic but heavy pressure in recent weeks. 'Devaluation has never been considered a good policy,' he said. 'France's economic indicators are the best at the moment within the EC.' Said he did not see the need to move the franc to a narrower band within the European monetary system, but that the idea was 'for discussion'. Renewed his backing for a 'European growth initiative' involving the acceleration of large EC infrastructure projects, and called again for a cut in German interest rates.

The management plan should be proactive, and establish a timetable for considering new vessel traffic regulations in the future.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  NOAA is working with the U.S. Coast Guard, which has the primary authority for vessel traffic regulation, to determine the need for additional measures to ensure protection of Sanctuary resources and qualities. In addition, NOAA will work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and the EPA regarding vessel traffic activities resulting from the transport of dredged material through the Sanctuary for disposal outside the Sanctuary. These consultations will aim to determine which resources are most at risk, which vessel traffic practices are most threatening, and which regulations or restrictions would be most appropriate to alleviate such risk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NOAA agrees that an improved vessel traffic monitoring and communication system along the coast is desirable. OPA 90 requires the Secretary of Transportation to complete a comprehensive study on the impact of installation, expansion, or improvement of vessel traffic servicing systems. NOAA will work with the State of Washington's OMS, the U.S. Coast Guard, and appropriate public agencies during the development of these monitoring studies to determine an appropriate system for the Sanctuary and the need for any additional site-specific protective measures.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vessel traffic monitoring and research and coordination on this subject have been incorporated into the Sanctuary management plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Allow only double-hulled vessels in the Sanctuary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  OPA 90 establishes double hull requirements for tank vessels. Most tank vessels over 5,000 gross tons will be required to have double hulls by 2010. Vessels under 5,000 gross tons will be required to have a double hull or a double containment system by 2015. All newly constructed tankers must have a double hull (or double containment system if under 5,000 gross tons), while existing vessels are phased out over a period of years.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As previously stated, the U.S. Coast Guard is completing a study of a tanker free zone where tank vessels would be required to remain offshore during coastal transits. Further, a proposal to establish an ATBA within the Sanctuary boundary has been developed and will be submitted to the International Maritime Organization (IMO) for approval at the earliest possible date which, in accordance with IMO's procedures, is June, 1994. Both actions will serve to ensure that hazardous material laden vessels will remain an appropriate distance offshore.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Require vessels to have a pilot aboard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Requirements for pilots are set forth in both Federal and state regulations. NOAA will monitor and review vessel traffic in the Sanctuary and make recommendations to the appropriate regulatory agencies, state and Federal, regarding the need for additional pilotage requirements. Pilotage is currently compulsory for all vessels except those under enrollment or engaged exclusively in the coasting trade on the West Coast of the continental United States (including Alaska) and/or British Columbia. Port Angeles has been designated as the pilotage station for all vessels enroute to or from the sea.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPA 90 requires the U.S. Coast Guard to designate U.S. waters where a second licensed officer must be on the bridge of a coastwise seagoing tanker over 1,600 gross tons. Under the Ports and Waterways Safety Act, the U.S. Coast Guard also is proposing to require a second officer on foreign flag tankers over 1,600 gross tons and on U.S. registered tankers over 1,600 gross tons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Establish a tonnage limit within three nautical miles of shore except for those making a port call.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  All types of vessels and traffic patterns will be reviewed by NOAA, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the State of Washington OMS to determine any appropriate action to be taken. In conducting this review, attention will be paid to vessel type, cargo carried, and vessel size.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

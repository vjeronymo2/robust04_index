			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Clandestine Indian Revolutionary </F> Committee-General Command, CCRI-CG, of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army, EZLN, in Mexico on 10 June]    [Text] Mexico, 10 June 1994    Reply to the peace agreements proposed by the supreme  government.    To the Mexican people, the peoples and governments of the  world, the national and international press, and brothers:    The Zapatist National Liberation Front's Clandestine Indian  Revolutionary Committee-General Command respectfully addresses  all of you to inform you of its evaluation and to reply to the  peace agreements proposed by the supreme government at the  negotiations table during the Meetings for Peace and  Reconciliation in Chiapas.    1. The EZLN, a militant Mexican organization comprised  primarily of Indians, rose up in arms against the supreme  government on 1 January 1994. The EZLN demands are summarized  in the 11 points outlined in the Lacandona Jungle Declaration:  work, land, housing, food, health, education, independence,  liberty, democracy, justice, and peace. Those demands are  supported by the majority of the Mexican people, and the EZLN is  struggling for those demands, for all Mexicans.    2. After bloody clashes between our troops and policemen and  soldiers of the Federal Army, a national and civilian movement  forced us to suspend the clashes and attempt to hold a dialogue  with the supreme government. Those talks were held in the city  of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas, in late February and  early March 1994.    3. On the occasion of the dialogue in San Cristobal, the  EZLN presented a list of demands containing 34 points that could  lead to peace with justice and dignity.    4. The list of 34 demands from the EZLN contains national  and state demands, some for the entire population and others for  peasants and Indians. The supreme government tried in vain to  minimize the importance of our just struggle by viewing it as a  conflict involving local Indian groups and even limiting it to  four municipalities in the southeastern Chiapas State.    5. Our national demands for all Mexicans include:    a) Free and democratic elections with equal rights and  obligations for all political forces.    b) In order to guarantee liberty and democracy, we  demand the resignation of the head of the Federal executive  branch as well as the illegitimate heads of the state  governments. Following the president of the Republic's  resignation, a transition government should be created, which  will organize free and democratic elections. We also demand  laws to guarantee the right of citizens and groups of citizens  without any political affiliation to participate in the  electoral process as a real and supreme authority.    c) We demand a new federal pact to put an end to  centralism and permit the autonomy of Indian communities and  municipalities.    d) We demand the revision of the free trade agreement  signed with Canada and the United States because it is not  consonant with Mexico's reality.    e) We demand dignified jobs and just salaries for all  rural and city workers; we also demand the enforcement of and  respect for the Federal Labor Law, for the benefit of all rural  and city workers.    f) We demand an end to the sacking of our national wealth.    g) We demand the cancellation of all debts acquired  through credits, loans, and taxes.    h) We demand solutions for the national problem of hunger  and malnutrition in the Mexican countryside and cities.    i) We demand the immediate and unconditional release of  all political prisoners and poor prisoners who are unjustly in  jail throughout the country.    6. The supreme government avoided giving a positive reply to  the national demands presented by the EZLN, which are supported  by wide sectors of the Mexican people.    Developments that followed the dialogue in San Cristobal  showed that the EZLN's demands for democracy were justified.  The cowardly assassination of Colosio, the imposition of  Zedillo as candidate of the PRI [Institutional Revolutionary  Party], and the newly acquired strength of government  hard-liners showed that the resignation of Mr. Salinas de  Gortari as chief executive on 1 January would have been the best  option for the country. His efforts to perpetuate his position  of power have created a permanent climate of insecurity and his  efforts to commit electoral fraud to continue usurping power,  through Zedillo, has placed the nation on the brink of a civil  war.    The electoral reform was obviously incomplete. The presence  of a flawed voters list leaves the door open to electoral fraud  and confirms the violation of the people's will. The  reinforcement of government apparatuses of repression and the  attempt to force the Federal Army to carry out police duties  shows us very clearly that the Salinist group is not seeking a  democratic transition, rather fraud and imposition.    The EZLN reaffirms what is reflected by reality: The supreme  government has no democratic inclination. The state party  system must be destroyed. The EZLN reaffirms the demands made  in points 1 and 2 of a document presented in San Cristobal:    1. Free and democratic elections.    2. Toppling the usurpers in the branches of the union and in  the states of the Federation.    The EZLN broadens its demands: There is a need for a  democratic transitional government and a new constituent  assembly to ensure, with laws and in practice, compliance with  the basic demands of the Mexican people: democracy, liberty, and  justice. These demands found a voice among the voiceless, a  face among the faceless, a future among the futureless, and a  life among the dead.    The bad government tried to limit the demand for autonomy to  the Indian communities and to leave intact the centralized  system of power, which gives the Federal executive branch a  dictatorial dimension. The government ignored the demand for  genuine autonomy for the municipalities.    The law proposed by the government to recognize the  political, economic, and cultural autonomy of Indian communities  is being handled according to normal procedures: The bill does  not present an in-depth solution and does not reflect a  consensus among Indian sectors or experts, and attempts are  being made to approve it in a hurry. Contravening its own offer  that the so-called "General Law of Indian Community Rights" will  be in response to "the demands, ideas, concerns, and political  consensus of the Indian communities" and that it will be  enriched by "a group of experts," the law simply complies with  the procedure of fulfilling the requirement of regulating  Article 4 of the Constitution, without consulting the interested  sectors.    To the demand of revising NAFTA, the government replied with  its stubbornness regarding continuing with an economic plan that  has only contributed to increasing poverty in our country and  deceiving foreign partners by promising them economic stability  and social peace. The government promised to conduct "a careful  evaluation of the impact of NAFTA." That evaluation has not  been made. The Mexican people, however, can help save the time  and money that will be spent by a commission "to evaluate the  impact." The impact of the free trade agreement may be observed  on the tables of any poor household in Mexico.    In reply to a national demand for dignified work and just  salaries, the government continues to implement an economic  policy that increases unemployment and underemployment and  decreases the purchasing power of workers. Union corruption  continues to be the foundation of the neoliberal economic  project.    The demand to end the looting of national wealth has been  ignored, and government action has been limited to the  ecological aspect. There is no national policy to defend the  country's natural wealth. The demand to pardon all debts  acquired by poor segments of the population has been met with  unfulfilled government promises to conduct a study, the result  of which will certainly be to postpone any solution to the  problem.    As in the previous examples, in response to a demand to end  hunger and malnutrition among our people, there have been  attempts to limit solutions to certain areas of Chiapas as if  hunger and malnutrition were only a problem of the Indians of  Los Altos and of the jungle area. As if the programs were food,  the government has responded with promises to implement child  nutrition programs.    In reply to our demand for the release of all political  prisoners and all the poor people unjustly detained in Mexican  jails, we have received promises of creating commissions to  study those cases. The unjust Mexican judicial system, which  only favors the powerful, will remain intact.    In sum, in no way did the federal government reply  satisfactorily to the just national demands presented by the  EZLN. Therefore, the EZLN rejects points 1, 2, 4, 7, 18, 20,  21, 22, and 23 of the peace agreement proposed by the government.    7. Some of the EZLN demands for peasants, which include all  Mexican peasants are:    a) Making Article 27 of the Constitution respect Emiliano  Zapata's original spirit: Land belongs to those who make it  produce.    b) Constructing hospitals and clinics for the countryside  in all rural areas, with doctors and medicine.    c) Just prices for farming products, the elimination of  mediators, and direct commercialization with peasants.    d) The Army and police should not act in rural  communities for the benefit of political bosses and landlords.    8. The supreme government has refused to reply  satisfactorily to national demands from peasants:    The government's refusal to abolish amendments to Article 27  of the Constitution promoted by President Salinas de Gortari and  to restore the right to land in the Constitution was repudiated  by broad peasant sectors throughout the country. Amendments to  Article 27 of the Constitution, which are the basis for  neoliberal policy in the Mexican countryside, must disappear.  The Political Constitution of the United Mexican States should  resume Emiliano Zapata's struggle.    The reply to the demands for hospitals, clinics, doctors,  and  medicine for the Mexican countryside is limited to offers for  the areas affected by the conflict. The right to health in the  Mexican countryside will continue to be neglected.    Demands for fair produce prices and for the elimination of  the middleman system have been met by the government with a  vote-buying office, Procampo, [Program of Direct Support to the  Countryside] whose efficiency is measured by its ability to  corrupt peasant leaders and commit their votes to the party of  the state. Promises of projects are the government's response to  a Mexican countryside that is just barely surviving.    Demands for the departure of policemen and Army troops from  rural areas have been met by the government with promises of  changes in the administration of justice, the increased presence  of troops and war materiel in conflict zones, and attempts to  force the Federal Army to fulfill police duties. The arrogance  of powerful cattlemen, who enjoy government economic support,  bothers common land peasants and Indians in general.    In sum, the just national peasant demands of the EZLN have  not received adequate responses from the federal government. It  has only promised partial and local solutions. Thus, the EZLN  rejects the peace agreement proposals in points 8, 9, 19, and 24.    9. Among the EZLN's national Indian demands are:    a) The right of the Indians to receive true and timely  information through an Indian radio station that is independent  of the government and led and managed by Indians.    b) Complete and free education for all Indian peoples.    c) Declaring the languages of all Indians official, and  making their teaching obligatory at all school levels.    d) Respect for the culture and tradition of Indian  peoples.    e) Eradicating discrimination and racism against Indians.    f) Cultural, political, and judicial autonomy for Indian  peoples.    g) Respect for the Indian people's right to liberty and  to a dignified life.    h) Economic and social support for Indian women.    10. The supreme government partially responded to the EZLN's  national Indian demands. Although the government promised an  independent Indian radio station, its response to the education  issue has been limited to the selective scholarship method that  deprives many Indians of their right to education at all levels.  The rest of the government's responses to these points are  limited to promises to carry out studies and programs in time  periods that, in most cases, already expired.    In sum, the partial government responses to our national  Indian demands and its failure to comply with previous  commitments lead us to reject the peace agreement proposals in  points 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 27, and 29.    11. Among the EZLN's demands at the state level are:    a) Holding general elections in Chiapas and legal  recognition of all political forces in the state.    b) Installing electricity in the Chiapas countryside and  a percentage of petroleum revenues.    c) Compensating war victims.    d) Repealing provisions in the Penal Code of the State of  Chiapas that restrict the political struggle.    e) Halting expulsions and promoting the free and  voluntary return of those expelled from their lands of origin  and compensation for damage inflicted.    f) Holding political trials for Messrs. Patrocinio  Gonzalez Garrido, Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, and Elmar  Setzer M.    12. The supreme government unsatisfactorily answered the  state demands of the EZLN:    The electoral reform in Chiapas does not allow groups to  organize themselves to participate in elections, the demands for  the electrification of the Chiapas countryside are answered with  programs and promises, expulsions continue and those responsible  are not punished, and there are only promises of economic  support for the Indians in the state. When the support is  finally given, it is in exchange for votes. The political trial  of the three former governors, who forced us to rise up in arms,  is omitted.    In sum, the unsatisfactory answers and our lack of  confidence  in the real fulfillment of government promises lead us to reject  the government peace agreement proposals in points 5, 6, 25, 27,  28, 29, and 30.    13. Finally, the EZLN demanded that the government recognize  it as a militant force. The Mexican people, through the various  organizations, have already granted us that recognition.    To our demand for recognition as a militant force and to the  recognition of our troops as authentic fighters, the supreme  government responded by offering guarantees of worthy and  respectful treatment of the members of the EZLN and offering  legal status for the EZLN.    The bad government cannot offer full security guarantees to  its components, nor can we expect it to give worthy and  respectful treatment to those who, interpreting the legitimate  goals of democracy, freedom, and justice for the Mexican people,  rose up in arms in a just struggle.    The EZLN was created as an army to demand respect for the  people's will. This respect continues to be denied, and the  people's will is disregarded by the usurping government. The  reasons that led to the birth of the EZLN prevail; the EZLN will  remain up in arms until the demands for democracy, freedom, and  justice for all are met.    The EZLN agreed to observe international treaties regulating  combat in war.... the EZLN has observed such treaties. We will  continue to do it. The EZLN reiterates its demand to be  recognized as a militant force and demands the recognition of  its troops as authentic fighters. To achieve this, the EZLN  will resort to the various international forums to demand this  recognition from the peoples and governments of the world.    The recognition of the EZLN as a militant force is necessary  so that the dialogue process can have firm bases for development.    14. The supreme government, in the dialogue in San  Cristobal, presented its peace agreement proposal. The EZLN  answered by explaining that it had to consult its members  because the people who created us were the ones who ordered us  into war and only they can give us the order for peace.  Following multiple setbacks, the consultations ended; this is  our reply to the government's proposals.    15. For all the above and based on the free and democratic  voting of its members, the EZLN answers NO to the peace  agreement proposal of the supreme government. It is terminating  the San Cristobal dialogue; it reiterates its willingness to  continue searching for a political solution that can lead to a  peace with dignity and justice, and it calls all progressive and  independent groups to a national dialogue of peace with  democracy, freedom, and justice. We will not surrender!  Democracy! Freedom! Justice!    Respectfully:    From the mountains of southeastern Mexico.    The EZLN's CCRI-CG.    Mexico, June 1994</p>

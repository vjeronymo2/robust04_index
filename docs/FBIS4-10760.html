			<p>BFN     [Text] La Paz -- As the "narco-links" case [involving  alleged links between former President Jaime Paz Zamora and his  party, the Movement of the Revolutionary Left, MIR, with drug  trafficking] gains impetus, fear grows within government and  political circles that the U.S. Court may issue a "massive  request for extradition of Bolivian citizens who perpetrated  attacks and/or crimes within U.S. territory, according to  official sources. [no closing quotation marks as published]    According to Interior Under Secretary Hugo San Martin,  "there  is an extradition procedure that has probably been considered  for the `Rico Toro case' and will probably be used for other  people."    Some legislators fear that as a result of the developments  following the charges and statements by drug trafficker Carmelo  Dominguez Vaca and the report on the FELCN [Special  Antinarcotics Force] operations, the United States may request  the extradition of "many Bolivian citizens involved in drug  trafficking such as General Felipe Carvajal Badani, retired, the  former National Police chief."    Referring to the former police chief, the FELCN report  states: "In October 1989 (Jaime) Paz Zamora swore in Felipe  Carvajal as the National Police commander. Carvajal, a MIR  activist well known for being corrupt, has a strong relationship  with Capobianco. Carvajal resigned on 12 March 1991 charging  that the U.S. Embassy was pressuring him."    When Hugo San Martin was asked on Thursday, 31 March, if he  knew of an alleged U.S. request to the Bolivian Foreign Ministry  for the extradition of Gen. Felipe Carvajal he answered: "We  have nothing official."    Diplomatic sources explained that despite the lack of an  extradition treaty between Bolivia and the United States that  explicitly refers to trafficking, the latter "has every right to  seek the extradition of any Bolivian citizens it believes are  involved in trafficking in U.S. territory."    As an example they mentioned that in the past few years the  number of U.S. requests for extradition for this reason amounted  to about two dozen. Of these requests, however, the Supreme  Court only approved the "case of Chunty Roca Suarez," who was  sentenced by the civil court to 15 years imprisonment.    On 23 March the U.S. Embassy officially asked the Bolivian  Foreign Ministry to extradite former Army Colonel Faustino Rico  Toro for violating the Miami federal antinarcotics law.    The Foreign Ministry submitted the request for extradition  to  the Supreme Court of Justice which, in turn, submitted it to the  Attorney General's office. Attorney General Angel Baldivieso  has ordered Rico Toro's preventive imprisonment while legal  procedures are completed.    Meanwhile, Government Minister German Quiroga Gomez  disclosed  that Faustino Rico Toro, who is believed to have shipped cocaine  from Bolivia to the United States, will continue incommunicado  in the FELCN prison in La Paz.</p>

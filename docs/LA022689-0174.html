			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SLOW-GROWTH RULINGS A BLESSING IN DISGUISE  </P> <P> For the second time in recent months, an Orange County Superior Court judge has  set aside a slow-growth initiative because it failed to pass legal muster.  </P> <P> This time Judge William F. McDonald ruled last Tuesday that the slow-growth  Measure X, which was narrowly approved by voters in San Juan Capistrano last  November, is unconstitutional. The court noted that the measure placed an  unfair burden on builders by requiring them not only to solve traffic, public  works and safety problems that their new developments might create, but to also  correct existing problems that were caused by someone else.  </P> <P> Last October, Superior Court Judge John C. Woolley made the same ruling in a  similar case challenging an initiative approved by San Clemente voters last  June.  </P> <P> Many observers believe that it is just a matter of time before a similar  growth-control measure passed by Costa Mesa voters last November is taken to  court.  </P> <P> The legal setbacks are not surprising. In addition to taking an inequitable  approach that would burden developers with problems not of their own making,  initiatives like the countywide Measure A rejected by voters last June were  confusing, poorly draw documents that would have created as many problems as  they sought to solve.  </P> <P> One positive aspect of the legal rulings is that after two defeats in the  courts, leaders of the slow-growth initiative drives finally seem ready to take  a different tack. They are now talking of shifting efforts and possibly  mounting legal challenges to specific projects, as they did earlier this month  in defeating the Cypress Downs development on the Los Alamitos Race Course  grounds and the Home Ranch project in Costa Mesa last November.  </P> <P> Zeroing in on particular developments that local residents consider to be  environmentally undesirable is an approach much to be preferred over shotgun  attacks on all development. Aside from the constitutional problems involved,  the initiative process is too inflexible, costly and time-consuming to use to  control land-use.  </P> <P> For example, using the initiative would lock local officials into the language  initially approved by voters. Any subsequent changes needed to make the  initiative or a development plan workable would then require putting the issue  back on the ballot for another election.  </P> <P> Growth and development must be properly planned. Developers must be held  accountable to the community and to residents who are frustrated by increased  traffic congestion and other environmental losses that irresponsible growth  produces. That accountability frequently takes the shape these days of  developer agreements that require builders to offset the overload on public  works that their projects cause. Such guarantees must be part of any project  approval.  </P> <P> But it should be understood that developers do not pick up the entire bill. The  cost for those public works is passed on to new home buyers. The added fees  only further inflate housing costs, forcing more people working here to live  elsewhere, adding to the already crucial traffic problem. It is a vicious cycle  that no one city can adequately resolve. That is why the court rejections of  ill-conceived slow-growth initiatives are a blessing in disguise. Maybe now  local officials, supported by residents and slow-growth advocates, will begin  taking a regional approach to the problems.  </P></p>

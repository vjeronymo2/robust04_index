			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Strong support for cask beers bolsters Greene King GREENE KING's strong advertising and promotional support for its cask beers helped increase trading profits from Pounds 25.3m to Pounds 26.8m in the year to May 2 on increased sales of Pounds 133.6m, compared with Pounds 128.6m. However, after losses on property disposals, against profits, and a higher interest charge the pre-tax profit fell slightly from Pounds 20.3m to Pounds 20.1m. Mr Simon Redman, chairman, said the trading performance for brewers in the south- east of England remained very difficult. He believed brands, such as Greene King IPA and Abbot Ale, should perform better as more buoyant conditions return. Free trade business accounted for 55 per cent of volume sales. Bad debts rose from Pounds 1.8m to Pounds 2.1m, which Mr Redman said reflected the continuing difficulties of the recession. A breakdown of trading profits showed wholesaling contributed Pounds 23.2m (Pounds 22.8m), retailing Pounds 8.75m (Pounds 8.18m), production and distribution Pounds 2.8m (Pounds 1.98m) and wine merchants Pounds 682,000 (Pounds 967,000). Central costs were little changed at Pounds 8.57m (Pounds 8.63m). Mr Redman said he expected Butterfly Hotels, in which the brewer has a 35 per cent interest, to break even for the present year after reporting a loss in the year underreview. Earnings per share fell from 36.1p to 35.4p. The proposed final dividend however, is raised to 8.6p (8.1p) making a total payment for the year of 12.3p (11.6p). COMMENT It is not impossible to take over a brewer but there is a price to be paid. It is unlikely to be one that Mr Redman is willing to pay. Notwithstanding the fall in interest rates, reducing the carrying cost of its holding in Morland, Greene King would do well to sell its stake. This would enable it to concentrate on expanding the group organically. Mr Redman has already hinted as much, although he insists that all options remain open. Abbott and IPA are strong brands, which should perform better over the next year given their strong advertising and promotional support. With forecast pre-tax profits for the year of Pounds 22m, the shares are on a prospective multiple of 13.6, which is just ahead of the market sector's average.</p>

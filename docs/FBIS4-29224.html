			<p>BFN     [Text] Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam  arranged a reception for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter and  his entourage on a visit to our country at the Moknan House last  night. Vice Foreign Minister Song Ho-kyong and others officials  concerned attended the reception.    Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam delivered a speech at the  reception. He said he would like to believe that Mr. Carter's  unusual current visit to our country would mark a good sign in  gradually turning the distrust and hostility lasting between the  two countries into relations of friendship, amity, and mutual  respect [chimi kato sonsaengui pomsangchi anun ibon urinara  pangmuni tunara saie chisoktoegoinnun pulsingwa choktaegamul  sollingwa uho hosang chonjunguro chomcha pakkuo nagalsu innun  choun chingjorago mitkkosiptta].    He said that it is the current trend of international  relations to advance toward reconciliation, friendship, and  cooperation after the Cold War ended, and that it is also the  common desire of the peoples of the two countries to establish  normal relations [chongsangjogin kwangyerul maennun kosun]  between the DPRK and the United States by ending [chongsan]  hostile relations between them.    He said: If the United States respects our country's  sovereignty and treats it as an equal partner by discarding the  concept of confrontation with us, the pending issues between the  DPRK and the United States, including the nuclear issue, will be  resolved satisfactorily and the two countries can live on good  terms with each other. He believes that this will immediately  contribute to peace in Asia and the rest of the world.    He said that Jimmy Carter, crossing through Panmunjom, would  have directly witnessed the tragic division of the Korean  peninsula, as well as felt the pain of the Korean people -- the  same nation with the same blood, who has suffered for nearly 50  years because of its artificial division on the single territory  and added: Our people ardently desire reunification and hope for  a true peace.    Also, he said: I believe that you will be able to deliver  our  people's resolute desire for peace and our Republic's  peace-loving position to the people of the United States and to  the social circles throughout the world the way they really are  [kunun ttohan tangsinduri uriinminui kyongyolhan tongil  yolmanggwa uri konghwagukui pyonghwa aehojokin ipchangul  migugindulka segye sahoegyee sasil kutaero chondal harirago  minnundago malhaessupnida].    He said: I think that Jimmy Carter's visit, made at his own  initiative, and that of his entourage would lead to a thaw in  the frozen relations between the two countries and to creating a  peaceful environment. He stated: I hope that I can meet various  U.S. politicians, including Mr. Carter, to openheartedly  exchange views in the future as well.    Then, Jimmy Carter delivered a speech. He said that he is  very pleased to come to the DPRK after anticipating it for three  years. He said: The time has come to establish overall  relations, including full friendship, understanding, trade, and  exchange of visits, between the two countries. [tunaraga  wanjonhan chinsongwa ihae muyok insa kyoryurul pirotan  chonmyonjogin kwangyerul surip halttaega toettago hamyonso] The  United States is ready to render its due cooperation to the DPRK  to achieve this goal [i mokchogul sirhyonhame issoso ungdang  chosonminjujuui inmin konghwagukkwa hyopchohal chunbiga toeo  ittago malhaessumnida].    He pointed out that it is the nuclear issue that has created  a big misunderstanding between North Korea and the United States  at present, and that if the nuclear issue is resolved clearly  and the misunderstanding is removed, progress can be made in  solving other problems.    He pointed out that he could not but feel sadness when he  saw  the division of Korea, crossing over the Demilitarized Zone  today, and that the U.S. leaders believe that Korea should be  reunified peacefully without fail, [migugui chodojadurun chosoni  pandusi pyonghwajoguro tongil toeoya handago mitkko issumyo] and  that he also believes that it can be done.    He said: Despite the differences in opinions between the two  countries, those problems can be easily solved when the two  countries make efforts together to achieve their common goals.  These problems can be solved by direct talks between the two  countries and their mutual understanding can be promoted as well  [iwagwaun munjewa kwanryonhayo chijop hoedamul tonghayo  hosangihaerul chungjin sikil su iddago malhaetta].    Participants in the reception proposed a toast for the  friendship, peace of the people of the two countries, for the  long life and good health of the great leader Comrade Kim  Il-song and of the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il and for the  good health of Mr. Jimmy Carter.    Pyongyang artists performed at the reception.</p>

			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Observer: Wry bread for Danes Now it seems increasingly likely that the unwell Manfred Worner, Nato's 59-year-old secretary general, will soon retire - he is not chairing a meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Istanbul next week - the hounds are already sniffing at the gate. But although he has all the right credentials, one hopeful is facing disappointment. Denmark's Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, leader of the Danish Liberal party, has already had his card marked by none other than a fellow Dane, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the Social Democratic party and head of the present government. Ellemann-Jensen is the one Danish politician who easily strides across the international arena. Foreign minister between September 1982 and January 1993, he is revered in many east European countries for having stuck his neck out in support of their anti-communist independence drives. But at home Ellemann-Jensen's habit of sharp-tongued straight- talking has earned him powerful enemies. Rasmussen has let it be known - via that trusted method, the media - that his government will not support Ellemann-Jensen, should he want the job. Still, Ellemann-Jensen will only be available if he is still in opposition after this autumn's general election to the Folketing. And no one is ready to place bets on Rasmussen's being around by Christmas.</p>

			<p>Article   Type:CSO     [Editorial Report] Commentaries and editorials in several  Italian dailies have discussed the merit of the various  coalitions running in the parliamentary elections, which will be  held on 27-28 March. Press views have ranged across the  political spectrum, but most dailies have been critical of the  decision by television magnate Silvio Berlusconi to enter the  race with a new party, Forza Italia.  <H5>  CORRIERE DELLA SERA Opts for Center </H5>   In a 30 January front-page editorial in the Milan daily  CORRIERE DELLA SERA, editor in chief Paolo Mieli supported  centrist forces in the election against "those who...preach the  need to break up the center and the formation of two opposing  blocs" on the right and the left. Mieli wrote that what is  needed now is for the parties to express "clear policy lines,"  especially toward the economy and institutional reform. The  voters expect the centrists, especially the Italian Popular  Party (PPI), to explain clearly whether they will go into  opposition or try to form a government coalition should they--as  is more than likely--not receive a majority of seats in the  election. The moderate wing of the left, particularly the  Democratic Alliance and some factions of the Democratic Party of  the Left (PDS), should also clearly state whether it will  include the PPI in any government it would form after an  election victory, Mieli continued. The government options  offered to the electorate should be transparent, and those  parties which have formed alliances for the elections should  remain together after the election and agree on a choice for  prime minister, Mieli concluded.    Writer, journalist, and television commentator Arrigo Levi's  commentary in the 29 January CORRIERE DELLA SERA rejects the  polarization of the political spectrum into left and right  blocs. The many politicians and commentators who advocate such  a division claim that it is the best way to prevent the  government from falling into the hands of communists,  reactionaries, or separatists, Levi wrote. However, a two-bloc  election would not provide a political home for the many voters  of the center who want change but also wish to preserve what was  good about the old system. According to Levi, such voters would  be forced to support "unacceptable" partners in both  blocs--ex-fascists, neocommunists, opportunists such as Forza  Italia, dogmatists such as the Rete, or groups with "obscure  intentions" for Italy such as the Northern League. After the  elections, Levi predicted, both blocs will lose their cohesion  because of the incompatibility of the component groups. The  effectiveness of the new government will, consequently, be  impaired. Levi asks why a center bloc, small but politically  homogeneous, should not participate in the race. In an election  that Levi views as part of a larger political transition, some  "moderate and progressive" parties would do better to run on  their own rather than as part of heterogeneous coalitions.    Regular CORRIERE DELLA SERA commentator Angelo Panebianco  noted in the 27 January edition that Silvio Berlusconi's entry  into the political arena was a gift for the leftist coalition  because Berlusconi provides the left with a "boogey man" to  attack during the electoral campaign. In addition, Berlusconi's  entry fragments the liberal-moderate forces, including the PPI,  already weakened by the refusal of Northern League leader  Umberto Bossi to join forces with it. Finally, the entry into  politics of television magnate Berlusconi has rallied the  journalists of the state-owned RAI television networks behind  the PDS, causing intense controversy over public television's  political objectivity.    Commentator Ernesto Galli Della Loggia observed that  Berlusconi's decision to enter politics to defend the moderate  forces is an indication of the confusion reigning among those  who identify with those forces. Berlusconi "thinks he is the  doctor when in fact he is the disease," Galli Della Loggia wrote  in CORRIERE DELLA SERA of 26 January.  <H5>  LA REPUBBLICA Favors Left </H5>   Alberto Cavallari, former editor for CORRIERE DELLA SERA and  currently a regular contributor to the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA,  has suggested that he saw "nostalgia" developing among  conservative parties "for 1948 "--a time when the left was  attacked by the right to prevent a change in the government. In  the 3 February LA REPUBBLICA, Cavallari characterized the  current political situation as the formation of a "cartel" by  eight leftist parties followed by the formation of an opposing  coaltion by eight rightist parties in response. If the center's  objective is the same as that of the right--that is, to destroy  the left--then the center, Cavallari maintained, inevitably  becomes a part of the right. In fact, what unites the eight  rightist parties is a 1948-style anticommunism. These parties  act as if nothing changed in 1989 and as if the Italian left is  a variant of Soviet communism. Cavallari asked rhetorically  whether it would not be better to "utilize" the crisis created  by the decline of the Socialist and Christian Democratic  parties, and of international communism, to try a system that  allows for alternating governments, instead of returning to the  old center-right, center-left alliances which have governed  Italy since 1947.    In a 27 January LA REPUBBLICA commentary, Ermanno Gorrieri,  former Christian Democrat and currently an official of the newly  founded leftist Social Christian movement (part of the  Progressive Alliance headed by the PDS) thanked Northern League  leader Umberto Bossi for the latter's rejection of an electoral  pact with the PPI. Had the PPI joined the center-right  coalition, the drift to the right of many PPI members would have  been "a disaster," Gorrieri maintained. He characterized the  PPI's intention to form a centrist coalition in opposition to  both the right and the left as "worrisome." This decision,  intended to safeguard the Catholic presence in politics, in fact  weakens the center. Under the new electoral system, parties  will be forced to form alliances to survive, Gorrieri wrote.  The PPI's insistence on running alone condemns it to a smaller  representation in Parliament. While many believe that the PPI  needs to be in the opposition for a while, Gorrieri asks whether  lay Catholics should give up their responsibility to help face  the upcoming challenges. That is why the Social Christian  movement was created: to organize left-leaning Catholics within  the Progressive Alliance. Gorrieri concludes by claiming the  Social Christians have gathered significant numbers of PPI  members who do not support PPI chairman Mino Martinazzoli or  former Christian Democrat Mario Segni.    In a 24 January front-page editorial criticizing  Berlusconi's  entry into politics, LA REPUBBLICA editor in chief Eugenio  Scalfari also criticizes Segni for trying to bridge the  ideological distance between his Pact for Italy and the PPI on  the one hand, and the Northern League and Forza Italia on the  other. Segni did not understand that the ideologies of the two  groups are too far apart, Scalfari wrote. He is still trying to  align the Pact not only with the League and Forza Italia, but  also with the National Alliance. According to Scalfari, the  latter three parties are planning for a League election victory  in the North and a National Alliance victory in the South, with  Forza Italia as the "glue" holding the group together. Scalfari  warns that this is a strong alliance with the means to  manipulate public opinion.  <H5>  LA STAMPA Critical of PDS </H5>   Editor in chief Ezio Mauro asked for "clarity" from the  leftist Progressive Alliance in a 2 February editorial in the  Turin LA STAMPA. Commenting on the formation of the Alliance  the previous day, Mauro wrote that in Italy it is easier to call  oneself progressive than conservative and the leftist alliance's  choice of the word "progressive" allows for a broader and less  exacting definition than the concept of "the left." The word  "progressive" makes no distinctions within the alliance and can  also appeal to voters from the center. It is a label that  avoids having to account for the past actions of socialism and  communism, Mauro wrote. Italy needs a left, but only a European,  western, and noncommunist left, Mauro argued. Thus it is  important that the left explain which of the old policies it is  willing to give up and which it is continuing to promote.  However, it has instead refused to identify with its history  because that would limit the number of potential electoral  allies. This failure by the left to address its history has  allowed Berlusconi to tag it as "communist," Mauro maintained.  The various groups within the Progressive Alliance should  confront each other, knowing that there will be  disagreement--and the PDS, as the leading party in the Alliance,  should decide in which direction it is heading and who the  Alliance candidates for prime minister and other government  posts will be if it wins the elections, Mauro advised.    University professor Gianni Vattimo, in a 30 January LA  STAMPA commentary, criticized the PDS's belief that after the  elections it can form a governing coalition with the PPI. Such  an arrangement would destroy any hope of a radical renewal of  the Italian political system, Vattimo wrote, and would be  nothing more than a return to the old corrupt political schemes.  Vattimo wrote that the PDS's two leaders, Achille Occhetto and  Massimo D'Alema, pretend not to understand that the PPI's  Martinazzoli is saying very clearly he does not want to ally  with them. While the PDS promises a postelection  "governability" derived from an alliance with the PPI, it is  going ahead with plans to form an election alliance with  Communist Renewal and the Rete--parties which, Vattimo wrote,  are to function as election allies but are supposed to disappear  when the time comes to form the PDS-PPI government coalition.  Citizen enthusiasm in Italy's "Second Republic" will wane if  the left and Martinazzoli's center lose their separate  identities, Vattimo concluded.  <H5>  IL MESSAGERO Favors PPI Running Alone </H5>   Giulio Anselmi predicted that despite all forecasts to the  contrary, Italy will not be able to adapt to a bipolar political  system. Anselmi, editor in chief of the Rome daily IL  MESSAGGERO, maintained in a 30 January commentary that the PPI  has emerged as the third bloc in Italian politics. Berlusconi,  who is using his influence to bring the League and the National  Alliance together, is opposing the PPI, and Anselmi wonders  which of the two groups will fight the PDS for control of the  country. Berlusconi says he is the only true anticommunist in  the race, because after the elections Martinazzoli will offer  his support to the probable leftist winner, Anselmi wrote.  However, by refusing to present himself as "anti-anything" and  clearly distinguishing himself from the National Alliance, the  League, and the PDS, Martinazzoli is the only candidate to have  retained some credibility, according to Anselmi. Martinazzoli  has the support of the pope and the Church in their call for  Catholics to remain united, preferably in one party. Amselmi  wrote that Martinazzoli deserves credit for having resisted the  temptation to transform the PPI into something totally different  from the old Christian Democratic Party (DC) and for having  weathered the breaking away of the party's right wing. His PPI  offers the moderate voter a choice other than the left or the  right.    In comparing the rightist and leftist coalitions,  commentator  Angelo Bolaffi noted that League chief Bossi's plan to pose as  the only true anti-PDS force has been spoiled by the similar  line taken by the National Alliance and Forza Italia. The  bickering that took place among the leftist coalition partners  for the placement of candidates is being duplicated in the  rightist coalition, but the discord on the right is worse  because of the great divergence in the political ideologies of  the League and the National Alliance. Efforts at forming a  coalition could backfire, forcing League and National Alliance  voters against each other to the benefit of Berlusconi, who  would once again show his exceptional business ability in  "speculating" with the votes of others, Bolaffi concluded (LA  STAMPA 1 February).  <H5>  IL SOLE--24 ORE Defends Berlusconi </H5>   The Milan financial daily IL SOLE--24 ORE was the only  monitored newspaper to defend Berlusconi's decision to enter  politics. An unsigned editorial on 29 January states that while  the benefits of having a media millionaire like Berlusconi enter  politics is debatable, Berlusconi's person and program should  not be "criminalized." Berlusconi's opponents, the editorial  continues, should remember that just a few years ago the League  was ridiculed in much of the press for the crudeness of its  language and leader. After the last elections, however, it  became clear how deeply entrenched the League was in society.  Berlusconi is introducing a liberal culture which has never  taken hold in Italian politics, the editorial maintained.  Although the League has also been expounding liberalism, it has  been accepted only in the North. Segni's waverings and the  distancing of many Catholics from his policies is leading many  voters to see Berlusconi as someone who can open a debate on  issues of interest to people both in the North and the South,  such as lowering taxes, easing fiscal regulations, improving the  administrative system, and safeguarding public security. Other  parties, especially the leftist parties, should express clear  opinions on these issues, the editorial concludes.</p>

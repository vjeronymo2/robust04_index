			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / International Company News: French group advances LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the newly-formed French water distribution and construction combine, reported increased turnover and profits for 1990, writes William Dawkins. The group turned in net profits of FFr1.42bn (Dollars 230m) last year, slightly below the FFr1.48bn forecast by the Lyonnaise des Eaux water distribution group and the Dumez construction company at the time of their merger in July. The result is a 12.8 per cent increase on the combined earnings in the previous year, on a 13.4 per cent increase in pro-forma turnover to FFr72bn. Earnings per share rose 17.6 per cent to FFr31.6. Mr Guy de Panafieu, group administrator and managing director, forecast that turnover would rise by between 5 and 10 per cent this year. The former Lyonnaise des Eaux contributed FFr896m to net profits. Lex, Page 22</p>

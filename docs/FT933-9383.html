			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow at record high after budget victory Wall Street US SHARE prices surged to record highs yesterday after bond yields dropped sharply in reaction to President Clinton's budget victory, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 15.65 at 3,576.08, above its previous record close of 3,567.42 but below its highs for the day. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.03 at 450.71, while the Amex composite finished 2.46 higher at 438.80, and the Nasdaq composite up 0.41 at 718.49, a new all-time high. Trading volume on the NYSE was 232m shares. Prices opened firmer, but did not post strong gains until mid-morning when the bond market's latest rally took hold. Bond prices rose sharply, and sent the yield on the benchmark 30-year issue below 6.5 per cent for the first time, as fixed-income investors applauded the Senate's approval last Friday of President Clinton's deficit-reduction package. The bond rally surprised dealers and investors, who did not expect much reaction to the Senate vote because approval of the budget had already been priced into Treasuries. The big drop in yields, however, was welcomed by the stock markets, and with computerised program buying adding to the upward momentum, prices raced to new highs just before midday. Among individual stocks, interest rate-sensitive issues in the financials sector fared well, with brokerage companies leading the way. Salomon climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 44 5/8 , Merrill Lynch added Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 89 1/4 , Primerica rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 56 5/8 , Morgan Stanley firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 73 1/8 and Bear Stearns put on Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 24 3/8 . Motor company stocks were in demand. The sector has been in favour recently following strong quarterly earnings reports, but last Friday it ran into profit-taking, suffering heavy losses. Yesterday, the sector rallied, with General Motors adding Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 49, Ford putting on Dollars 5/8 at Dollars 52 1/4 and Chrysler climbing Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 43 1/4 . Selected drug stocks weakened following downgrades from the investment bank, Lehman Brothers. Schering-Plough fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 59 3/8 , Johnson &amp; Johnson dropped Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 36 7/8 and Bristol-Myers Squibb gave up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 51 5/8 . Eastman Kodak continued to rally in the wake of last week's ousting of its chairman, Mr Kay Whitmore, rising another Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 59 7/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 28 1/4 after the National Security Agency suspended a Dollars 200m workstation contract with the company after competitors said that the machine's performance was misrepresented. Canada TORONTO closed higher, led by recovering gold stocks. The composite index rose 42.24 to close at 4,002.20 in turnover of CDollars 510.3m. Advances led declines by 390 to 292. Volume was 42.8m shares. The gold sub-index rose 4.5 per cent as the gold price rebounded from last week's fall. Ten of the other 13 sub-indexes also closed higher. Among gold stocks, Franco-Nevada soared CDollars 3 5/8 to CDollars 71 5/8 , American Barrick jumped CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 33 1/8 , and Placer Dome gained CDollars 1 to CDollars 26 3/8 .</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAR CROWD MELEE LEAVES 2 WOUNDED IN PASADENA  </P> <P> In the midst of an altercation by patrons leaving Romeo's, a popular Pasadena  club in the heart of Old Pasadena, a California Highway Patrol officer  accidentally shot a police officer and a bouncer early Friday, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Seven people were arrested, five women and two men, on charges that included  interfering with a police officer, assault with a deadly weapon and public  intoxication.  </P> <P> Police and witnesses were at a loss to explain the melee, involving at least 20  patrons of the club.  </P> <P> "They were all drunk, screaming back and forth," said bouncer Mark Underwood,  whose co-worker, Devin Beasley, took a shotgun pellet in the side of his knee.  "Who knows what it was about?"  </P> <P> Underwood said the shotgun had discharged after the CHP officer had used the  weapon as a cudgel on a man officers were trying to subdue. "I saw (the  officer) had his finger on the trigger, so I started moving," Underwood said.  "I got behind a Blazer that was parked there. My friend didn't quite make it."  </P> <P> The CHP would not comment on specifics of the shooting, saying that it was  under investigation by the department's shooting team.  </P> <P> The wounded Pasadena police officer was in stable condition, and the bouncer  was treated and released.  </P> <P> Merchants and workers in Old Pasadena, a colorfully remodeled district of  restaurants, bars and clothing stores which developers sometimes tout as  "Westwood East," said that the incident reveals a persistent underside to the  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Despite the transformation of the Old Town, which was a Skid Row 10 years ago,  "you can go a block in either direction and still get mugged," said Vincent  Terzo, co-owner of a neighborhood bar on Colorado Boulevard next door to  Romeo's.  </P> <P> He and his sister, Jennine, said that the alley behind their bar, The  Thirty-Fiver, was a frequent site for fistfights between departing patrons of  Romeo's, a basement dance club with marble columns and neon strip lights.  </P> <P> "I almost got hit myself recently," said Jennine Terzo. "Someone was taking a  swing at somebody and they just missed me."  </P> <P> Ivan Sasaki, who works in a surfing shop on Fair Oaks Boulevard, said he  avoided the alley. "A lot of things happen back there, a lot of fights," he  said.  </P> <P> According to Pasadena police, the fight began in the alley and spread to an  adjoining parking structure, where somebody fired a shot. Police subsequently  retrieved a .357 Magnum with one spent round, said Lt. Greg Henderson.  </P> <P> Pasadena police arrived at the scene shortly after a passer-by had hailed a  Highway Patrol radio car. Officers from both departments tried to break up the  disturbance, Henderson said.  </P> <P> CHP Sgt. Mike Brey said matters escalated when a man in the alley became "loud  and boisterous," forcing officers to try to subdue him. The shotgun discharged  during the scuffle, he said.  </P> <P> The CHP would not identify the officer holding the shotgun. "We have to give  the officer a chance to notify his family in the area of what happened," said  Brey.  </P> <P> Underwood said the unruly man was resisting arrest. "They were trying to get  the guy down, but he didn't want to be handcuffed," Underwood said. "The CHP  guy first hit him in the head with the butt of the shotgun, then he started  swinging it with his finger on the trigger. It was very stupid."  </P></p>

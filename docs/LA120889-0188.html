			<p><P> December 8, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BEARS OWNER GROWLS FOR STADIUM  </P> <P> Chicago Bears owner Michael McCaskey says Mayor Richard M. Daley needs to make  some moves on a new stadium and "get over the myth that it's impossible for the  Bears to leave Chicago."  </P> <P> McCaskey said Thursday that he is "out of time, out of rope and out of  patience" in his efforts for a new tax-supported football stadium to replace  Soldier Field along the city's lakefront.  </P> <P> The team is under contract to play at Soldier Field until 1999, but McCaskey  said the stadium is an "aging, decrepit structure whose useful life is nearly  at an end."  </P> <P> McCaskey said Republican Gov. James R. Thompson has been "very supportive" of a  new stadium, but said Daley, a Democrat, is "hoping the problem will somehow go  away."  </P></p>

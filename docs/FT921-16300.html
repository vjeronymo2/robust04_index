			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Perspectives: A head above the parapet - The gospel according to William McCrea 'In country, town or city, wherever man is found folk spend their time a grumbling at everything around,'  - from 'The Grumblers' recorded by the Rev William McCrea in Nashville, Tennessee, 1986. WHEN the Rev William McCrea, Democratic Unionist MP for mid-Ulster, started to cry during our interview, the troubles, tragedy, hopelessness, despair - call it what you will - of Northern Ireland, stood as drearily as the province's weeping mountain scenery on a winter morning. Here was a true fanatic - the most popular gospel singer in the province, a simple-minded father of five from a tucked-away Ulster farming town, a Presbyterian fundamentalist, a deeply-emotional politician - who was prepared to carry the heavy burden of a community's collective grief. If you want a view on the IRA, the locals say, speak to McCrea. He will put his head above the parapet. His small family house is surrounded by security technology. He has police protection. Three cousins have been murdered by terrorists. When we spoke he had just returned from the funeral of a policeman, murdered by the IRA, who had once been his bodyguard. You may mock his timbre, his irritating protestations, or ridicule the lyrics on his albums - but you cannot laugh at McCrea. There are not many jokes in Northern Ireland politics. 'I'm a very resolute person,' he says, restraining the tears. 'I'm determined that the enemy will not deter me from doing that which is right.' I was shown around his Calvary Free Presbyterian Church, on the outskirts of Magherafelt, by the labourer working for free to help build a Sunday school extension. Clambering from the scaffolding, he brushed some of the mud from his black shoes and took me through the church's side door. The foundation stone of the brick and pebble-dash building was laid in 1975 by the Rev Ian Paisley, the voluble, larger-than-life leader of the Free Presbyterian Church who has dominated Northern Ireland's Unionist politics for two decades. Gaunt on its hillside perch, overlooking patchwork fields, the building is surprisingly comfortable, a welcoming church rather than of strict Presbyterian austerity. Free Presbyterianism dates from 1951, when Northern Ireland's most conservative evangelistics concluded that the Rome-ward drift and apostasy of Irish Presbyterianism was beyond redemption. From its earliest years, the church has been almost a museum example of traditionalist religious fervour in an increasingly secular Europe. In grey bricks above the altar, were set the words: 'Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel.' The labourer, a devotee of McCrea, caught the line of my sight. He was a thick-necked man wearing a ripped vest and trousers that struggled to cling to his belly. 'That is the God's wrath, up there,' he warns. McCrea, now 43, came here first in 1968, running a three week gospel campaign. He was a young man, fresh from the college Paisley had set up in Belfast to train ministers for his growing church. A year later he returned, preaching in a windowless wooden building that quickly became too small. The Calvary church, advertising McCrea's 'Old Tyme Gospel Evening Services' has been built for expansion. McCrea was born into an strict Irish Presbyterian family, not far from Magherafelt, and dutifully attended church each Sunday. 'You went and you knew nothing else,' he says. But on June 4 1957 (he has no difficulty recalling the date), the nine-year-old William McCrea was 'saved' - the experience of conversion that characterises full members of the Free Presbyterian church. 'I realised that before God that I was a sinner,' he says. Reconciliation could only come through Jesus Christ upon the Cross. 'That night I simply asked the Lord Jesus to come into my heart. I asked the Lord Jesus to cleanse me from my sin.' He entered the ministry of the Free Presbyterian Church, inspired by Paisley's imprisonment in 1966 following disturbances at an anti-ecumenical march against the Irish Presbyterian leadership. 'I realised that here was someone who was suffering because he believed the Bible, because he preached the gospel,' says McCrea. Life for him, in many ways, is as simple as that: defending the beliefs that he is, literally, prepared to risk his life to maintain. The Bible is the divinely inspired word of God; Jesus Christ died to atone our sins. He adheres to the seventeenth-century Westminster Confession of Faith in which the Catholic Pope is the Anti-Christ. He believes in sex only in marriage and respect for the Sabbath. It is a prickly defensiveness. He is no ecumenicalist; McCrea is the antithesis of a consensus politician. He can see no other way. Little wonder Peter Brooke, Northern Ireland secretary, finds it so difficult to find a political accommodation in the province. I asked if he saw himself as an emotional person? 'Yes, I do,' he say quietly. 'What would you have been like, if you hadn't been saved?' 'I don't know. I couldn't answer that question. I'd just say, 'thank God the Lord did take control of my life'.' Religion brings him an inner peace and joy, he argues, that gives him the strength to withstand the threats and intimidation; to stand up to terrorism where others might crouch. 'I have been the target of attacks. I opened my front door one night and a man was standing there with a revolver pointed straight at my brow. I have been left to tell the story but you are always conscious that death is never far away. I suppose nothing I ever do now will spare me as far as the terrorists are concerned.' McCrea, the politician, is as fierce in his defence of the Union with the UK mainland as he is of the gospel. Free Presbyterianism and the Democratic Unionist Party, established by Paisley in 1971, do not have to overlap but frequently do. They are similarly conservative and equally convinced that their's is the true way. The DUP is the brasher, less stiff-collared cousin of the larger Ulster Unionist Party, drawing its support largely from working class, urban and rural, voters. McCrea's style is shrill; his soft singer's voice does not stretch easily when trying to cower the House of Commons or journalists with words of fire-and-brimstone. 'The honourable gentleman is working himself up,' Margaret Thatcher retorted in her best school ma'am manner after a particularly hysterical intervention. He has been an MP since 1983 - from when, he says, unionists have been systematically betrayed by the government. Once he sent Thatcher his album, 'How Great Thou Art', only to find that the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, signed by the former prime minister, was to give the Irish government a say in the affairs of the province. He, like all his unionist colleagues, was horrified at the prospect of foreign intervention in a part of the UK. Constitutional uncertainty has to be ended, he insists, with the government making clear, 'that no bombing, no shooting, no campaigning - political or otherwise - will destroy the union.' Then the IRA will have no purpose and could be eradicated by a determined counter-offensive from the British security forces, unfettered by politicians. 'It is so easy for other members of parliament to carry on with the little niceties of parliamentary privilege and parliamentary duties. They haven't a clue what it is to spend the last eight years as an MP, going from home to home, family to family, seeking to give them succour, help, comfort.' That leaves little scope for embracing the agenda of nationalist politicians or the Catholic church, although he says he has nothing against individuals or their right to a particular viewpoint. 'It seems to be all right for a Roman Catholic to aspire to be part of an all-Ireland but it seems to be a sin for us to aspire not to be. I can't have a dual passport.' Does he shed a tear when he hears of a IRA terrorist who has been killed by the security forces? 'I grieve genuinely that a person has been cut off and taken out into eternity but I realise that a person who espouses violence and murder as a means of achieving a political end can expect to die by the sword.' He is not a good European but turns to Biblical prophecy for comfort. 'The fall of the system, yes, the European Community and the fall of Romanism. Read the 17th chapter of the Book of Revelations. You get a wonderful view of the fall of Babylon.' Within the DUP he is taken most seriously. During the summer 'round-table' talks engineered by Brooke he is widely regarded as having urged Paisley to stand resolute behind the DUP's demands - to the despair of more moderate colleagues. Some believe he might eventually succeed Paisley, now a close friend. Compared with his politics, the best-selling, 'singing Billy' is a far softer character. Positively soapy, in fact. But he taps a rich vein of fans, stronger still than his popularity as a politician. In spite of having no formal training, there are silver, gold and platinum discs framed on his sitting room wall. 'The best key to be in is B natural', he says. The style is 'country 'n' gospel' which means hymn tunes or Biblical themes set to a twangy country 'n' western backing, 'in the way that I feel the Lord wants me to present it'. He has recorded more-or-less an album a year for two decades, usually in Nashville, Tennessee. He has no reservation in expressing his love for Jesus Christ. It is pure, unadulterated and unsophisticated. His first producer tried to mould him. 'They were trying to change my ministry and put in it something which wasn't me and I said, 'Lord, give me the grace to stand up against this, give me the strength to say no.' And I did. That was the best decision I made in all of my singing.' What you get is almost the pure, heart-opening McCrea: 'Majesty, worship his Majesty. Unto Jesus be glory, honour and praise,' run the lyrics of one. It is almost, but not quite, McCrea. As we neared the end of our conversation, I asked if he were not, in fact, a grumbler at heart? Whenever he speaks - in Parliament, on television, even here in the comfort of his sitting room, he is on the defensive, full of demands. He looked shocked at first but, to my surprise, did not deny the charge. He believed in self-improvement: 'Maybe someday I'll be able to come on and tell you all the good things that are happening.' One day, perhaps.</p>

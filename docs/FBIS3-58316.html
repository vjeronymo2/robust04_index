Vranitzky was reacting to a proposal by Social Affairs Minister  Hesoun, who had called for cutting maternity pay for women whose  partners earn more than 70,000 Austrian schillings per month.    The Minister for Women's Affairs, Johanna Dohnal, although  in  favor of weeding out the social benefit system, opposed cuts in  maternity pay. Austrian People's Party [OeVP] Chairman, Vice  Chancellor Erhard Busek also rejects such cuts. He said that  misuse had to be stopped before introducing selective cuts.</p>

			<p>940317 FT  17 MAR 94 / Scandals hit Japan budget debate The Japanese government and opposition were yesterday paralysed by separate scandals, threatening to delay market-opening measures urgently needed to defuse the trade row with Washington. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, former prime minister and a faction leader in the opposition Liberal Democratic party, yesterday denied press allegations he was involved in efforts to prevent the Fair Trade Commission taking action against a construction industry cartel. The allegation, in the Asahi Shimbun, a daily newspaper with a long record of uncovering LDP corruption, has reinforced the opposition's determination to fight back by making use of a separate year-old scandal, to put pressure on Premier Morihiro Hosokawa. The LDP is boycotting a parliamentary debate on next year's budget until Mr Hosokawa submits documents proving he repaid a loan from the Sagawa Kyubin trucking company. It also wants Mr Hosokawa's secretary to give evidence in the chamber. Opposition officials said yesterday the budget boycott, started three days ago, would continue. Mr Hosokawa, who has repeatedly denied impropriety, continued to hold firm. The budget debate 'shows no signs of resuming. The government takes the situation seriously,' said Mr Masayoshi Takemura, chief cabinet secretary. Continued blockage on the budget for the year starting April 1 jeopardises the government's tax cuts, the main point of its second economic stimulation in six months, designed to pull Japan out of its worst recession in post-war years. The wrangle delays work on draft plans to stimulate imports, as the government decides whether or not to impose trade sanctions under the recently revived Super 301 provision of US trade law. It wants the plans to include further deregulation, incentives for foreign investment, tougher controls against cartels, and more open public procurement. It is also working on wider economic measures, to be ready for the Group of Seven summit in Naples in July. Sales at Tokyo department stores fell 6.1 per cent last month, from February 1993, marking the 24th consecutive monthly decline. Consumer spending is sluggish, but department stores are doing especially badly, because they are losing market share to new discount outlets, which report strong turnover.</p>

			<p><P> October 18, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UAL EMPLOYEE GROUPS CALL FOR CHIEF, BOARD TO QUIT  </P> <P> In what was viewed as an effort to torpedo the takeover of UAL Corp., two  United Airlines employee groups Tuesday demanded the resignation of United's  top officers, including Chief Executive Stephen M. Wolf.  </P> <P> The demand came as Wolf and his advisers tried to revise a failed $6.75-billion  offer for the airline from United's top managers and its pilots. The initial  $300-a-share offer collapsed last Friday after nervous lenders rejected the  deal as too risky.  </P> <P> Calling Wolf's actions "greedy and irresponsible," John F. Peterpaul, general  vice president of the International Assn. of Machinists, called for Wolf to  step down, along with UAL's board. Peterpaul also asked that the Securities and  Exchange Commission look into events surrounding the proposed takeover.  </P> <P> Later, in an interview, Peterpaul reiterated his union's position that the  takeover would place too much debt on United and serve to enrich the airline's  top executives. Wolf stands to make almost $76 million from his stock and  options in a $300-a-share buyout. "The whole program is bad," Peterpaul said.  </P> <P> Separately, a group that claims to represent United's 40,000 non-union  employees called upon Wolf to quit. William Palmer, an organizer of a group  called Coalition Acting for the Rights of Employees, or CARE, said the proposed  buyout would have forced a 10% wage cut on non-union employees.  </P> <P> Palmer said he hoped CARE's action would discourage lenders from financing a  UAL takeover. "Any banker that doesn't consider the negative attitudes of  employees would be derelict in his duty," he said in an interview. Palmer and  Peterpaul said the similar actions by their groups Tuesday was coincidental.  </P> <P> United's machinists and nonunion workers are at odds with the airline's pilots,  who have joined Wolf in an effort to buy the airline, with help from British  Airways. The proposal would have given an 85% ownership stake to United's  employees and managers and a 15% stake to British Air.  </P> <P> The leaders of United's pilots union met with their advisers Tuesday outside  Chicago in an attempt to devise a new buyout proposal. The meeting is expected  to last until Friday.  </P> <P> UAL released a statement from Wolf on Tuesday, calling Peterpaul's comments  "divisive and uncalled for." He said a resignation of UAL's board would not be  in the company's best interest.  </P> <P> On Wall Street, professional stock speculators said Peterpaul's remarks also  seemed designed to help his union gain leverage in contract talks with the  company, which opened Tuesday. "I think he's just trying to make Wolf angry and  scare the U.S. and Japanese banks," one trader said. "But I don't take him too  seriously."  </P> <P> One executive with a large foreign bank said Tuesday that Peterpaul's remarks  were of concern to overseas lenders. "There is too much uncertainty about the  deal," said the executive, whose bank has helped finance other airline  acquisitions, including the recent $4.05-billion buyout of Northwest Airlines.  </P> <P> The bank executive said foreign lenders would feel more comfortable if the  machinists union, which represents 23,000 United workers, joined the deal, a  prospect that seems unlikely. Peterpaul said in the interview that an employee  stock ownership plan, or an ESOP, is not part of the contract talks. He said  UAL executives in previous meetings had refused to discuss with him what he  considers to be key aspects of an ESOP plan.  </P> <P> "We asked them to describe how it would be governed and their business plan,  and they would not give us that information," Peterpaul said.  </P> <P> The foreign banker, who asked that his name and the name of his institution not  be used, said UAL's plummeting stock price was also causing lenders to  hesitate. UAL shares fell $25.625 to close at $197.25 on the New York Stock  Exchange. On Wall Street, traders said UAL shares could drop as low as $140  before they hit bottom.  </P> <P> The drop Tuesday was blamed on a statement by Citibank, one of two lead banks  for the buyout group, that it had received "expressions of interest" from some  banks willing to finance a UAL buyout but did not have an agreement from banks  or from the buyout group on a revised offer.  </P> <P> Citibank had asked 20 leading banks in Europe, Japan and the United States,  whether they would finance a transaction at $250 a share. The Citibank proposal  included more generous fees for banks than the financing plan rejected by the  banks last week.  </P> <P> The Japanese trade journal Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported in its Wednesday  editions that of the large Japanese banks, only Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking  was ready to finance the UAL deal. The newspaper said Sumitomo Bank had decided  not to participate and that other important institutions, including Sanwa Bank  and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, seemed reluctant to finance a takeover.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report]  <H8>  THE STAR </H8>   Back in Commonwealth -- "It is one of history's little  ironies that those most vocal in bewailing South Africa's  departure from the Commonwealth in 1961 are now most lukewarm  about our readmission," notes an editorial in Johannesburg THE  STAR in English on 2 June on page 16. "`Club' membership no  longer brings unquestioned economic benefits in terms of  preferential tariffs and increased trade. But is does offer  assistance in education and literacy, technical training, health  programmes, scientific conferences and other areas where years  of enforced isolation from the world have left us lagging well  behind other countries of comparable size and influence." "As  long as the costs of membership do not substantially outweigh  the benefits, South Africa will be better off as a member of the  Commonwealth than as an `old boy' looking on from the sidelines."  <H8>  BUSINESS DAY </H8>   Looming Bank Legislation -- "Apprehension over looming  legislation to compel banks to detail publicly information on  lending by race and by sex is understandable," states an  editorial in the 2 June BUSINESS DAY in English. "Apart from  the obvious difficulties of compiling the information" there  would "also be the bureaucratic cost of complying with yet  another layer of regulation." Against the bank's "understandable  fear" of being "legally or morally coerced into making riskier  loans," is the counter of of using "openness" as a "potent  marketing tool" to "differentiate banks from each other and help  in their efforts to attract and keep business." "The banks have  to accept that they are operating in a new environment. By the  same token, the ANC's advisers must be realistic and not seek to  introduce commercially unsound change."    New World -- "South Africa is tumbling with gusto into every  possible international forum that once rejected us: the  Commonwealth, the Organisation of African Unity, the Non-Aligned  Movement, the International Labour Organisation, and of course,  we will soon be back in the Un General Assembly." "It is not  clear that the Non-Aligned Movement has any further role in what  has been for years a unipolar world" and Commonwealth membership  "will not deliver much of measurable significance," the second  editorial in the 2 June BUSINESS DAY notes. "More important are  our international trade relations, and they are helped by our  new membership of international forums." "After the `welcome  back' fanfare, government and the private sector will have to  work at enhancing the relationships that count."  <H8>  SOWETAN </H8>   Back in Commonwealth -- "Getting back into the Commonwealth  is important but is mainly a sentimental and psychological boost  for South Africa, notes an editorial in Johannesburg SOWETAN in  English on 2 June on page 8. The Commonwealth nations are mainly  poor and there is not much to gain economically." Going from  "pariah state" exclusion affected not only "intellectual,  cultural and economic stimulation, but our confidence." And  being back in the Commonwealth "also means we will compete again  in the Commonwealth games."  <H8>  THE CITIZEN </H8>   Return to International Bodies -- "Resuming our Commonwealth  membership is another major step in the normalisation of our  relations with the outside world," states an editorial in  Johannesburg THE CITIZEN in English on 1 June on page 6. South  Africa also became a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, the  Orgainzation of African Unity and will take its seat in the  United Nations. "When that happens, we will be back in all  international bodies from which we were excluded by apartheid,  and we will be able to hold our heads high once more in the  community of nations."</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / People: Talking emerging markets before trend set in Arnab Banerji, joint head of emerging markets at Citibank Global Asset Management, is moving to Foreign &amp; Colonial as chief investment officer of the new F &amp; C Emerging Markets. Currently one of the trendier byways of fund management, emerging markets also represent a return to basics for F &amp; C, which was founded in 1868, with its first portfolio full of the likes of Egyptian railway loans and Peruvian 5 per cent bonds. Last month F &amp; C set up a new subsidiary, doubling ts stake in Latin American Securities, a company founded in 1987 by Audley Twiston Davies, and combining that with its existing south-east Asia team to form a group managing Dollars 1.5bn in funds. Banerji, who moved from India to Britain at the age of three, says that he has been 'talking about emerging markets since 1984 when it was thoroughly unfashionable'. He is now moving to F &amp; C because it is ' a pure investment house, where my remuneration is tied directly to the performance of the funds and where I can concentrate solely on emerging markets, which is what I love.' Citibank, where Banerji put together a global emerging markets team, currently has some Dollars 3bn under management in this sector. Since joining the fund management side in 1990, he has been involved in the launch of a number of funds including Latin American Horizons, targeted at clients of Citi's private bank. More recently, 37-year-old Banerji has concentrated on institutional investors, bringing in some Dollars 200m on a segregated or pooled basis, from clients including KLM and Royal Dutch Shell. Trained as an eye surgeon before a car accident cut short his medical career, Banerji started in the City as a fund manager for Schroders. In 1986 he moved to Nomura, where he was deputy head of research, specialising in healthcare and chemical stocks. Three years later he moved to Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers as head of equity research.</p>

			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / Monitoring change for factors urged INDEPENDENT factoring companies, which provide clients with cash against their invoices and other credit management services, should be more closely regulated, the larger of the industry's two professional bodies said yesterday. The statement follows the collapse last month of London and Provincial Factors, which was not a member of the Association of British Factors and Discounters, the body which represents the large factors. All 11 members of the business are owned by banks. Many of London and Provincial's clients stand to lose much of the money they are owed and are facing collapse. The Bank of England should ensure that factors are financed properly and that they do not use clients' invoices as security for bank loans, the association said.</p>

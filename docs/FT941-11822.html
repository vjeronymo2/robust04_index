			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Kalon makes Pounds 6.2m purchase Kalon, the paints group, is expanding its penetration of the specialist decorative products market via the acquisition of the principal assets and goodwill of Vallance &amp; Co, a subsidiary of Den Braven Sealants, for about Pounds 6.2m cash, including Pounds 5.2m for tangible assets. Products within the Vallance range include sealants, putties, fillers, fire cement, tile adhesive, grouts and liquid nails. This latter has the fastest growing sales. Den Braven retains its trade sales of sealants. Because of this, no profits figure can be attributed to the acquired business, though sales have been stated as Pounds 12.5m.</p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ROOTS ACROSS SEA;  </P> <P> IRVINE PROFESSOR ELECTED TO ESTONIAN CONGRESS  </P> <P> Rein Taagepera, newly elected member of Estonia's congress, ran his campaign  from the kitchen of his Irvine home.  </P> <P> He pounded out essays and speeches on a home computer, then broadcast them to  his homeland in the Soviet Union via Radio Free Europe. Sometimes he faxed his  campaign literature to Estonia and counted on friends to distribute it to  voters.  </P> <P> "Of course when you try to send a fax to Estonia, it sometimes takes three to  four days. There's a lot of hit and miss," Taagepera said.  </P> <P> Born in Estonia, Taagepera, 57, is a UC Irvine political science professor  whose articles and speeches brim with pro-independence rhetoric about his  homeland's struggle with the Soviet Union. He is a staunch nationalist who, at  the age of 11, accompanied his parents as they fled Estonia after the Russian  occupation in 1944.  </P> <P> Taagepera, who is a Canadian citizen, is the only person in the United States  who was elected in March to the new, 500-member Estonian Congress. In all, four  of those elected live outside Estonia.  </P> <P> In Estonia, Taagepera explained, the congress is "like a national assembly. It  is legal but has no administering power. The Supreme Soviets (the ruling  authority) still run the country."  </P> <P> But he quickly adds: "However, everything in my homeland -- control of the  press, industry and government -- is in a state of flux."  </P> <P> Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are the three Baltic states that were annexed by  the Soviet Union in 1940. Only last week, Latvia joined Lithuania in declaring  its independence. In the case of Lithuania, the action prompted Soviet  President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to impose an economic blockade.  </P> <P> By contrast, Estonian leaders, seeking a more moderate approach and worried  about the large numbers of Soviet troops within their borders, took a different  tack. They tried to soften their stand with an "announcement" that the Soviet  occupation was illegal and, therefore, Soviet laws no longer had authority.  </P> <P> The Estonian plan is to negotiate an independence agreement with Moscow that  would remove Soviet troops from Estonian soil and hand control of the  republic's affairs to local officials, Taagepera said.  </P> <P> "Basically, we declared independence without using the word independence,"  Taagepera said.  </P> <P> Since the announcement was made in March, Taagepera said, Soviet leaders in  Moscow have asked Estonia to withdraw the statement.  </P> <P> Taagepera was one of 11 candidates vying for five seats in his hometown of  Tartu. He won a seat with 4,346 votes, more than twice as many as his nearest  competitor.  </P> <P> "I tried to go to Estonia for the election, but my visa was denied," he said.  </P> <P> Cesar Sereseres, a UC Irvine colleague in the political science department,  describes Taagepera as a caring man.  </P> <P> "He cares about his homeland, his students and his family. . . . He's like  professors from Ireland, Africa and Costa Rica who have blood roots to their  homeland. These people have their ethnicity deeply embedded, not only in their  brains but their hearts, and that's Rein," Sereseres said.  </P> <P> Taagepera's wife, Mare, a UC Irvine chemistry instructor, was also born in  Estonia. She said it is difficult for others to understand, but "our cultural  background is very strong. We speak Estonian. . . . It's a hard thing to  explain to people not in this situation."  </P> <P> To live under Soviet rule, she said, is to live with fear. Just several years  ago, she said, people wouldn't talk to their neighbors for fear of being  reported to the KGB. "Estonians remember what it was like when it was  independent, but the Russians came in and made us a third-world country."  </P> <P> Taagepera has made trips to Estonia. On one visit last year, he made 21 public  appearances in 18 days and spoke to crowds ranging from a handful of people to  5,000, he said. In his articles, Taagepera describes the Soviets as  "post-occupation colonists," essentially illegal immigrants who should apply  for Estonian citizenship.  </P> <P> "It's not only my viewpoint but a question of legality. The question isn't to  throw out a (Soviet colonist) who has been there 39 years, but to legalize  their status," he said.  </P> <P> "It's not a matter of Estonia leaving the Soviet Union, because we never  joined. We were illegally occupied, and that occupation has continued because  of fraudulent elections. Our question is, 'Do you want to join with the Soviet  Union?' Not, 'Do you want to leave?' " he said.  </P> <P> Taagepera considers himself "more radical" than some of the mainstream  pro-democracy organizers. But he believes that with relations presently  strained between Moscow and the Baltic states, it would be foolish to begin  pushing hard for Estonian independence right now.  </P> <P> He said he is seeking approval for a four-month teaching assignment at an  Estonian university in Tartu. He views the assignment as a challenge to  discover whether he would eventually like to move back to Estonia.  </P> <P> "I like living here and to live in Estonia would be a difficult move for both  my wife and I. How do I know whether I would like living there? But let's just  say I'm considering moving back."  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 16, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MASS BY NEW BISHOP A BOOST FOR MIGRANTS  </P> <P> In a clear rebuff of anti-immigrant sentiment, incoming San Diego Roman  Catholic Bishop Robert H. Brom celebrated an open-air Mass in Encinitas Friday  for migrant workers and spoke out on behalf of the impoverished laborers.  </P> <P> Brom's brief but pointed homily called on all Catholics to rally around the  plight of the migrants and other dispossessed people.  </P> <P> "Tonight, we pray that members of the church will be a compassionate voice for  those who have no voice, in behalf of justice and basic fairness, work and a  decent wage, housing, health care, and other human services," said Brom,  speaking in his embryonic Spanish to more than 300 worshipers, including many  migrant workers.  </P> <P>  "In the church, we celebrate that we are all one family -- men and women,  white people, black people and brown people, citizens and aliens, rich and  poor," said Brom, who stood on an elevated podium at the end of a dusty  Encinitas arena used for charro, a kind of Mexican rodeo.  </P> <P> "And so tonight, we hope and pray that all people of good will join us in  striving to eliminate prejudice, and to develop together a social conscience of  solidarity."  </P> <P> Brom wore a fuchsia-color skullcap and resplendent robes made of Mexican  fabric, including a multi-colored stole woven with the image of the Virgin of  Guadalupe, the patroness of Mexico and Latin America.  </P> <P> As Brom was celebrating the sunset service, he was accompanied by a mariachi  band, whose smartly dressed members played ballads of pilgrims and sojourners.  </P> <P> The bishop's sermon carried a striking message of unity and conciliation  against what many perceive as a rising wave of resentment and racism against  the area's immigrant population. Most of the migrants are men from Mexico and  Guatemala, but many women and children immigrants also live in the area.  </P> <P> Brom, a native of rural Wisconsin, is scheduled to be officially installed as  San Diego's Roman Catholic prelate next month, after Bishop Leo T. Maher  retires.  </P> <P> Brom has said he plans to reach out to the area's Latino population, and this  was the second time that he had celebrated an open-air Mass for migrant  workers. The first was in January, in a large migrant worker encampment in the  Rancho Penasquitos area of San Diego.  </P> <P> Last year, he spent time in Mexico honing his Spanish, which is still halting  but was much appreciated by those in attendance.  </P> <P> "When we see him here, we know that he will help us," said Julio Felipe Leon, a  34-year-old Mexican man who was among those attending the service. "We are all  Catholics here, and it gives us pleasure to see him here."  </P> <P> During his homily, Brom made no direct mention of the tensions in northern San  Diego County surrounding the explosive migrant issue. But the controversy  provided an unspoken backdrop to the whole evening.  </P> <P> Bolstering the service's symbolic importance was the fact that it took place in  Encinitas, where city officials have taken the area's most stringent measures  against the migrant population.  </P> <P> The service was timed to take place before June 22, the effective date of an  Encinitas ordinance aimed at outlawing the roadside hiring of day laborers. It  also took place near El Camino Real, the north-south thoroughfare, where each  morning hundreds of Latin American laborers seek roadside employment. Many live  in crude encampments on either side of the road.  </P> <P> A banner placed at the entrance of the rodeo arena denounced the ordinance,  saying the new law is intended "to harass men and boys whose only crime is to  seek an honest day's work."  </P> <P> After the 45-minute service, meals were served to the participants, and Bishop  Brom blessed babies and posed for photographs with the mariachi musicians and  accompanying rodeo artists.  </P> <P> Organizers of the event described it as successful in its purpose of  consolidating support for the migrants.  </P> <P> "The mere fact that he came to officiate a Mass for them is a strong statement  that he cares," said Ozzie Venzor, an Encinitas resident who heads a group  called Friends of the Immigrant Workers.  </P> <P> A similar sentiment was voiced by Enrique M. Loaeza Tovar, the Mexican consul  general in San Diego, who also attended the service.  </P> <P> "Despite some of the negative currents against the presence of the migrants, it  is good to see that there are many citizens who are open to the possibility of  sharing with these people and enriching themselves in the mixture of culture  that is so evident here," Loaeza said.  </P></p>

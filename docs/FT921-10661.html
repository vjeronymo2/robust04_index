			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Company News: Vogue submits Le Cinq rescue bid VOGUE, the French record company, has submitted a rescue bid for La Cinq, the ailing French television station. This morning, Mr Hubert Lafont, who was this year appointed as La Cinq's administrator after the station filed for bankruptcy, will announce whether he has found an acceptable buyer for the channel. Vogue's chief competitor as La Cinq's saviour is Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media mogul who already owns 25 per cent of the shares and on Monday announced a FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270bn) recapitalisation plan for the channel. Mr Berlusconi claims to have already found enough potential investors for his package. He also intends to increase his investment, maintaining his holding at 25 per cent, the maximum allowed under French law. If other existing shareholders, whoh include the Hachette media group and Credit Lyonnais, the French bank, did not reinvest, their holdings would be so diluted that Mr Berlusconi and his partners would be in a very powerful position. Vogue said yesterday that it saw its bid as a means of 'preserving the French character' of La Cinq. Vogue, which is owned and run by Mr Jean-Louis Detry, is one of a handful of French record companies in an industry dominated by the US and Japan. It employs 110 people and turned over around FFr200m in 1991. Any rescuer for La Cinq must conform to the French criteria for the ownership and management of TV stations. If Mr Lafont decides that none of the mooted rescues is suitable, La Cinq will close.</p>

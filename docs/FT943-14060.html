			<p>940716 FT  16 JUL 94 / Railtrack to try fresh direct appeal to strikers Railtrack plans to make a further direct appeal to its 4,600 striking signalling staff in an attempt to prevent the stepping up of the dispute after next week. The company will write to staff with more details of its latest productivity pay offer in the next few days. Railtrack managers said signalling staff were confused by their union executive's decision to move to a 48-hour strike from noon on Tuesday, July 26. The sixth 24-hour Wednesday stoppage is planned for July 20. Railtrack said that it had heard from about a quarter of the strikers on a special telephone 'hot-line' over the past fortnight through its 'hearts and minds' campaign. While the company acknowledges that the staff remain loyal to their union's leadership, the calls were helping management clarify and improve its pay offer. The company has few options at this stage to counteract the union's move to step up the industrial action. An official said that Railtrack had not yet reached the point when it might consider imposing new contracts of employment on the signalling grades which would change working practices. The company has ruled out the option of dismissing the signalling staff and replacing them with a newly trained workforce. Railtrack believes that such a move would close down the network for at least three months and deal a mortal blow to the company's future. Railtrack continues to hope that the signalling staff will put pressure on the RMT leadership to restart peace talks. The staff have already lost Pounds 300 in pay through the strikes. They are set to lose as much as Pounds 180 a week, more than 60 per cent of their earnings, if they move to 48-hour stoppages. This could mean the loss of three days' pay, because of rostering arrangements. Mr Jimmy Knapp, the RMT's general secretary, said yesterday that there were still 10 days left to reach a settlement with Railtrack before the first three-day disruption took place. He continued to insist that Railtrack had to agree to an interim payment for past efficiency achievements before going on to negotiate a restructuring package worth between 13 per cent and 26 per cent on basic rates. Employer organisations are concerned at the cost of the rail conflict to business. The Institute of Directors warned yesterday it could seriously damage the economic recovery and hit Britain's reputation as a reliable place to do business.</p>

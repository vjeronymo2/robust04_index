			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Accountants to probe Church COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, has been appointed to report on the finances of the Church of England following criticism of the Church Commissioners' investment performance. The church asked Coopers to examine 'the commissioners' borrowings and the information flow required for the management of their assets'. Dr George Carey, who as archbishop of Canterbury is chairman of the commissioners, promised the Church's general synod in July that there would be an inquiry. He said 'serious points' had been made about the management of funds and about judgments on investments. The undertaking followed an article in the Financial Times in July which said the commissioners, who are responsible for handling the church's main assets, had suffered Pounds 500m losses on investments. In their annual report for last year, the commissioners said that they expected annual income to remain flat for some years and that it had 'become urgent' to cut expenditure to match income forecasts. One of the consequences is that church members have been told they will have to meet a higher proportion of clergy stipends in future. In the synod debate Sir Douglas Lovelock, first church estates commissioner and chairman of the assets committee, defended the commissioners. He said there was not an institution in the country whose capital value had not gone down in the past year or two.</p>

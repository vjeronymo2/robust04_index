			<p>BFN     [Text] The State of Kuwait and Tunisia have stressed the  significance of implementing all the UN resolutions relating to  the respect of the independence and sovereignty of the State of  Kuwait, including Resolution No. 833, which embodies the  geographical framework of the borders between the State of  Kuwait and Iraq, and on resolving the question of the Kuwaiti  POW's and hostages in the prisons of the Iraqi regime.    A joint statement released today at the end of the first  visit to Tunisia by Shaykh Sabah al-Ahmad, Kuwaiti deputy prime  minister and foreign Minister, says that the visit of the first  deputy prime minister and foreign minister to Tunisia stemmed  from the fraternal relations between the peoples of the two  countries, and the close relations which his highness the amir  and his brother President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali have laid.    The statement notes that the talks between the delegations  of  the two countries dealt with ways of promoting bilateral  relations and an exchange of views on Arab, Islamic, and  international issues of mutual interest.    The two sides renewed their support of the peace process in  the Middle East aimed at achieving a just and durable peace  which ensures legitimate Arab rights. The two sides also stress  their backing for the efforts exerted at realizing national  reconciliation in Yemen and maintaining its unity and cohesion.    Regarding the situation in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the two sides  express their profound concern at the aggressive acts, genocide,  and ethnic cleansing to which the unarmed people of Bosnia is  subjected at the hands of the Serbs. The two sides demand that  the international community shoulder its responsibility through  an immediate implementation of the Security Council's  resolutions, and to save a state member of the United Nations  [as heard].</p>

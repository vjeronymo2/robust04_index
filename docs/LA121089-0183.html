			<p><P> December 10, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> MORNINGSIDE WINS PACIFIC SHORES TOURNEY  </P> <P> Morningside High won its seventh Pacific Shores basketball tournament Saturday  night by defeating Lakewood, 85-72, Saturday night at Redondo Union High  School.  </P> <P> Senior forward Tyrone Paul, who led Morningside with 18 points in Saturday's  game, was named the tournament's Most Valuable Player.  </P> <P> Morningside got a scare, however, at the beginning of the third quarter, when  Lakewood outscored the Monarchs 14-3 to shave 12 points off a 15-point lead.  </P> <P> Then, with 2:43 left in the quarter and the Monarchs leading by only 49-46,  Morningside center Jeff Crowe was called for a technical foul after arguing an  official's call.  </P> <P> "We were pretty upset, but the coaches told us to have poise," Crowe said. "We  settled down and we got back in synch."  </P> <P> In the rest of the third quarter, Morningside went on to outscore Lakewood,  18-6.  </P> <P> A similar run in the opening minutes of the game, when Paul had two breakaway  dunks, staked Morningside to a 17-3 lead.  </P> <P> "I felt pretty good tonight," Paul said, noting that his team had been  eliminated in the semifinals of last year's tournament. "This team has got a  winning feeling. Last year we got to the door. This year we're going inside."  </P> <P> Crowe had 13 points, eight of them in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> All-tournament selection Andre Miller, a senior forward for Lakewood, had a  game-high 27 points. Lakewood forward Terrence O'Kelley had 19 points.  </P> <P> In the third-place game, Carson beat Rolling Hills 82-73. Senior forward Bobby  Kelly led the Colts with 27 points. Roger Hendrix led Rolling Hills with 25.  GREG GONZALEZ  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl has stated that EPA has failed to address issues regarding both the statistical treatment of the data underlying the RfC and EPA's decision to employ a 1000-fold factor of uncertainty in calculating the RfC. EPA disagrees. Appendix A of the ORD Risk Assessment addresses each of these issues. The extensive analyses the Agency has conducted represent a concerted effort to respond to the statistical issues raised by Ethyl. The fact that EPA does not adopt Ethyl's advocated position is not a failure to address the issues. In fact, no scientific consensus or policy exists on many of these issues, such as the selection of a specific mathematical dose-response model, the selection of an effect level, how to address continuous data, and the appropriate magnitude of severity regarding production of uncertainty factors for the various effect levels. As is specifically described in the ``Response to Comments'' document, ORD utilized scientific judgment in determining the appropriateness of certain models and the inclusion of specific uncertainty factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl also expressed concerns that EPA had not adequately addressed alternative analyses for estimating an RfC by utilizing different groupings of subjects in the Roels analysis. ICF Kaiser, a consultant for Ethyl, commented that ``ORD ignores alternative analyses which most closely resemble the conventional method for calculating RfCs.'' The alternative approach Ethyl employed to group the data from the study by Roels et al. (1992) has no evident rationale other than providing a statistically nonsignificant effect level. The groupings employed by Roels et al. (1992) and used by ORD appear to have been selected because they provided approximately equal numbers of subjects per group. The groupings selected by Ethyl result in both smaller and more disparate numbers of subjects per group, with a consequent reduction in statistical power to detect a significant difference between a Mn-exposed group and controls. Further, as explained in the Response to Comments Document previously cited, ORD does not view the use of the upper boundary of the concentration associated with a group as a scientifically appropriate or representative metric to describe the exposure of the entire group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl also took issue with the Agency for focusing on analyses using the average concentration of respirable dust (ACRD). The decision to focus on ACRD was not arbitrary or designed to yield lower RfC estimates but, as explained in Appendix A of the ORD Risk Assessment, was based on both an explicit consideration of the advantages ACRD offered for fitting dose-response models and its ability to reflect average past exposure, thereby obviating some of the apparent disadvantages of the two exposure measures reported by Roels et al. (1992), LIRD and CRD. Although the Agency views ACRD as the best choice of these three available exposure measures for the analytical approaches employed in the ORD risk assessment, Figure 1 (See Section VI&hyph;B, above.) illustrates all of the RfC estimates presented for all three exposure measures and all analytical approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ethyl recommends that certain analyses should be omitted from consideration on the ORD risk assessment. To some extent, the Agency believes the difference between Ethyl's and EPA's positions is related to differing interpretations of what is reasonable versus unreasonable, biologically plausible versus implausible, or valid versus invalid. As addressed before, the Agency's basic approach in the ORD risk assessment was to present all of the results of its analyses and then identify a subset of the total that have a scientifically stronger basis for being considered preferentially. <FOOTCITE>63</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 63 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For specific discussion related to these issues the reader is referred to Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26, II&hyph;A&hyph;12. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Ethyl offers several arguments directed at reducing the overall uncertainty and specifically the composite uncertainty factor (UF) of 10 for database limitations applied in deriving estimates of an RfC for manganese. Ethyl's first argument concerns the basic ``biological plausibility'' of the RfC, suggesting that inhaled manganese cannot be as toxic (compared to ingested manganese) as the roughly 100-fold difference in RfC and RfD estimates would indicate. <FOOTCITE>64</FOOTCITE>  The Agency believes that a fundamental problem with Ethyl's comparison is that it is limited to what Ethyl estimates is the ``systemic dose.'' The key issue is not systemic dose but delivered dose, i.e., the amount of manganese that actually reaches and enters a critical target organ such as the brain. Furthermore, the Agency believes that, depending on the form of manganese inhaled, and its ability to enter the brain, it is quite possible that a significant fraction of even small amounts of inhaled manganese would be able to reach target sites in the central nervous system. Thus, the apparently greater toxicity of inhaled versus ingested manganese may reflect important pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences of manganese that enters the body by different routes of exposure. Ethyl's analysis of systemic dose does not adequately address this issue. <FOOTCITE>65</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 64 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Air Docket A&hyph;93&hyph;26. The Reference Dose or RfD is analogous to the RfC but for ingestion as opposed to inhalation. Document II&hyph;A&hyph;13 (in the docket), Table 1, compares the ``systemic dose'' of manganese for the Recommended Daily Intake (now termed ``Recommended Daily Allowance'' by FDA) of ingested manganese, the RfC for inhaled manganese, and the RfD for manganese in drinking water. This tabular comparison does not address several issues that the Agency has identified as factors in its assessment on inhaled manganese toxicity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 65 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> In fact, as is indicated in ``ORD's Response to Comments on MMT'' document, many studies indicate that inhalation exposure does result in a greater delivered dose. This evidence includes, for example, a report by Coulston and Griffin (1977), who exposed monkeys to the whole combustion products of MMT (Mn <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> O <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ) for 23 hr/day for up to 66 weeks. According to the authors, monkeys breathed 0.86 L/min, or 119 L in a 23-hr exposure day. AT 100 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , approximately 120 &mu;g Mn would be inhaled daily, which would equate to a systemic dose of about 24 &mu;g/day (assuming 20% deposition and 100% absorption). In addition, both control and inhalation-exposed monkeys ingested about 4&hyph;5 mg Mn/day in their diet, which would equate to a systemic dose of approximately 135 &mu;g/day (assuming 3% absorption). Even though these calculations indicate that the diet accounted for about six times more Mn entering the body of the exposed animals, the relatively small inhalation fraction doubled the delivered dose of Mn in the brains of the inhalation-exposed monkeys. Furthermore, the authors found blood levels of Mn to be equivalent in the exposed and control monkeys, despite the higher brain levels in the inhalation-exposed animals. Thus, extrapolations based on estimated systemtic dose by ingestion underpredict doses delivered to the brain by inhalation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The more specific critique Ethyl offers regarding the composite UF of 10 for database limitations deals with three areas of inadequate information represented by the composite factor: chronic exposure effects, reproductive/developmental effects, and differences in toxicity of different forms of manganese. In deriving RfCs for other chemicals, any one of these three areas of uncertainty has, in one case or another, warranted a full UF of 10. <FOOTCITE>66</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 66 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The decision whether to utilize the full uncertainty factor of 10 is based on a judgement by the RfC workgroup on a case-by-case basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency believes that given the possible accumulation of manganese, the effects of chronic exposure to inhaled manganese are of concern. The maximum average exposure duration of the available occupational studies cited by both ORD and Ethyl is 16.7 years (Mergler et al. 1994), <FOOTCITE>67</FOOTCITE>  which does not constitute chronic exposure. Ethyl's comments ignore the point that the RfC is in fact aimed at extrapolation to 70 exposure years. Reproductive and developmental toxicity are widely recognized as significant public health concerns and therefore warrant specific consideration as uncertainties in RfC derivation. The available animal studies on reproductive and developmental effects almost exclusively involved oral dosing of manganese and are inadequate for inhalation RfC purposes. Studies of such effects in humans are limited for males and nonexistent for females.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 67 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Mergler D.; Huel, G.; Bowler, R.; Iregren, A.; Belanger, S.; Baldwin, M.; Tardif, R.; Smargiassi, A.; Martin, L.; (1994) Nervous system dysfunction among workers with long-term exposure to manganese. Environ. Res. 64: 151&hyph;180. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The potential difference in toxicity potency of Mn3O4 in comparison to MnO2 or other compounds of manganese is a significant uncertainty because no existing study has directly compared the toxicities of these compounds by inhalation exposure. Ethyl's comparison of studies involving not only different routes of exposure but significant differences in methods, subjects/subject populations, and other key features does not constitute an adequate quantitative assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> August 17, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE DISMISSES CLAIM B OF A PLOTTED TO OVERTURN VERDICT  </P> <P> A federal judge has dismissed a woman's claim that Bank of America and two  state appeal court justices plotted to overturn a $26-million jury award  against the bank that she and her partners in an apple-processing business  received.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel in San Francisco on Monday rejected  Irene O'Connell Kruse's $200-million civil rights claim, calling it "wholly  without merit" and based on "irrelevant, scurrilous charges." The judge also  said she is considering imposing sanctions on Kruse's attorney, Frederick  Watson of Walnut Creek, Calif., for filing the suit. Watson declined to  comment.  </P> <P> A Sonoma County jury awarded Kruse and her partners $47 million in 1985. They  had accused the bank in a lawsuit of fraud for allegedly causing the collapse  of her Sebastopol, Calif., apple business by failing to lend her money after  promising to do so.  </P> <P> The award was later reduced to $26 million. A three-judge appellate panel then  unanimously overturned the verdict, citing a lack of sufficient evidence. A  Sonoma County judge is considering whether to grant a new trial, a Bank of  America spokesman said.  </P> <P> After the award was overturned, Kruse filed a lawsuit alleging that Bank of  America had conspired with Justices William Newsom Jr. and John Racanelli of  the State Court of Appeal in San Francisco to quash the jury award. The  defendants denied all of the charges.  </P></p>

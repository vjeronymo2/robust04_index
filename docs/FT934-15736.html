			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Sport: The turnip faces the end of the world - Peter Berlin previews a week of big games / Soccer THE TURNIP goes back in the pressure cooker next week. Graham Taylor, the England manager and the Fleet Street tabloids' favourite vegetable, is this weekend coaching his squad in the nuances of the long-ball game in preparation for his date with destiny in Rotterdam on Wednesday. Victory would, more or less, ensure a place in the World Cup finals in the United States next year; defeat could mean the end of the world. A nation's fans will be glued to their television sets as Taylor stews in Feyenoord's stadium, the Tub. Taylor and the England fans will not be alone. Only eight of the 24 places in the finals are decided. The 500-game qualification process started 19 months ago in Santo Domingo where Puerto Rico beat the Dominican Republic 2-1. Around 450 games have been played since - give or take a few annulled or twice-played matches in Africa - but 33 teams are still competing for the remaining 16 places. Algeria and Nigeria met in Algiers last night in African Group A to decide whether Nigeria or Ivory Coast goes to the US. All but three of the othersplay in the next 10 days. Taylor has one advantage over his rival on Wednesday. Win or lose, Dick Advocaat, the Dutch coach, will not take his team to the US. If the Netherlands qualifies, Johann Cruyff will return from Barcelona to manage it in the finals. If England makes it, Taylor is safe in his job for five years. The 1996 European championships will be held in England, so his team is excused qualifying. Failure to reach the final stages has, traditionally, cost England managers their jobs although failures in the finals have been forgiven. A win in Rotterdam, though, and Taylor could watch his side lose every big game until the end of the qualifying tournament for the 1998 World Cup before having to find a new job. A draw would leave matters balanced finely. England has a worse goal difference than the Dutch. Both play their last matches on November 17, England away to hapless San Marino and the Dutch in Poland. England would be giving the Dutch a four-goal start, a handicap which favours England slightly. Taylor does not fancy a night of such calculations: 'When you start to think that way, it will drive you crazy.' He said England would go for a win on Wednesday. This is a bluff. Taylor knows the Dutch must attack, and a counter-punching strategy would suit him. He has not added a creative player to his squad to replace Paul Gascoigne, who is suspended, and will select a defensive midfield. England's main attacking strategy will be Taylor's preferred long-ball game: a vague boot from defence towards the strikers. Taylor must envy Egil Olsen, Norway's manager. His team leads England's group and needs to win just one of its last two games to be sure of going to the US. Switzerland, Belgium, the Republic of Ireland, France and Sweden also need just one win in two to qualify. All are placed perfectly for an attack of the jitters. England and the Netherlands are not the only traditional soccer powers struggling to qualify. Below Switzerland, Italy and Portugal scrabble for a place. Behind the Irish, Denmark, the European champion, could qualify if results go well on Wednesday but, otherwise, faces a showdown in Seville against Spain. The US organisers will be praying France does not slip and that Spain, Italy, England and the Netherlands right themselves. But if the European groups have made the marketing people nervous, the start of the South American qualifying tournament in July must have terrified them. Brazil had been in wonderfully creative form in the Copa America and the US '93 tournament earlier in the summer, but won neither. Then, it opened its qualifying group with a draw in Ecuador and a loss in Bolivia. But Brazil, cannily, had scheduled all its home games for the end; it won the lot and went through. The three other Latin American teams assured of a final place - Mexico, Bolivia and Colombia - all are crowd-pleasers. Argentina, the pantomime villain of world soccer, must win a two-leg play-off against Australia, starting in Sydney on October 31. In July, Argentina again showed its big-match resilience, grinding through matches in the Copa America as it did on its way to the final of the 1990 World Cup. It beat Brazil and then Colombia on penalties; but, in the final, Gabriel Batistuta scored two superb goals in a 2-1 win over Mexico to suggest Argentina has added a scoring edge it lacked in Italy. It should be too tough for the Australians. Emotions will run high in Casablanca tomorrow where Morocco must beat Zambia to qualify. Morocco, which lost out on hosting the 1998 World Cup, is the only north African nation with a chance of reaching the finals and pride is at stake. The Zambian team, meanwhile, has been patched up from youngsters and returning European stars to replace the squad wiped out in an air crash in April. If they qualify, the indomitable Lions of Cameroon know they will be the first African nation seeded in the finals. Cameroon needs only to avoid defeat at home to Zimbabwe tomorrow, but the team has started wrangling over cash. On the other hand, Zimbabwe must overcome a passionate home crowd in Yaounde and the ground's reputation for strong witchcraft. The organisers of Asia's final qualifying group, starting in in Qatar on Friday, have implored the press to concentrate on soccer, not politics. The six contenders include North and South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran. The chief question is whether the J-League has made the sixth team, Japan, a soccer power. Franz Beckenbauer, the former German manager, said the champion will be handicapped because it is excused the qualifying tournament which toughens teams. The problem, as Taylor could point out, is that it can also eliminate them.</p>

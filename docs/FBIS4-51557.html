			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 26 KYODO -- Shigeru Goda will resign  as chairman of Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. this week to take  responsibility for the company's involvement in a payoff  scandal, company officials said Tuesday [26 April].    Goda will step down and take up new duties as an adviser  effective Thursday, the officials said.    They said Goda will consider whether to resign as head of  the  Japan Shipbuilders Association.    Mitoshi Ozawa will continue to serve as president of the  company, the officials said.    A former executive of the company was arrested last February  on suspicion of offering 10 million yen in bribes to a city  assembly member in Tsukuga, Ibaraki Prefecture, in a bid to win  an order for construction of a waste disposal facility.    The company also was reported to have offered bribes to  local  government officials in Niihama, Ehime Prefecture, and Gojo,  Nara Prefecture, in connection with the construction of waste  disposal and water treatment facilities.</p>

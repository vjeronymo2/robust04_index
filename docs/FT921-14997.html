			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / German Bunds: Outbreak of optimism drives yields down AT LAST, the yield on the 10-year long bund has fallen from the 8.25 to 8.5 per cent range in which it was stuck for the latter half of last year. A wave of buying from overseas before and after Christmas has driven the yield to just below 8 per cent, with enthusiasts predicting that it will reach 7.5 per cent by the middle of the year. Paradoxically, the catalyst was the Bundesbank's decision to raise each of the discount and Lombard rates by a full half a percentage point to 8.5 and 9.75 per cent respectively. The increase was denounced as 'going overboard' by international and domestic observers alike. But fixed-income investors were pleased. 'A clear consensus has emerged that we have already reached the peak for short-term interest rates for the current year,' says Mr Mark Houghton-Berry, executive director in charge of fixed income activities at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, explaining international investors' response to the highest German interest rates in 50 years. 'They believe that they should not wait for rates to fall, but should buy bunds now.' Part of the attraction is that bunds offer significantly higher yields than US Treasury bills. Equally, international investors have been drawn in on the assumption that the Bundesbank's resolute display of monetary rectitude just before Christmas will be enough to put an end to the build-up of inflationary pressures in the German economy. Consumer price inflation reached an annual rate of 4.1 per cent in December and is expected to rise to 4.7 per cent in March. Labour cost inflation is running at over 7 per cent and the Bundesbank must be hoping that the rate move will frighten German unions into accepting reasonable settlements in the 1992 wage round. By reasonable the Bundesbank may mean below 5 per cent. Investors are assuming that the strategy will work, and that after settlements are finalised in April, the Bundesbank will be in a position to bring rates down again. Taking into consideration the slowdown of the German economy, consumer price inflation could be down to 3 per cent by the end of the year. These are all reasons why bunds should move into a new trading range - with yields fluctuating between 7.6 and 7.9 per cent in during the first quarter. At present, as Mr Dieter Wermuth of Caisse des Depots in Frankfurt puts it: 'Buying bunds is the only game in town,' - with the caveat that the game is played mainly by non-domestic investors. For capital gains to be anything other than precarious or short-lived, German investors must buy too - and there is no incentive for them to do so when yields on overnight money and three month-deposits are significantly higher than those on 10-year bunds. One other factor could dislodge the favourable outlook: increasing instability in the former Soviet Union. International investors attitudes to Germany are likely to change dramatically if troubles in the east escalate in some as yet imponderable way - and bund yields may go back up again.</p>

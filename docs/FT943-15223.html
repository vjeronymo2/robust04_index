			<p>940711 FT  11 JUL 94 / Curb on food adverts is urged Advertisements for fatty and sugary foods should be banned from children's television, the National Food Alliance campaigning group says today in submissions to the Independent Television Commission and the Advertising Standards Authority. The call comes as the group publishes the results of a poll conducted by MORI which indicates that two-thirds of parents want to see tougher restrictions on food advertising. Three-quarters of parents think that food adverts do not encourage children to eat a healthy, balanced diet, said the alliance. The survey was carried out among 633 parents of children under the age of 15. Nearly half said their children persuaded them to buy advertised foods or drinks which they would not otherwise have bought. The National Food Alliance is an umbrella group of more than 50 organisations including the British Dental Association, the National Farmers' Union and the Trades Union Congress. The submissions include proposals that: Advertisements for fatty and sugary foods should be banned when large numbers of children are likely to be viewing. Advertising should provide more balanced nutrition messages. The use of misleading or meaningless claims such as 'full of goodness' or 'wholesome' should be prohibited.</p>

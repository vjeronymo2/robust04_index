			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / The Queens's Awards for Export Achievement 1993: Valuable paper-chase - Harrison &amp; Sons / high security printing HARRISON &amp; Sons, one of the world's oldest high security printers, has been literally cashing in on the death of communism. The firm, whose roots go back to the 16th century, has been putting its skills at the disposal of newly freed countries which want passports, currency and other sophisticated documentation both for practical purposes and to flaunt their independence. Harrison, based at High Wycombe, never names its customers unless its clients want them to do so. But Jeff Stuart, chief executive, confirms the receipt of orders from 'about four' of the 15 former Soviet members of the Commonwealth of Independent States, including the newly emergent Moslem countries of Central Asia. These and other new orders have underpinned the 70 per cent of its Pounds 65m a year turnover which is accounted for by exports to about 150 countries. Harrison, part of Lonrho since 1979, is one of two British firms, and one of only eight in the world, which supply the full range of high security printing, including bank notes, travellers cheques, passports and identity cards. Delarue, the other, is the biggest in the world - it recently won the contract for the new Estonian passport. Canada too bosts two high security printers and there are one each in the US, Germany, Holland and France. These eight companies compete to supply the 10 per cent of banknotes not produced by the world's 69 State printing works. The market for the private firms has expanded due to the freeing of the countries of Eastern Europe, previously reliant on state printers in the Soviet Union, East Germany and Hungary. Developments in the east added 3.5bn banknotes to the 7.5bn previously supplied by private printers. The US Banknote Company is supplying the new Lithuanian currency. The German firm, Devrient of Munich, has taken over the former East German state printer. Harrison has won orders in Poland and is believed to have already supplied currency to CIS countries which want their own alternatives to the Russian rouble, still widely circulating in the former USSR, and the new Russian Federation Rouble. Harrison's expanding sales, says Stuart, are due only partly to the collapse of Soviet communism. In the early 1980s it embarked on a strategic expansion plan as a result of which it had the capacity to meet the new demand once it materialised. This capacity includes not only sophisticated machinery but the skills of its designers and engravers, which are the creative spearhead of its 750-strong workforce. In spite of the economic difficulties in the post-Communist countries, Stuart has no concern about doing business with them. All Harrison's new customers had been scrupulous in backing their orders by international letters of credit confirmed on a European bank. Harrison &amp; Sons was founded in 1750, but traces its ancestry to a 16th century bible printer, whose original imprint is still used. Soon after it was established, Harrison &amp; Sons was entrusted to print the London Gazette for the British Government, in which, fittingly, its latest Queen's Award was published. It no longer prints the Gazette, but still works for the Government as the supplier of more than 90 per cent of all postage stamps. One of its presses consumes 30,000 miles of paper a year.</p>

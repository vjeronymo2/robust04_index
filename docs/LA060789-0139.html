			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> VALLEY PHONE SERVICE 'SWITCHED' OFF  </P> <P> Long-distance telephone service to and from the San Fernando Valley and  surrounding areas was disrupted for several hours today when a switch failed at  a phone center in Sherman Oaks, officials of AT&amp;T said.  </P> <P> The 8:30 a.m. equipment failure cut service to AT&amp;T long-distance customers  in the 818, 805 and portions of the 213 area codes, said Kelly Williams, a  spokeswoman for the company. She said the affected areas apparently included  the San Gabriel Valley, West Los Angeles, the Santa Clarita Valley and Ventura  County.  </P> <P> Williams declined to reveal the number of customers affected "for proprietary  reasons." She said service was restored when computerized equipment rerouted  calls to other circuits. By noon, fewer than 10% of long-distance calls from  those areas were not going through the first time, she said.  </P> <P> Some business customers reported they were completely without service for more  than two hours during what is normally the busiest part of their day. "It's  caused a hell of a problem because we do everything by phone," said Wade  Ambrose, a broker with Jones and Associates in Westlake Village. "We were out  of business. Our customers couldn't reach us and we couldn't reach them. This  has cost us multiples of thousands of dollars."  </P></p>

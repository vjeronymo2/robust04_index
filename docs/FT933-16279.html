			<p>930705 FT  05 JUL 93 / German chambers 'have more staff' CHAMBERS of commerce in Britain have only a fraction of the resources available to their German counterparts, a study published today shows. British chambers have only one fifteenth of the resources of German chambers on average, while staff numbers are just one sixth of German levels. This means UK chambers often offer a far narrower range of services. In spite of their limited resources the British chambers have lower unit costs and they are more commercial in their approach to the needs of business, the study says. Chambers of Commerce.

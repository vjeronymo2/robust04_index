			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Stepan Romanchuk: "Ukraine Was the Big Loser in </F> the Elections"]    [Text] Contrary to the bold statements made by the leaders  of the Ukrainian National Democracy, the democrats suffered a  stunning defeat in the 1994 elections. The Rukh faction in the  parliament has now been reduced from 60 to 28 persons, the  Democratic Party went from 30 down to 5 persons, and only the  URP [Ukrainian Republican Party] maintained a stable number of 9  persons. However, the left-wingers are celebrating a clear  victory. Whereas in the old parliament the left-wing portion of  the political spectrum was represented by the ideologically  vague "Group 239," nowadays we have 118 precisely oriented party  deputies (from the KPU [Communist Party of Ukraine], SPU  [Socialist Party of Ukraine], and SelPU [Peasants' Party of  Ukraine]) plus an unknown number of non-party persons.    Having received a push in the Donets Basin, the left-wing  wave rolled all the way to Kiev, where--even though an absolute  majority of the voters did cast their ballots for the  democrats--only 5 of their deputies out of 23 were elected. The  reasons why the National Democrats lost at least 16 seats in the  capital have become evident following an analysis of the results  of the second round of balloting. In Kiev elections took place  only in those districts where there were political contests  between candidates. In those places where two representatives of  the National Democracy were contesting a seat, or where  democrats were running against members of the UNA [Ukrainian  Assembly] the left-wing voters ignored the elections. The split  between the "Ukrayina" bloc, which includes Rukh pro forma, and  Rukh itself, which decided to play its own election  game--placing the party principle above all else--together with  a 50-percent rate of visiting election wards, worked to the  advantage of the communists' successful tactics with regard to  disrupting the elections. The great amounts of money spent by  Rukh in printing up posters with pictures of its candidates in  the second round of balloting (candidates which the people  called the "blue team" because of the color of the paper used)  and on distributing them by the state services did not justify  themselves: In 21 districts only 3 Rukh persons were elected,  and--judging by the political circumstances--they would have won  anyway, even without the above-mentioned posters (their  opponents were communists).    The struggle for Kiev's seats will be continued in the  runoff  elections, which--most likely--will be held in the autumn. The  National Democrats in the new parliament will attempt to alter  the electoral law in such a way as to reduce the 50-percent  barrier of voter attendance and the 25-percent quota for  determining a winner. The left-wing faction--not being  interested in the Kiev representation--will act as quickly as  possible to prevent changes in the above-mentioned law, basing  their arguments on the position that a precedent must not be  allowed whereby a single Supreme Council is to be elected by two  different legislative norms. Therefore, unless Rukh revises its  principle of "One's own party is closest to one's own skin"  prior to the runoff elections, we can anticipate a new  disruption of the elections in Kiev. And that would mean a new  victory for the communists' tactics.    The National Democratic leaders' habit of palming off their  defeats as victories (in the case of the past elections as well  as in the case of their unsuccessful attempt to conduct a  referendum on a pre-term re-election of the parliament in  December 1992) could play a bad joke on them and on the entire  state. The communists evidently will strive to reinforce their  own success and will press for holding the presidential  elections also on 26 June. They will either put up their own  candidate or else support Kuchma's candidacy for the post of  chief of state. But if these elections do not take place, or if  a president is not elected (realistically speaking, the  candidacies of Kravchuk, Plyushch, and Kuchma have approximately  equal chances, whereas the candidacies of Chornovol, Lukyanenko,  and Yukhnovskyy cannot be viewed as serious), this will provide  grounds for the left-wing faction to attempt to abolish the post  of president. Without a doubt, the communists--together with  their left-wing allies and the Kuchma-Hrynyov faction--will  bring up the question of forming an economic and political union  with Russia and federalizing Ukraine. A hundred deputies from  the non-party "party of power" will obviously support them  because they lean toward whatever side is the strongest. The  "struggle for the party of power," which has been proclaimed by  the Rukh leaders, seems to be lost ahead of time.    The results of the 1994 elections signify not only a  communist revenge; they also threaten the very existence of the  Ukrainian state. And--analogously to this--the fact that the new  parliament has lasted for three or four years, despite numerous  attempts to overthrow it. The tactics of the National Democracy  have failed utterly, and it is extremely important that its  leaders come to understand and acknowledge this. And they must  revise the strategy of their own political activities in  accordance with this. For one can be a radical, a liberal,  a fighter for justice, as well as a buffoon on the political  stage; but to leave power in alien hands is dangerous for  Ukraine and for its citizens. Nor do childish games in the  "blue team" and lists of candidates from variegated parties  create grounds for anticipating that power will someday pass  into the democrats' hands.</p>

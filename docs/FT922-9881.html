			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Signs of hope amid the ashes of destruction: Mr Peter Ueberroth, who will direct the rebuilding of Los Angeles after last week's riots, faces a daunting task Inside Messiah Baptist Church, a few blocks from the burned out liquor stores on Crenshaw in South-Central Los Angeles, the Reverend Kenneth Flowers called upon his special guests to rise. More than 50 white men, women and children from Temple Israel in Hollywood, as well as 'Brother Barber from London', stood up to applause. The Gospel choir struck up again, and the Reverend Flowers appealed to the Lord ('You're still on the Throne, you're still in charge') to bless his ravaged city. Few Jews have ventured into the inner city since the race riots in Watts in 1965 sent them fleeing to north Hollywood and the San Fernando Valley. But last week's looting spread to these supposedly safe white enclaves, claiming the life of one of the synagogue's own members and encouraging both black and white to join together in mutual solidarity and grief. The healing and reconciliation took place in dozens of churches last Sunday as Los Angeles braced itself for the awesome task of rebuilding the city shaken by three days of rioting which cost up to 49 lives, Dollars 500m in property damage, and as many as 10,000 businesses destroyed. The random violence is a sledgehammer blow to a city which has regarded itself with pride as the multi-racial metropolis of the future. Amid the uneasy weekend calm, there were hopeful signs. Young people of all races marched with brooms, shovels, and paint brushes to clean up the rubble and the pervasive gang graffiti in the barrios. The relief effort was equally impressive. At Pastor Cecil Murray's First AME Church, home of the oldest black congregation in Los Angeles, volunteers worked round the clock to distribute food and clothing to riot victims. After two decades of neglect, the local community remains suspicious. The big question is whether the city's leaders will tackle the deep rooted and economic problems which provided the tinder  - if not the spark of the Rodney King trial verdict  - that ignited last week's explosion. Much will depend on Mr Peter Ueberroth, the man appointed by Mayor Tom Bradley to head the recovery. Mr Ueberroth managed the highly successful 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games; and has a reputation as a trouble shooter who is fast on the draw. Mr Ueberroth intends to form a non-profit organisation this week which will move quickly,with the creation of jobs being a top priority. He has already made clear he expects help from companies in the US and abroad, suggesting at a news conference on Saturday that Japanese investors will be pursued aggressively. In Mr Ueberroth's own words, the emphasis will be on a public-private sector partnership which could be a blueprint for revitalising inner cities across the US. At times the blond haired Mr Ueberroth looks and sounds like Mr Heseltine touring Toxteth in 1981 after the Liverpool riots. So what are his chances of success? At this stage, it is a good deal easier to identify the obstacles, many of which are typical of virtually all of America's major cities. These have declined inexorably in the face of the suburban exodus, a shrinking tax base, and a sharp drop in federal support in the 1980s. The withdrawal of federal funds amounts to a conscious decision on the part of the Reagan/Bush administration determined to wean the cities off the support which grew out of President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society  - the battery of welfare and other social programmes designed to lift minorities, predominantly blacks, out of poverty. These programmes fostered the growth of a black middle class which gratefully accepted the public service jobs on offer and, in many cases, joined the white flight to the suburbs; but increasingly black and white experts have argued that these programmes not only failed to alleviate poverty, they reinforced the culture of dependency among blacks and may even have encouraged a violent 'counter culture' dominated by drugs, gangs, unsafe sex and the Aids virus. Mr Joel Kotkin, an expert on urban politics in California and Fellow at the Petterdine School of Business and Management, estimates that black participation in the labour force in Los Angeles is the lowest of any ethnic group, roughly one third less than that of Latinos and Asians. African-Americans have the lowest rate of two-parent families, with young females three times more dependent on welfare and nearly twice as likely to give birth to drug-addicted babies than their Latino or Asian counterparts. These statistics suggest that only a comprehensive approach involving education, health care and economic incentives has any chance of success. So far, however, reaction among most black leaders, including the Rev Jesse Jackson, has focused on appeals to the federal government to provide jobs and affordable housing for blacks. Miss Linda Wong, executive director of the Achievement Council in Los Angeles has long worked to improve relations between black and other ethnic minorities. She says the old civil rights approach of the 1960s is fatally flawed. Despite the apparent similarity between black outrage in Watts in 1965 and South-Central Los Angeles in 1992, there are significant differences which require radical new thinking on the part of local and national leaders, Miss Wong argues. According to this analysis, the inner city problem can no longer be reduced to a black issue alone; it encompasses Koreans, central Americans, Mexicans, and other latinos, most of whom were not present in South Central LA in the 1960s. Second, the federal government is simply not equipped financially to deal with the inner cities on the grand scale pursued by President Johnson until the Vietnam war. Nor is the state government which this year faces a Dollars 10bn budget deficit and is already cutting higher education and other social services to the bone. 'The private sector must be involved,' says Miss Wong. Yet all the evidence of the past 20 years is that the private sector has abandoned the inner city in favour of downtown Los Angeles. Local agencies have offered hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to corporations to invest in Mayor Bradley's dream of creating a gleaming gateway to the Pacific rim for American and Asian businesses alike. Mr Ueberroth's challenge will be to shift these priorities, to discover new leaders in the Asian and Latino community and to negotiate the rivalries between the city council, the county board of supervisors and the mayor himself who at 74 tenaciously clings to power. But succeed he must. For Los Angeles, with its ethnic diversity coupled with the relative decline in numbers in its white population, offers a foretaste of the future for the rest of the US. Failure would raise the spectre of a society hopelessly divided on class, race and ethnic lines, a glimpse of which millions of Americans caught on their television screens in the last few days.</p>

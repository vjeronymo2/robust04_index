			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Rifkind outlines curb on Trident MR MALCOLM RIFKIND, defence secretary, yesterday confirmed plans to limit the firepower of Trident strategic missile submarines but refused to give details of planned armament levels. Trident's total explosive power would be 'not much changed' from Polaris, he said. He set a ceiling of 96 nuclear warheads per submarine, however, twice the maximum number on Polaris boats. In a keynote speech on nuclear policy in London he said the actual number deployed could be 'significantly fewer' than 96. Previously the maximum was set at 128 warheads per submarine - eight for each of 16 Trident missiles. The new policy 'should lay to rest comments and speculation about Trident representing a major growth in the size of the UK's nuclear armoury,' Mr Rifkind added. When Trident was fully in service the UK's nuclear stockpile would be 25 per cent lower than in 1990, he said. He denied that financial considerations influenced the decision and said savings would be 'very modest indeed' compared with the Pounds 10bn overall cost of the Trident programme. He did not believe the change would directly affect jobs among the 6,700 employees of the Aldermaston-based Atomic Weapons Establishment. But the recent abandonment of plans to develop a new air-launched missile would bring 'a change of focus' there. Mr Rifkind also made the clearest statement to date of government support for a comprehensive treaty banning nuclear tests. The UK was ready 'to participate fully and constructively' in negotiations to secure a ban, he said. The proposed ban, regarded by some scientists as threatening the UK's capacity to design nuclear weapons, is seen as an important gesture by the nuclear powers in their effort to secure renewal of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1995. Mr Rifkind said Britain would press for an indefinite extension of the treaty, designed to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Although complete disarmament was 'a desirable ultimate goal', Mr Rifkind said it was essential for Britain to keep full-scale strategic nuclear arms and less potent sub-strategic weapons. Trident would be adapted to fulfil both both functions. Mr Rifkind, who emphasised growing nuclear co-operation with France, said Nato should not abandon the right to use nuclear weapons first in a crisis.</p>

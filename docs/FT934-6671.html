			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / World Trade News: VW and Thyssen join Vietnam queue Volkswagen and steelmaker Thyssen of Germany have made a joint proposal to make cars and components in Vietnam, Reuter reports from Hanoi. Vietnam's heavy industry minister, Mr Tran Lum, said Renault, Peugeot, Mercedes-Benz, Chrysler, General Motors, Toyota and Mitsubishi had also shown interest. South Korea's Daewoo is also understood to have made proposals. Vietnam has three motor plants - a Japanese-South Korean company assembling four-wheel-drive cars, a joint venture between Mekong and Fiat's Iveco making trucks and buses, and a Philippine-Vietnamese concern making Mazdas and Kias. Mr Martin Posth, VW board member responsible for Asia, said the plan was to start by manufacturing about 2,000 semi-knockdown cars a year, then start construction of complete knockdown cars. Local content would increase and workers would get more advanced training.</p>

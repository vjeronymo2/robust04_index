			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> IT'S IN REPLY TO HIS 'DEAR MIKE' LETTER;  </P> <P> VAN DE KAMP GETS 'DEAR JOHN' LETTER  </P> <P> Atty. Gen. John Van de Kamp apparently knows that Dana Point City Councilman  Mike Eggers is a magnetic figure in South Orange County politics.  </P> <P> In a recent "Dear Mike" letter to Eggers, Van de Kamp sought to enlist him in  his bid for the Democratic nomination for governor. "You and I have worked  together for years within the Democratic Party to advance our common agenda. .  . . " Van de Kamp wrote.  </P> <P> Oops!  </P> <P> Eggers, a lifelong Republican, is also the full-time district aide of  Republican U.S. Rep. Ron Packard, who represents South Orange County and North  San Diego County in Congress.  </P> <P> Eggers said on Friday that he guffawed over Van de Kamp's letter, then  dispatched a reply. Eggers' tongue-in-cheek response said, "I never realized  that I have worked so closely with you or the Democratic Party or that we  shared a common agenda, especially in light of the fact that I've never met  you. . . . "  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's campaign headquarters in Los Angeles acknowledged that it had  goofed with the letter to Eggers. "We were seeking endorsements around the  state, and when you do a mailing like that, things like this happen," said  Jonas Hanelin, a Van de Kamp campaign aide.  </P> <P> The letter to Eggers said that Van de Kamp's polls show him leading Pete Wilson  among voters likely to turn out next year in the gubernatorial election.  Wilson, a Republican from San Diego and a U.S. senator, is the odds-on favorite  to win the GOP nomination for governor in 1990.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp's letter to Eggers continued: "More and more people agree that I  can beat Pete Wilson and become our state's next governor. I'm writing to ask  you to join them by endorsing my candidacy."  </P> <P> Eggers' response, in effect, told Van de Kamp not to hold his breath. Eggers'  letter noted that Packard and Wilson have been good friends "for many, many  years."  </P> <P> Eggers' letter added: "All this brings to mind that classic line from the movie  'Cool Hand Luke' when the warden said, 'What we have here is a failure to  communicate.' I can only assume that is the case, although I'm sure some  computer list or, worse yet, inexperienced campaign volunteer will be blamed  for all this.  </P> <P> "With that in mind, John, I am returning your campaign endorsement card  unsigned. As you might expect, a campaign donation check is not in the mail."  </P></p>

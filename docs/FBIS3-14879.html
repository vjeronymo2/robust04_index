Despite Moscow's indifference to the  elections and referendum in Ingushetia and the fact that it  provided no money from the budget to pay for them, the required  billion rubles, according to Batyr Taldiyev, chairman of the  republican district electoral commission, had been found in the  republic's coffers.    Seventy-five polling stations opened at 0800 that Sunday  morning where 105,000 voters (without taking into account the  Ingush people who came from North Ossetia during the  Ossetia-Ingushetia armed conflict) came to express their will.    The Ingushetia presidency was contested by current President  Ruslan Aushev and Bamatgirey Mankiyev, a former state farm  director. According to preliminary data, Ruslan Aushev won by a  landslide. This had not been doubted in principle if one thinks  about the small artillery preparation for the presidential  elections two weeks ago in which Ruslan Aushev declined to run  for the presidency, saying that his motive was his unwillingness  "to bear responsibility for a repeat escalation of tensions  owing to the ineptness of some politicians," because, in his  view, "the current policy would lead to a new flare-up of the  Ossetia-Ingushetia conflict this April or May." The Ingush  president has lately been sharply critical of the Russian  Federation temporary administration in the Ossetia-Ingushetia  conflict zone because, he thinks, it puts the brakes on the  implementation of Boris Yeltsin's edict on a phased return of  Ingush refugees to four population centers of North Ossetia's  Prigorodnyy Rayon. In the wake of the president's dramatic  statement, the majority of eligible Ingush voters unanimously  decided, as a snap poll showed, that Ruslan Aushev "cannot be  excused from the president's post, and he cannot go against the  will of the people." He collected 70,000 votes in his support.    Ruslan Aushev voted yesterday for the republic's draft  constitution and for 27 deputies for parliament. Mr. Aushev did  not vote for president and vice president, thinking that "voting  for himself is unethical."    The new president is to meet soon with the head of North  Ossetia. The question of a possible meeting had already been  taken up at the experts level. True, negotiations about the  return of Ingush refugees to North Ossetia's Prigorodnyy Rayon  would hardly be a simple matter because North Ossetia President  Akhsarbek Galazov, who had the idea for the meeting, stated that  the problem of normalization of relations between the republics  is being forced into a blind alley in which one of the sides  (implying the North Ossetia side) is being pressured.</p>

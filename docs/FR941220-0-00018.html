			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements governing skilled nursing care contradict the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current principles contained in the Medicare HHA Manual.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We disagree. The requirements of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section are based on section 205.1(A) of the Medicare HHA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual, which is entitled ``General Principles Governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reasonable and Necessary Skilled Nursing Care.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of this rule closely reflect the manual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions and in many ways are identical.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter suggested that this section be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised to include a reference to the skilled nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of 42 CFR 409.33, which provides examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled nursing care for purposes of Medicare coverage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> posthospital skilled nursing facility care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  We agree and have added a cross-reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to paragraphs (a) and (b) of &sect;409.33.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One commenter stated that this section should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specify that teaching and training are covered skilled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nursing services. Another commenter stated that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section should specifically note that the management and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> evaluation of a care plan is a covered skilled nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  By adding the cross-reference explained in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the previous response, &sect;409.44 now incorporates the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> description of skilled nursing care contained in &sect;409.33.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 409.33 includes patient education services and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management and evaluation of a care plan as examples of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> skilled nursing care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters expressed concern about  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare's policy that a service that can safely and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effectively be performed by the average nonmedical person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> without the supervision of a licensed nurse cannot be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered a skilled nursing service. The commenters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically disagreed with the preamble's example of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonskilled service that described a patient who could not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> self-administer eye drops that are normally self-administrable. The commenters believed that the absence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a caregiver to administer the eyedrops made the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administration of the eyedrops a skilled service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Our policy that a nonskilled service does  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not become a skilled service simply because there is no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> competent person to perform it is intended to protect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare from paying skilled personnel (at a skilled rate)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for furnishing nonskilled services. In the example  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> described above, the absence of a caregiver to administer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the eyedrops does not make their administration a skilled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service. Therefore, this rule at &sect;409.44(b)(1)(iv) states  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that ``if the service could be performed by the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nonmedical person, the absence of a competent person to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> perform it does not cause it to be a skilled nursing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service.'' This clear statement represents no change from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the longstanding Medicare policy that is currently contained  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Medicare HHA Manual at &sect;205.1(A)(2) and (B)(4)(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Several commenters requested clarification of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare coverage of skilled nursing care following cataract  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surgery.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Medicare coverage of skilled nursing care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished to beneficiaries who have recently undergone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cataract surgery is based on the same policies governing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare home health coverage of skilled nursing care  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> furnished to any beneficiary. If, for example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> patient's unique medical condition is such that the skills  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a nurse are required to observe and assess his or her  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition or furnish additional teaching of a medication  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regimen or safety precautions, these services would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered. It is important to note, however, that the routine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> initial teaching of post-cataract medication administration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and post-operative safety precautions that is needed by any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual having cataract surgery is routinely furnished by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ophthalmologists as part of their care of cataract patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, it is not considered reasonable and necessary for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a HHA to duplicate such services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

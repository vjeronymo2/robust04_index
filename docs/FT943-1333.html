			<p>940924 FT  24 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Swan Hunter pension example - At a Glance Pensioners who are counting on the government's proposed minimum solvency requirements as insurance that their pension benefits will be paid in full should consider the case of Swan Hunter. The shipyard, now almost certainly facing receivership, has had to tell its members that as much as 40 per cent of their pension entitlement will be lost. The irony is that according to the scheme's actuary, it technically is nearly 100 per cent fully funded as measured by the new solvency requirement.</p>

			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUST WHEN THE RAIDERS START TO WIN AGAIN, FANS END UP BEING LOSERS  </P> <P> Al Davis needs to wake up and realize where he is.  </P> <P> This is Los Angeles, not Oakland. A large portion of the crowd that attends a  Raider game at the Coliseum goes to watch the visiting teams. At last week's  Raider-Steeler game, perhaps 20% of the crowd was made up of Steeler fans. At  $30 a ticket, that is a lot of money to the Raider organization, yet the  Raiders seem content to keep the Coliseum the most inhospitable stadium on the  West Coast, if not the entire country.  </P> <P> CHRIS BURNS, Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LAWMAKERS CALL SESSION A SUCCESS;  </P> <P> WORKERS' COMP, TRANSPORTATION PLAN LISTED AMONG MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS  </P> <P> With the Legislature trying to clean up its image and the governor worried  about his place in history, blurry-eyed state lawmakers adjourned for the year  in the pre-dawn Saturday after having passed enough major bills to assure that  their 1989 session will be considered a success.  </P> <P> "The governor has changed. The Legislature has changed. We're all getting older  and tired of the old-fashioned fight," said veteran Assemblyman Phillip  Isenberg (D-Sacramento), a member of Speaker Willie Brown's inner circle.  </P> <P> Then referring to the GOP governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature,  Isenberg echoed the view of many by adding: "Republicans finally figured out  they are running the state and had better start running it. We figured out we  aren't running the state but could help. . . . It took us six years to figure  out that George Deukmejian is governor and that we are no longer in charge."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Problem-Solving Role  </P> <P> Observed one longtime Republican legislator who did not want to be identified:  "The governor finally became the governor. He was more directed toward  problem-solving than in the past."  </P> <P> Among the Legislature's final acts before recessing until January was passage  of a bill revamping California's $8-billion system for compensating injured  workers. It also passed sweeping legislation aimed at controlling the growth of  solid waste, or garbage.  </P> <P> Both issues had for months been high on the priority lists of Deukmejian and  the Legislature. So their accomplishments, after weeks of delicate negotiations  between the governor and legislative leaders, generally were regarded as  crowning achievements for a session that already had produced a bold plan for  financing new transportation projects and relaxing the tight lid on state and  local government spending.  </P> <P> "I feel like I can go home for the first time in seven years and not have to  apologize for this Legislature's activities," Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-La  Mesa) told a reporter shortly after the lower house quietly adjourned at 3:42  a.m.  </P> <P> Yawning lawmakers did not drag themselves out of the Senate until 4:11 a.m.  "This was an extraordinary session," asserted Senate GOP Leader Ken Maddy of  Fresno. "Think back. It's hard to find another year in which we did more."  </P> <P> Some accomplishments, however, involved only modest steps at best. Passage  early Saturday of a scaled-down bill aimed at providing health care for  uninsured workers fell far short of what had been sought all year by the  measure's author, Speaker Brown (D-San Francisco). "I should be embarrassed to  handle (the bill) on this floor," Brown told his colleagues.  </P> <P> What passage of Brown's bill did illustrate, however, was a new eagerness by  Deukmejian and Brown to compromise in an effort to attain at least half a loaf,  although in this case the Speaker probably got only a quarter.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Veto Likely  </P> <P> But there were exceptions to this conciliatory attitude, including a major one  on the final night when Brown pushed through a bill to provide auto liability  insurance for low-income drivers at only $25 per month. The rub was that the  governor and the Speaker never came to a meeting of minds on this issue and  Brown's victory is expected to be short-lived because Deukmejian very likely  will veto the bill.  </P> <P> This "take-it-or-leave-it" attitude by Democratic leaders -- so prevalent in  past sessions -- was the exception rather than the rule this year on big  issues, however. Deukmejian called it his "most enjoyable year in terms of the  working relationship between myself and the legislative leaders."  </P> <P> There was plenty of motivation on both sides to cooperate and get things done.  Both the governor and the Legislature had been widely criticized -- by business  leaders, academics, local government and the news media -- for alleged lack of  leadership and vision. State government wasn't working, critics said.  Legislating had been relegated to ballot initiatives.  </P> <P> The Legislature especially was feeling the heat because of a drawn-out, highly  publicized FBI investigation into alleged Capitol political corruption.  </P> <P> In this framework, legislators began worrying about voter wrath in the 1990  elections and Deukmejian -- who decided not to seek a third term -- became  acutely concerned about his legacy. Additionally, Brown -- who already had  served as Speaker longer than any predecessor -- began fretting about how he  would be remembered by historians.  </P> <P> "Somebody finally told the governor this year that 'if you want to go down in  the history books, you've got to resolve problems,' " said a Deukmejian  supporter, who asked not to be identified. "And he began kind of enjoying it  (problem-solving)."  </P> <P> Many legislators of both parties said the Capitol political climate changed for  the better when Deukmejian announced he would not run for reelection. Democrats  no longer considered him a long-term threat -- the positive flip side to being  a weakened lame duck. The governor basically agreed Saturday: "Once I announced  (retirement), Democratic lawmakers could feel a little more comfortable in  working with me."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No 'Political Handlers'  </P> <P> One influential Republican legislator, who asked for anonymity, added this  observation: "Deukmejian's not running for reelection and therefore everything  doesn't have to be run by his political handlers."  </P> <P> Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights), a veteran legislative insider who  helped negotiate the transportation package, said the improved Capitol  atmosphere resulted from "a combination of factors -- a sense that the state's  not moving ahead, the infrastructure is deteriorating, the vision of California  is becoming clouded. Everybody came to that realization about the same time.  And the FBI investigation obviously motivated the Legislature to do something."  </P> <P> One thing the Legislature did do on the final night of the session was to  approve a broad ethics package aimed at curbing special-interest influence --  but also paving the way for a substantial pay raise in return for banning  honorariums and limiting gifts. "It's going to be viewed as curious to the  public that in response to an ethics crisis we voted ourselves a salary  increase," Assemblyman Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said during the floor  debate.  </P> <P> Reflecting on the determination of both branches of government to chalk up some  major accomplishments, Senate GOP Leader Maddy said: "It was a matter of  timing. The governor was ripe for doing something. And there was the dynamics  of Willie (Brown) wanting to be 'a policy-maker.' "  </P> <P> For Brown, this was a year he tried to discard his image as a political  wheeler-dealer and turn to the business of solving the state's problems. Many  believe he took some significant steps, but images are difficult to redraw --  especially for a political animal like Brown.  </P> <P> Anyway, one person's "achievement" usually is another's "setback," especially  on controversial issues. Gun control is a prime example.  </P> <P> The Legislature, supported strongly by Deukmejian, last spring voted to ban  semiautomatic assault rifles -- a move seen by most Californians as a laudable  achievement, according to the polls. But many gun groups bitterly saw this as a  setback and never quit lobbying the Legislature as it debated additional bills  to control firearms.  </P> <P> As lobbyists for the National Rifle Assn. stood as political sentries outside  the chamber, two gun control bills died on the Assembly floor shortly before  adjournment Saturday. One would have limited "banana clips" and other rifle  ammunition magazines to 15 rounds each. The other would have required  inexperienced handgun purchasers to complete a two-day course in firearms  safety.  </P> <P> Another 11th-hour failure -- in the eyes of many -- was the inability of the  Legislature and the governor to agree on a $147-million supplemental budget  package, including $24 million for family planning. It got hung up on demands  by Deukmejian and GOP lawmakers for new language forbidding use of the family  planning funds for anything that might smack of assisting abortion.  </P> <P> According to knowledgeable sources, Democrats decided not to wage an all-out  fight over the issue, preferring instead to blame Republicans for killing  family planning programs and thereby gain a political issue. They also realized  they can take up the issue again in January when the Legislature convenes the  second half of its two-year session.  </P> <P> For a while, Deukmejian was trying to use the $147-million budget package as a  bargaining chip for a prison labor program he badly wanted. But he gave up  Friday night and tentatively decided to try to place a prisons job initiative  on the November, 1990, ballot.  </P> <P> The Legislature also did nothing during the session to help implement  Proposition 103, the 1988 ballot measure that tightened regulation of the  insurance industry.  </P> <P> But the governor and lawmakers, after long negotiation, agreed on how to  implement Proposition 99 and spend its $600 million per year in new tobacco tax  revenue. Most of the money will go to county hospitals, emergency centers and  health programs for the indigent.  </P> <P> </P> <P> LEGISLATIVE SESSION HIGHLIGHTS  </P> <P>  As the Legislature headed for adjournment of its 1989 session early Saturday  morning, lawmakers groped to resolve a number of major issues. The following is  a summary of what the issues were and what happened to the legislation.  </P> <P> THE ISSUE: WORKERS' COMPENSATION -- An effort to overhaul California's troubled  $8-billion system for compensating injured workers included two bills that  would increase the maximum temporary disability benefits by 50% over two years  and boost permanent disability payments by 7.5%. The measures also would  implement changes aimed at speeding up the system, improving the effectiveness  of vocational rehabilitation and restricting the ability of injured workers and  employers to shop around for medical evaluations that best suit their purposes  in a disputed claim.  </P> <P> THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- A two-house conference committee worked out  last-minute differences on one of the bills, by Assemblyman Burt Margolin  (D-Los Angeles), which then breezed through both houses. The measure won with a  34-0 vote in the Senate and 65-2 tally in the Assembly. The companion bill by  Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) also won easy approval, with a 68-0 vote in the  Assembly, which sent it to the Senate for a quick 36-0 approval of amendments.  The measures now go to the governor for his signature.  </P> <P> THE ISSUE: LEGISLATIVE ETHICS -- Under a cloud because of an FBI probe of  political corruption in the Capitol, lawmakers have been considering a number  of measures that would reform the way legislative business is conducted. The  keystone of the ethics package is a constitutional amendment that would bar  legislators from accepting honorariums, impose a limit on gifts and prohibit  lawmakers from lobbying for one year after they leave office. It would also set  up an independent commission to set their salary -- a move that could mean a  doubling of the present level of $40,816 a year.  </P> <P> THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- The constitutional amendment by Senate President Pro  Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) passed on lopsided votes, 33 to 3 in the  Senate and 68 to 7 in the Assembly and will be placed on the June, 1990,  ballot.  </P> <P> THE ISSUE: GUN CONTROL -- After a successful effort earlier in the session to  ban the sale of many semiautomatic weapons in response to the killing of five  children in a Stockton schoolyard, legislators considered several other  proposals to regulate the sale and use of guns. One measure would require a  two-day course in gun safety and proper storage before a handgun could be  purchased. A second bill would limit the capacity of rifle ammunition clips to  15 rounds.  </P> <P> THE OUTCOME: DEFEATED -- In response to intense lobbying by gun owner  organizations, led by the National Rifle Assn., the Assembly refused to pass  both the safety instruction bill by Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-Los Banos) on a  37-31 vote, and the ammunition clip restriction measure by Assemblyman Johan  Klehs (D-Castro Valley), 36 to 32. The bills required 41 votes for passage.  </P> <P> THE ISSUE: SOLID WASTE -- With local governments beginning to run out of room  to bury trash, lawmakers worked with Gov. George Deukmejian on several measures  designed to cut in half the amount of garbage trucked to landfills by the year  2000. With an emphasis on recycling, the proposals would establish a full-time  state solid waste management board with broad powers. Critics objected that the  plan would encourage the use of incinerators to meet trash reduction goals and  complained about the composition of the board.  </P> <P> THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- The most far-reaching of the solid waste bills, a  measure by Assemblyman Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), was approved 22 to 15 in  the Senate and quickly sent to the Assembly, which voted 42 to 25 to accept  Senate amendments. The measure now goes to the governor, who is expected to  sign it.  </P> <P> THE ISSUES: FAMILY PLANNING, MENTAL HEALTH FUNDING, PRISONS -- A bill that  would appropriate $146 million for a variety of state and local government  programs became embroiled in a controversy over whether state family planning  funds were being used to promote abortions. The measure was also linked to  negotiations over a contentious Deukmejian plan to permit private industry to  contract with the state. At stake in the debate was the restoration of $24  million for family planning programs that had been vetoed earlier by the  governor. But the same measure included funds for other programs, including $25  million for mental health services.  </P> <P> THE OUTCOME: DELAYED UNTIL NEXT YEAR -- The Assembly on a 51-24 vote rejected a  compromise bill that would have prevented the use of family planning funds for  abortions. The measure required 54 votes for passage, two-thirds of the  80-member Assembly. And the governor's prison measure remained bottled up in an  Assembly committee. As a result, the $146-million appropriation bill by  Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa Clara) was never taken up on the Senate  floor and must now wait for consideration until January, when the Legislature  returns.  </P> <P> THE ISSUE: AUTO INSURANCE -- Lawmakers nibbled at the problem of the high cost  of automobile insurance with a pair of complementary bills intended to get  uninsured drivers off the road and to help poor people find affordable  insurance. One of the measures would extend the requirement that all California  drivers carry at least a minimum auto insurance policy. The other bill would  require insurance companies to offer a $25-a-month policy to low-income people  -- to single individuals earning $20,000 or less or to families with incomes  below $25,000.  </P> <P> THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- Both the mandatory insurance bill, by Sen. Alan  Robbins (D-Tarzana) and the affordable policy measure, by Assembly Speaker  Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) won last-minute approval in the Senate and  Assembly. The two bills go to the governor, who has said he probably will veto  Brown's bill.  </P> <P> THE ISSUE: HEALTH INSURANCE -- Legislators looked at proposals intended to  provide health insurance for an estimated 2.5 million uninsured California  workers, but could not agree on how to fund it. What did emerge were two bills,  one of which would provide a $300-per-employee tax credit for companies that  offer health insurance to their workers. A second bill creates a task force to  study the idea of requiring businesses to provide such insurance and requires  the Deukmejian Administration to report back by March, 1990, on ways to lower  the cost of such coverage.  </P> <P> THE OUTCOME: APPROVED -- The tax credit bill, by Sen. Barry Keene (D-Benicia),  and the study measure, by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown were both approved by  the Senate and Assembly and now go to the governor for his signature.  </P></p>

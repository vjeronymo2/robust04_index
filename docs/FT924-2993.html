			<p>921210 FT  10 DEC 92 / US Marines make first easy inroads in Somalia IN A convoy of 22 armoured personnel carriers and anti-tank vehicles, more than 200 Marines weighted down with weaponry and dressed in desert fatigues yesterday made a full-scale assault on the wreckage of the former US Embassy compound. Cobra helicopter gunships hovered overhead as the nervous Marines fanned out across the vast Embassy grounds and advanced on the vandalised buildings. US soldiers two years ago had to pluck US diplomats and foreigners from the rooftop to safety as Somalia slipped into anarchy and the US turned its back on its former cold war satellite. On that occasion the Marines faced gunfire, tracer bullets and anti-aircraft flak. Yesterday the only obstacles were cows and goats grazing on the overgrown garden littered with the rusting innards of computers, fax machines and filing cabinets - the debris of repeated looting. At the airport yesterday Marines searched buildings, shouted orders in English at sleeping workers in an airport hangar and forced them to lie face down with their hands spread out on the tarmac. One worker had his left arm in the air bent at right-angles. For several minutes US soldiers shouted at him until a fellow worker explained in broken English that the man's arm was broken. At the port helicopters fired tracer bullets over reporters and port workers as soaked Marines arrived. The US later claimed they had been fired at first. 'They started firing at us on three different occasions. We returned fire,' Captain David Clement, 33, whose Fox company from the Ninth Marines Regiment landed in 18 Zodiac inflatable dinghies. Somali drivers and guards were arrested and had their hands tied behind their backs with plastic handcuffs. Their guns, used to protect their vehicles from bandits, were temporarily confiscated. The Marines were clearly confused and many said they were scared. They dropped boxes of ammunition and other equipment in the first hour of the operation to secure the port, a hub of the relief effort. Later, bandits known as moriyan fired on a vehicle belonging to an aid agency injuring two men. The men's colleagues later blamed the Americans, who they said had confiscated 12 of their guns. Col Fred Peck, the Marine spokesman, yesterday defended the strong-arm tactics. 'We did it to make a point,' he said. 'We are here and we are here for serious business.' Many of the senior Marine officers, like Col Peck, are well acquainted with Somalia's problems but it was clear yesterday that most Marines have a poor understanding of Somalia. 'We didn't know you have to move around the city with gunmen,' one soldier said. While yesterday's lightning operation passed off remarkably successfully, and crowds welcomed the Americans they see as their deliverers, Somalis say the US should proceed sensitively in the coming days. Negotiations with local warlords, so far ignored, will have to proceed smoothly. The experience of the Marines in Lebanon a decade ago ought to provide a cautionary tale. When they first landed in Beirut they were greeted with euphoria as saviours from the warlords and rival militias. As soon as they got bogged in Lebanese politics that euphoria quickly turned to hostility, and 241 Marines returned home in body bags before they evacuated the city. Somalia is not Lebanon. The rival clan-militias are not as heavily armed or motivated. But there are parallels. Even the US flag raised over the embassy yesterday was the same one that flew over the Marine barracks in Beirut.</p>

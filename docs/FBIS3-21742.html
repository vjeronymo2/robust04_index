			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Extravision" newscast] </F>   [Text] Deputy Doris Tijerino said today the U.S. Embassy  does not want the National Assembly plenum to pass the antidrug  law, because it does not include the DEA's collaboration with  the National Police on drug control.    The police and National Assembly commission that prepared  the  draft bill on narcotics, psychotropic substances and so forth  still disagree on certain controversial issues such as whether  the DEA should participate in Nicaraguan drug-trafficking  investigations. Tijerino says the antidrug law should be  educational instead of repressive.    [Begin Tijerino recording] Excessive pressure has been  exerted on the commission to make the law repressive. My  concern is it may repress our youths, a point that is obvious  from the disregard that has been shown for the need to allow the  Nicaraguan Youth Council to work with the National Council.  [end recording]    Commander Leonel Espinoza, of the National Police Narcotics  Department, has said the following:    [Begin Espinoza recording] Every law contains repressive  elements, but this law also calls for a national council that  will design a plan that will also address general preventive  issues such as education, children, and youths; in other words,  the law contemplates the preventive side of the struggle against  drug related crimes, not only the coercive side of it. [end  recording]    Deputy Tijerino says the U.S. Embassy did not want the  plenum  to pass the law. [Begin recording]    Unidentified reporter: Who has come under pressure  and what type?    Tijerino: I have met with David Noble, and I was  informed that before the draft bill was sent to the plenum for  discussion it was delivered to the U.S. Embassy so that the  embassy could say whether it adhered to international  agreements. Mr. Noble asked me, diplomatically, of course, if I  would agree to a withdrawal of the law from debate. This means  U.S. Embassy officials oppose the law, because it does not  guarantee unrestricted activities by organizations such as the  DEA, which promotes police operations against drug trafficking.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, Commander Espinosa has said the following:    [Begin Espinosa recording] I have said openly we will  cooperate with every police force in the world. We believe  certain police organizations have more experience in the  struggle against drug trafficking and more vested interests as  well, but such cooperation is totally fair and normal. [end  recording]    The antidrug law had been stored away for over two years,  and  during the second session of debates progress was made only on  Article Five, which was discussed today for more than three  hours. The law will continue to be discussed at the National  Assembly, and its approval is expected within several weeks.</p>

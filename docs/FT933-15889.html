			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / World Trade News: China on a wing and a prayer - A Hong Kong investor's move to mainland / Foreign Investment 'I WENT to have a look, and there I was standing knee deep in a paddy field talking to the village headman who boasted that his was the best village in China.' On the strength of that, Mr Patrick Wang, managing director of Johnson Electric, one of the world's leading manufacturers of micro-motors, made the most important decision in his company's life. The year was 1982 and the place Shajing, a small rural village in Guangdong prefecture north of Shenzhen. Today in Shajing - which has been transformed from a sleepy rural community to a light industrial town - Johnson produces 90 per cent of its output of micro-motors - motors for electric windows in Volkswagen, General Motors and Chrysler cars and a host of household appliances and power tools. In the space of a decade the Hong Kong-based Johnson has gone from employing a few hundred to 7,000 workers at its Shajing factories. Mr Wang reckons that his prices would have had to be 30 per cent higher if he had stayed in Hong Kong and if he could have found the people to hire - a big if. He says his investment in China has been paid back 'many times over', and points to Johnson's post-tax return on investment of 20 per cent over the past few years. However, investing in Shajing has not been trouble-free. 'We had problems at different stages,' Mr Wang says. 'Initially electricity was not a problem, but as more factories set up in Shajing it became one. There was rationing; so we put in our own power plant. Water was also problem. We were forced to dig our own wells and when they ran dry - because the water table had fallen - we had to dig deeper.' The explosive growth in industrial activity also took its toll on the workforce. Today, Mr Wang says, most of Johnson's original employees, having got rich, have moved elsewhere. The workforce now comes from China's interior and that means having to house them. For most of Johnson's decade in southern China the output of its factories has been destined for foreign markets. This will change after two joint-venture companies it has established begin to turn their attention to the domestic Chinese market. Mr Wang finds himself facing challenges many foreign businessmen meet when trying to sell into the Chinese market. For him, two things stand out: understanding the value of guanxi (connections) and knowing the local language and, if possible, more than one dialect. 'Connections are always useful in China,' he says. 'One gets a lot more information if you know the right people. Access to information is explicitly linked to guanxi networks. Information is held within the network and exploited for profit. 'There will be crackdowns on corruption, but China is China. It's not too different from the way Taiwan was. But it is not something that is out of hand, with no regard to the overall economics of a venture, like it is in Indonesia.' Developing a network is something to which Mr Wang is devoting considerable time. 'I attend shows and technical seminars, use referrals and word of mouth. Also a lot of our customers - such as Volkswagen, General Motors and Chrysler - have operations in China and we can sell to them. You have got to use whatever you have.' He believes that for a western company, cracking the Chinese market is difficult. 'You cannot depend on finding management or administrators in China - they do not exist,' he says. 'Western companies will have to identify managers in their companies who represent the core values of the organisation. If they decided the China market is crucial to them they then have to send them to live in China.'</p>

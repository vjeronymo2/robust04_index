			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WASHED-OUT HIGHWAY MAY BE WASHED UP;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS WANT TO PERMANENTLY CLOSE STRETCH OF CALIFORNIA 39  NEAR CRYSTAL LAKE THAT HAS BEEN BLOCKED BY BOULDERS SINCE 1978.  </P> <P> For years, northbound travelers on California 39 winding into the heart of the  Angeles National Forest have been stopped abruptly by boulders blocking the  road near Crystal Lake.  </P> <P> Since a 1978 rainstorm washed out 500 feet of asphalt and tossed rocks onto the  highway, a 4.4-mile stretch of roadway has been closed. In the meantime, state  transportation officials have been unwilling to spend the estimated $20 million  needed to reopen the San Gabriel Valley's central link to the forest and the  Angeles Crest Highway.  </P> <P> Now Caltrans and U.S. Forest Service officials want to make the road closing  official, taking the unprecedented step of abandoning a part of California 39.  </P> <P> The mile-high section of road with its breathtaking chaparral views 8 1/2 miles  north of Azusa would be given over forever to hikers, mountain bikers and the  forest's estimated 700 big horn sheep.  </P> <P> Other state roads have been closed temporarily before, but they have always  been repaired and reopened at some point, said Wallace J. Rothbart, chief of  Caltrans' project studies branch for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, as he  led a tour of the road Wednesday.  </P> <P> Even the closing won't be cheap: officials estimate that it will cost several  million dollars to remove barriers and shore up the road so it doesn't crumble  into adjacent Bear Creek Canyon.  </P> <P> Although California 39, finished in 1961, once provided easy access to ski  resorts at Mt. Waterman and Kratka Ridge and was a scenic route to Wrightwood,  Caltrans officials say they have heard no complaints about the closing.  </P> <P> "There has been no pressure one way or the other from environmental groups or  business interests to reopen the road," said Don Stikkers, district ranger of  the Forest Service's Mt. Baldy District. "We just feel it . . . needs to get  resolved."  </P> <P> Caltrans will hold a hearing on the closure next Thursday from 4 to 8 p.m. at  the Glendora Library.  </P> <P> Stikkers said considerations include how a permanent closure would affect deer,  bear, the big horn sheep whose migratory path includes the roadway and even  trout that swim in Bear Creek Canyon.  </P> <P> So far, Caltrans has maintained culverts along the closed part and even cleared  small rockslides. "It always has been a maintenance headache," Rothbart said.  </P></p>

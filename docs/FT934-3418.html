			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Nigerian debt arrears hit Dollars 6bn Nigeria's external debt arrears have reached Dollars 6bn (Pounds 4bn) and are expected to rise substantially as weak international oil prices hit the country's main export, western creditors and bankers warned yesterday. Nigeria's most serious economic crisis since independence has deepened since last month's removal of Chief Ernest Shonekan, the civilian leader of the military-backed government, and the fall in the price of Nigeria's Bonny Light crude from a peak Dollars 20 a barrel in early March to the present Dollars 14. The 1993 budget was based on Dollars 17.50 a barrel. The new government, led by Gen Sani Abacha, former defence minister, is split over economic policy, making it hard to agree on the 1994 budget, due to be presented on January 1. Mr Kalu Kalu, new minister of finance, has argued for the budget deficit to be cut, white-elephant projects to be cancelled, and foreign exchange deregulated to allow market rate to be set for the naira, paving the way for a deal with the International Monetary Fund. Others, led by Mr Aminu Saleh, secretary to the government, want more state control and regulation. They want the naira revalued to N15 per dollar (it fetches over N40 on the parallel market) and strengthened by cutting spending. Nigerian private-sector leaders told Gen Abacha yesterday the economy was 'so sick that shock treatment is needed in the 1994 budget before economic recovery and growth can begin'. They outlined conditions to halt capital flight and attract private investment: a balanced budget, low inflation, a stable currency, fuel prices near international levels, tax cuts, reduced bureaucracy, and agreement on a medium-term programme with the IMF leading to external debt relief. Gen Abacha acknowledged mismanagement of the economy by previous regimes but did not outline his own prescription.</p>

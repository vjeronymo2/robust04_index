			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / CAA plans to curb aircraft fees at Manchester Airport THE Civil Aviation Authority yesterday proposed a more rigorous pricing formula for landing and aircraft parking charges at Manchester International Airport as part of its general efforts to hold down UK airport costs and improve airport operators' efficiency. Annual increases in airport charges at Manchester will be capped at 3 percentage points below the rise in the retail price index for the next five years, according to the CAA proposal. The previous five-year formula was RPI  1 point. The CAA proposal follows a similar recommendation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which every five years investigates the charges and activities of UK airports under the 1986 Airports Act. The CAA will decide on the pricing formula for Manchester next month. The regulatory agency last year imposed a tougher formula for the south-east England airports of BAA, the airports operator. After consultations, the formula for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted involved RPI -8 points in the first two years, RPI -4 points in the third year and RPI -1 point in the last two years, giving a weighted annual average of RPI -6 points. On the basis of the MMC's findings, the CAA has asked Manchester Airport to provide more information to users on costs associated with baggage handling, check-in desk charges, other ground handling facilities and the levy on fuel. At least three ground handling agents should offer services in Manchester's Terminal One no later than April 1997, the CAA proposed. At present, there is one agent, a subsidiary company of the airport, which is owned by the county councils of the Manchester area.</p>

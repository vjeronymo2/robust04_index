Negotiations between the Petroleum Authority of  Thailand and Burmese government to buy natural gas from the  Martabang site are expected to be settled this month, said  Maj-Gen Sanan vesterday. The gas project covers two exploratory  plots, M5 and M6, over an area of 26,140 square metres.    France's Total Co Ltd has been developing the site since  1992  with Unocal Myanmar Co holding shares in the company.    "The Burmese side would like to have the minister witness  the  MoU signing after the deal is settled, as far as I know," said  Thai Ambassador to Rangoon Wirasak Futrakun by telephone.    Maj-Gen Sanan said he would also meet privately with Burmese  Forestry Minister Lt-Gen Chit Swe to discuss an extension to the  timeframe during which Thai companies can remove felled logs  still in Burmese territory.</p>

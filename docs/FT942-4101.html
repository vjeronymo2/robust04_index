			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Tonga the featherweight in the central banking stakes Sir, The Central Bank of the Solomon Islands may be a tiddler, as you report (Observer, June 9), but last month I paid a visit both there and to Tonga's central bank to assist with manpower development. I conclude that the National Reserve Bank of Tonga is considerably smaller. Whether you apply the yardstick used by Central Banking magazine staff numbers (NRBT 21, CBSI 61) or compare gross national product (Tonga Dollars 110m, Solomon Islands Dollars 186m) or population covered (Tonga 100,000, Solomons 320,000), the powerhouse of the Pa'Anga comes out a good deal smaller. However, the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands has the best display of shell and feather currency. That's perhaps central banking at its most basic.

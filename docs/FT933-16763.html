			<p>930702 FT  02 JUL 93 / OECD Economic Outlook: Economic activity to expand 'modestly' this year ECONOMIC activity in the industrialised world will expand only modestly this year and unless German interest rates continue to fall rapidly, recovery in Europe will be delayed until late next year. In its half-yearly Economic Outlook published yesterday, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development projects growth of 1.2 per cent for its 24 members this year and a moderate recovery in 1994, but warns that the upturn could easily be upset, especially in continental Europe. Unemployment will continue to rise in virtually all of the member countries and could reach 36m - 8 3/4 per cent of the labour force - in the first half of next year. The good news is that inflation will slow, with many OECD countries experiencing the lowest rates for decades. If the opportunity to lock into low inflation is seized, the recovery, once it comes, could usher in a prolonged period of sustained OECD growth, the outlook projects. Several uncertainties surround the projections. In particular, continuing debt reduction may damp demand by more than has been estimated. The OECD says although progress has been made in cutting excessive debt accumulated in the late 1980s, borrowers and lenders are still cautious. This is apparent even in the US where the most significant progress has been made. High European interest rates continue to act as a drag on recovery. The outlook says it is not clear how far interest rates will have to fall from current levels to spur recovery but lack of progress on tackling German inflation means Germany's European exchange rate mechanism partners 'may have to continue to maintain interest rates above levels warranted by their domestic economic situations.' Scope for stimulating growth is limited in virtually all OECD countries because of the need to cut budget deficits. Plans by several member countries to cut public spending could have a negative short-term effect on demand that may not be offset by the favourable impact of lower long-term interest rates. External factors also continue to pose some risks, in particular exchange rate pressures and widening external imbalances. The latter is putting policy makers under pressure to extend protectionist measures, says the Outlook. Crucial to sustained recovery is a rebuilding of consumer and business confidence. Governments could contribute to this by bringing the Uruguay Round to a rapid conclusion. Other OECD highlights: Fiscal policy: The immediate task facing governments is to ensure their macroeconomic policies underpin non-inflationary growth. But this is not easy, particularly when rising unemployment puts pressure on governments to loosen fiscal policy. Recently announced fiscal packages in Japan need to be implemented as quickly as possible to boost demand while growth is still weak. The sharp deterioration of public sector finances in the UK and France are described as 'disquieting' and not entirely due to sluggish activity. Both cases underline the need to tighten fiscal policy in the medium-term and the already announced tax rises in the UK may be essential to credibility, says the Outlook. In the US and Germany further measures are necessary to cut budget deficits. The US deficit is projected to widen again after 1997 unless the Administration takes action before the end of its term of office. Unless Germany reigns in spending, it and other ERM countries may have to live with high real interest rates in the future. Monetary policy: With room for manoeuvre on the fiscal side restricted, most of the burden for supporting a sustained recovery will fall on monetary policy. Outside continental Europe, monetary conditions are consistent with actual or incipient recoveries, says the outlook. If recovery falters a further cut in interest rates would be in order but only if inflation remains subdued. For many continental European countries even modest recovery depends on further interest rate cuts. Falling output and wage moderation should make an easing of monetary conditions possible for Germany. Such a move would have to be judged carefully, however, in order not to compromise price stability. International issues: Differences in cyclical positions between countries could lead to widening of the absolute levels of current account imbalances. The OECD says there is a danger that bilateral deals to cut trade imbalances will undermine multilateral bargaining in the Gatt.

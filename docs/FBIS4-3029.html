			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Correspondent Li Zhigao] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, April 18 (XINHUA) -- Mrs. Elsie Tu,  senior British national and now newly-appointed Hong Kong  adviser to China, said her first priority concern is the  peaceful transition of Hong Kong in 1997.    "I really believe most Hong Kong people, probably 90 percent  at least, want 1997 to go through peacefully," said the  81-year-old woman, who has served in the Urban Council for 31  years and is concurrently member of the Legislative Council.    In a recent interview with XINHUA, Elsie Tu said, "Hong Kong  people work very hard to build up the economy. If we have  political disturbance, political instability, it will certainly  and eventually affect the economy."    "In case it (political disturbance) affected economy, people  would move business out of Hong Kong and people lose jobs.  That's what the people are worried about," she added.    She said that she received both written and oral  congratulations from local residents after she was appointed  Hong Kong affairs adviser to the Chinese side earlier this month.    "Because the talks between China and Britain broke down, I  think it's necessary for us to make some kind of bridges with  China to have cooperation so as to understand each other's  viewpoints," she said.    "If the government can't do it, let's the people do it. Then  it's the people's idea not the government's idea," she said,  adding "that's better than the views of Mr. Patten."    "One or two of the press said to me 'whether or not you  compromise your position and make you support China'. I said,  'Have you ever seen me compromise?'"    "It's not intended to be a honor (to be appointed as the  adviser). It's responsibility," she said, adding "since the two  governments cannot agree, it's up to us, the citizens, to try to  find some ways of helping make the transition smooth," she said.    Mrs. Elsie Tu has lived in Hong Kong for 43 years since she  came to Hong Kong in 1951. She has served as the supervisor and  teacher of a local school, Mu Kuang English school, which she  and her Chinese husband set up in 1954. "I understand the  grassroots better than I understand the business," she said.    Her familiarility with fellow residents has been  strengthened  since she became a member of the Urban Council in 1963. For 31  years, she has spent most of her time, at least twice a week,  interviewing people, usually middle-and-low-pay workers.    "The only rest I get is Sunday evening when I go with my  husband for dinner and that's my holiday," she smiled.    "Probably, apart from very well off people who don't need  any  help, I had probably some contacts with most families in Hong  Kong," she said.    "That is the foundation that people trust me because I don't  talk politics to them, I only talk about how to improve social  conditions," she said.    Mrs. Tu is expected to go to Beijing to receive the adviser  appointment next month. "As an adviser, I would like to explain  China's attitude towards Hong Kong and Hong Kong's feelings to  China," she said.</p>

			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Yule Catto up 42% but warns on margins A sharp increase in first half profits at Yule Catto, the chemical and building products group, was yesterday overshadowed by a warning that rising raw material prices could hamper future growth. Although the group saw pre-tax profits increase 42 per cent from Pounds 9.26m to Pounds 13.2m in the six months to June 30, it said margins were likely to come under pressure following price rises of up to 90 per cent for some petrochemicals. 'Higher raw material costs are starting to impact on our chemicals business and we will have to push up prices progressively over the coming months,' said Mr Alex Walker, chief executive. Prices for chemicals such as Styrene, used in latex, have increased from about Pounds 320 a tonne to more than Pounds 500. The group has tightened cost controls to reduce the effect of higher prices, but Mr Walker hinted that its speciality chemicals business could see a dip in the second half. Profits increased by 29 per cent from Pounds 9.51m to Pounds 12.3m in that division following contributions from Synthomer Chemie, the German latex company acquired for Pounds 18.2m last year, and buoyant sales in east Asia, where it has sizeable adhesive operations. Increased demand from the construction industry, mainly in continental Europe, helped the building products division report a 43 per cent increase in profits to Pounds 2.61m (Pounds 1.83m). The two divisions helped lift operating profits of continuing operations from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 13.8m. Turnover rose 14 per cent to Pounds 160.1m (Pounds 140.6m) including Pounds 3.15m (Pounds 6.73m) from discontinued operations. Last September's Pounds 29.7m rights issue, which funded the Synthomer acquisition, helped reduce net borrowings from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 6.46m, equivalent to gearing of 10.4 per cent. Earnings per share, adjusted for the rights, rose from 6.4p to 8p and the interim dividend is increased to 2.8p (2.5p). The shares, which fell 9p to 284p earlier this week, regained 8p to close at 292p. COMMENT Yule Catto is better equipped than most to cope with costlier raw materials. It has improved volumes and reduced overheads, mostly through the disposal earlier this year of its loss-making facades business in the Netherlands. But it will be difficult to force price increases on unwilling customers. The only consolation is that all chemical manufacturers are in the same boat, so market share is unlikely to be affected. If it can contain the cost rises, full-year profits could reach Pounds 29m. Like most other chemicals companies, the shares - on a forward multiple of 17 - are at a premium to the market. Unlike some, however, they look a reasonable if unexciting prospect.</p>

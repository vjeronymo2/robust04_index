			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Video project chief loses post in shake-up British Telecommunications has broken up the division which helped to develop and promote video-on-demand, leaving its director Mr Steve Maine without a formal post. Mr Maine, who has been at BT for 20 years, ran the Visual and Broadcast Services division from 1991. The division was responsible for such activities as video conferencing, satellite-data broadcasting and the provision of communication networks for broadcasters. The development of video-on-demand, which also included a wide range of home services using the telephone network, was potentially the division's biggest project. Technical trials of video-on-demand, sending VHS-quality pictures down telephone lines at the same time as the line is being used for conversation, are nearing completion. Marketing trials involving between 2,000 and 2,500 homes are scheduled to start later this year or early next year. If BT decides to go ahead with what it calls inter-active multimedia services the investment would probably amount to several billion pounds. Sophisticated computer databases would have to be installed at telephone exchanges. Earlier this year Mr Maine told delegates at a Financial Times conference: 'If you are in the home-entertainment business, think beyond the existing boundaries of your industry - talk to us at BT.' The video-on-demand project has now gone to ICE - the BT division responsible for information, communication and entertainment. Mr Rupert Gavin, a marketing director from retail group Dixons, has been brought in to run the division. The appointment reflects the strategy of Mr Michael Hepher, BT's group managing director, to make the organisation more marketing-led. Mr Maine is said to be carrying out 'a special project' and an announcement about his new job in BT is expected 'in due course'. Mr Maine, who is on holiday, was unavailable for comment. BT satellite services will become part of the international communications division. Video conferencing will go to business communications. BT emphasised that the restructuring did not mean any lessening of its commitment to interactive multimedia. A long and winding road, Page 8</p>

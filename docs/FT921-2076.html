			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Opera house asks consultant to investigate costs THE Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, has called in a management consultant to examine administration, production costs, and backstage operations. It hopes the findings will strengthen its case for a big increase in Arts Council subsidy. 'We deserve an uplift in funding,' Mr Jeremy Isaacs, director-general of Covent Garden, said yesterday. 'We hope that this investigation will provide the material which justifies an uplift.' The consultant, Mr Ian Beesley from Price Waterhouse, conducted a similar exercise at Covent Garden's rival, English National Opera. Mr Beesley will report by September. Covent Garden will receive Pounds 18.95m from the council in 1992-93, a 6.5 per cent increase on last year. This will make it by far the largest beneficiary of the council. Covent Garden operations are also being examined by a panel appointed by the Arts Council and headed by Lady Warnock. This review is part of the regular assessment of council clients. The council says it is happy for Covent Garden to undertake its own audit and will take the findings into account when making its judgment. The Royal Opera House feels under threat. To reduce its deficit it has been forced to increase seat prices by more than the rate of inflation to more than Pounds 100 for important opera productions. However, many recent new productions have attracted tepid reviews, and audiences are at about 80 per cent of capacity compared with 90 per cent last season. In contrast English National Opera is on a high. The government this week awarded it Pounds 10.8m towards the Pounds 12.8m costs of acquiring the freehold of the Coliseum. The remaining Pounds 2m will come from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts, run by the pools companies. English National Opera is also expected to announce soon a surplus for the financial year. Covent Garden said it was confident that an outsider's assessment of its performance would endorse its management and confirm its case for increased subsidy.</p>

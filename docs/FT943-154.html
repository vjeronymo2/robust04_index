			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / UK Company News: French Connection lifted to Pounds 3.07m Improvements on the wholesale side and in the US and Hong Kong operations underpinned a 53 per cent pre-tax profits increase at French Connection in the six months to July 31. The fashion clothing company, 75 per cent owned by Mr Stephen Marks, its chief executive, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 3.07m (Pounds 2m) on turnover up 14 per cent at Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 30.6m). Shares eased 5p to 250p. There will again be no dividend. Mr Nicholas Mather, finance director, said the holding company's balance sheet was still in deficit - Pounds 3.2m at January 31 - but he hoped the group would restart payments 'sometime in 1995/96'. UK retail sales rose to Pounds 8.7m (Pounds 8m) from four concessions and 24 shops, up three on last time. Mr Mather thought it a 'good performance compared to some competitors', adding that it had been a 'tough summer on the high street'. Margins were lower than last time. Export sales to Europe, where the company had gone the wholesale rather than the retail route, had increased. In France, sales were flat at Pounds 1.4m but losses were reduced. In the US, sales were largely unchanged at Pounds 10.9m, but margins improved significantly. Sales in the Far East of products sourced from Hong Kong rose to Pounds 2.6m (Pounds 1.6m). Gross margins for the group improved 1.4 percentage points. Mr Mather pointed to careful risk management, especially on the buying side, and the benefits of forward cover on currencies, especially the Hong Kong dollar. Operating profits climbed 39 per cent to Pounds 3.2m. Earnings grew to 10.6p (4.4p) per share.</p>

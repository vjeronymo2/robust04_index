			<p>Language: <F P=105>Cambodian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Second Prime Minister Samdech Hun Sen told Mr.  Georges Albert Wehry, ambassador of the Netherlands to Cambodia  [name and title as heard], on the morning of 22 February that  the current military campaign against the Khmer Rouge [KR]  ordered by him and Prince Krompreah Norodom Ranariddh is not a  solution to the problem, but pressure on the guerrillas to come  to the negotiating table.    Answering a request from the Netherlands, Samdech Hun Sen  said troop reduction cannot now be implemented in Cambodia  because of three essential factors: First, the reduction can  affect political problems; second, the royal government still  needs Armed Forces for self-defense and to counterattack the KR,  preventing them from further causing insecurity among the  people; third, the government has not yet provided those troops  with any skill or possibility to earn a living after the troop  cut.    Samdech Hun Sen reaffirmed that only peaceful political  means  can solve the KR conflict, not military offensives. He also  said that the security situation and the KR problem are not  obstacles to the Netherlands' investment in Cambodia or the  Netherlands' aid to the country. He urged investors to do  business in Cambodia since the country abounds with manpower,  and he called on the Netherlands to help promote Cambodia's  agricultural sector.    Mr. Georges Albert Wehry informed Samdech Hun Sen that at  present the Netherlands is exploring how it can help Cambodia  and determine what its needs are. The Netherlands already  granted $1.5 million in aid to Cambodia [words indistinct].</p>

			<p><P> June 24, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE CONTROVERSY OVER CONTROVERSIAL ART  </P> <P> Serrano's position about his controversial Christ image is reported as being a  protest against exploitation of religious values. The picture in question is,  to me, very moving and effective. But, to give it the obnoxious title the  artist has chosen, "Piss Christ," smacks of blatant exploitation. With a title  like that, what sort of reaction did he expect?  </P> <P> JOHN DEGATINA  </P> <P> Studio City  </P></p>

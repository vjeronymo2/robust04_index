			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEEN TENNIS STAR GAVALDON SAYS NO TO PRO STATUS NOW  </P> <P> Teen-age amateur sensation Angelica Gavaldon turned her back on $24,000, saying  she's not sure she's ready to play tennis for a living.  </P> <P> Gavaldon, 16, made the quarterfinals of the Australian Open, her first Grand  Slam tournament, before losing 6-4, 6-3 to West German Claudia Porwik today.  </P> <P> "The money is tempting," Gavaldon admitted. "But I want to be sure I'm ready.  This is the type of thing that makes you want to turn pro."  </P> <P> Gavaldon, taking 11th-grade classes by correspondence, has yet to decide  whether she wants to play full time on the tour or go to college.  </P> <P> If she turns professional, she will be ineligible to play in NCAA competition.  </P> <P> "One tournament is not enough," she said. "I think I should play a couple more  and see how I do. I just want to be really sure about my decision."  </P> <P> The Coronado, Calif., resident came through three qualifying rounds at the Open  with a ranking of 192. She then beat No. 7 Hana Mandlikova, a two-time champion  here, and No. 15 Gigi Fernandez on the way to the quarters.  </P> <P> Gavaldon was the youngest quarterfinalist in the Open since Carling Bassett in  1983 and is now ranked in the top 100.  </P> <P> Gavaldon's performance in the Open lifted her to the forefront of the new wave  of young players set to challenge top-ranked Steffi Graf over the next few  years.  </P> <P> Zina Garrison Upset.

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / 25% of house sales 'fail before contract exchange' MORE THAN a quarter of house sales collapse before contracts are exchanged, a study by the Lord Chancellor's Department has found. The main reasons are problems raised by surveys, mortgage valuations or changes in personal circumstances. The report says the average cost of buying or selling a house in England and Wales represented about 2 per cent of the purchase price, making it the cheapest in Europe. It takes just more than six weeks for an average transaction to progress from initial agreement to exchange of contracts. To complete a purchase takes two months on average. Delays in exchanging contracts are mostly due to waiting for mortgage finance or by last-minute attempts to renegotiate the purchase price. The study was commissioned under the Citizen's Charter programme to help 'speed up and simplify the process of buying a house'. The government is investigating two proposals - time limits for local authority searches, and a national land information system 'so that all the information currently requiring searches at the Land Registry and in local authority registers could be obtained from a single computerised source'. Report on House-Buying. Lord Chancellor's Department, Southside, 105 Victoria Street, London SW1E 6QT. Pounds 2.50.</p>

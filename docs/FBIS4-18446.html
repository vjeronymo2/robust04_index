			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara -- The governor of the eastern province of  Agri said on Thursday [31 March] that Iran was cooperating with  Turkey against separatist terrorists and delivering them "dead  or alive" to Turkish officials after military operations.    Agri governor Dogan Hatipoglu told the semiofficial Anatolia  news agency that militants of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) were infiltrating into Turkey over the Iranian  border but that lately modern physical barriers put up on the  border and better security measures had reduced this traffic.  Noting that they had a dialogue with Iran on security issues,  Hatipoglu said "we have seen this dialogue work out. Iran was  previously claiming that the PKK did not exist in its territory  but changed this view after talks and seeing documentation. Now  they are also struggling against the PKK with their own forces.    ``They have returned some terrorists either dead of alive.''  [paragraphing as published] Hatipoglu said Turkey was extremely  pleased over Iran's attitude and called on other neighboring  countries to take a similar approach as well.    Meanwhile, officials in Sirnak province said on Thursday  that  the number of people killed when a passenger minibus hit a mine  on a bridge in southeast Turkey on Wednesday had reached fifteen.    The officials said the vehicle was on a country road bridge  near the town of Idil, in Sirnak province, when it hit the mine.  They said the mine was planted by PKK militants and one person  was wounded.</p>

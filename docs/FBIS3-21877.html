According to the prosecutor, this automobile painter has on  seven different occassions since 1990 brought hashish to Finland  via Turku, Naantali, and Helsinki. At first the shipments were 3  kilos in size, but the last shipment was 60 kilos.    Charges in the case have already been brought against more  than 10 people, including the chief individuals in the so-called  Ristiina Gang, among others. The case has been in court now for  almost one year. The case has been at a standstill for half a  year as the court awaited the extradition of the Finnish man who  was arrested in Belgium. The automobile painter was arrested in  April of 1993.    The automobile painter admitted on Monday that the charges  were true in their main parts. The last charge, involving the  60-kilo shipment, is not quite accurate, however, according to  him, for, as his own version has it, he merely received the  shipment here in Finland. He had no prior knowledge about the  size of the shipment he was receiving.    Police have been able to seize over 50 kilos of hashish in  connection with the case. Some of this was found on the property  of one Ristiina businessman, the main defendant in the case, and  some was found in a residence in Porvoo.</p>

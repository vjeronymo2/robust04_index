			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 26 May (NA) -- In connection with a  Chilean map that shows serious irregularities which was  published by a Buenos Aires morning newspaper, the Foreign  Ministry stated today that "there is no border conflict between  Argentina and Chile."    According to Argentine officials, the map was published in  black and white "without showing the colored areas and without  the explanatory notes of the original, thus making a serious  mistake in its interpretation."    In a communique, the Foreign Ministry assures that the map  published with the report was taken "from a chart in the `Atlas  of Chilean History,' by Osvaldo Silva, published by Editorial  Universitaria in 1992."    The communique says: "The original clearly shows areas on  the  map as Argentine territory assigned to Chile. These are the  territories that were `stripped' from Chile as of 1563 until the  end of the 19th century when new viceregal jurisdictions and  border treaties were implemented."    It makes clear: "The original map entails no claim by Chile  to any current Argentine territory."    The Foreign Ministry emphasizes that "there is no border  dispute" between the two countries, and that of the 24 pending  border issues that remained unresolved until 1991, "22 were  settled through a bilateral agreement that was signed that year."    The two remaining issues, Laguna del Desierto and the  continental glacier zone, are being considered by the two  Congresses.</p>

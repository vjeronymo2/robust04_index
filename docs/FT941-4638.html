			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Norway's Uni Storebrand pulls out of international reinsurance Uni Storebrand, Norway's biggest insurer, yesterday reported record 1993 results but announced that it was withdrawing from the international re-insurance business following a succession of losses. 'Negative results over several years plus a weak capital base are the main reasons why Uni Storebrand International is being wound down,' the group said. It is charging NKr450m (Pounds 408m) against the 1993 accounts to cover expenses during the run-off period. Uni has also written down the value of its shares in Uni International, which made an operating loss of NKr357m last year, by NKr694m. In 1993 the international business represented 20 per cent of group premiums. Uni said its international reinsurance operations were unlikely to generate an acceptable rate of return for the foreseeable future, and capital could be deployed more profitably on core domestic businesses. Uni is to continue to undertake insurance business internationally in sectors such as marine, oil and satellite within its non-life unit. But the Singapore office is to be closed while Uni Storebrand UK has been supplied with a liquidity support guarantee of up to Pounds 20m to continue operations. The UK business is to be put up for sale. In the US, Uni last year failed to succeed with an initial public offering for Christiania Re, but said that operations would continue until the unit was sold. Uni is not the only Scandinavian insurer to withdraw from international reinsurance. Last year, Swedish rivals Skandia and Trygg-Hansa cut their reinsurance business. For 1993 the group achieved a net profit of NKr1.02bn against a loss of NKr3.54bn in 1992. The result was helped by NKr3.4bn in realised gains on securities and bonds against losses of NKr800m in 1992. Group net operating income rose last year to NKr23.6bn from NKr20.6bn. Premium income fell to NKr13.7bn from NKr14.3bn. Uni plans to pay a dividend of NKr1.10 per preference share and NKr0.20 per ordinary share. Skandia rights issue, Page 29</p>

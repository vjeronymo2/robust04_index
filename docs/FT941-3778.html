			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / Tighter rules on Lecs called for Local enterprise companies (Lecs), the employer-led economic development bodies, should be obliged to publish details of all grants they give to businesses, Mr Campbell Christie, general secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress, said yesterday. Mr Christie said the recently introduced arrangement - whereby Lecs are obliged to publish details of grants to companies in which a Lec director has an interest - meant there was not the 'total openness' there ought to be. It also placed Lec directors whose companies were receiving Lec grants at a disadvantage with their competitors. They had to disclose details of their company's transactions with the Lec, but rival companies receiving grants did not. Mr Christie, who is on the board of the Glasgow Development Agency, one of the Lecs, was giving evidence in Glasgow to the inquiry by the Scottish select committee into Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, the parent bodies for the Lecs. He said he believed in the local delivery of economic development, but was concerned that too much power had been transferred by Scottish Enterprise to the Lecs, creating tension between it and them. For example, he said, Scottish Enterprise had given the Lecs responsibility for helping defence companies diversify, instead of taking a strategic view. An initiative to help the electronics industry was in the hands of the Scottish Electronics Forum, which he called 'a self-help group' of companies with little input from Scottish Enterprise or the Scottish Office Industry Department. Mr Christie also complained that there was no union representative on the Scottish Enterprise board. A public and private-sector partnership launched yesterday to promote Somerset has set itself the target of helping to create 25,000 jobs by the year 2000. The Somerset Economic Partnership brings together the county and district councils, chambers of commerce and industry and Training and Enterprise Councils. It is the latest of a series of initiatives in the west country designed to develop economic strategy and to lobby on issues such as regional aid.</p>

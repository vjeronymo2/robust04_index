			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Alberto Adrianzen M.: "Trapped With No Way </F> Out?"]    [Text] This Christmas may not be President Fujimori's best  one. The engineer's presents--and oh, what Christmas  presents!--will be the task of solving several problems that he  surely never thought would come up.    First of all, the results of the 31 October referendum,  which  were a real surprise. The government was expecting a result of  more than 65 percent, which would enable it to guarantee the  future reelection of President Fujimori and finish out the cycle  begun on 5 April. In other words, to legitimize and legalize the  Fujimori regime itself in a single act. That has not been  possible. The new constitution is practically stillborn. In this  context, the weakness of the new constitution as a legal basis  for Fujimorism is a fact of life.    Secondly, what was going to be the political basis of  Fujimorism, an indisputable electoral-legal majority, is also in  doubt. The near stalemate and the triumph of the "no" vote in  more than a dozen departments have shattered the dream of an  overwhelming, undeniable political majority that would be loyal  to the president personally. Moreover, there is the uncertainty  of foreign and national investors in the face of the election  results and the political scandals that will certainly come to  light in connection with the handling of the debt papers.    These developments have a variety of consequences. The most  important one is the beginning of the presidential campaign for  1995, which shows how fragile President Fujimori's future  prospects are. Some sectors are already seeking to build a  Fujimorism without Fujimori. Meanwhile, others (such as Daniel  Estrada, Ricardo Belmont, and Luis Caceres) are practically in  full swing in their presidential campaigns.    The other major consequence is that the opposition and other  social sectors have managed to open up new opportunities and  place themselves in an expectant situation. This fact is so  obvious that even the extraparliamentary opposition, sidelined  until very recently, has managed to raise its head, as evidenced  by Belaunde's presence at a rally held not too long ago in the  city of Iquitos.    Evidently, President Fujimori's legitimacy and the legality  of the political regime inaugurated on 5 April are now being  called into question. One indication of this weakness, for  example, is the way the La Cantuta case has been unfolding.    Another manifestation is the president's appeal for a  national accord. It shows a desire to bring order to a political  situation that got out of the government's control on 31  October. The goal is to shift the government's political  position with respect to public opinion, which wants consensus  and is sick of confrontations,[.sup]1[/] and at the same time  to head off the avalanche of constitutional amendments that the  opposition and other social sectors are proposing.  <H5>  La Cantuta: A Political Test </H5>   The people who committed the atrocity of La Cantuta  certainly  never imagined that their actions would unleash a political  scandal or give rise to an investigation, much less that the  incident would become one of the most disturbing developments  for this government. The same group had probably been involved  in other actions that were never investigated. One of them, in  fact, the disappearance of almost an entire family in Huacho, is  quite similar to the La Cantuta case.    Nevertheless, the La Cantuta affair, bravely revealed by the  magazine SI, has placed the government on the horns of a  dilemma: Either it knuckles under to pressure from the military  not to allow a serious investigation of this atrocity, punishing  only those who directly participated in the operation, or it  decides to face the issue head-on, jeopardizing the so-called  military hierarchy and the Armed Forces' perception of Fujimori  as their leader.    It should be noted that after the accusations made by  Congressman Henry Pease in April of last year, the military,  without even consulting the president, decided to take the tanks  out into the streets.    Furthermore, the problem of La Cantuta has ceased to be  simply a matter of human rights violations; it has also become a  kind of political test that will measure institutional and group  responses and relationships that are important to this  government.    Several institutions are involved in La Cantuta. The first  one is the Democratic Constituent Congress (CCD) itself, which,  having changed its earlier position in view of the overwhelming  evidence, has now demanded that the matter be handled by  civilian courts rather than military ones.    Another institution involved is the judiciary, which will  have to determine soon, when the prosecutor decides to file  charges, whether the La Cantuta affair is a matter of common or  military jurisdiction. The military courts' objections to  prosecutors' questioning the military personnel allegedly  involved in this multiple crime, and their refusal to turn over  information to the CCD on the grounds that the matter is outside  its jurisdiction, show just how far the stonewallers can go.    The Armed Forces themselves are involved as an institution,  and to be perfectly honest, the political survival of the Army's  top echelon is at stake, in view of the accusations by General  Robles from his asylum in Argentina that they were accomplices  in this criminal incident.    There is something more, as well. The solution to the La  Cantuta case will also serve to assess the relationship between  President Fujimori's government and that of the United States.  It is well known that the Clinton administration, ambiguities  aside, is anxious for this case to be resolved on the best  possible terms as a first step toward changing the command  structure of the Armed Forces.    And finally, the relationship between President Fujimori and  the military hierarchy, one of the pillars of the regime  inaugurated on 5 April, is at stake. President Fujimori's recent  confirmation of the commanders-in-chief of the various branches  of the military, including the police, and the scandalous  exclusion of Parliament from the process of promoting the  highest-ranking officers[.sup]2[/] show not only that he has  already made one decision--to protect the senior military  commanders--but also that there is some instability in the  relationship between the military leadership and the president  that could result in a coup d'etat or in a change of personnel  in that leadership.    For this reason, as we have stated, the La Cantuta case is a  true political test. At risk is the autonomy of the  aforementioned institutions, as well as the ability of the key  players to exert pressure. There is, then, a direct relationship  between the institutions' independence and the political power  they theoretically wield. The latter is important, given that  one of the variables for measuring the authoritarianism of a  regime is precisely the degree of autonomy--and therefore  power--exercised by these institutions.    If the judiciary decides to stay out of the La Cantuta case  or to defer to the military courts, we can conclude, once again,  that this institution is not autonomous and, therefore, that  either it is a mere appendage of the government or it has no  power. The same can be said of the CCD.    This would confirm the notion that the objectives of the  self-coup of 5 April were not to reform the judiciary or the  political system. Rather, these objectives can be found in the  logic of the neoliberal economic model, the antisubversion  strategy itself, and the role of the military, as shown in the  documents published by the magazine OIGA.[.sup]3[/]    For this reason, the danger of this kind of political  development, and of La Cantuta, is that they reveal the real  intensions of power, and therefore, they always end up imposing  a "zero sum" logic in which the gains of the victorious are  based on the total losses of the defeated.    To put it another way, if the triumph of Fujimori and the  military hierarchy in the La Cantuta affair is based on the  unconditional defeat of the opposition and greater political  control over the institutions of the regime, it entails greater  involvement by the military in the government, since it is the  military that has actually won the game. Consequently, now the  groundwork has really been laid for a transition toward a  civilian-military government that could, in the short term, as  more incidents such as La Cantuta are revealed,[.sup]4[/]  turn into a military government.    That is why, if the results of 31 October represent a severe  blow to the future of President Fujimori and his government, La  Cantuta reveals a president walking into a blind alley. Mr.  Fujimori has ended up entangled in his own alliances.    The question is whether he is trapped for good, in which  case  he could become an irrelevancy, depending on how things unfold,  or whether he will decide to put on a military uniform. The  tragedy in all this is that it would not be the uniform of  Francisco Bolognesi or Miguel Grau, but that of Martin Rivas or  Nicolas de Bari Hermoza. This uniform could quickly take on a  black hue. There is, however, another option: changing the  military leadership.  Footnotes    1. The surveys conducted by the agency IMASEN immediately  after 31 October yielded the following results: About 80 percent  thought the Constitution should be amended before being  promulgated; 73 percent thought there should be a political  accord between the government and the opposition. It should be  mentioned that the IMASEN survey was conducted in Lima, one of  the government's most important political bastions.    2. Actually, rather than assuage the Army's fears about La  Cantuta, the promotions have caused greater consternation. For  example, as some news media, including the magazine SI, have  pointed out, no one from the artillery, to which Gen. Valdivia  belongs, has been promoted to major general.    3. We are referring to the documents published by that  magazine several months ago. According to the magazine, the  documents, of military origin, mention a political plan to  govern this country for at least 15 years, through either a  civilian government or a military regime.    4. As we finished writing this article, Channel 9, ATV,  reported the disappearance of nine people in Chimbote in May of  last year. The operation followed a pattern quite similar to  that of La Cantuta. There was an attack in the area, and a few  days later nine people suspected of being Shining Path members  disappeared. This time the accusations have focused on the Navy,  so it is not just the Army that is involved in this kind of  action, but another branch of the military as well.</p>

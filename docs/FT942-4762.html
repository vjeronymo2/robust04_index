			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / Observer: Fight to the Finnish? You can tell a bully - they are the ones who always pick fights with much smaller people. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant Russian nationalist politician, has selected a female Finnish journalist, Jutta Ziliacus, for his latest punch-up. She apparently queried his mental fortitude in a recent article; now he's suing her. The man from Ivantheterribleograd is little-loved in Finland. He says the Finns can have eastern Karelia back - they lost it to Russia in the Winter war of 1939-40 - but the price will be that all Finland is reunited with Russia. Zhirinovsky is also suing a Helsinki theatre, currently running a farce entitled Mein Kampf by Hungarian dramatist George Taboris. Zhirinovsky's lawyer claims the central character - Herr Schicklgruber himself - spouts words taken from Zhirinovsky's speeches. Damages of around Dollars 2.5m are being sought. But Zhirinovsky has shot himself in the foot again. In Finland, at least, libel damages are usually nominal.</p>

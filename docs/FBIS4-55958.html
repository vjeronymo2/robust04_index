			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Several Romanian papers carried reports  and commentary on the death of Moses Rosen, chief rabbi and  president of the Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania  (FCE) and leader of the Romanian Jewish community since 1948, on  6 May at the age of 81, as well as speculation about his  possible successor. The independent daily Bucharest ADEVARUL on  7 May published the FCE announcement of the death and a photo of  Rosen on page 1 of its 7 May edition, and on 9 May published two  photographs and a brief report on the funeral. The main  opposition paper ROMANIA LIBERA, on the other hand, reported the  death in a brief factual account on page 9 of its 7 May edition.  <H5>  Possible Succession </H5>   ADEVARUL speculated in an article on 9 May that a layman  would probably be selected for the position of FCE president but  that it would be "difficult to predict" who would succeed Rosen  as chief rabbi, since there are "very few rabbis in Romania, and  they are all quite old." ROMANIA LIBERA on 9 May opined that the  president of the Jewish Community of Timisoara, Rabbi Dr. Ernest  Neumann, would succeed Rosen as chief rabbi and that Sorin  Iulian, former head of the General Inspectorate of the Militia  in Bucharest, would be named president of the FCE. TINERETUL  LIBER on 9 May reported that it had learned from "unauthorized  sources" that Academician Dr. Nicolae Cajal had the best chance  of taking over the leadership of this community.  <H5>  President Iliescu Condemns Anti-Semitic Acts </H5>   An article in the 9 May issue of the popular daily  EVENIMENTUL ZILEI, which is consistently critical of Iliescu,  reported on Rosen's funeral and on President Iliescu's reaction.  In an article headlined "President Ion Iliescu Said That  Thousands of Jews and Innocent Persons Were Massacred by the  Romanian Fascists," the paper noted that Iliescu gave a  "surprising" address at the funeral, "condemning in unequivocal  terms, from his `position as head of state,' the years of the  Iron Guard rebellion," referring to the fascist organization of  the 30's and 40's. According to the article, Iliescu recalled a  1976 ceremony in Iasi at which he and Rabbi Rosen unveiled a  monument dedicated to the memory of persons "massacred" in 1941  by "Romanian fascists under the protection of the state."  Iliescu called it a "disgrace" that there are forces today which  are "attempting to rehabilitate actions of inhuman cruelty  committed against a population, not only against Jews, but  against all peoples and against the Romanian people." He said  that he had "lived through the horrible days and nights of the  Iron Guard rebellion in 1941" and "knew the families which  suffered the losses" and "all the atrocities Romanian Jews and  Jews in other parts of Europe experienced and the sufferings the  Romanian people endured under oppressive regimes." EVENIMENTUL  ZILEI adds that, concluding this veritable confession and  personal testimony," Iliescu expressed the hope that such  moments "would never be repeated in the history of the Romanian  people and of humanity" and stated that "public opposition to  the new attempts to `regenerate' such trends is the common duty  of all."  <H5>  Other Reaction </H5>   A condolence message to the FCE from the Executive Bureau of  the Democratic Party, published in the party's paper, AZI, on 9  May, praised Rosen, saying that "his prominent personality,  which has a permanent place in contemporary history, will be,  for the members of our party, an example of a brilliant scholar,  a servant of God, a fighter for the defense of the interests of  his community against extremism, xenophobia, and anti-Semitism  and for the promotion of the values of humanity."    The youth newspaper TINERETUL LIBER of 9 May lauded Rabbi  Rosen for "completely transforming the recent history of Judaism  in Romania, fighting for freedom of religion for Jews and  obtaining the emigration of more than 300,000 Jews to Israel in  exchange for the payment of sums of money to Ceausescu. After  the collapse of the Iron Curtain, Moses Rosen protested  vehemently against attempts to rehabilitate [World War II-era  dictator] Marshal Antonescu and against the anti-Semitic  tendencies of some parties and publications in our country."    In contrast, Senator Corneliu Vadim Tudor, one of Rabbi  Rosen's strongest critics and owner and chief editor of the  ultra-nationalist weekly ROMANIA MARE, presented a different  picture of Rosen in the paper's 13 May issue. After introducing  his article with the Latin saying "De mortuis nil nisi bene  [bonum]" (Let nothing be said of the dead but good), Tudor  admitted that he had a "strange feeling" when someone brought  him the "good news" of Rabbi Rosen's death: "My greatest enemy  was dead, and I was suffering as one would suffer after the  death of a friend."    While he praised Rosen for participating in the 1 December  1993 Alba Iulia National Day festivities celebrating the  anniversary of the Union of the Principalities, much of his  6,000-word article consisted of a denunciation of actions Rosen  allegedly took against Tudor and against certain "respected  Romanian writers" during the past 15 years. These actions,  according to Tudor, included "falsifications of the truth," the  removal of books from bookstores and libraries, and "defamatory  statements" to the world press. Tudor also reported receiving  critical telephone calls from "ordinary Romanians" who "were  exasperated" because Radio Bucharest devoted two hours to the  Rosen funeral services in Bucharest. Other commments Tudor says  he heard were: "It's a wonder that Iliescu did not proclaim a  national day of mourning!" "The richest man in Romania has died.  Who got his money?" "Who is paying for the charter flight to  Israel [where Rosen was buried]?"    Continuing, Tudor said: "This is not the time or the place  to  judge the rabbi's sins against the Romanian people. Who knows,  perhaps they can be compensated for by his very great service to  his people, Israel, helping about 400,000 Jews to leave Romania  for the Promised Land, the land of their ancestors, which is  quite admirable and to his credit! As for me, I have the courage  and honesty to forgive him for the days and nights of nightmares  he caused for my parents and for me. To forgive and forget is  Christian. This is the difference between Christianity and  Zionism, which does not forgive, does not forget, and even  invents, constantly, other plagues, other holocausts, and other  hunters of men." In conclusion, Tudor wrote: "Moses Rosen was a  person of international caliber, an educated man, a brilliant  scholar of the Bible and the Torah, a character from a novel, a  devoted husband, a distinguished pastor of Jewish souls. I think  that all these qualities will carry a lot of weight at the Last  Judgement. May God forgive him his sins, value his merits, and  give rest to his tormented soul. Lord have mercy on him! I  forgave him long ago."</p>

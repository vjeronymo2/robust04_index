			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Economic advisers to the Russian government Anders  Oslund of the Stockholm School of Economics and Jeffrey Sachs of  Harvard University have sent a letter to President Yeltsin  saying they refuse further work.    The two experts spoke of not wanting to help the Russian  government further because "the Prime Minister-declared aims are  entirely out of line with our personal views." They fear that  with the arrival of the new Russian government, the situation  will exacerbate following further inflation, already among the  world's highest.    Pointing to austerity measures carried out by Estonia,  Latvia  and Poland, which succeeded in curbing inflation, Oslund and  Sachs expressed the hope for a successful reform in Russia.  They also spoke of wanting to work on a personal basis with  reform supporters and a new generation of Russian pro-market  economists.    To avoid a diversion from the course of reforms, the new  government ought to include competent people not lobbyists such  as Vice Premier Aleksandr Zaveryukha, Oslund told Interfax.  Oslund and Sachs have worked for the Russian government since  1991.</p>

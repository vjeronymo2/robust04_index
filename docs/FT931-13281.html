			<p>930125 FT  25 JAN 93 / UN arms team aims to inspect Iraq plant A United Nations team of nuclear weapons inspectors is set to fly into Baghdad today on a delayed but routine mission. They are expected to examine damage to the al-Rabiya site, south of Baghdad, which was attacked last week by US cruise missiles. The mission, the 17th by nuclear weapons inspectors to Iraq since the end of the Gulf war, comes one day after Mr Les Aspin, the new US secretary of defence, said there were signs that Iraq was moving its surface to air missiles back into the no-fly zones. He said the US would need to watch the missiles in the next few days. The eight-member team will join about 70 UN inspectors who returned to Iraq last week after Baghdad belatedly agreed to their direct access to the country following intense US and UN pressure. A team of ballistic missile experts will also fly into Iraq today. UN officials said a large team of chemical weapons inspectors who entered last week had met no resistance from Iraqi officials in resuming work destroying chemical and biological weapons. Mr Zifferero's team will undertake what he described as 'essential follow-up work, verifying equipment has been destroyed'. He said the al-Rabiya site, a complex of several factories, housed several heavy machine tools used in the construction of uranium enrichment calutrons which his inspectors had tagged for destruction on visits before the US raid.</p>

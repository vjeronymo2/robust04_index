			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Hamburg, Germany, Jan 15 (AFP) -- Belgian  General Francis Briquemont, outgoing commander of the United  Nations Protection Force in Bosnia-Herzegovina, has criticized  NATO's air raid threats in the war-torn republic.    Briquemont -- who will be replaced by British General  Michael  Rose on January 24 after asking to be relieved of his functions  -- said in an interview to be published by the German weekly DER  SPIEGEL Monday [17 January] that he was tired of hearing about  the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's threats to carry out  air raids against Serb positions.    Such raids would not solve the problem of surrounded and  besieged cities like Sarajevo, he said, adding that continual  threats of this nature would not make the warring parties any  more willing to discuss peace.    In his interview, an excerpt of which was released Saturday,  the UNPROFOR commander accused the West of lacking a clear  strategy in Bosnia.    Too many different opinions have been expressed, too many  resolutions have been adopted and there are not enough resources  allocated to carry out policy, he said.    Briquemont said he feared that "the blue helmets will soon  no  longer be able to continue their humanitarian aid."    "It's an illusion to think UN troops can continue to supply  humanitarian aid for an unlimited time if firing continues," he  said.    If no peace agreement is reached soon the UN peacekeeping  mission will have to be reassessed, he added. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / George sees fair inflation outlook: Bank chief says markets are too pessimistic Financial markets are too pessimistic in their outlook on inflation, according to Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England. Speaking first to a financial markets conference in London, and later to a group of businessmen in Birmingham, Mr George stressed the message that markets, both in the UK and overseas, were exaggerating the inflationary threat, and the likely interest rate rises needed to combat it. He said: 'There are a number of reasons for supposing that the effect of the economic expansion on inflation could be less in the present upswing than it has been in the past.' Analysts said the governor's comments suggested that the Bank's quarterly inflation report, to be released next Tuesday, was unlikely to contain any surprises about inflation pressures in the economy. The likelihood of a rise in interest rates after the monthly monetary meeting between the governor and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, next Wednesday would also appear to be reduced. Mr George lent substance to this view in his Birmingham speech, delivered last night. He said: 'There are relatively few immediate signs that inflation is about to pick up strongly.' He stopped short, however, of ruling out another increase in rates. Short sterling futures, which reflect the market's view on prospective interest rates, firmed yesterday, showing less pessimism about the extent to which rates would have to rise. The governor received some support from Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor. He told parliament during question time: 'We will be able to keep interest rates down . . . if we act in good time, if our fiscal policy is sound, and if we keep on the course that we have now set.' Mr George's speeches trod a careful line between stressing the Bank's willingness to act early to curb inflationary pressures - as it had done by raising rates last month - while also making clear that the markets were too bearish in their inflation outlook. In his London speech the governor spent some time addressing the issue of why global bond yields had risen so far this year. He concluded that the 'most important influence' had been the increasing evidence of recovery and expansion in the industrial world. Mr George said the run-up in bond yields - by between 1.5 per cent and 1.75 per cent in the US, Germany and the UK, from a year previously - reflected increasing uncertainty and worsening inflationary expectations. He said there were a number of reasons to believe these were exaggerated. These included: a global consensus on the need to achieve monetary stability and to curb fiscal deficits; the fact that real interest rates were already quite high; little upward pressure on labour costs; and the intensity of business competition.</p>

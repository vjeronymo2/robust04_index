			<p>920103 FT  03 JAN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading HEAVY two-way business in the FT-SE futures contract provided the feature of the derivatives markets yesterday. The March contract on the Footsie, which has now taken over from December as the active contract, extended the strong premium achieved on New Year's Eve as two US houses struggled to unwind substantial positions taken aboard over the Christmas period. March traded throughout at a substantial premium, which stood at around 65 points at the close, against a 29-point fair value premium, the estimated level which allows for dividend flows and financing costs. However, the follow-through in the underlying stocks was disappointing and traders said the stocks were being sold in late trading. Traded options were also busy, with the Footsie option taking up much of the attention. Of the day's total of 26,261 traded contracts, against 22,087 on Tuesday, 12,252 were FT-SE contracts. Individual share contracts were more active than last week as traders positioned themselves for the new year recommendations. Asda headed the list with 2,062 contracts, with its nearest rival, Hanson, recording 1,595 contracts, and British Airways (1,382) and BTR (1,169) next.</p>

			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MINGLING AT THE WORKS' INAUGURAL  </P> <P> Background  </P> <P> Small private dinner at the Works Gallery South, a new art shop in South Coast  Plaza's Crystal Court. The gallery's inaugural exhibition features work by L.A.  artist Billy Al Bengston -- who showed up at Wednesday's fete fashionably late,  fashionably dressed, lean, tan, relaxed. Bengston's arrival sent a frisson  through the business-suited group of 60 or so art collectors and aficionados  tipping back bubbly. "People like to get near the source," explained Charles  Desmarais, director of the Laguna Art Museum.  </P> <P> Perspective  </P> <P> Gallery owner Mark Moore (who bears a striking resemblance to Newport Harbor  Art Museum chief curator Paul Schimmel) has been dealing art to locals from his  gallery in Long Beach for six years. "They came to Long Beach, but they'd  rather not," said the 32-year-old Irvine native of his southern expansion.  "People who live in Orange County are more convenience-oriented than in other  markets." Browsing the brightly colored exhibit, guest Norma Glover dubbed the  new space "the best contemporary art gallery in the county." The competition  being? "Well, um, let's see," Glover said, brow furrowing. "Oh yes, I can think  of one other -- but I'm not naming names." Early arrivals Lori and Mike Paselk  hovered near a small gold-toned piece called "Telegraph Trail," the newest  addition to their personal collection. "This one came out of the box and into  my hands," said Paselk, a friend of Moore and the commercial contractor who  built the gallery space. "Our little prize," said his wife, gazing adoringly at  their $28,000 purchase.  </P> <P> Motif  </P> <P> She's the boss. Ask Herb Brownell, a retired Laguna Beach architect, about his  art collection: "My wife is the collector. Aesthetically I'm thrilled.  Financially I bleed." Ask Newport Beach lawyer Philip Gold: "I had a couple of  Bengstons when I was married, formerly, a couple of nice pieces. (My ex) got  them. But I have a good sense of humor, so I'm here tonight." Ask Larry Deane,  a Newport Beach developer: "Talk to the boss over there," he said, nodding  toward his wife. "I enjoy what I enjoy, but when it comes to the decisions, I  just snap and salute."  </P> <P> Notables  </P> <P> The hot spots at dinner went to Jack and Marion Shea and David and Margarita  Steinmetz -- the Sheas seated to the left and the Steinmetzes to the right of  Bengston and his "goodest friend," as he put it, Christi Bach. Asked if he  collected Bengston, Shea laughed. "I gave the best one we had to the (Newport  Harbor Art Museum), and my wife's never forgiven me." ("Absolutely right," said  Marion, casting a glance at the next table, where Paul Schimmel sat with his  associate curator, Lucinda Barnes. "Paul's loaning it back real soon -- like on  Monday.") Artist Ed Ruscha and his wife, Danna, and L.A. gallery owner Jim  Corcoran flew down with Bengston and Bach. (Yes, globe-trotters, that's Santa  Monica to John Wayne by air, then a limo to the gallery. And still an hour late  -- thanks to a pilot who headed north for 25 miles and a limo driver who took  "back roads," according to Bengston, who clocked the last leg of the journey at  18 minutes.)  </P> <P> Edibles  </P> <P> Dinner was catered by mall neighbor Bangkok Four, an elegant presentation that  included Belgian endive appetizer, green salad, baked prawns, fresh fruit and  pineapple sorbet. Washed down with Chardonnay and Thai coffee.  </P> <P> Quoted  </P> <P> Of mingling with patrons, Bengston said: "You just have to relax and see what  happens. Sometimes it's a good time and sometimes it's hell. I can name a  couple of parties that were worse than hell." PAMELA MARIN  </P></p>

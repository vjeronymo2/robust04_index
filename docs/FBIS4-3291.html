			<p>BFN     [Text] Tashkent, April 20 (XINHUA) -- China and Uzbekistan  have agreed to further expand their trade and economic  cooperation, according to a press communique released here today  at the end of Chinese Premier Li Peng's three-day official visit  to Tashkent.    The communique says that the cooperation will include direct  links between localities and enterprises of the two countries.    The two sides will perfect the legal basis and economic  infrastructure in this aspect, and strive to create better  conditions for diversified forms of trade and economic  cooperation, says the communique.    They have agreed to hold consultations on expanding the  capacities of transportation by aviation, railways and highways,  with a view to drawing up bilateral or multilateral agreements  in this regard, it says.    During the visit, Premier Li and Uzbek President Islam  Karimov held talks on furthering bilateral relations and on  regional and international issues of mutual concern, and briefed  each other on social, political and economic situation of their  own countries.    The two sides have expressed satisfaction with the results  of  the talks and are willing to further cooperation in political,  economic, trade, cultural and other fields, according to the  communique.    They have also pledged to strictly abide by the five  principles of peaceful co-existence, and develop long-term  friendly relations of mutually beneficial cooperation, which  they say is in line with the fundamental interests of the two  peoples, and conducive to peace, stability and development of  Asia.    Both sides hold that the situation in the Asia-Pacific is  developing towards relaxation and stability in general, and  maintaining peace and stability in Asia conforms with the common  interests of this region and other parts of the world as well.    They are also willing to work for the safeguarding of peace  and security in Asia in the light of the conditions and  characteristics of Asia, the communique says.    Political stability and economic development of Central  Asian  nations not only conform with the fundamental interests of the  peoples in this region, but are also of great significance to  the peace in Asia and the world at large, it adds.    In the communique, the Chinese side appreciates the wish  expressed by President Karimov on strengthening security and  stability in Central Asia, and supports efforts made by the  Government of Uzbekistan to consolidate domestic and regional  situation and to develop national economy.    The two sides have also agreed to continue their frequent  contacts and exchange of visits between leaders of the two  countries.    In this regard, Premier Li, on behalf of President Jiang  Zemin, has invited President Karimov to revisit China and  Karimov has accepted the invitation.

			<p>Language: <F P=105>French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Powder-Propellant Supersonic </F> Combustion"]    [Text] ONERA [National Office for Aerospace Studies and  Research] successfully tested a powder-propellant ramjet engine  equipped with a plexiglass combustion chamber. A Mach 1.5 hot  air flow was supplied to the chamber (consisting of a short  cylindrical section followed by a divergent), and a small amount  of hydrogen gas was injected into a mixed supersonic speed zone  located at the chamber inlet (this to help maintain combustion).  Typical speeds at the chamber outlet ranged from Mach 1.1 to  Mach 1.4, and combustion efficiencies observed were as high as  87 percent, with equivalence ratios ranging from 0.49 to 0.66.  In the present setup, however, losses due to the calorific  intake and to friction against the walls resulted in a 50-70  percent impact pressure drop throughout the chamber.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The TEC [Transitional Executive Council] and the  Lebowa government have appealed to striking officials to return  to work immediately in order to restore essential services. The  director general of the chief minister's office, Mr. J.M.  (Mahlangu), made the appeal after a task group of the TEC had  reported on the disruption of essential services, increasing  tension and lawlessness in the area. The task group also  reported on the apparent inability of the Lebowa government at  the Department of Regional and Land Affairs to resolve Lebowa's  financial problems.    Mr. (Mahlangu) said that the TEC had also decided that an  effective administration had to be established in Lebowa as soon  as possible and that administrators had to be appointed to  assist in this. He said that the immediate task of the  administration would be to appoint independent arbitrators to  attend to the problems and complaints of officials.</p>

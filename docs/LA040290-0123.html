			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> IRATE ART-LOVERS POUND ON PRADO  </P> <P> Dozens of angry people pounded on the doors of the Prado Museum early today in  a futile attempt to get into a wildly popular exhibition of Diego Velazquez  paintings, which just ended its two-month run.  </P> <P> More than 500,000 people flocked to the exhibition after it opened Jan. 24,  lining up several hours to see 80 paintings by the 17th-Century Spanish master.  </P> <P> It was billed as the most complete Velazquez retrospective ever held.  </P> <P> Museum officials said they were forced to reopen the exhibition to latecomers  twice Sunday night. This followed a public pledge by the museum's director that  the show would not close until the last visitor had gone away.  </P> <P> But about 40 people were turned away shortly after midnight, despite banging on  the door and chanting "We want in!"  </P> <P> The exhibition featured such works as "Las Meninas," "The Forge of Vulcan,"  "The Spinners," "The Rokeby Venus," and "The Portrait of Juan de Pareja."  </P></p>

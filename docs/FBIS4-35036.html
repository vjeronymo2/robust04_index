			<p>BFN     [Text] Most Chileans support President Eduardo Frei's  administration even though this support is less than President  Aylwin received during his first 90 days of government.    According to an Adimark poll conducted in Greater Santiago,  54 percent support President Frei's administration, 15 percent  disapprove, while 31 percent neither approves nor disapproves.  Comparing these figures with the first 90 days of former  President Aylwin's government, the support level is lower.    Concerning pending matters, 41 percent believe the  government  badly handled the case of [Carabineros Director General] Rodolfo  Stange, 36 percent believe it handled it well, and 22 percent  said they do not know.    Most Chileans believe Gen. Stange should resign.</p>

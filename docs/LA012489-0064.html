			<p><P> January 24, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Convicted spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, imprisoned at the Federal Penitentiary in  Marion, Ill., began a five-day fast to protest the transfer of his wife, Anne,  from a Danbury, Conn., hospital to a federal prison medical facility at  Rochester, Minn., said Anne Pollard's father, Bernard Henderson. Pollard, 34,  was sentenced in 1987 to life in prison after he was convicted of supplying  classified U.S. documents to Israel. His wife, 28, was given a five-year  sentence as an accessory. Anne Pollard collapsed Jan. 11 at a federal prison  work camp at Danbury, her father said. She was taken to a hospital for  treatment of a gastrointestinal disorder, he said. Henderson claimed his  daughter was moved from the hospital Jan. 14 before treatments had been  completed. A U.S. Bureau of Prisons spokesman said Pollard was moved "for  medical reasons" and denied that she was being mistreated.  </P></p>

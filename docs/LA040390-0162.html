			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> BOMB THREAT SNARLS COMMUTE IN VAN NUYS  </P> <P> Several buildings were evacuated and a major Van Nuys intersection was closed  this morning after a bomb threat, apparently directed at a church, was  telephoned to police, authorities said.  </P> <P> Police said the caller claimed that a bomb was in a brown Datsun parked near  the Church on the Way, 14300 Sherman Way.  </P> <P> Nearby buildings were evacuated about 9 a.m. and Sherman Way was closed between  Van Nuys Boulevard and Hazeltine Avenue. The evacuated area included the  Sherman Way and Lennox Avenue intersection where the church is situated.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Police Department bomb squad members and the Criminal Conspiracy  Unit were called to the scene after a car matching the description was found  parked near the church. Spray-painted on the sides of the car were the words  "Hot" and "The End." On the trunk of the car was painted, "LAPD Capt. VVAL  only," possibly a reference to an officer who is a member of the church,  Detective Bob Muldrew said.  </P> <P> Bomb-sniffing dogs were used to approach the car but gave no indication of an  explosive device inside. Later, bomb experts detonated small charges inside the  car, but no larger explosion was triggered. The car was searched and no  explosives were found, police said.  </P> <P> The bomb threat caused severe traffic congestion in the largely commercial area  near Sherman Way and Van Nuys Boulevard, two heavily traveled roads during the  morning commute, police said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the Church on the Way, which espouses charismatic beliefs,  declined to comment on the incident. Muldrew said the motive for the threat was  not known.  </P></p>

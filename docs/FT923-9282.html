			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / International Company News: Cathay keeps its long-term plans on course - The Hong Kong airline's preparations for Chinese rule in 1997 EARLY last month, the final piece of a jigsaw started in 1984 fell into place for Cathay Pacific, the Hong Kong airline owned by Swire Group. A 10 per cent stake in the airline passed from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) and China Travel Service (CTS), two mainland Chinese companies. The deal marked the fruition of a nine-year plan to secure Cathay's future after 1997. This not only covered the airline's shareholding structure, but included since 1987 the way it manages its balance sheet, emphasising the maintainence of high levels of cash. Senior Cathay executives believe this twin-track policy will help dispel any concerns among investors and customers over the airline's future. If so, then Cathay should be well placed to take advantage of growth in the Asia-Pacific region, analysts say. The region is forecast to show the most growth in airline traffic. According to the International Air Transport Association (Iata) scheduled traffic in the Asia-Pacific region will grow from 25.2 per cent of the world's total in 1985 to 35.8 per cent in 1995 and more than 50 per cent by 2010. In 1984, Britain and China signed the Joint Declaration on Hong Kong providing for the transfer of the colony to China on June 30 1997. At that time, Swire decided it could not continue to own Cathay outright and safeguard its future after 1997. Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, says: 'We decided that the shareholding structure of the airline would have to change. Broadly, we had in mind three steps.' The first was to take the company public. This was done in April 1986 when 17.5 per cent was sold with 15 per cent floated publicly. The other two steps required securing mainland Chinese investors. In 1987, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (Citic) acquired 12.5 per cent through an issue of new shares and the purchase of stock from Hongkong Bank. Arguably, the most important step was the third: securing a mainland shareholder with its own aviation interests. 'We are now in a situation which we would broadly wish to see stay in place for the long term,' says Mr Sutch. 'We have no intention of changing what we have; I believe that what we've got in place meets the needs of 1997.' According to analysts, the biggest threat to Cathay is that after 1997 China will set up a competitor airline in Hong Kong. The company, however, hopes that, through the addition of CNAC and CTS to its share register, this possibility is ruled out. Mr Sutch says: 'If China is interested in capitalising on what Hong Kong has to offer, they can do it most effectively through the instrument of Cathay rather than through starting from scratch themselves. Cathay is the best positioned to take advantage of Hong Kong.' He is also content with the second part of the defensive package: strong cash holdings. Gross cash at the end of 1991 totalled HKDollars 11.4bn (USDollars 1.47bn), roughly double the level in 1987 when the company decided to build its cash reserves. Cathay wanted the protection that liquidity brings if banks shy from lending to airlines. 'We wanted to be sure that in the event that Hong Kong got put into the 'too-difficult-to-manage-China-risk-basket' then we would have the cash we needed for development,' Mr Sutch says. 'We've got a 'war chest', if you like, so that if the banks foreclose on airlines in Hong Kong then we can keep going.' However, these policies for securing the airline's future have only laid the foundations for the years ahead; building on them requires imagination. Since 1987, the cost of running Cathay has doubled but profits have not. Last year, it cost HKDollars 16.5bn to produce revenues of HKDollars 20.1bn. Although the airline is well-positioned geographically, its home base has a chronic inflation problem, with price rises likely to remain in the low double digits for the foreseeable future. Although Cathay has ach-ieved productivity growth of about 3.5 per cent a year since the late 1980s, Mr Sutch admits there remains a lot to do. To this end Cathay will relocate half its computing operations to Sydney, Australia, and transfer more than 200 accounts function jobs to Guangzhou (Canton), China. It may also base air crew in other parts of the world. The introduction in the mid-1990s of Airbus A330s and Boeing 777s to replace ageing TriStars will increase capacity, save on maintenance costs and reduce flight crew numbers by a third. The rationale is simple. Land and labour costs - especially in China - are much lower than in Hong Kong. In Sydney, where land is cheap, there is the added benefit that many former Cathay computer systems engineers live there. 'In the same way that manufacturers found that Hong Kong was too expensive and went across the border, so are we,' says Mr Sutch. But, even with these moves, he admits it is unlikely that Cathay will return to the levels of profitability achieved in the late 1980s. At that time, it had gross operating margins of more than 25 per cent. 'I don't think we will see the very high returns of the late 1980s. They were exceptional and before Hong Kong's inflation rate settled into the double digits.' Cathay has remained aloof from the trend in civil aviation to form alliances with other airlines. But Mr Sutch foresees a time in three to five years when a loose alliance with a European, US and other Asian carrier might work. 'But I do not see any need for equity exchanges. If an alliance or relationship is put in place for good commercial reasons then those good commercial reasons should make it stick. Any alliance would have to meet the key requirements of increasing competitiveness, lowering costs and adding value for the customer. We are not there yet.'

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin by Muhammad </F> Wahbi -- place and date not given]    [Text] [Wahbi] Reports from Washington say that Dennis  Ross, U.S. coordinator of the peace process, and Martin Indyk,  President Clinton's assistant for Middle East affairs, will  arrive in the region to give impetus to the peace process,  particularly the Syrian-Israeli track. You have said that  President al-Asad has not done even one percent of what he  should be doing toward the peace process, but the Syrians say  that he has done much more than that. He has stated that he is  prepared to fully recognize Israel in exchange for full  withdrawal from the Golan. He also has gone a long way by  explaining to President Clinton what he means by a comprehensive  peace with Israel. Why don't you for your part travel the same  distance that President al-Asad has travelled by specifying what  you mean by withdrawal from the Golan?    [Rabin] First of all, I am not aware that the two U.S.  officials you have named will come to the region. As far as I  know, since it has been decided to resume the talks in  Washington at the end of April, U.S. Secretary of State  Christopher and the U.S. peace team will visit all the countries  participating in the peace process to get the process going.  This is all I can say in this regard. I am going to Moscow for  four days next month and when I come back, Christopher will be  in the region. He will visit Israel the week after next. In  the meantime, we are continuing the negotiations with the  Palestinians, primarily in Cairo. We are also negotiating with  them on economic issues in Paris. President Mubarak and the  Egyptian Government are hosting the negotiations in Cairo. I  believe that President Mubarak has made a great and positive  contribution toward continuing this process and eliminating the  obstacles facing it. As regards the other parties, undoubtedly  the position of Syria is of major importance to the peace  process. I have previously stated, and I still believe, that  Israel is a democratic state. Its people must be convinced, now  that we have entered the peace process, that we must achieve  peace with all parties in the region. Naturally, no one could  do what President al-Sadat did in terms of making a breakthrough  in the Arab-Israeli conflict. There is no doubt that President  Mubarak is developing and backing the peace resulting from this  breakthrough. As for Syria, I refer to what the newspaper  TISHRIN, the official paper in Syria, published two days ago.  It severely criticized Oman for hosting an Israeli delegation  to talk about water issues. If such an attitude shows a  readiness for peace on the part of Syria, then I don't know what  opposition to peace would be like. Also, do not forget that in  the joint news conference between Clinton and al-Asad following  their talks, in which you said the Syrian president explained  his definition of full peace, none of the Israeli papers were  invited to the conference. Israeli journalists were not allowed  to ask any questions. In addition, Syria is hosting antipeace  organizations. It allows the Ahmad Jibril-led organization and  others to attack the PLO for signing the Declaration of  Principles with Israel and the Cairo Agreement and at the same  time urges the Palestinians to undermine the peace process. More  serious than this is that Syria provides all facilities to all  types of attacks on Israel, whether from Lebanon or other  places. All this does not prove that Syria has made a strategic  decision to make peace with Israel.    I also do not believe in the possibility of achieving peace  with Syria without secret meetings. We all remember that a  secret meeting took place between Major General Hasan al-Tuhami  [an aide of late Egyptian President al-Sadat] and Moshe Dayan in  Morocco in 1977. We also remember that we were engaged with the  PLO in secret talks in Oslo over six months, after which a  Declaration of Principles was reached with the PLO.    Our government was the first Israeli Government to accept  Resolution 242 as a basis for peace with Syria, which includes  agreement to withdraw from the Golan as I have announced many  times before, and this prompted the Israelis to attack me.    However, the geographical dimension of the withdrawal cannot  be determined until after Israel knows the full meaning of the  Syrians' term full peace. President al-Asad may have explained  what that meant to President Clinton as you have indicated, but  I have no knowledge that Syria's delegate to the Washington  peace talks has explained this to his Israeli counterpart at the  talks. So I cannot understand the meaning of a full peace as  envisaged by the Syrians. Besides, the problems goes beyond the  mere linking of peace and withdrawal and we have to know the  meaning of peace, the extent of withdrawal, and the security  phases that this withdrawal will pass through.    Let me remind you that the Camp David Accord was reached  after one-year-long talks, from the time President al-Sadat  visited Jerusalem in November 1977 to September 1978, and  another six months were needed to reach a peace treaty in March  1979. Six months later we withdrew to the Ra's  Muhammad-al-'Arish Line and then began the normalization between  the two countries by exchanging embassies and we completed the  withdrawal beyond the border as was agreed upon in April 1982.    In the one-year period between President al-Sadat's visit to  Jerusalem and the signing of the Camp David Accord, the Israeli  prime minister was invited to Ismailia and the Mena House  Conference was held. We also held talks at the highest level  before the Camp David Accord, 13 days after Egyptian, Israeli,  and U.S. leaders met behind the walls of Camp David, which was  isolated from the rest of the world. So far, nothing of this  kind or similar to it has happened between us and Syria.    [Wahbi] I have spoken with some Syrians about your demand  for  secret talks with Syria, but they told me that the Palestinians'  experience in the secret talks with you does not really  encourage them to repeat the same experiment with you.    [Rabin] Why?    [Wahbi] Because of the many difficulties the Palestinians  are  encountering right now, particularly since some Palestinian  leaders believe that the PLO was cheated in the Oslo agreement.  The talks leading to that agreement were held in secret and no  third party, like the Americans, was represented in them.    [Rabin] The difficulties existing now are due to the fact  that the Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO  tackled much more complex matters than those that might  complicate matters between Israel and any other Arab state. An  agreement with any Arab state would mean defining peace,  dividing borders, withdrawal stages, and the interrelation  between a phased withdrawal and the normalization process. When  it comes to Palestinians, we are trying to attain a certain goal  in the peace process in its entirety. That goal is how to  establish peaceful coexistence between two geographically  overlapping entities. This creates much cause for strife on a  daily basis. Many other details will need to be tackled if you  want to guarantee success for peaceful coexistence between these  two overlapping entities.    Moreover, there are people among both Palestinians and  Israelis who oppose peace and want to ruin it. Among the  Palestinians, extremist groups like "Hamas" and al-Jihad  Organization practice terrorism, although they know very well  that the Israeli people accept a political solution. But most  of these Israelis ask: If this solution does not bring peace to  us in our daily life, what kind of peace do you seek through the  current peace process? The operations that "Hamas" and al-Jihad  are carrying out create a vicious circle of violence between the  two sides. This makes an agreement with the Palestinians much  more difficult than with any Arab state.    [Wahbi] Egypt used to say to our Arab brothers that Israel  can be very difficult and might insist on the smallest details  in negotiations, but it implements any agreement it signs to  the letter. I have to tell you that many of us have difficulty  in repeating what we used to say to Arabs about the Israelis.    [Rabin] Why? Why?    [Wahbi] Since you say that agreed dates for implementing the  Declaration of Principles are not sacred, what prevents you from  announcing later on that any of the Declaration's words is not  sacred?    [Rabin] I will only give you an example to show you that  there is no justification whatsoever for saying that. We did  not delay for a single day any previously agreed date for  negotiations with the Palestinians. They delayed negotiations  with us for a month. The opponents of peace in Israel asked me  why I did not suspend negotiations with the Palestinians after  the killing of Israelis in the "Afula and Hadera" incidents. I  told them that if we did that in reaction to those who killed  the Israelis with the goal of ruining the peace process we would  be giving the perpetrators the best reward for their actions.    We did not delay negotiations for a single day. The  Palestinians have to realize that they cannot say that dates are  sacred. They said that they were delaying talks for a month  because of a certain horrid incident to achieve what was agreed  upon and to show commitment to the dates specified in the  Declaration of Principles. However, I say that if both sides are  prepared to reach middle solutions, which they have already done  several times, we will implement the agreement on putting the  Declaration of Principles into effect within two or three weeks  at the most after signing it.    [Wahbi] It is also being said that if Rabin is causing all  these difficulties while negotiating about the implementation of  an agreement that is not related to the questions of  sovereignty, the settlements, and Jerusalem, which have been  postponed until negotiations on the final status of the occupied  territories start, then what kind of difficulties could he cause  when the time comes to discuss these topics at the final stage  of the negotiations?    [Rabin] Why are these suspicions raised? The Palestinians  and Israelis have agreed that their agreement would not be the  same as Israel's agreement with the other Arab states. First of  all, the Palestinians do not represent a country, but an  organization. Second, it was clear to them and to us that when  the facts change and when the Palestinians are able to run every  aspect of their life, cities, villages and the enormous  responsibilities that this entails, the more difficult issues  can then be handled. This is because they would then be in a  better position to handle such issues. Also, the atmosphere  then would be more suitable because bridges of confidence  between the two peoples will have been built, or at least the  mutual hatred and suspicions will have eased.    [Wahbi] It is known that the self-rule idea goes back to the  Likud and to [Zionist leader] Jabotinsky. The Labor Party has  always talked about regional solutions that involve exchanging  land for peace. Why, then, this exaggerated insistence by the  Labor Party on the terms of the self-rule?    [Rabin] First of all, the Palestinians do not like to use  the term self-rule because it appeared in the Camp David Accord.  They prefer to use the abbreviation PISGA, which stands for  Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority. For our part, we  have decided not to get into an argument with them over names.  Thus, the term self-rule was mentioned in the letter of  invitation to the Madrid Conference on this basis. For me, I  believe that there are two stages: a transitional stage for  building bridges of confidence and changing some realities, then  comes the stage in which the final solution will be handled and  in which we will be ready for regional solutions. We have  pointed out that we do not want to assume responsibility for  most of the Palestinians in the territories, but this does not  mean that we will be prepared to withdraw to the pre-1967 lines.    [Wahbi] It is said that by creating obstacles to the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles, Rabin is  damaging the credibility of the moderate Arab forces,  particularly Yasir 'Arafat's position. It is also said that if  Rabin continues to create such obstacles, this will cause chaos  in the occupied territories and might cause problems for Israel  itself. What is your comment?    [Rabin] I am not creating any problems, nor am I delaying  the  implementation of any agreement. If you read the Declaration of  Principles you will be certain that agreement has to be reached  through negotiations on each phase stipulated in the Declaration.    We have not postponed the negotiations and are ready to  pursue the efforts to reach an agreement that will realize the  goals of the transitional phase, overwhelm the opposition from  some forces on both sides, achieve security for the Israelis,  and grant the Palestinian council the authority to run the  Palestinians' affairs.    [Wahbi] I believe you have promised to face the problem of  the settlements in the future. The question now is how can you  deal with this difficult problem with all the trouble it entails  if you are currently refusing to evacuate about 20-30 settlers  from (Notetrim) settlement and also refuse to evacuate a handful  of settlers from Hebron even after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque  massacre?    [Rabin] Because the agreement is very clear. It stipulates  that all settlements will remain during the transitional phase  and the PLO has signed that agreement. We will turn to the  settlements when we negotiate a final solution. I expect the  Palestinians to honor their commitments as they expect me to  honor mine.    [Wahbi] About two weeks ago Israeli television showed a  documentary in which the camera proved that the settlers, at  least in some case, issue orders to the Israel army instead of  the army issuing orders to them. How true is this?    [Rabin] I have not seen this program, although I heard about  it. In any case, that situation does not exist and for our part  we will prevent that from happening. We have issued additional  orders to make sure that such an impression is not made in  future, because the army is responsible for the security of both  the Palestinians and Israelis and that is its role.    [Wahbi] It is also being said that you are using the talks  with the Palestinians to pressure the Syrians and vice versa.  Why don't you negotiate with everybody at the same time and with  the same zeal?    [Rabin] We have not suspended the Washington talks, the  Syrians decided to suspend them, then the other parties followed  suit. We are not engaged in any "game" at the expense of other  parties. We deal with every Arab party on the basis of the  chances of success that each issue presents. We thought we were  close to reaching an agreement with Jordan, but unfortunately  our efforts have not brought results. For our part, we have no  regional problems with Jordan basically. We have absolutely no  regional problems with Lebanon, but there are security problems  because the Lebanese Government does not enjoy sovereignty over  all its territories. We are not after a single inch of Lebanese  territory. There are international borders between us and  Lebanon. All we want is for the government there to be able to  disengage [as published] the private military groups, such as  the Druze and Phalangist militias and others. So far, the  Lebanese Government has not done anything to prove its ability  to control south Lebanon.    [Wahbi] Let me ask one final question, which concerns  Israel's internal affairs. How far is Foreign Minister Peres  authorized by you to negotiate with the Palestinians? In other  words, does Minister Peres have a real and full authorization to  reach an agreement with the PLO or do you keep the final  decision on the Palestinians in your hands? If so, why do you  refuse to meet with President 'Arafat, with whom you have not  met for a long time?    [Rabin] Every time Peres met with 'Arafat he had full  authorization, and reports about a limited authorization are  nothing but nonsense. Also, I believe that no one should  recommend a meeting between me and Chairman 'Arafat before  everything is made to prepare for such a meeting. This is  because if we meet and fail to reach an agreement, it will cause  disappointment and frustration that in fact will defeat our  purpose of reaching an agreement that can be implemented.</p>

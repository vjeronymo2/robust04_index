			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Pak Tu-sik on 10 February news conference in </F> Washington, D.C. by Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu]    [Text] Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu, who left for the  United States in a hurry with about 10 days to face the deadline  for resolving the North Korean nuclear issue through dialogue,  held a news conference with his accompanying reporters and  Korean correspondents stationed in Washington after meeting U.S.  Vice President Al Gore on 10 February. The following is a brief  of the news conference:    [Unidentified reporter] What do the ROK and U.S. Governments  think is the reason North Korea is not allowing nuclear  inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency [IAEA]?    [Han Sung-chu] There are various analyses. First, the  restriction posed by the North Korean political and policymaking  structure may be the reason. Second, it may be North Korea's  negotiation strategy. In this case, it is possible that the  situation will dramatically be reversed right before the IAEA  Board of Governors meeting to be held on 21 February. The  situation, however, would be pessimistic if we are under a  fundamentally limited situation [kibonjok hangye sanghwang]  (this seems to mean in case North Korea possesses nuclear  weapons or feels uneasy for fear of the disclosure of its  nuclear development), in which it is impossible to resolve the  nuclear inspection issue.    [Unidentified reporter] Is it possible to refer the issue to  the UN Security Council? Does the ROK agree on this?    [Han] It is hard to ignore any possibility at present. We  will continue dialogue to the last, but will seek an alternate  effort [tarun chawonui noryogul moseakhal kosida] if our effort  for dialogue ultimately comes up against a wall. We will  respect the international agency's decision on the North Korean  nuclear issue.    [Unidentified reporter] Have you delivered our protest  against U.S. media reports on rumors about a crisis on the  Korean peninsula?    [Han] It is unreasonable to make a protest to the U.S.  Government against those reports because they were made by  independent U.S. media. However, I will express our concern  about the fact that some media reports can make people  misunderstand the current situation.    [Unidentified reporter] Do the United States and North Korea  have any intention to resume their contacts in New York?    [Han] The possibility of their exchange of opinion through  New York remains open, but not the resumption of contacts. They  may use some means of communication. They just think that this  is better than nothing in order to improve the situation. The  United States will, however, hardly attempt dialogue on its own  initiative.    [Unidentified reporter] There is the rumor that the U.S.  State Department's recent attempt to resume contacts with North  Korea in New York has failed because of the objection by the  U.S. Department of Defense. Is this true?    [Han] As far as the ROK Government knows, it is not true.    [Unidentified reporter] Could you confirm, through a series  of talks, the confrontation between the hardliners and the  moderates inside the U.S. Government?    [Han] It is not right to divide all matters into toughness  and moderateness. The ROK and U.S. Governments have invariably  maintained the position that they will try to solve the North  Korean nuclear issue through dialogue, and if this method does  not work, they will carry a stick, too. The mobilization of  strong measures is being made by the international situation,  not by the will of the ROK and U.S. Governments.    [Unidentified reporter] How will the situation develop after  the referral of the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council?    [Han] The effort for dialogue will be continued even after  the issue is referred to the UN Security Council, but the  reality will make it difficult. Two methods are being  considered. One is the gradual increasing of sanctions  beginning with light ones, such as the adoption of a resolution  urging North Korea to allow inspections and diplomatic  sanctions, and the other is applying certain sanctions during a  short period. They have not decided yet which one to choose.    [Unidentified reporter] Do South and North Korea have any  intention to attempt direct dialogue between themselves?    [Han] We have insisted on and urged holding South-North  dialogue on the nuclear issue. North Korea, however, has not  acceded to it.    [Unidentified reporter] What will be discussed if North  Korean-U.S. dialogue is resumed at North Korea's request?    [Han] There are various possibilities. North Korea may  demand that the United States lessen [wanhwa] the scope of  nuclear inspections by the IAEA or that the United States  confirm the inspections are not to be conducted as an obligation  under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. The U.S. position  is, however, that this is what has been agreed between North  Korea and the IAEA. North Korea may also demand that the United  States remove tension caused by U.S. moves, such as the  reinforcement of its combat strength on the Korean peninsula,  and guarantee the validity of the U.S.-North Korean agreement  reached in New York late last year.</p>

			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Bank agrees to limit credit expansion THE Russian central bank has agreed to credit expansion limits set by the government, in a move designed to strengthen Russia's credibility with aid donors at tomorrow's meeting in Tokyo. The agreement was termed 'a historic event' by Deputy Prime Minister Boris Fyodorov, who says it means there is hope for a restrictive monetary and credit policy, without which western financial assistance would be wasted. Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman who has come under heavy pressure from Mr Fyodorov to co-operate, said yesterday the bank's board of directors had decided to 'give the limits a try'. But he quickly poured cold water on the agreement, saying the government was 'unlikely to be able to stick to it'. 'In June they'll have to give teachers advance pay for their summer vacation. So what will the government do then? It will ask the central bank for money,' he said. 'The only alternative to injecting more money will be to continue fasting until September.' The proposed limit is for central bank credit in the second quarter of this year to increase no more than 30 per cent from the first quarter. According to Mr Fyodorov, inflation in March was down to 18 per cent a month from 30 per cent in January. Mr Fyodorov has said he would applaud the central bank if it cut off funds to the government when the limits are exceeded. But this is unlikely to happen in practice, if only because the bank will not want to take sole responsibility for the consequences of refusing government pleas for more money. Mr Gerashchenko says that rather than blame him for printing money, the government should slash budget expenditure, introduce competition and limit wage increases to help fight inflation. Having blamed the high inflation and constant fall of the rouble on the central bank, Mr Fyodorov has already retreated from some of the demands he made of the bank when he took office in December. He first said the government should be made to pay a new increased interest rate of 100 per cent for central bank loans just like commercial banks, but the Finance Ministry is now to continue paying just 10 per cent - in order to avoid a big increase in the budget deficit. Mr Fyodorov, who says spending pressure is such that satisfying various ministries' demands would require a budget twice as big as envisaged, sees western financial assistance as a cushion to cut expenditure gradually and help reduce inflation generated by the printing of money. Western governments have been worried about the level of inflation in Russia, fuelled by the printing of money to finance state-owned businesses and the government deficit. US officials say, however, that an aid package that provided other sources of finance for businesses and the budget deficit could contribute to bringing inflation under control.</p>

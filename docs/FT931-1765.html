			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Life fund exercise leads to share rise SHARES of life insurance companies rose sharply in London yesterday following an announcement from United Friendly Group that it is studying ways to allocate a greater portion of its reserves to shareholders. United Friendly's shares closed 65p higher at 715p on the news. Industry analysts estimate the exercise, which requires the permission of the Department of Trade and Industry, could as much as double the value of shareholders' assets. Mr Roman Cizden, analyst at stockbroker Smith New Court, said 'This company has been even more squirrel-like than some' in building reserves against future liabilities. While life funds must hold reserves to cover past bonuses awarded on policies that have not yet matured, individual companies have scope to vary the amount of reserves they need to hold for future bonuses. Mr George Mack, finance director, said the company was examining its so-called unallocated reserves within the Pounds 2bn life fund to see whether a portion of them can be safely allocated to shareholders. 'The question is how much of these unallocated reserves are needed to protect the reasonable expectations of policyholders,' he said. If United Friendly decides it has been too conservative in building reserves, assets per share could rise to as much as Pounds 6.40 from the current level of Pounds 3.25, industry analysts said. Mr Mack said that the exercise was in line with that taken by several other UK life insurers, partly out of concern that failure to display the full value of shareholders assets would leave the company vulnerable to a predator. The acquisition of Pearl Assurance in 1989 by Australian insurance group AMP was widely seen as undervaluing the shares of Pearl. Since then, life insurance companies have been examining ways to reflect the true value of shareholders' funds in their balance sheets. United Friendly has appointed an independent actuary, Mr Richard Squires, partner at R Watsons and Sons, to make an independent assessment of the company's roughly Pounds 2bn life fund.

			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / International Company News: Cragnotti faces accusations over Canadian deals The Ontario Securities Commission has accused Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the prominent Italian financier, of securities law violations involving Lawson Mardon, the international packaging group controlled by Mr Cragnotti's investment company. The OSC said yesterday it expected Mr Cragnotti and one of his business associates, Mr Roberto Marziale, to submit a settlement proposal at a hearing in Toronto tomorrow. Lawyers and OSC officials declined to disclose the terms of the proposed settlement. But similar cases have involved payments totalling several million dollars and a suspension of trading privileges. Mr Cragnotti was arrested in Italy last month on suspicion of involvement in the Enimont bribes scandal. He has subsequently been released. His company, Cragnotti and Partners, recently agreed to tender its 52 per cent voting stake in Lawson Mardon to Alusuisse-Lonza Holding, the Swiss industrial group. Alusuisse is in the midst of a due diligence examination before deciding whether to proceed with a CDollars 555m (USDollars 417) offer for all Lawson shares. Although Lawson's head office is on the outskirts of Toronto, about four-fifths of its revenues come from Europe, mainly the UK. An Alusuisse representative in Toronto said yesterday the allegations against Mr Cragnotti will not affect the proposed offer. He said the Swiss company has known 'for some time' about the OSC's investigation. The commission alleged that Mr Cragnotti and Mr Marziale 'knowingly participated' in the trading of Lawson shares through nominee accounts during 1992 and 1993 'so as to create a false and misleading appearance of trading activity and an artificial price'. The commission also accused the two men of insider trading ahead of an equity offering by Lawson in October 1992. It alleged they made 'misrepresentations' to the commission during the initial stages of its investigation.</p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Arts: Selling Weill at the Proms FROM the 1960s to the '80s, many classical musicians, music-lovers and music-promoters saw Kurt Weill as the (dead) composer most likely to bring together the distinct audiences for popular music and 'serious' concerts: a consummation devoutly wished by many, if on hazy grounds. The Brecht-Weill Threepenny Opera had been triumphantly resuscitated off-Broadway toward the end of the 1950s, and 'Mack the Knife' reached the American hit-parade, while a handful of other Weill songs became late-night listening - chiefly on LPs by Lotte Lenya, Weill's widow - among sophisticated folk, especially left-liberals. Since anyone with a judicious ear could hear that Weill was much more than just a tunesmith, and the smug European consensus that the (profitable) music of his American exile represented an unworthy decline was already passe, he seemed to offer a bridge across an embarrassing musical barrier. Yet hardly anyone crossed it. The people who took to his catchiest theatre-songs do not come to revivals of his harder, less ingratiating pieces, and many of his highbrow admirers are still shy of admitting Gershwin or Cole Porter to the same canon. The first of Wednesday's two Prom concerts tried a brave new tack. Conducting his Matrix Ensemble, Robert Ziegler offered a programme of jazz- and black-influenced German music, comprising some unusually 'authentic' Weill, his contemporary Wilhelm Grosz's cycle of Afrika-Songs, and Bernd Alois Zimmermann's 1954 trumpet concerto on 'Nobody knows de trouble I see' (typically troubled, looking-both-ways Zimmermann - serialism and modernism v. honest Heart - pointedly delivered here by Hakan Hardenberger). Grosz's 1930 cycle displays impeccably decent sympathies, but also his incurable knack for bland, memorable tunes, of the same ilk as his 'Red Sails in the Sunset', though nobody remembers him for that. The concert began with the Brecht-Weill Mahagonny-Songspiel. Not the hybrid Kleine Mahagonny, which was amiably eked out with extra songs from their later 'opera' Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny (also about capitalist temptations and catastrophe), but the original 1927 sequence of prickly vocal numbers with acrid instrumental interludes. The emollient Grosz cycle might have been chosen deliberately to set Weill's tougher virtues in proper relief. In the second half we had Cry, the Beloved Country, David Drew's well-calculated arrangement of numbers from Weill's 'musical tragedy' Lost in the Stars, for Broadway - not linked by any dialogue, but by sober narration from Weill's and Maxwell Anderson's source, the celebrated South African novel by Alan Paton. Drew's focus is clinically fixed on the larger social issues, to decently wrenching effect; but Weill's own calculated vein of American uplift is discreetly expunged, even to the starry-eyed title-song. Yet Drew, than whom nobody knows Weill's music better, would surely agreed that the composer's best European theatre-music relied upon dramatic context for its scathing ironies. (The most vicious people and their deeds got the most elegant tunes.) It seems to me that the later Weill's Broadway shows were just as meticulously planned wholes as before; can it be right simply to jettison his 'sentimental', too-American stuff in favour of the politically right-on numbers? Among the vocal soloists in all this music Janis Kelly and Jake Gardner made consistent marks, and Damon Evans pushed his light tenor hard enough to score. Cynthia Clarey's equally light, pretty soprano was often threatened by Weill's quaintly jazzy brass and saxes, like the supporting male quartet in Mahagonny. Still, their plucky efforts were appealingly human. In the second Prom of that evening, seven singers from Anthony Rooley's Consort of Musicke were so practised, so elaborately subtle and balanced and secure (and English) in Monteverdi's 6th Book of madrigals that I was driven to imagining what flamboyant, volatile, self-advertising Italians might have sounded like instead.</p>

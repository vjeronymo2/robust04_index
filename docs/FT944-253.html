			<p>941230 FT  30 DEC 94 / Upturn brings record fall in business failures Business failures fell sharply this year as economic recovery gathered strength and lifted the fortunes of small as well as large businesses, Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group, reported today. Its latest annual tally of business liquidations and bankruptcies showed a record 16.3 per cent drop in failures in England and Wales to 40,255 this year from 48,066 in 1993. The drop for mainland Britain, including Scotland, was more pronounced at 21.8 per cent to 43,598 in 1994 from 55,733 last year. This reflected a sharp 56.4 per cent decline in Scottish business failures over the year to 3,343 from 7,667 in 1993, following changes in Scottish bankruptcy regulations which reduced the financial incentive for companies to be placed in bankruptcy. The news was hailed by Mr Anthony Nelson, Treasury minister, who said this largest recorded drop in the failure rate of businesses would boost confidence in job security and job opportunities. He said that an increasing number of small businesses, which account for most of the growth in employment, could look forward to a more prosperous new year. Mr Philip Mellor, Dun &amp; Bradstreet's senior analyst, said the last time the number of business failures in Britain fell as sharply as this year was in 1987, before the recession. However, at that time the number of companies going out of business was far smaller, at less than 20,000 in England and Wales. Mr Mellor said that 'perhaps the most encouraging part' of this year's figures was that they showed small businesses were now participating in the recovery. Dun &amp; Bradstreet takes the view that the bankruptcy figures are a good proxy for small-company failures, while medium and large companies go into liquidation. After stripping out the exceptional Scottish figures, the statistics for England and Wales showed a 15 per cent drop in bankruptcies to 24,505 this year from 28,846 in 1993. This was only slightly below the 18 per cent fall in liquidations to 15,750 this year from 19,220 last year. Earlier in the recovery, the drop in the failure rate of medium to large businesses was much bigger than the drop for small businesses. In Scotland, the number of bankruptcies dropped to 2,758 this year from 7,215 while liquidations increased to 585 from 452. Mr Mellor said the relative strength of the small-company sector was highlighted in a sharp 28 per cent fall for both bankruptcies and liquidations in the west Midlands, where the export-led recovery was benefiting both large companies and their suppliers. Elsewhere, company failures fell sharply - by between 17 per cent and 18 per cent in the north-west, north-east and south-east, excluding London, where the fall was 14.7 per cent. Liquidations were concentrated in London - with just over 29 per cent of the British total in 1994 and 1993 - and south-east England, with slightly more than 22 per cent in both years. Bankruptcies were concentrated in south-east and south-west England, and Scotland.</p>

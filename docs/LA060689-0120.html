			<p><P> June 6, 1989, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> FIND IT IN FARSI;  </P> <P> HELPED BY INFLUX OF IMMIGRANTS, IRANIAN YELLOW PAGES GROW THICK  </P> <P> It's taking fingers longer every year to walk through the Iranian Yellow Pages.  </P> <P> Eight years ago, Sohrab Rostamian and Bijan Khalili, who fled their homeland  amid Iran's revolutionary chaos in the late 1970s, published a 96-page  telephone directory of businesses owned by the growing number of Iranian  refugees in Southern California.  </P> <P> This year, the Iranian Yellow Pages is 848 pages long, listing about 1,600  businesses and professionals. The number of Iranian dentists, for example, that  are listed in the book has climbed from six to 91. Rostamian and Khalili have  set up a 411-like information service to give callers telephone numbers of  Iranian businesses in their native Farsi language.  </P> <P> The reason for the growth of Ketab Corp., the Van Nuys parent company the two  men own and run, is that Southern California, particularly the West San  Fernando Valley, has become home to the largest concentration of Iranians in  the United States. Most fled Iran in the wake of the 1979 revolution led by the  Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who died Saturday. As many as 300,000 Iranians are  believed to be living in Southern California, including some 30,000 Iranian  Jews such as Rostamian and Khalili.  </P> <P> A large number of the Iranians in the United States came from the nation's  elite group of professionals such as doctors, lawyers and engineers. Some have  established large, well-known businesses. The Bijan boutiques in Beverly Hills  and New York were founded by Iranian-born designer Bijan Pakzad. Adrays, a  chain of discount electronics stores, was started by Iranian Masud Hakim and  two partners. Iran-born developer Kambiz Hemkat is building the 22-story Center  West tower in Westwood.  </P> <P> Most of Rostamian's and Khalili's advertisers in the 1989 Iranian Yellow Pages  paid $650 a year for a full-page ad. Businesses also are listed in a computer  database of numbers given to people who call the information line. Some 34,000  copies of the yellow pages are distributed free and are used by nearly 200,000  Iranians, the partners estimated.  </P> <P> Most information in the Iranian Yellow Pages is written in Farsi, with a small  amount of English scattered throughout. Pages are numbered from right to left  because that is how Iranian books are numbered.  </P> <P> A standard yellow pages logo, showing two fingers walking across the pages of a  book, adorns the front of the book as well as Ketab's headquarters building on  Van Nuys Boulevard. The main difference is that the fingers are walking on  pages of green, white and red, the colors of the Iranian flag.  </P> <P> Most of the advertisers are professionals or small-to-medium-sized businesses.  Beverly Hills urologist James Elist, who moved to the United States from Iran  in 1976, said that two to three patients a week locate him through the Iranian  Yellow Pages. Some large firms, such as brokerage houses and insurance  companies, advertise in the directory, typically featuring Iranian employees in  their ads.  </P> <P> Ketab Corp. is grossing about $1 million a year, compared to about $80,000 in  1981. Ketab (which means "book" in Farsi) has a direct-mail service to  Iranians. Two years ago, the information line was started (818-908-0808,  because "08" was once the information number in Iran, equivalent to the U.S.  use of 411.)  </P> <P> Ketab also operates a bookstore in Westwood for Iranians. (The bookstore does  not sell Salman Rushdie's "The Satanic Verses," the novel that inspired  </P> <P> Khomeini to call for the death of Rushdie. Rostamian and Khalili say they don't  want trouble.)  </P> <P> Rostamian, 38, an agricultural engineer by training, and Khalili, 38, a civil  engineer, are both natives of Tehran and became friends while studying during  the late 1960s at Pahlavi University, now the University of Shiraz, about 500  miles south of Tehran.  </P> <P> Fearing that trouble was coming, Rostamian left Iran for Europe in 1978 just  before the revolution, arriving in Los Angeles in 1979. Khalili left Iran in  1980, traveling first to Switzerland and then to Los Angeles, where he arrived  on Thanksgiving Day.  </P> <P> Growth in the number of Iranians in Southern California is one obvious reason  for growth in Rostamian's and Khalili's business.  </P> <P> But Rostamian has another interesting theory. He said many Iranian exiles  thought Khomeini's regime would only last a year or two and, sensing they would  be returning home soon, did not establish roots.  </P> <P> "Many people didn't even unpack the first year," Rostamian said.  </P> <P> When it became clear that they were wrong, he said, people began settling down  and starting businesses and establishing practices that have started to thrive  the past few years.  </P> <P> Smaller Iranian Yellow Pages are published in Northern California, New York,  Houston and Atlanta. The Southern California version includes listings from  those areas.  </P> <P> Directories such as the Iranian Yellow Pages are part of a growing trend in  yellow pages -- a generic name used widely -- that are being published for  target ethnic groups. There are about 80 second-language, or non-English,  yellow pages across the country. Yellow pages featuring Vietnamese-owned  businesses have been published in Northern and Southern California. Direct  Language Publishing in San Francisco, the largest second-language yellow pages  company, publishes five Asian-language yellow pages in Northern California and  15 Spanish yellow pages throughout California and Arizona.  </P> <P> One reason the publications are often successful is that immigrants often want  to do business with other people from their home countries.  </P> <P> "When you have big pockets of ethnic groups it makes sense. There have been  quite a few attempts to demographically segment the market," said Larry Small,  vice president of marketing for the Yellow Pages Publishers Assn. in Troy,  Mich.  </P></p>

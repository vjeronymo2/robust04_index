			<p>Mid-March   <F P=102>   94AF0179A Algiers ALGER REPUBLICAIN in French 6 Apr 94 p 3 </F> <F P=103> 94AF0179A </F> <F P=104>  Algiers ALGER REPUBLICAIN </F> <F P=105>  French </F> CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Mohamed D.: "New Security Dynamic: Hundreds of </F> Terrorists Eliminated"]    [Text] So, according to our estimate, these operations made  it possible to disable hundreds of barbarians from being able to  do harm.    Since the start of this campaign in mid-March, close to 400  terrorists have been killed and just as many arrested. Cities  such as Blida, Chlef, Medea, Kseur-el-Boukhari, and, most  recently, Tiaret, which were said to be "hard to reach," have  been cleaned of their savage hordes.    In the same spirit, the special courts (responsible for  cases  of terrorism and subversion) have been reactivated. Hundreds of  Islamic fundamentalists arrested for having been part of armed  groups and taking part in assassinations, hold-ups, acts of  sabotage, etc. have started appearing in front of these agencies  of the law. Close to 350 terrorists are supposed to appear this  month in the Algiers special court alone.    In Oran, several terrorists groups appear in court each day.  Stiff sentences are handed down. They thus pay for the crimes  they have committed.    Knowledgeable observers are delighted with these new  measures. "The armed arms of Islamic fundamentalism," they say,  "have been pinned back; but that is not enough. These new  measures should be accompanied by radical policy decisions and  fundamentalism should be fought tooth and nail."    Indeed this experience has shown that security measures  alone  are not enough. Policy action is even more important.    As for the Islamic fundamentalists, they have understood  this. They have divided up the tasks. Some kill, others talk.  Among the latter, some harden the tone and others appear  conciliatory.    One single objective unites them. The establishment of an  Islamic state.    On this subject, chahid Boudiaf said: "Stopping the  electoral  process had become necessary. Using Islam for partisan and  political means, demagoguery and lies for some time were able to  achieve an impact on those in this system who were excluded, on  marginalized people. To this should be added the complicity of  certain areas of the government."    "Today it becomes more and more evident that collusion  exists  between the party in power, fundamentalism, and, unfortunately,  a certain partisan opposition..."    Thus continuing to believe that it is possible to contain  the  fundamentalists through legal means is but an illusion.    This could be fatal for the country.    As for those who talk about respecting the constitution, it  might be time for them to think of implementing it. Law No.  89-II dated 5 July 1989 pertaining to political associations  says in its Article 4, final paragraph: "furthermore the  political association cannot base its creation or actions on an  exclusively religious, linguistic, regional, sexual, racial, or  certain professional status basis."    The law could not be clearer. This paragraph bans the former  Islamic Salvation Front [FIS], Hamas [Islamic Society Movement],  Ennahda, and all their satellites.    As we have often emphasized, Islamic fundamentalism is  ruthless towards the weak. The more you make concessions to it,  the more it demands. It knows no bounds. It is not generous.  Delays are not its problem. It wants everything and wants it now.    To fail to understand this policy would be to play into  their  hands.</p>

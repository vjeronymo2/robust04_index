			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Observer: Ken's plug? Kenneth Clarke boasted to the annual CBI dinner on Tuesday about how he had 'let the Bank (of England) loose to write its own inflation report', the idea being that the truth would kill off a good story. But the most recent report proved so exciting that the contents of someone's advance copy were leaked straight to the gilts market. A memo now goes out saying that journalists will be incarcerated at the Old Lady under supervision for a full two hours before the thing hits the wires. With that kind of time on their hands, who knows what kind of good stories the journos will be able to fabricate.</p>

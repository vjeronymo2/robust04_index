			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 7 KYODO -- Japan's Trade Ministry on  Monday [7 March] urged U.S. flat glass makers to strive harder  to enter the Japanese market. Japanese flat glass makers have  done all they could to promote fair competition while their U.S.  counterparts' efforts to do business in this country have been  insufficient, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) said.    Citing the latest poll on Japanese wholesalers of flat  glass,  MITI said 11.4 percent of those polled handle imported flat  glass, an increase from 5.7 percent in the previous June 1993  survey.    The data does not necessarily suggest that the remaining  88.6  percent or 303 firms are reluctant to import foreign-made flat  glass, MITI said, noting that most responded they had no records  of buying foreign products just because they have not received  any inquiries from foreign makers. Of the 303 wholesalers, only  74 reported having had contact from foreign firms whose efforts  were described as limited by 53 wholesalers in failing to  progress beyond exchanging greetings or sending direct mail,  MITI said.    The survey was conducted from November through December 1993  with 385 wholesalers belonging to the nationwide flat glass  wholesalers' group. Of the total, 342 responded.    A MITI official said the survey was conducted to check the  openness of Japan's flat glass market following the enforcement  of a variety of market-opening measures after then U.S.  President George Bush's visit to Japan in January 1992.    Based on the "Tokyo Declaration on the U.S.-Japan Global  Partnership" signed during Bush's Japan visit, MITI formulated  an antitrust program for Japan's three major flat glass makers,  encouraged users to step up imports and encouraged greater  efforts by foreign makers, the official said.    The U.S. often describes Japan's flat glass distribution  system as exclusive of imports but Washington's "distorted  perception" of the Japanese market as closed should be  rectified, the official said.    The MITI official said Japan's top glass maker Asahi Glass  Co. has scrapped shady pricing systems and "a progressive rebate  system," a practice that has drawn foreign criticism as  exclusionary by promoting wholesale buying only from a single  maker.    The two other major glass makers also unveiled a plan to  abolish these practices from April, the official said.    In the latest survey, 30 of 39 wholesalers that handle  foreign products cited further qualitative improvement as a top  condition for increasing purchases from foreign companies in the  future. In contrast, only three of the 39 firms cited quality  as a reason for handling foreign products.    Japan's flat glass imports from the U.S. surged 27 percent  in  1993, the official said.    Imports could rise in the future if foreign makers improved  quality, prices and delivery, the official said.</p>

			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Vodka and gold prices freed The Russian government yesterday freed the price of vodka and gold, implementing moves promised by the government earlier this year, writes Leyla Boulton. Other price controls are due to be phased out under a programme being fleshed out with the International Monetary Fund. The state is to keep its monopoly on production of spirits, although it yesterday gave up its monopoly on the production of beer and wine.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> AROUND THE NFL;  </P> <P> PAUL BROWN IN HOSPITAL WITH BLOOD CLOT  </P> <P> Cincinnati Bengal founder Paul Brown is recoverying from a blood clot in his  leg that forced him to be hospitalized during the weekend, according to the  team's doctor.  </P> <P> Dr. Robert Heidt Jr. said the problem wasn't serious, and Brown should be able  to go home today.  </P> <P> Brown, 82, was in Christ Hospital when his team lost to the San Francisco  49ers, 20-17, in overtime Sunday. It was the first time Brown had missed one of  the Bengals' home games.  </P> <P> Winless in his first four games as the Cleveland Browns' head coach, Jim  Shofner has given up any hope of returning to the same job next season.  </P> <P> "Obviously, I wasn't the answer," Shofner said Monday. "Certainly I inherited a  lot of circumstances. You can say there are all these reasons why, and maybe  they're legitimate. But it still adds up to the same thing -- I didn't get it  done."  </P> <P> The Browns lost to Houston, 58-14, Sunday, giving up more points than they had  ever given up in a regular-season game.  </P> <P> Chicago Bear Coach Mike Ditka got into a heated exchange with a reporter  Monday, broke off his weekly news conference and stomped out of the room.  </P> <P> The outburst was triggered when Red Mottlow of Chicago's WFYR radio asked Ditka  about the Bears' offensive showing in Sunday's 10-9 loss to the Washington  Redskins.  </P> <P> "What's wrong?" Mottlow asked.  </P> <P> Ditka replied: "They got a pretty good defense, Red, and they stopped us! Why  don't you talk about how good they played instead of our problems."  </P> <P> Ditka then swore and told Mottlow, "You're a joke."  </P> <P> After somebody else asked a question, Ditka said, "You want to get answers to  what you need, get them from Red Mottlow. He's the expert on everything."  </P></p>

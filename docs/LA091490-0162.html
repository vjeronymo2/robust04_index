			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BESSIES VIE WITH BOOS AT N.Y. AWARDS;  </P> <P> DANCE: PROTESTERS CALL FOR PHILIP MORRIS, PARTIAL SPONSOR OF THE DANCE AND  PERFORMANCE AWARDS, TO STOP SUPPORT OF SEN. JESSE HELMS.  </P> <P> The scene outside the Brooklyn Academy of Music suggested a political rally  rather than an awards ceremony. Self-styled cigarette girls and Marlboro men  handed out rolled-up "Helmsboros," flyers calling on Philip Morris to cease  supporting Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and urging a boycott of Philip Morris  products.  </P> <P> Indeed, the name invoked most often Wednesday evening at the seventh annual New  York Dance and Performance Awards (or Bessies as the awards are known) was not  that of a performing artist but of Helms, whose efforts to impose restrictions  on National Endowment for the Arts grants have inspired an activist response  within New York's performing arts community.  </P> <P> Both scheduled hosts for the event -- performance artist Karen Finley (who won  a Bessie) and actress Danitra Vance -- withdrew to protest the partial  sponsorship of the evening by Philip Morris Co. Inc. Philip Morris, which also  supports the Next Wave Festival and a number of other arts events, is a major  donor to Helms' current re-election campaign and a planned center to store  Helms' papers.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Stephanie French, a Philip Morris vice president, confirmed the  company's continuing support for the Bessies as well as Helms. "Not all  viewpoints were represented last night. We support Helms because of our tobacco  interests. This does not mean we agree with him on other public-policy issues."  </P> <P> Inside the BAM Opera House, the 3 1/2-hour ceremony was evenly divided between  political pep talks (anti-Helms, outspokenly gay, and in support of an  unrestricted NEA) and the awarding of the Bessies.  </P> <P> In the performer category, awards went to Arturo Armijo, a dancer with Susan  Marshall and Dancers; Victoria Finlayson of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company;  Penny Hutchinson, long time dancer with Mark Morris; Jonathon Reisling (now  with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater) for his performances with the  Jamison Project; Louise Smith, for her performance in Ping Chong's  "Brightness"; and Gail Turner, for her collective work with Meredith Monk.  Recipients in this category receive a $500 cash award.  </P> <P> In the category of choreographer/creator, for which $1,500 is awarded, there  were nine awardees: choreographer Margarita Guergue and musician Hahn Rowe for  their collaboration "We Were Never There"; the collaborative duo Eiko and Koma,  for their dance "Passage"; Ulysses Dove for "Episodes," choreographed for the  Ailey troupe; Karen Finley, for her controversial work "We Keep Our Victims  Ready"; performance artist Robbie McCauley, for "Sally's Rape"; and Belgium  choreographer Wim Vandekeybus. Choreographer Garth Fagan and performance artist  Pat Oleszko were given sustained achievement awards.  </P> <P> Special citations went to Annabelle Gamson, for her reconstructions of Isadora  Duncan and Mary Wigman dances; Beate Gordon, for her presentations of Asian  performing arts; and to Martha Wilson, founder and director of the performance  space Franklin Furnace.  </P></p>

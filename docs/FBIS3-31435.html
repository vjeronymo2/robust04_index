			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Liviu Luca, president of the PETROM </F> Independent Trade Unions Federation and vice president of the  Fratia National Confederation of Romania's Free Trade Unions  (CNSLR), by Liana Buligan on 11 February; place not given: "The  Executive Power Is Experiencing a Dramatic Authority Crisis"]    [Excerpts] [Buligan] In your opinion, what is the actual  position of our country's population following the  intensification of the current economic and political crisis?    [Luca] There is an aspect that has to be pointed out to  provide a correct answer. The population, that is the  foundation of trade unions, is desperate and dumbfounded. At  this point, no one in Romania understands anything -- neither  the people, nor the electorate, and not even the leaders of  various parties involved in the political game. To quote just  one example: In a country that is extracting 8 million tonnes  of crude oil a year, the oil industry is suffering from  financial blockage and is on the brink of bankruptcy. [passage  omitted]    The disaster continues and no one seems to be responsible  for  what is happening. Thus all efforts go into the silly game of  acquiring power and the problem of tangible solutions to justify  this portfolio- and position-hunting is not posed.    [Buligan] What is the situation of financial blockage at  this point?    [Luca] If you could have frank discussions with the big  shots in industry you would be surprised to note that they are  totally confused. No one knows who is his leader and what  strategy or program he has to implement. On the one hand, the  Vacaroiu government is accused by everyone, including us, the  trade unions, of not doing anything; on the other hand, what can  he do as long as he does not have the economic levers in his  hand and has no freedom to make decisions?    [Buligan] Who is holding these economic levers?    [Luca] Under the law, the head of the State Property Fund  [FPS] is the holder of these levers, while the executive,  however, belongs to the prime minister. Under the Privatization  Law, an illogical situation has emerged in which decisionmaking  is divided in such a way between the FPS and government that  neither can do anything. The situation is such that we do not  even know for sure how many powers there are in the state, thus  even the country's integrity is questioned. Consequently, the  population is fed up to such an extent that they confuse  democracy with the crisis and almost are expecting a  reorganization of sociopolitical structures, even if this would  mean a military dictatorship. At this time, such notions as  freedom, democracy, and reform are compromised in Romania.    [Buligan] What is the explanation of the fact that recently  trade unions firmly demanded a broad national coalition  government, meaning that they got involved in "politics," as  some public figures say?    [Luca] We demanded the participation of the democratic  opposition in government for at least two reasons. First, an  economic one. Under the current single leadership of the Social  Democracy Party [PDSR], the former communist nomenklatura is  consolidating its positions in the economy, thus becoming a very  rich, though small, segment of, let's say, 5 percent. As for  the rest, there is great poverty. A country with no prosperous  middle class, but with catastrophic economic differences is not  a stable country. Through the participation of the other  parties in government, the segment of the privileged would  expand and our society would become a normal society. [passage  omitted]    Returning to the financial blockage, an easy solution would  be if oil producers concluded their contracts directly with  refineries; that would eliminate financial blockage. Despite  all our efforts, however, this is not possible. In their  naivete, the trade unions thought that this problem would belong  to the competence of the Ministry of Industry and the prime  minister, but we were wrong because these authorities have no  decisionmaking power. Thus we have to ask the question: Which  are the dark powers behind those appointed to govern? [passage  omitted]    [Buligan] Is there any solution to this blockage?    [Luca] In the oil sector, the blockage amounts to 160  billion lei. Halting payments or, differently put, the  application of the Bankruptcy Law is the only way out.  Normally, such a financial blockage cannot last long; but maybe  what is pursued is to exasperate people and ruin the economy in  order to prove that Romania is unsuited for the market economy.  [passage omitted]    [Buligan] Do you believe in the efficiency of a new  government?    [Luca] No, because the country does not have the time needed  to form and break in another government team.    [Buligan] Do you think that the legitimate power is  experiencing an authority crisis?    [Luca] Yes, an authority crisis coupled with an outrageous  lack of responsibility vis a vis national interests. The  political forces have abandoned the nation, but the nation has  also abandoned and isolated them in their silly game to win  power. Thus, the country is split. [passage omitted]    [Buligan] What is your opinion about President Ion Iliescu  in the current situation?    [Luca] His main asset is an outstanding resilience. At a  recent meeting with trade union leaders, he emphasized the need  for consensus through the participation of all in a government  coalition, but, as you well know, even the road to hell is paved  with good intentions.    [Buligan] What will the trade unions do next?    [Luca] We will continue to heed our responsibilities.  [passage omitted] The problem of responsibility is a tangible  and strict problem with us.

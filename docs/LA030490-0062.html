			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POLICE OVERKILL  </P> <P> The San Diego Police Department is understaffed? They claim that a response  time of 30 minutes or longer is very common, yet they send 30 cars, motorcycle  units and a helicopter to corral 200 secondary students conducting an orderly  protest. Can this be the same understaffed force?  </P> <P> This overreaction should be an embarrassment to the SDPD and the citizens of  San Diego.  </P> <P> JIM WRIGHT  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

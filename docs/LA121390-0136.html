			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHARITABLE CHOCOLATE  </P> <P> Here's a great gift for chocoholics on your Christmas list who are convinced  they have tasted every chocolate treat on the market. Furthermore, all proceeds  benefit the Down's Syndrome Congress.  </P> <P> Lacey Susans, a dry chocolate cookie mix, requires only a stick of butter and  an egg; the batter bakes into 8-9 dozen delicate paper-thin chocolate cookies.  And luckily, for such a yield, the batter holds in the refrigerator or freezer  for those who prefer baking small batches at a moment's notice.  </P> <P> The recipe, which makes a perfect stocking stuffer or hostess gift, was  developed by Sue Zelickson, a Minneapolis food writer. The cost is $5 per  package; a minimum mail order is two packages plus shipping. Payment can be  made by check, money order, Visa or MasterCard. Call 1(800) 773-6663 for  further information or write Canterbury Cuisine, Box 2271, Redmond, Wash.  98073. ABBY MANDEL  </P></p>

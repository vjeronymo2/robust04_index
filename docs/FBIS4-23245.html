			<p>BFN     [Text] Ivorian President Henri Konan Bedie is planning to  create a new CFA franc like de Gaulle did in 1959 when he  created the new French franc. The new CFA franc will equal 100  current CFA francs and, since it will have the same value as the  French franc, a single currency will circulate within the franc  zone. It will be a simple solution. The move will clearly show  that the CFA franc, even if devalued, remains resolutely  attached to the French franc. Also it will show that the January  devaluation is definitely the last one.    The objective is to prevent any further devaluation of the  CFA down the line and give additional support to the operation  launched at the beginning of the year.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report] </F>   [Text] Five members of the Kakh organization, settlers from  the territories who are under administrative detention, have  asked the prime minister to deport them to south Lebanon, an  area they consider the birthright of the tribe of Asher, one of  the 12 biblical tribes of Israel.    Our army affairs correspondent Alon Ben-David reports that  the five men claim that their appeal was neither a media gimmick  or a joke. They assert that their deportation to south Lebanon  would satisfy the prime minister's craving to be rid of them and  also get them out of jail. The five said that in south Lebanon  they could contribute to the conquest of Eretz Yisra'el and the  war against terrorism while realizing their Jewish and Zionist  aspirations.</p>

			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Letter: No mention of the unemployed Sir, Samuel Brittan's article, 'Recession, but not all gloom and gloom' (July 30), reached a new low in insensitivity and complacency. As far as I can see there is no mention in the article of the unemployed and who is to say the numbers of unemployed will not exceed 3.25m next year? Mr Brittan seems oblivious to the families in the south-east who are being booted out of their homes through no fault of their own but due to the government's slave-like adherence to the ERM strait-jacket of which Mr Brittan is one of the most vociferous advocates. Clearly he has no idea how ordinary people are feeling in the depths of this unpleasant recession. John R Wiltshire, 193 Burnt Oak Lane, Sidcup, Kent DA15 9BW</p>

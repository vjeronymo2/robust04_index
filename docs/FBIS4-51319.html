			<p>BFN     [Text] After successfully winding up an official visit to  Germany and Denmark, Xie Fei, CPC Central Committee Political  Bureau member and Guangdong Provincial CPC Committee secretary,  returned to Guangzhou yesterday evening.    In Germany, Xie Fei and his entourage held extensive talks  with friends in German industrial, commercial, and banking  circles and briefed German friends on Guangdong's economic  growth, investment environment, and projects open to foreign  investment. The two sides also held conscientious discussions  on ways and means of expanding bilateral cooperation and  exchanges.    In order to acquire a better understanding of the German  economic, cultural, and environmental protection situations, Xie  Fei and his entourage inspected Frankfort Airport, which is  currently undergoing extension; travelled on a high-speed  railroad in a high-speed special train made by Germany's Siemens  Company; and visited a farm in Bavaria, where they also called  on the farm owner.    During their two-day stay in Denmark, the Guangdong  provincial economic investigation delegation led by Xie Fei held  separate talks with Denmark's ministers of agriculture and  fisheries and foreign affairs and conscientiously conducted  investigations into Denmark's agricultural production, farm  products processing, and agricultural management structure.    In their talks with people of all walks of life in Germany  and Denmark, Xie Fei and his entourage fully publicized the  excellent opportunities in and good prospects for  Guangdong-Germany and Guangdong-Denmark economic and  technological cooperation; expressed the hope that both sides  would make continued efforts to further bilateral cooperation  and exchanges; and discussed and agreed on with Germany and  Denmark specific forms of bilateral cooperation as well as a  number of joint-venture projects.</p>

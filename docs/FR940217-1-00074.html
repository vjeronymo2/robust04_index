			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Finally, these proposed regulations would include  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations of misuse of all Federal (as opposed to simply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Title IV, HEA programs) funds and State or local government  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds. For example, a person determined to have committed fraud  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the acquisition of State educational grant funds could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreshadow a potential danger to the Title IV, HEA programs if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that person were employed by an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These additional requirements are needed to establish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate safeguards to protect the Title IV, HEA programs if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> serious questions are raised about the honesty and lawful conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an individual, agency, or organization that contracts with or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is employed by an institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Section 668.13&blank;Factors of financial responsibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 498(e) of the HEA introduces the concept of ``substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control'' over an institution essentially by adopting the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulatory concept of ``the ability to affect substantially the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> actions of'' an institution. Accordingly, the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substitutes the new phrase where applicable in these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. Further, the Secretary proposes to establish that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an institution is not considered financially responsible_a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> condition of participation in the Title IV, HEA programs_if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> person with substantial control over the institution_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Has or had substantial control, either alone or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combination with members of his or her family, over another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or a third-party servicer that owes liabilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those liabilities are not being properly repaid;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Has family members who, alone or in combination with one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another, exercise or exercised substantial control over the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other institution or servicer; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Owes liabilities, or members of his or her family owe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liabilities, for violations committed by the other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution or servicer, and the liabilities are not being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly repaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The institution could continue to be considered  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> financially responsible if_  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The person repays a proportion of the liabilities equivalent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the amount of control held over the other institution or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) The institution can establish that the person does not, in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact, have substantial control over the institution; or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The institution can establish that neither the person nor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of his or her family members in fact has or had  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial control over the other institution or servicer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The definition of a family member (as currently defined in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;668.13(j)) refers to a parent, sibling, spouse, or child;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> spouse's parent or sibling; or sibling's or child's spouse.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Secretary would apply the concepts of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``substantial control'' and ``ownership interest'' (as currently  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> defined in section 498(e) of the HEA and &sect;668.13) to third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

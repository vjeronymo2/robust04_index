			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Fears on jobs plan SCEPTICISM about whether employers will take part in the government's new Workstart programme has been expressed by the independent Employment Policy Institute. Workstart, under which employers will be given a government subsidy of Pounds 60 a week for taking on the long-term jobless, was announced in last month's Budget. The institute said: 'The most immediate task facing those responsible for the pilots will be to gain the interest of employers.' It suggests that the pilot schemes should experiment with different levels of subsidies in the range of Pounds 60 to Pounds 150 a week. It also said that problems had arisen with previous job subsidy experiments, including the displacement of existing workers and the provision of subsidies for workers who would have been taken on anyway - 71 per cent of the subsidised recruits under a 1978 experiment would have been taken on without the subsidy.

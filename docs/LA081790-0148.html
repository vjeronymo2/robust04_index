			<p><P> August 17, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POWER GLITCH HOLDS UP FED TRANSFERS, GENERATES PANIC  </P> <P> The communications system that is used to transfer billions of dollars between  U.S. banks was disrupted Thursday by a glitch in a backup power generator that  has been in use at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since a power outage  struck Manhattan Monday.  </P> <P> The glitch forced the New York Fed to delay the opening of the so-called  Fedwire, a step that drove up short-term interest rates and backed up the  processing of big interbank transactions. The 2 1/2-hour delay also panicked  dealers in government securities, whose transactions are completed through the  computerized system and who also use it to arrange financing.  </P> <P> Fed officials were able to start up the system only by rerouting the flow of  computer information through a backup system in Pearl River, N.Y., across the  Hudson River and about 25 miles north of Manhattan.  </P> <P> The disruption was the second demonstration this week of the vulnerability of  the nation's financial infrastructure.  </P> <P> On Monday, a fire in a Manhattan electrical station cut off power to much of  Wall Street, halting trading at the American Stock Exchange and five New York  futures and options exchanges, and curtailing market activity through much of  the United States. It was that outage that forced the New York Fed to turn to  the backup diesel generator.  </P> <P> E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, said at an afternoon news  briefing that the disruption was "Exhibit 'A' of the relevance and importance  of the plumbing of the financial system."  </P> <P> Although he sought to minimize the difficulties, he said the Fed was "not out  of the woods yet." The transfer to a backup system is "incredibly complicated,"  he added.  </P> <P> The Fedwire has been called the central nervous system of the nation's banking  system and functions somewhat like a trillion-dollar checking account run by  the central bank. The primary electronic transfer system among banks, savings  and loans, credit unions and U.S. government agencies, it handles about $900  billion in financial transfers on an average day.  </P> <P> Fed officials were told Thursday morning of difficulties with the diesel  generator and quickly decided to halt the usual 8:30 a.m. opening, a spokesman  said.  </P> <P> A failure poses the risk that records of billion-dollar transactions could be  lost.  </P> <P> Corrigan said the technical problems developed because the backup system had  been working "full blast" since the Monday outage.  </P> <P> Fed officials spent the first hours of the morning consulting with officials of  government and major banks, while technical personnel arranged changes in the  computer protocols and software needed to reroute transactions through the  Pearl River computer operation. Many banks also needed to reroute their  computer connections.  </P> <P> But as preparations were under way, some of the nation's banks couldn't wait  for the opening to arrange overnight loans that they need to finance part of  their assets. They began bidding up the overnight loans and raising the  so-called federal funds rate to as much as 8.5% during the day from 8%.  </P> <P> "That half-point doesn't seem like much, but it adds up," said Paul Kasriel,  vice president and economist with Northern Trust Bank in Chicago. "At a time  when a lot of banks are feeling earnings pressure, it'll hurt."  </P> <P> Fed officials hope to return to the regular system this weekend.  </P></p>

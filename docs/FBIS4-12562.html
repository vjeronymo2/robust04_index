			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: It is clear that there has been no  change in the Israeli position on how to deal with the peace  process, while the U.S. position is still undecided, hesitating  between following U.S. interests and complying with Israeli  wishes. The idea of separate deals and secret talks still  dominates Israeli thinking. Israel's talk about the  comprehensiveness of negotiations is empty and meaningless.  This being the situation, it takes us back to the same old  question: What does resuming or not resuming the bilateral  talks this month, or next month, or even after that, mean as  long as nothing has changed in the Israeli way of thinking?  Perhaps, counting on the U.S. stand to influence the Israeli  position is not really in harmony with the current state of  affairs. This is because Washington behaves toward the peace  process from the position of someone influenced by the Israeli  stand and not someone who influences that stand. For Israel,  this is not new. However, what is new is that nothing has  changed in the U.S. position, just as Israel and its strong  lobbies in the United States have always wanted it. They want  the United States to take Israel's side, not even allowing to  play a neutral role. Neutrality, a balanced position, and the  role of an honest broker are all unacceptable to Israel, because  it cannot tolerate seeing Washington in a position that is not  fully biased toward it, taking into consideration that it relies  on the U.S. support for its aggressions against Arab land and  rights. Throughout the Arab dealings with the U.S. peace  initiative, it has become clear that every time there has been a  difference between the U.S. position and the Israel position  over the peace process, even though it may have been for  considerable reasons in favor of Washington's position and in  the interest of the peace process, the U.S. position did not  take long to move back into line with the Tel Aviv rulers'  position, even though it may have led to a setback in peace  efforts.    Israel's game has been exposed. It is obvious that what it  wants is to impose an Israeli peace through separate deals with  each Arab party. It wants a peace that would allow it to  maintain its military, security, economic, and political  supremacy in order to eventually have a free hand to control  this region after the establishment of this so-called peace.  However, the question is really whether or not Washington is  still committed to the role of an honest and neutral partner in  the peace process. This question should be posed in light of  Washington's pressure on the various Arab parties, through  various means, forms, methods, and names, which all serve the  Israeli position. What is really required of the United States  is that it prove its honesty by pressuring the party that is  obstructing the achievement of a just and comprehensive peace in  the region; namely, Israel. The importance of an answer to this  question lies in the possibilities of the Arab parties returning  to the Washington bilateral talks and the negotiating table at  the end of this month. Will U.S. efforts actually include the  signs of honesty that have long been awaited by the Arabs, or  will the U.S. position continue to swing back and forth within  the circle of Israeli influence?</p>

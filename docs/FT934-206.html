			<p>931230 FT  30 DEC 93 / Wild ride comes to abrupt halt for Spanish maverick Mario Conde has, so far, had a knack for landing on his feet. Few had heard of him six years ago when he and a friend sold their pharmaceuticals company Antibioticos to Montedison for Pta58bn (Pounds 280m). The money from that transaction bought him a stake in Banesto and, very quickly, he became president of the board. With it came a wild ride as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the economic boom that transformed the country after it entered the European Community in 1986, and now as one of the losers of the subsequent recession. By character, Mario Conde is far from the epitome of an international banker. He brushes his hair back so that it curls slightly in the nape of his neck. When he first got to Banesto he spoke English with an English accent. Gradually it changed to an American twang, reflecting a change in teacher but also in priorities as he became more enchanted with the new world. Critics doubted whether he would make an effective banker because his background had been as an industrialist. But his answer was that switching from industry to banking was little more than a change of management challenges. He achieved some big successes at Banesto, unravelling the chaotic interweaving shareholdings held by the bank's old squabbling owning families into a reasonably recognisable set of institutions. But he was never quite understood by Spain's financial establishment. He sailed a boat sponsored by Banesto and flew around in a private jet and bought himself a vast finca, or ranch, to hunt on. However he remained a very private person. His abrupt dismissal as president of Banesto on Tuesday by the Bank of Spain will have shocked him. But he has a personal interest in fighting back hard: he had recently invested Dollars 50m of his own money in Banesto. The son of a Galician customs officer, Mr Conde, 45, won one of the highest marks ever in national law exams in 1973. He is a Freemason who inspires loyalty among his staff. In spite of that, he had a habit of losing friends and potential allies. He alienated the Bank of Spain by, for instance, criticising auditing practices demanded by the central bank, and could be frustratingly vague about what he wanted to do with Banesto. When asked whether he would sell all its industrial holdings or not, he would reply only: 'Everything has its price.' One mistake - aside from trying to run a troublesome bank - was to allow himself to be construed in the serious media as a man with a political brain, a possible white knight for the political right wing once Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez leaves office. It meant he lacked friends in the government. He took Banesto into big media investments but found himself blamed for attacks on the government by newspapers he controlled. Perhaps his darkest moment before Tuesday was in 1989 when he became involved in a Machiavellian tussle to merge Banesto with Banco Central, a large competing bank, and thus rid Central from the grip of 'Los Albertos', two equally hard nosed entrepreneurs who were threatening to take over Central. Los Albertos eventually walked away from Central to become prosperous future owners of the smaller but healthier Banco Zaragozano, a fate Mr Conde might have wished had been his.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / The French Referendum: Milan share prices improve SHARES on the Milan stock exchange recovered slightly yesterday as dealers reassessed the outcome of the French referendum on the Maastricht Treaty and speculators' nerves steadied after the sharp falls in the past week. Prices on average rose 1.6 per cent, clawing back part of the 3.02 per cent fall on Monday triggered by concerns over the impact of last Friday's 1.75 point rise in the discount rate which in turn forced commercial banks to raise their own prime rates. The lira again reflected market sentiment about an eventual realignment and fell back from Monday's fixing against the D-Mark of 763.40 to 764. Dealers described the lira as having entered a phase of 'armed truce' against the D-Mark, with the Italian authorities having made clear their determination to defend the parity. The precarious position of the lira and the need to regain international confidence was emphasised yesterday by Mr Andrea Monorchio, comptroller general of the public accounts. He told a parliamentary commission yesterday that the Amato government had to give a 'strong signal' and intimated that it had to consider even tougher measures than had already being prepared in the 1993 budget to reduce the public sector deficit. Each one percentage point rise in the discount rate, he said, raised the government's needs by L15,000bn (Pounds 7bn) in a full year.</p>

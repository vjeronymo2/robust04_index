			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Bill Elliott crashed and Dale Earnhardt spun out during the first day of  practice for the Daytona 500 stock car race. Elliott, the NASCAR Winston Cup  champion and a two-time race winner here, suffered a broken left wrist that  will probably knock him out of action, and the incidents aroused fears that the  new radial tires are not as safe as believed.  </P> <P> Wayne Estes, a spokesman for the Ford teams, said that Elliott told him the  accident occurred when a tire blew with no warning. Earnhardt, a three-time  Winston Cup champion, escaped injury when he hit the wall after a tire  shredded.  </P> <P> Goodyear is introducing its new stock car radial this week.  </P> <P> Ken Schrader turned the fastest unofficial lap, 197.776 m.p.h. Elliott was next  at 196.859.  </P> <P> In qualifying for Sunday's ARCA 200-mile late model stock car race, Patty Moise  of Jacksonville, Fla., became the first female driver to win a pole position at  Daytona Friday when she qualified her Buick at a speed of 195.499 m.p.h., more  than 2 m.p.h. faster than runner-up Tracy Leslie of Mt. Clemens, Mich., who did  193.087 in his Pontiac.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, March 24 KYODO -- The following is the full  text of South Korean President Kim Yong-sam at the state banquet  hosted by Emperor Akihito on Thursday [24 March].    Your majesties, your royal highnesses, your excellencies  Prime Minister and Mrs. Hosokawa, distinguished guests,    I am grateful for the warm hospitality that has been  extended  to my wife, myself and my delegation and also for this splendid  dinner.    Your majesty has just made some very kind and friendly  comments about the Korean people. I am certain that your  remarks will serve as an invaluable catalyst for developing our  bilateral relationship.    I am visiting your country in the belief that our two  countries must endeavor to build truly neighborly ties of  cooperation looking ahead into the future.    As close neighbors, our two countries have interacted with  each other in the cultural and other fields for many centuries.  We must continue to be such close and good neighbors for  millennia to come.    At the turn of the century, it is true, Korean-Japanese  relations were put to a severe test by the thunderstorms and  turbulent currents of history. But we must not let our past  fetter our progress into the future any longer. My conviction  is that a new era of strong neighborly ties will surely arrive  once we squarely face the past just as it was and have earnestly  learned its lessons. Only if our two peoples continue to expand  exchanges in all fields will a new good-neighborly relationship  surely begin to develop. Our two countries should benefit from  the shared advantages of a long history of interaction as well  as geographical proximity.    Your majesty,    The fast-approaching century will almost certainly be an  Asia-Pacific century. I believe that both our nations face a  mandate of history to work together as partners to usher in this  new era. This mandate must be fulfilled without fail. The firm  resolve of both our peoples bolstered by their shared past  experiences will greatly help power the march of mankind toward  a new Asia, a new Pacific and a new world.    Your majesty,    Our two countries are jointly pursuing the universal ideals  of freedom, democracy and market economics. Both our countries  are striving for sweeping reforms and greater openness. With a  shared sense of mission, both the Republic of Korea and Japan  are now more determined and enthusiastic than ever about  building a diverse bilateral relationship on the strength of a  broad pubic consensus in both lands.    We must establish a rock-solid bilateral relationship before  the present century is out. By building an ROK-Japan  partnership in answer to the call of the times, we should  together lead the long march into the 21st century of peace and  prosperity.    Let us pool our wisdom and strength so that we will be able  to proudly pass on to posterity the heirloom of a good  neighborly relationship marked by a spirit of mutual help and  interdependence.    Distinguished guests,    Please join me in toasting the good health and longevity of  their majesties, the boundless prosperity of the Japanese people  and the evolution of neighborly ties of cooperation between the  Republic of Korea and Japan.    Thank you.</p>

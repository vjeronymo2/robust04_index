			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Observer: Swap shop The ultimate Whitehall nightmare of having to implement a policy you thought would be someone else's problem may soon come true for some unfortunate officials. Horror of horrors. A new programme of secondments between central and local government could mean that those in the department of the environment responsible for devising the transitional relief for the council tax, for example, could find themselves trying to administer it. Michael Howard, the environment secretary, was adamant that the planned move to Docklands of his department was not a ploy to ensure sufficient volunteers for his new pet project. Even so, there will be some sympathy among his underlings for a suggestion by the Association of Metropolitan Authorities that Howard's job swap idea should be extended to include ministers and council leaders.</p>

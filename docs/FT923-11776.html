			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / People: Ashcroft answers the call from Betacom Ken Ashcroft, Amstrad's corporate finance director, has left the board as part of the company's restructuring. Ashcroft, 57, explained yesterday that he had resigned in order to pursue other business interests - in particular as non-executive chairman of Betacom, the telephone equipment distributor which is 71.3 per cent owned by Amstrad. He replaces Roger Rowland who also resigned yesterday; he became chairman last year following the resignation of the founder, Dennis Baylin. Amstrad became the majority shareholder in Betacom - which has recently experienced deteriorating trading conditions, lower sales and higher customer returns - last week after less than a third of Betacom's recent Pounds 8.4m rights issue was taken up by other shareholders. The issue was underwritten by Amstrad, which received Takeover Panel approval to take control without making a bid. Ashcroft has considerable experience in the consumer and consumer electronics industries. He joined Amstrad from Dixons and had previously worked for Philips, Ford and Ideal Standard. As Amstrad's corporate finance director he was in charge of the group's City and banking relations, and acted as troubleshooter in cost control and inventories. He said yesterday that as chairman of Betacom's independent board his first task would be to 'steer the company back into profitability in the UK market'. Ashcroft, whose departure from the Amstrad board appears to have been amicable, added that he had decided to leave the Amstrad board and 'try something else' earlier this year, before the Betacom opportunity opened up.</p>

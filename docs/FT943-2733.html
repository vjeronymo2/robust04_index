			<p>940917 FT  17 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Fired Earth back in black at Pounds 60,000 Despite virtual stagnation in the underlying market for ceramic tiles, Fired Earth reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 60,000 for the six months to June 30, compared with a loss of Pounds 94,000. Turnover was up slightly from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 2.52m. Earnings per share were 0.78p (1.25p losses). Mr Nicholas Kneale, the chairman, said that lower costs and the 'gathering momentum' of sales of new product lines in natural floor coverings had helped the company move back into the black.</p>

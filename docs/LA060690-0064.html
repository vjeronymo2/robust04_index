			<p><P> June 6, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: RED SOX MANAGER SUSPENDED  </P> <P> Manager Joe Morgan of the Boston Red Sox was suspended Tuesday for three games  by American League President Bobby Brown for supporting a brush-back pitch that  led to a bench-clearing brawl last weekend in Cleveland.  </P> <P> The suspension is to begin tonight with Boston's game against the New York  Yankees at Fenway Park.  </P> <P> Morgan said that he will not appeal.  </P> <P> "Appeal? Appeal for what? You lose appeals," Morgan said after Boston beat the  Yankees, 9-8, Tuesday night. "I talked to Mr. Brown. I told him I did not like  his decision and I have no further comment."  </P> <P> Problems began last Saturday when Indian reliever Doug Jones threw a pitch near  the head of Tony Pena, who had helped Boston beat Cleveland the previous night.  On Sunday, Roger Clemens hit the Indians' lead-off batter, Stanley Jefferson,  triggering a fight.  </P> <P> "I loved it. We got even, didn't we?" Morgan said after Boston's victory  Sunday. "We voted as a team, 34-0, that it would be such."  </P> <P> Brown was unhappy with Morgan's attitude.  </P> <P> "The fact that pitchers throw close to hitters and sometimes deliberately hit  them is a known fact," his statement said. "Nevertheless, it behooves the  American League office to eliminate premeditated and announced violence."  </P></p>

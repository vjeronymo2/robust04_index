			<p>Language: <F P=105> Azeri </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Major-General Iskender Allahverdiyev, Deputy </F> Minister of National Security of the Azerbaijan Republic and  commander of the border troops, by Sohbet Seferli: "There Is No  Foundation To Rumors That Border Troops From Another State Will  Be Stationed On Our Borders"]    [Text] Recently a meeting of border troops' commanders of  CIS states was held in Ashgabat. At this meeting, attended also  by a delegation from the Azerbaijan Republic, documents prepared  on the smuggling of narcotic substances across borders,  additional changes to the staff structure of liaison services of  the Council of Border Troops Commanders, mutual principles of  the material-technical equipment of border troops, the  submission of an accounting of the 1993 costs of liaison  services and a draft of costs for the first quarter of 1994,  plans of the Commanders' Council and and their liaison services  for the first half of this year, the time and places of regular  meetings of the Commanders' Council, and other important  questions were discussed. In connection with this, our  correspondent met with Major General Iskender Allahverdiyev,  Deputy Minister of National Security and commander of the border  troops, and interviewed him. He said:    "The Council of Border Troops Commanders will meet once a  quarter and discuss questions pertaining to borders. Since the  Azerbaijan Republic has also joined the CIS, it is natural that  we participate in the planning of this organization. At present,  Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine and Azerbaijan have established  their own border troops, and other states of the former USSR are  in the process of doing so. The need for our participation at  this meeting also stems from the fact that borders between the  CIS states are porous, and the organization of the defense of  borders with non-foreign states cannot but disturb each of us.  Certainly this disturbance also pertains to us, and one of the  issues discussed at the Council's Ashgabat meeting was on the  protection of state borders under conditions of mutual  cooperation."    The establishment of material-technical equipment on the  borders was also widely discussed. As is known, the basic  equipment used in protecting the borders is produced in Russia  and other states. From this point of view, for the best  organization of our borders, we have to cooperate on reaching  compatibility with the CIS states.    Finally, the passage of narcotic substances, weapons and  other contraband products across borders was an important  question of interest to all the states. Discussion of this  question, which is not within the power of any one state to  solve on its own, also aroused great interest among meeting  participants. It remains to say that there is no foundation for  the rumors being spread on the stationing of troops from another  state on the borders of the Azerbaijan Republic. As for the  recent quick visit to Baku of Colonel General Andrey Nikolayev,  commander in chief of Russian border troops, this had nothing to  do with the issue. His journey was in connection with our  borders with Russia. In general, Russia believes that we can  protect our own border.    [Seferli] General. Quite some time has passed since the  border troops in our republic were established. What is the  situation today?    [Allahverdiyev] Certainly, in spite of all the difficulties,  we are making progress and the border troops have been created.  It goes without question that had there been no war, we would  have been able to do this job much faster. Our zealous and brave  specialist officers in the national army are fighting the enemy.  Hopefully, after the war is ended the majority of them will  return to the border troops. Our young officers are also  maturing. There is a special faculty at the Bak All Forces  Commanders' School which is training border officers. We are  participating closely in its operations. From next year, more  young officers will be sent to border detachments and take part  in the creation of border troops.    [Seferli] Our borders in the occupied territories have been  destroyed by the enemy. As the result of brave attacks by our  soldiers, a significant portion of our borders with the Islamic  Republic of Iran have been liberated. How will the repair work  in these territories be conducted? What kind of help will the  CIS states offer?    [Allahverdiyev] In fact, some of our borders are in very bad  shape, but this is not to say that our borders cannot be  protected. There has to be the technical means, meaning  technical equipment, channels of communication, etc., for border  protection. In the opinion of most of the participants at the  meeting, barbed wire should not be strung across the borders  again. Borders have to be protected in a civilized manner, as in  the European countries. There is no doubt that there has to be  political and economic stability in our countries for this; the  appropriate laws have to be prepared and normal conditions for  the protection of borders have to be created.    In the border zone liberated from the enemy, engineering and  technical equipment and buildings have been considerably  damaged, and in some places buildings have been burned to the  ground. Our border troops, in conjunction with our national  army, have been restoring our borders as soon as they have been  liberated. I would like to make use of this opportunity to say  to your readers that the protection of borders is a matter for  the state and all its people. If we do not believe in each  other, on the contrary, if we hurl inappropriate accusations at  each other, if we make our work more difficult, we will be  unable to achieve the desired result. All of us, whether at the  state level or at the level of the normal citizen, must help in  the protection of our borders and help our border troops. All of  us are obligated to give this help.</p>

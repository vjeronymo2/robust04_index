			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Tao Guangxiong (7118 0342 7160): "Some </F> Deputies to `Two Sessions' Appeal to Authorities To Pay Great  Attention to Sharpening Contradictions Among People"]    [Text] Beijing, 20 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--Some  deputies to the "two sessions" this year held that, at present,  there are strained relations between the party and the masses  and between cadres and the masses as well as the outstanding  problems of intensifying contradictions among the people. They  said that it is necessary to pay great attention to these  problems and deal with them properly, otherwise social unrest  and political instability will ensue.    Xing Bensi, deputy to the National People's Congress [NPC]  and vice-principal of the CPC Central Party School, said in an  interview with this reporter: If in the 1950's and 1960's, the  contradictions among the people markedly manifested themselves  in the ideological arena, they are now evident in economic  benefits. Unfair distribution and a wide gap between the rich  and poor has become an outstanding problem toward which the  masses bear deep resentment.    He said: An important factor leading to strained relations  between the party and the masses and intensifying contradictions  among the people is the problem of party style. Once a minority  of party members and cadres have grasped power, they are  concerned only with their own interests and no longer work for  the masses. In the end, they will meet with the opposition of  the masses.    Guo Ningfu, member of the Chinese People's Political  Consultative Conference [CPPCC] National Committee, said: At  present, the public order situation is not good, prices have  been rising too fast, and the phenomenon of corruption is  serious. If these problems are settled properly, the people's  unity can be strengthened and our undertakings can further  flourish; but if these problems are not settled well,  contradictions will be intensified and this will unnecessarily  infringe upon social stability and the development of our  undertakings.    Hou Zhenting and other NPC deputies from Hunan said: On the  one hand, teachers' pay is in arrears and IOUs are issued for  grain purchases; on the other hand, gorgeous offices are built  and top-grade limousines are bought; and enterprises are in the  red and workers' basic pay cannot be guaranteed while, on the  other hand, factory directors and managers travel and give  lavish banquets to others at public expense. How can the masses  be satisfied with this?    Xing Bensi said: It is necessary to pay great attention to  solving some outstanding problems regarding the relations  between the party and the masses and between cadres and the  masses to pacify the masses. For example, the phenomenon of  issuing IOUs is, to be blunt, a kind of peasant exploitation.  Viewed from historical experience, if something goes wrong in  China in the future, this will be where the problem comes from.  Therefore, we can never again allow any infringements on  peasants' interests.    Li Zhen, NPC deputy from Shandong, said: Apart from  conscientiously improving the people's living standards and  doing a good job in the comprehensive management of social  order, governments at all levels must maintain closer ties with  the masses, always have their well-being at heart, do more  practical and good things for the people, properly handle  contradictions among the people under the new situation, and nip  various unstable factors in the bud.    NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members also held  that vigorous measures must be taken to wipe out special  privileges and corrupt behavior, both of which are detested by  the masses. They proposed strengthening mass supervision of  government officials.</p>

Ujazdowski told a press conference on Monday, that a dispute  has been going on since the time the PK was established as to  whether Polish conservatism is to be a fragment of the Polish  right-wing. he maintained that the faction within the PK, headed  by the party's leader Aleksander Hall, teetered between the  right-wing and the Democratic Union which he described as  inconsistent with the target of the PK.    Ujazdowski added that a peaceful split was a better solution  than an exhausting fight. "In our opinion there is no  conservatism beyond the right-wing. The split was a condition  for the integration of the right-wing," he said.    The Conservative Coalition supports a fast integration of  the  Polish right-wing parties into one coalition. He declared that  his grouping would cooperate with the coalition made up of the  Centre Alliance, the Christian National Union, the Peasant  Agreement and the Movement for the Republic of Poland and would  seek the cooperation of the Christian Democrats party and the  Real Politics Union.    The right wing needs to be integrated as fast as possible  and  to create an attractive alternative for the leftist rule. We  hope that our efforts will lead to the formation of one grand  right-wing coalition, Ujazdowski said.    He added that the diversification of the right-wing parties  was not an obstacle to their integration. He also reported that  the Conservative Coalition is being supported by a half of the  Conservative Party local structures, that is some 1,000 people.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Price stability and employment link false Sir, Michael Prowse's disparaging review (Book Review, June 9) of Paul Krugman's book, Peddling Prosperity, suggests that 'conservative economics' is alive and well, apparently because Krugman accepts some of Milton Friedman's once controversial claims. Friedman, of course, likewise accepts much from Keynes, but so what? One such claim accepted by Krugman is that there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment in the long run. But to deny a trade-off is not to deny an effect: we cannot permanently lower unemployment by accepting permanently higher inflation but we might achieve a better employment record in the long run by taking a more measured attitude to inflation reduction. Consider this: at the trough of recession in 1977 unemployment reached 6 per cent (using OECD figures). There followed a small recovery, then Margaret Thatcher's Friedman-inspired recession, then the Nigel Lawson boom, at the peak of which unemployment was 6.8 per cent] Never before Thatcher had a post-war recession left as many people unemployed as did Lawson's boom. Since the Thatcher period was also one of so called 'supply-side' reforms, how can unemployment rise from recession to boom if not because of the long term damage done by the severity of Thatcher's recession to enterprise, infrastructure, access to foreign markets and the skills and motivation of the workforce? This shows that it is not the case - as crucially claimed by Friedman, and believed by 'conservative economists' all over the world - that if policy focuses on price stability, the labour market will deliver high rates of employment. With this essential claim of the monetarists demonstrated as being false and millions of unemployed paying the price, Prowse might take less comfort from the general acceptance of lesser monetarist claims.

In an address he made after appointing new walis and  governors in various wilayas, prefectures and provinces of  Morocco and new governors at the central administration of the  Ministry of State to the Interior, the sovereign underlined that  the ministries will be accountable before the municipal and  rural councils, as well as before the parliament in case of a  delay in implementing projects.    "We have set up a committee gathering representatives of all  central services, including engineers, physicians, teachers,  farming engineers, magistrates and all the representatives of  the administrative apparatus of the state", the sovereign added.    This committee will meet once a week to examine with the  walis and governors all the topics submitted and to monitor the  projects underway with a view to implementing them in the best  conditions.</p>

			<p>921223 FT  23 DEC 92 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report London's robusta COFFEE futures closed near a fresh 20-month high as the strong upward trend showed no signs of abating. Dealers said the market's advance continued to be fuelled by the strength of New York where key resistance levels were being regularly breached. However, New York arabica futures were only moderately firmer by midday as profit taking emerged following the sharp gains of the past two days. GOLD reversed small early gains to hover near support around Dollars 332 a troy ounce with the market nervous of a a possible repeat of Monday's Dollars 4 sell-off. Dealers said trade was thin. 'Under normal circumstances the volume traded would not have moved the market so much,' said one trader. SILVER was in retreat in London after selling at the Comex opening. One dealer said some long-term operators had returned to the market to buy at 370, but others said recent rallies in world equity markets could indicate industrial recovery, lifting the silver price.

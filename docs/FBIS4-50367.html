			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 18 (AFP) -- Cambodia's King Norodom  Sihanouk returned to Beijing Wednesday to resume medical  treatment for a cancer that has spread to his bone marrow.    Although smiling and waving, King Sihanouk was clearly weak  and had to be helped down the steps from the airplane after his  flight landed at Beijing's international airport.    Citing "serious health problems" Sihanouk said last week  that  he needed to return to Beijing from Cambodia two weeks ahead of  schedule.    The king spoke for several minutes with Chinese officials  among the welcoming committee before being whisked away by  limousine.    Sihanouk, 71, began chemotherapy and radiation treatment at  a  Beijing hospital in October folowing the discovery of a tumour  near his prostate gland.    He has maintained homes in Beijing and the North Korean  capital Pyongyang for several years.</p>

			<p>940131 FT  31 JAN 94 / International Company News: ANA mission looks for links with BA - Japan's second airline's search for increased volume A team from All Nippon Airways, Japan's second largest carrier, leaves Tokyo today for London. Its immediate mission is to negotiate an agreement to allow the airlines's passengers to participate in British Airways' frequent flyer programme. But ANA has bigger ambitions. The team is also under instructions to explore the possibility of a wider marketing alliance with BA that will help counter a collapse in demand caused by Japan's worst post-war recession. The airline, the world's eighth biggest - larger than BA in terms of passenger numbers - urgently needs to improve loads on its international flights, particularly from Europe and the US to Japan. The carrier's management believes a strategic marketing alliance with BA could be the answer. Mr Yuzuru Masumoto, senior vice-president legal affairs, says the two airlines could negotiate code sharing agreements, as well as exchange of data, engineering facilities and flight crew. The depth of the Japanese recession has taken ANA by surprise. The percentage of available seats filled on domestic flights dropped from 71.3 per cent in the financial year to March 1992 to 62.2 per cent during the six months to September 1993. The airline's plight has been exacerbated by increasing deregulation allowing greater competition from Japan Airlines (JAL). Meanwhile, the group's international strategy is faltering. ANA's heady expansion during the late 1980s and early 1990s has come to a halt. Loading on international routes has fallen from 69.7 per cent in 1992-93 to 63.2 per cent in the six months to September and management expects no recovery during the second half. The fall in passenger volumes has been exacerbated by a change in customer mix. Mr Masumoto says the number of passengers in first and business class has fallen by a third since the early 1990s. ANA, unlike its rival JAL, is still in profit, but management admits its post-tax results would have fallen into the red during the six months to September if the group had not changed its depreciation policy, by extending the assumed life of its aircraft from 10 to 13 years. Retrenchment is now the order of the day. The company is drawing up a new five-year plan which should be ready within a month and is based on lower growth expectations. ANA's management knows cost-cutting can only go so far. What the company needs more than anything is improve passenger volumes and upgrade its passenger mix. Hence the approach to BA. But although ANA is clearly keen, BA's management, contacted by airlines for similar agreements almost weekly, remains to be convinced.</p>

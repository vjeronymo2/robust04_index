			<p>931005 FT  05 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: D-Mark bucks Russian crisis AS RUSSIA stood on the brink of revolution yesterday the hard currency which would be most threatened by political collapse in eastern Europe, the German D-Mark, rose steadily throughout the day, writes Peter John The preference for travel rather than the final destination is one of the classic market cliches and the reverse is true in the case of bad news. With the D-Mark, international financial dealers had seen Russia approach the brink less than a month beforehand and become hardened against the possibility of chaos. There was a general belief that President Yeltsin would win through this time as he had before, providing stability at best and 'devil-you-know' credibility at worst. Support for the German currency was further helped by encouraging domestic economic data and the poor economic situation elsewhere in Europe. Nevertheless, the D-Mark began the week with the inevitable knee-jerk selling that took it down by more than two pfennigs to DM1.6550 against the dollar when dealing began in the Far East. By the time European traders were at their desks, however, it had already recovered to DM1.6480. Then, the latest West German industrial production statistics showed that production was not deteriorating. Also, the siege of the Russian Parliament building appeared to be going President Yeltsin's way. The currency regained all its earlier losses and moved ahead to DM1.6190 at best before closing at DM1.6240 up from DM1.6310 on Friday. Economists said that while Germany would obviously suffer from problems in Russia the fundamental economic situation in the rest of Western Europe gave no impetus for switching funds. Belgium is saddled with heavy debt and concerns of a currency split with Luxembourg. France is bedevilled with expectations of further rate cuts which may be good for the economy but are negative for the currency and have already been discounted in the market. Italy is gripped by political concerns and there growing militancy of the northern right-wing groups. Finally, there was a technical element to the strength of the D-Mark. The last Russian crisis came at the end of the week; dealers who had already balanced their books were subsequently caught and the currency was squeezed. Yesterday, traders were prepared to take a more adventurous stance and less inclined to sell. Elsewhere, sterling avoided being shaken by either the D-Mark's earlier weakness or the dollar's strength and held its ground throughout the day. The pound closed at DM2.46, up from DM2.4550 previously and at Dollars 1.5150, up from Dollars 1.5055 previously. The French franc was steady against the D-Mark with some dealers saying the Bank of France had been taking advantage of the D-Mark's weakness to rebuild its reserves.</p>

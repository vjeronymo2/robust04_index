			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / FT Law Report: Solicitor's cheque defence is arguable CLIFFORD CHANCE v SILVER Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Neill and Sir Christopher Slade): July 22 1992 THE ENDORSEE of a cheque who acquires it in good faith for value by conditional delivery becomes the 'holder in due course' on satisfaction of the condition, with a right to claim against the drawer for subsequent dishonour. But on a claim for summary judgment the drawer is entitled to defend if there is sufficient evidence for him to argue that the endorsee relinquished his rights under the cheque in return for payment of a smaller sum. THE COURT of Appeal so held when allowing in part an appeal by Mr Geoffrey Silver from Mr Justice Garland's decision ordering summary judgment on a claim against him by the plaintiffs, Clifford Chance. LORD JUSTICE Neill said that in December 1990 a series of property transactions were contemplated, relating to freehold property in Lambeth. The transactions included: (a) sale of the property by Chartwell Land Investments Ltd, previously called Woolworth Properties Ltd, to Mr Don Abili; (b) lease of the property by Mr Abili to Woolworths plc; (c) subsequent sale of the property by Mr Abili to Camberside Ltd, a company controlled by Mr Abili, and a further sale by Camberside to Courtyard Leisure plc. Clifford Chance acted as solicitors for Chartwell, Frederick Hass &amp; Stone for Mr Abili, and Mr Silver for Camberside. The deposit payable under the first agreement (the sale by Chartwell to Mr Abili) was Pounds 100,000. Under the second agreement (the sale by Mr Abili to Camberside), the deposit was originally Pounds 170,000 but was increased to Pounds 185,000. On December 12 1990, Mr Silver sent Frederick Hass two cheques for Pounds 100,000 and Pounds 70,000, representing the deposit originally agreed under the second agreement. On December 13, Frederick Hass replied, confirming that Mr Silver had given them permission to deliver the Pounds 100,000 cheque to Clifford Chance 'on the basis that they will hold the cheque strictly to our order'. On receipt of the Pounds 100,000, Frederick Hass endorsed it sans recours and sent it with an accompanying letter requesting Clifford Chance to hold the deposit cheque 'strictly to our order, returnable on demand until we are able to authorise you to effect an exchange'. Early in January 1991, the contracts for the sale by Mr Abili to Camberside were exchanged. On January 10, the contracts for the sale by Chartwell to Mr Abili were exchanged. The Pounds 100,000 deposit under the first agreement then became due. On January 11, Clifford Chance presented the indorsed cheque for payment. On January 16 the cheque was dishonoured by Mr Silver's bank. Following the dishonour discussions took place between Clifford Chance and Frederick Hass, and between Frederick Hass and Mr Silver. As a result of the discussions between Frederick Hass and Mr Silver, a Pounds 50,000 banker's draft was sent by Mr Silver to Frederick Hass. Clifford Chance, as endorsees of the cheque, claimed Pounds 100,000 against Mr Silver. Before Mr Justice Garland, Mr Silver raised four defences. The judge rejected them and gave judgment for Clifford Chance. On the present appeal Mr Goldblatt for Mr Silver put forward fresh arguments, including a submission that Clifford Chance were never 'holders in due course' of the cheque. By section 29 (1) of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882, a 'holder in due course' was a holder who had taken a bill, complete and regular on its face, under the conditions '(a) that he became the holder of it before it was overdue and without notice that it had been previously dishonoured . . . (b)that he took the bill in good faith and for value, and . . . had no notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated it'. Section 31 of the Act provided that a bill was negotiated 'when it is transferred . . . in such a manner as to constitute the transferee the holder of the bill'; and that a bill payable to order was negotiated 'by the indorsement of the holder completed by delivery'. Mr Goldblatt submitted: (1) that the cheque was indorsed and delivered to Clifford Chance by a transfer of possession on December 13, and was negotiated to them on that date; (2) that on December 13 Clifford Chance were aware that Frederick Hass's title was defective, in that they held the cheque to Mr Silver's account, not their own - their title was merely conditional; (3) that being aware of the defect at time of negotiation, Clifford Chance were incapable of becoming holders in due course unless as a result of subsequent negotiation; (4) that even if transfer of possession and delivery did not take place until January 10, Clifford Chance could not satisfy section 29 (1)(b) because they never gave value for the cheque themselves. The submissions were not accepted. Section 21 of the 1882 Act provided that delivery of a bill of exchange '(2) (b) may be shown to have been conditional or for a special purpose only, and not for the purpose of transferring the property in the bill. It was clear that delivery of a cheque could be shown to be conditional. The delivery on December 13 was conditional and the contract between endorser and endorsee was incomplete. On January 10 the contracts for sale of the property were exchanged, and the conditions stipulated in the letter from Mr Silver and the letter from Frederick Hass were fulfilled. It was on that date that the cheque was negotiated to Clifford Chance. They then became holders in due course. Except where a bill was overdue, a bona fide holder for value without notice of any defect in the title of the person who negotiated the bill to him was a holder in due course. Consideration was given for the cheque when contracts were exchanged on January 10. Mr Goldblatt argued also that after the cheque was dishonoured Mr Abili, acting as Clifford Chance's agent, agreed with Mr Silver that in consideration of a Pounds 75,000 payment by Mr Silver (of which the earlier Pounds 50,000 payment was to form part), Clifford Chance would release him from any liability under the cheque. The argument was based on Mr Silver's affidavit that Mr Abili had told him Chartwell and Woolworth would forgo their rights under the cheque if he could pay Pounds 75,000. Mr Silver said it was clear to him that the offer was intended to bind Clifford Chance. The judge dismissed a similar argument. He rightly said it was inconceivable that Clifford Chance would appoint a purchaser who was already in difficulty as their agent to strike a bargain waiving rights under the cheque. Mr Goldblatt also argued that even if Clifford Chance became holders in due course of the cheque, Frederick Hass were authorised by them after the cheque was dishonoured to negotiate on their behalf with Mr Silver; and as a result of those negotiations, Mr Silver sent Frederick Hass the Pounds 50,000 banker's draft which was paid and accepted in part payment of the cheque. In support of that argument counsel drew attention to a number of documents, including Clifford Chance attendance notes and a Frederick Hass letter. It was submitted that those documents indicated that following the dishonour, Clifford Chance authorised Frederick Hass to discuss the position with Mr Silver on their behalf to see whether the deposit could be raised before they enforced their rights under the cheque. Clifford Chance argued that other documents which showed they never relinquished any of their rights under the cheque. On this part of the case Mr Silver had an arguable defence. The appeal was allowed in part by giving unconditional leave to defend as to Pounds 50,000 and interest. Sir Christopher Slade gave a concurring judgment. For Mr Silver: Simon Goldblatt QC and Robert Jay (Fuglers) For Clifford Chance: John McGhee (Clifford Chance)</p>

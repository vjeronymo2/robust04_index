			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 18 (YONHAP) -- Former U.S. President  Jimmy Carter returned to South Korea from Pyongyang via the  truce village of Panmunjom Saturday morning after meeting with  North Korean leaders to resolve the nuclear dispute.    Upon his return to Seoul, Carter will brief President Kim  Yong- sam at Chongwadae [presidential offices] on the contents  of his two rounds of talks with Kim Il-song during his four-day  visit to the North Korean capital.    Carter, escorted by a North Korean army colonel, arrived at  the Military Demarcation Line in Panmunjom at 8:35 a.m. to be  greeted by American Ambassador James Laney and Southern  officials.    He posed briefly for scores of cameramen in the Southern  sector of the truce village before heading to Seoul.    During his meeting with Carter, President Kim is expected to  explain his government's stance toward the latest developments  in the nuclear row.    Prior to visiting Chongwadae, the former American president  is to meet Foreign Minister Han Sung-chu at the U.S.  ambassador's residence to discuss steps that Seoul and  Washington can take on the nuclear issue based on the outcome of  Carter's talks in Pyongyang.    Carter is scheduled to meet with the press at the  ambassador's residence Saturday afternoon before leaving for the  United States.</p>

			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / Economics Notebook: History lesson on how to raise taxes The European Community has just woken up to a crisis in its public finances. EC economics and finance ministers agreed a week ago, that they would have to take tough action to cut national budget deficits, including possible tax increases. The problem is daunting. According to the EC's economic policy committee, net general borrowing by EC governments has risen steadily to more than 6 per cent of national income this year, compared with 2.7 per cent in 1989. During the same period, state spending has jumped more than 5 percentage points to a record 52 per cent of gross domestic product, and the share of tax and social security contributions has risen by 1.5 points to almost 46 per cent - also a record. But increasing taxation is no easy matter. No-one likes paying taxes at the best of times. Moreover, the EC's political leaders are nearly all unpopular. Higher taxes can easily translate into defeat at the polls. In this uncertain world, Mr Ken Messere, until 1991 the head of the fiscal affairs division of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, has produced a valuable guide on tax policies in the main western industrial countries. His Tax Policy in OECD Countries: Choices and Conflict* offers no magic cure. But drawing on 30 years' experience with tax policy matters and 20 years as the OECD's top tax expert, he provides a mine of information about where governments have gone wrong and gives valuable clues as to what they should and should not do. Mr Messere is no instinctive tax cutter. He can barely conceal his distaste for the antics of politicians in the 1980s, who (especially in Britain) cut taxes for ideological reasons and argued that the changes would enhance economic per-formance. With the advantage of a long perspective and an erudite approach to taxation that takes in the observations of Pliny the Younger, St Thomas Aquinas and the November 1992 Catholic Church Catechism, he takes a dim view of the happenings of the past 30 years. 'Any watcher of revenue developments can hardly fail to be struck by the irrationality of countries' tax policies over most of the period.' One irrationality, in a supposedly interdependent age, has been the failure of most OECD governments to pay attention to tax policy changes made by other governments to solve similar problems. Another is the way that the total tax ratio, that is the ratio of total tax revenues to GDP, has fallen in many countries since the mid 1980s without a corresponding fall in government outlays. This trend has been accompanied by a generally welcome convergence of industrial country tax ratios. But great differences remain in the way governments raise tax revenues. This is especially true of the four biggest EC member states: Germany, France, Italy and Britain. France has the lowest dependency of any major industrial country on revenues from personal income tax - only 7.5 per cent of GDP in 1990. The reasons include antiquated collection methods and high thresholds that exempt nearly half the population from paying tax. Against this, it relies a great deal on social security contributions. Germany, which is struggling with huge deficits caused by unification, has the lowest standard value added tax rate in industrialised Europe at 15 per cent, and VAT and income tax ratios that are below the European average. Italy, on Mr Messere's reckoning, has no pronounced tax eccentricity. But its tax administration is notoriously deficient. Britain, whose government so prided itself on tax reform in the 1980s, has a poor tax policy record in Mr Messere's view. It has the narrowest VAT base in Europe, zero-rating such items as foods, new dwellings, books, children's clothes and sewerage services. UK tax policy has been influenced far more than in other states by party political preferences, because Britain's 'first past the post' electoral system has given the executive arm of the UK government more power to change taxes than governments on the continent. Some consequences for taxation have been bold, innovative and rational: Lord Lawson's 1984 reform of corporation tax falls in this category. Others such as the poll tax or the selective employment tax introduced by Labour in 1966 were simply 'crazy', according to Mr Messere. Nor is he very enthusiastic about the council tax. He notes that it combines various features of a property tax, a household tax, a poll tax and an income tax, 'which has never been contemplated by any other OECD country'. Differing tax structures among EC member states may help explain their varying economic performance. For example, France's greater dependence on employers' social security contributions to provide state revenues may be one reason why French unemployment stayed so high in the 1980s and is now rising very sharply in recession. But the differing structures could also present an opportunity to governments that now must think about raising tax to eliminate deficits. Peer group example and pressure are already being used to soften up electorates for potentially painful cuts in welfare spending. Ironing out differences in tax structures among EC states could provide a suitable cloak for European governments wishing to boost revenues in the 1990s. Handled carefully, the process could even smooth the competitive playing field for businesses and individuals, promoting the single market. Clearly, much would depend on how the additional tax revenues were raised. Mr Messere points out that it is sensible to diversify sources of increased tax revenue to reduce taxpayer discontent. This may seem obvious, but it has been ignored by many governments. *Fl 195 from IBFD Publications, PO Box 20237, 1000 Amsterdam. Tel +31 (0) 20 626 77 26. Fax +31 (0) 20 622 86 58.</p>

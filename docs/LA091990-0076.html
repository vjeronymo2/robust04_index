			<p><P> September 19, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUBBARD REQUESTS OWNERSHIP RULING;  </P> <P> HORSE RACING: HE APPARENTLY WANTS TO KNOW IF HOLLYWOOD PARK ROLE COULD BE  CONSIDERED A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.  </P> <P> R.D. Hubbard, apparently continuing his battle to oust Marje Everett and assume  operating control of Hollywood Park, has asked the California Horse Racing  Board for an opinion about whether he has a conflict of interest because of  holdings in other California race tracks.  </P> <P> Hubbard, whose purchases this year have given him 9.9% of the stock in  Hollywood Park, also is one of the owners of Los Alamitos Race Course and owns  less than 1% of the stock in Santa Anita. The structure of Hollywood Park stock  is such that no one can have more than 9.9% of the total. Everett has control  of 11%, but a portion of it is in a trust and can not be used for voting.  </P> <P> Dennis Hutcheson, executive secretary of the racing board, could not be reached  for comment on the opinion sought by Hubbard, who apparently anticipated that  his ownership in other tracks could be interpreted as a potential conflict.  Hubbard's office in Ft. Worth, said that he was out of the country and could  not be reached.  </P> <P> The next meeting of the racing board is on Sept. 28, but since Hubbard's  request is not on the agenda, it is unlikely that the board will consider his  situation then.  </P> <P> Everett, who has run Hollywood Park since 1972, has told her opponents that she  will not step aside. Her regime has been subjected to considerable criticism in  recent years as the track's debt reached $100 million. Payment of dividends  resumed recently after a three-year absence. By selling Los Alamitos, Hollywood  Park has eliminated more than half of that debt.  </P> <P> Tom Gamel, a member of the Hollywood Park board, is another shareholder who has  tried to oust Everett. Gamel nominated Hubbard to the board in June, but no  action has been taken by the nominating committee, which consists of Everett  and two of her allies, Merv Griffin and John Forsythe. Apparently the 11-member  board will meet with Hubbard before considering his nomination.  </P> <P> Hubbard, who also owns Ruidoso Downs in New Mexico and the Woodlands, a  thoroughbred-greyhound racing facility in Kansas City, Kan., would like to oust  Everett at the board level, and in a recent letter to the track's board he  proposed making her chairman emeritus by the end of the year. Another way to  create a change is through a proxy fight, which would cost the track's  shareholders and Hubbard's group millions of dollars in legal fees. Some  investors say the fight could cost each side as much as $2 million. The  advantage Everett would have in such a struggle is that she could wage her side  of the battle with track money.  </P> <P> In the event of a proxy fight, Hubbard reportedly has begun to line up  constituents and may have owners of as much as 30% of the stock on his side. A  key player in the struggle is Harry Ornest, a Beverly Hills resident who owns  the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. Ornest owns 9.9% of the  track's stock, but he has been noncommittal about which way he would go in the  event of a proxy battle.  </P> <P> Hollywood Park's second-quarter report was much improved over last year,  primarily because the restructuring of its bank loan greatly reduced interest  charges.  </P> <P> The track's net cash flow for the period was $6.4 million, compared to $3.3  million for the second quarter in 1989. Hollywood's debt service was reduced by  $2.7 million for the quarter, to $1.1 million, which means that the track's  cash flow for the period increased by about $400,000.  </P></p>

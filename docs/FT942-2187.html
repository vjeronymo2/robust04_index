			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Ecuador land protests grow Protests by Ecuador's indigenous population have closed some of the country's main motorways, hitting commerce and isolating several cities. The protests, entering their second week and becoming increasingly violent, were sparked by a land reform law approved by President Sixto Duran Ballen on June 13 which critics say halts popular land redistribution programmes. In the central highlands, roadblocks have virtually cut off Ambato and Cuenca, Ecuador's third and fourth largest cities, resulting in supply shortages and price increases. The Pan-American highway has been blocked by protests from some 200 indigenous communities at several junctions in Cotopaxi Province. About 40,000 indigenous people gathered in the provincial capital Rio Bamba to demand annulment of the legislation. In Ecuador's Amazon region several access roads to oilwells are also reported to have been blocked. Last week a protester was shot dead by a motorist trying to crash the barricades. Clashes between irate motorists and Indians armed with machetes have left dozens wounded. Some governors are asking President Duran to declare a state of emergency; others say they would annul the so-called agricultural development law. Critics of the law say it ends 25 years of land redistribution. Indigenous peoples, making up 40 per cent of Ecuador's population, are now denied communal land and water rights, they add. Government and indigenous leaders were due to hold their first talks late yesterday. Yet prospects for an immediate solution are dim; the government has said it will not repeal the law.</p>

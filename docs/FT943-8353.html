			<p>940817 FT  17 AUG 94 / Envoy hints on Bosnian arms United Nations mediator Thorvald Stoltenberg said yesterday that lifting the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems 'could be helpful' provided it was not done unilaterally. He was speaking after a visit to Belgrade and Bosnia, where he failed to persuade Bosnia's Serbs to alter their rejection of an international peace plan. His comments contrasted with stark warnings from the UN military in Sarajevo that lifting the ban will lead to further fighting and a collapse of the UN mission as contributing nations pull out their troops. Mr Stoltenberg said he believed the blockade imposed on the Bosnian Serbs by Belgrade to punish their resistance to the peace deal would be effective in securing its eventual acceptance. However, Serbia's President Slobodan Milosevic is resisting efforts to deploy international monitors on Yugoslavia's borders with Bosnia. Sarajevo, meanwhile, suffered an outbreak of sniper fire, despite an accord which earlier UN reports had suggested was holding as it entered its second day. UN special envoy Yasushi Akashi is in the Bosnian capital holding talks with government leaders aimed at slowing down fighting and opening up commercial routes into Sarajevo closed by Serb forces around the city.</p>

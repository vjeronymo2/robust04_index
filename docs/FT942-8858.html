			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Thai airline surges to Bt2.28bn midterm Thai International Airways yesterday reported a steep increase in net profits for the six months ended March, due largely to improved efficiency. Six-month profits were Bt2.28bn (Dollars 89.8m), up 300 per cent, following a 166 per cent rise in second-quarter net profits to Bt1.19bn. The airline has been a private sector company since March 1992 when just over 7 per cent of the company was floated on the Bangkok stock market. Since the flotation it has been criticised by airline analysts for propping up weak operating results with extraordinary income, notably from aircraft sales. However, Mr Thamnoon Wanglee, president, appears to be creating a leaner organisation. Revenues from transportation, the core income, rose 10.8 per cent over the year while operating expenses went up by only 2 per cent. 'This is encouraging, although it is still too early to say if they have turned the corner or not,' said an analyst at brokers HG Asia. Although the current load factor (passengers and cargo carried) is 70.3 per cent, compared with 65.8 per cent last year, this does not translate directly into higher profits because the airline currently targets economy-class passengers. Previously, it sought primarily high-spending business and first-class passengers. The break-even load factor is nearer 66 per cent compared with 62 per cent a year ago. That Thai still finds unconventional revenue useful is shown in a comment from the company that second-quarter revenues of Bt2.42bn would have been higher but for a delay in the delivery of an Airbus A300-600 which also delayed a 'concession payment'.</p>

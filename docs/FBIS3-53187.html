The cable said: This project enabled our men to hold the key  to modern technology through purely national efforts and  programmed, creative action. This action displayed the most  marvelous pictures of resolve and determination and incorporated  boldness and science and knowledge which characterize the sons  of Iraq.    The cable added that this strategic project will provide raw  material to build the national industry, especially in  manufacturing tires, batteries, inks, and various dyes.    The cable asserted that accomplishing this strategic project  means taming [tarwid] crude oil and its derivatives, and even  taming the sacred Iraqi soil in its great wealth and abundant  water. This project opened up new horizons to the creative Iraqi  mind. It is indeed the ax of the creative people that will  smash the embargo and teach the enemies a profound lesson and  will make them regret their reckless blockade.    Staff Gen. Husayn Kamil Hasan said this major project has a  capacity of 25,000 tonnes annually. This will meet Iraq's needs  of carbon black in various industries. Iraq used to import this  material using hard currency, paying $1000-3000 per tonne. This  means that Iraq is ready to help its brothers and friends in the  oil countries in this field to break the monopoly and activate  constructive cooperation and mutual interests.</p>

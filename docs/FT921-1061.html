			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Letter: Clean-up cost fears unfounded Sir, Judy Dempsey's article 'Inheriting the Earth' (March 18) was misleading. Foreign investors in eastern Germany and Poland need not be frightened of having to foot the bill for cleaning-up the sites of companies they acquire. The Treuhand in Germany and the ministry of privatisation in Poland have both evolved ways to fund the clean-up of land owned by companies being privatised: the Treuhand using government finance, and Poland using funds from the sale of the company. However, in both cases, the investing company is expected to take on managerial responsibility. Moreover, in order to ensure the remedial work is done cost-effectively, the investor in both countries is expected to contribute between 5 and 10 per cent of the cost.

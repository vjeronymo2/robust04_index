Titled "Daddy's Days Away," the book encourages kids to  express their feelings, to write to daddy, to help mom with the chores.  "Whether dad is at home or away, we are a family," the book says. . . . And why  is dad going? "To protect and defend our country." Originally written for  Pendleton Marines, the book is now distributed nationwide. Tom Hamilton and  Shannon Sands  </P></p>

			<p>920326 FT  26 MAR 92 / Election 1992: FT Election Share Index ON A DAY when the overall market rose slightly, the gap between the two sectors of the FT Election Share Index widened a little. Shares that might benefit from a Labour victory rose by less than the main FT-SE index, while shares that might benefit from a Conservative win closed virtually unchanged. Overall, however, turnover was very low. Both portions of the index are calculated on a base of 100 as at closing prices on March 11, the day the election was announced.</p>

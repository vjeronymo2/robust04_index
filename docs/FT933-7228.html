			<p>930823 FT  23 AUG 93 / High stakes test of patience: The holiday is over for the French government, as it tackles unemployment and recession The holidays are over for Mr Edouard Balladur and his government. The French prime minister has returned to Paris from his vacation home in Chamonix in the French Alps to launch what he has described as a new phase in the action of the administration. This new phase will be mapped out today in a cabinet meeting. It will determine the course of the Balladur government, which faces increasing pressure to resolve France's unemployment problem and to revive the recession-hit economy. The risk for the prime minister is that, for the French public and for members of his Gaullist RPR party, his new phase may not seem new enough. With presidential elections due in 1995, his continued commitment to anti-inflationary policies and to the maintenance of a strong franc may test their patience. Mr Balladur's next steps will centre on a series of structural reforms. At the top of the agenda is the fight against unemployment, which currently stands at a rate of 11.6 per cent of the workforce and is forecast by Insee, the national statistics institute, to rise to 12.5 per cent by the end of the year. The government's response is a five-year plan to create jobs, unveiled last week by Mr Michel Giraud, the labour minister. The principal elements include: The transfer of social security charges from employers to the government for families of workers earning up to 1.5 times the minimum wage. The measure is intended to reduce the costs facing employers and to encourage them to increase their workforces. The replacement of the 39-hour working week with an equivalent hourly total for the year. This is designed to increase the flexibility of production by allowing companies to work longer in any one week and to reduce overtime payments. Exemptions for employers from payment of social security taxes for up to five years for the first three extra workers they hire. The labour market reforms are to be combined with a fiscal stimulus aimed at reviving consumer demand. This is expected to involve a cut in income taxes. In a television interview earlier this month Mr Balladur said that a reform of the income tax system, which he described as one of the most complex in the world, should 'permit the middle classes and those with average salaries to have their charges reduced'. Government spending is also being raised in an attempt to revive the economy. The proceeds of the 'Balladur bond' issue, which raised about FFr110bn (Pounds 12.5bn), three times more than the target amount, will be used to fund public works and construction projects. As with the income tax reforms, details of the spending plans will be outlined in the budget for next year, to be presented to the National Assembly in the autumn. The various measures are, however, unlikely to have a rapid impact on unemployment. The job creation schemes are a medium-term plan rather than a short-term stimulus and leave untouched the controversial minimum wage level. The minimum wage, or Smic, currently stands at FFr5,880 a month and is regarded by French industrialists as one of the principal obstacles to increased employment. 'It sets an expensive floor for hiring workers,' said the finance director of one manufacturing company. Mr Balladur appears to have ruled out reform of Smic on political grounds. 'I will not take responsibility under the pretext of fighting a crisis for destroying the system of social protection in our country,' he said this month. Despite his reluctance to undermine France's social security system, trade unions have reacted angrily to the plans. The general-secretary of the CGT, one of the largest union groups, echoed counterparts in describing the proposals as 'one of the most serious aggressions to be launched against workers'. The limits of the plan and the fact it is to be implemented over five years mean that unemployment is expected to rise further. 'He is right to focus on the structural problems of the labour market in France,' said one French economist, 'but I don't think we are likely to see any stabilisation in unemployment until the first half of next year.' The fiscal measures are also constrained. Mr Jean-Francois Mercier, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the merchant bank, estimates the government's budget deficit target of FFr317bn this year is unlikely to be achieved, and forecasts a shortfall of about FFr350bn. The scope for cutting taxes and stimulating growth is consequently limited. That leaves monetary policy as the remaining means to stimulate the economy. But since the effective collapse of the ERM at the beginning of the month, which widened the franc's fluctuation bands within the exchange rate mechanism from 2.25 per cent to 15 per cent, the Bank of France has followed a step-by-step approach to reducing borrowing costs. This cautious reduction of interest rates is partly a reflection of Mr Balladur's commitment to a strong franc. But it also reflects determination to preserve the process of European union, despite the damage sustained by the ERM. Mr Balladur will meet Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany on Thursday and is expected to emphasise France's commitment to the existing timetable for European monetary union which calls for a single currency to be introduced by 1997 or 1999 at the latest. He may also discuss the prospects for a return to tighter exchange-rate fluctuation bands and reform of the ERM rules to increase co-operation between ERM members in support of their respective currencies. Mr Balludur's German hosts would probably resist such a reform, but they might make the French prime minster's journey easier by announcing a cut in interest rates. Even without one, France would appear to have some rom for manoeuvre on cutting borrowing costs. The franc has responded well to the recent cuts in the 24-hour rate (the overnight lending rate to commercial banks), and stands at less than 3 per cent below its previous ERM floor rate of FFr3.4305 to the D-Mark. But the new exchange rate framework remains fragile and French monetary officials reject any swift downward move. The constraints on fiscal and monetary policy suggest there is little reason to expect a rapid economic upturn. Mr Mercier at Salomon Brothers, in common with most private-sector economists, predicts a contraction of gross domestic product of about 1.5 per cent this year, a view which is supported by French business. A survey this month by Insee found that industrialists do not expect demand to recover until the fourth quarter of the year; they expect to continue to reduce staff levels. This all adds up to a dilemma for the French prime minister. Continued recession risks erosion of support for his conservative government. A change of tack risks the loss of credibility. The challenge he faces is to contain pressures for change while the economy stabilises. So far, the debate concerning a move to a British-style policy of devaluation and rapid interest rate cuts has been limited to the press. A letter in Liberation, the French daily, signed by a group of French bankers, condemned 'the ayatollahs of the strong franc' who, they said, had failed to respond to the failure of the ERM and to adopt a more expansionary policy. The problem for Mr Balladur is that such views are not confined to business but are heard even within his own party. Mr Philippe Seguin, president of the National Assembly, is a longstanding advocate of devaluation and expansionary policies. Mr Jacques Chirac, the leader of the RPR who has his eyes on the presidency in 1995, is also thought to favour a more growth-orientated economic policy. Responding to the outcome of the ERM crisis, Mr Chirac said: 'France has found again in the management of its economy the freedom it needs to fight for jobs.' No one is yet prepared openly to challenge the prime minister. Splits within the ruling RPR-UDF coalition would be damaging in the run-up to presidential elections as demonstrated by the failure of the right to unite in 1981 and 1988, which handed consecutive victories to the Socialists. But with politicians returning from the summer break, with the trade union movement showing signs of unity in the face of the planned labour market reforms and with a new influx of students about to attempt to enter the depressed labour market, the pressures for change are likely to increase. Mr Balladur, with an approval rating of more than 50 per cent in opinion polls, remains the most popular prime minister in postwar France. His ability to ride the challenges expected in the autumn will determine whether the political honeymoon, like the holiday season, is drawing to a close.</p>

			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: Independent in spirit and practice - Peter Martin finds enthusiasm and paradox at Bankers' Investment / Investment Trusts MICHAEL Moule is an enthusiast. When he talks about investment trust management, words race each other to be first out of his mouth. When a full coffee cup gets in the way of his eager gestures, it is swept aside unceremoniously; the resulting flood of lukewarm liquid does not interrupt the verbal flow. There is a paradox here: what Moule is describing with such intensity is an investment strategy of caution, restraint, moderation. The Bankers' Investment Trust, which he has managed with striking success since 1977, is an old-fashioned international general investment trust, with an investment attitude to match. Although managed since the mid-1970s by Touche Remnant (since last year, part of the Henderson fund management group), Bankers' has stayed independent in spirit and in practice, refusing to add the TR initials to the front of its name and avoiding cross-holdings in other TR funds. Indeed, independence has been taken to surprising lengths: Bankers' chairman is Andrew Barker, vice-chairman of a rival fund management house, Foreign &amp; Colonial. There are a number of other paradoxes. Moule is a value investor, aiming to buy shares when they are cheap and sell them when the market recognises their virtues once again. That approach traditionally produces good long-term performance, although at the price of never doing remarkably well in any individual year. Yet, Bankers' not only stands top of its performance sector in the Finstat rankings for the past five and seven years, it has also produced good short-term performance in the past few years. Although Moule has a healthy regard for the virtues of dividends, he has taken the trust away from the high end of the income range. His aim is to buy shares with a yield around the middle of the market, with a portfolio yield of around 3 1/2 to 4 per cent. Value investors often concentrate on large, long-term investments in a relatively small number of shares they know well. That way, they get the maximum benefit from their painstaking judgments. By contrast, Bankers' holds shares in a relatively large number of issues - 340 at the last year-end, in October 1992 - and Moule rarely takes large stakes in them. His typical 'unit' of investment is Pounds 1.5m, but often he will start by buying much less. And although he holds some shares happily through long, dull years, waiting for the upturn he is sure will come, he turns over 35 per cent of the portfolio each year. At the last year-end, 49 per cent of Bankers' assets were in the UK, with 23 per cent in the US and 17 per cent in continental Europe. Equities made up 85 per cent of the gross assets, with 8 per cent in convertibles and bonds and the rest in cash. (Moule usually avoids unquoted companies). Bankers' has Pounds 11.3m of debenture debt: a 4 per cent perpetual debenture of Pounds 1.3m; and a Pounds 10m debenture at 10.5 per cent. In general, Moule prefers the highly developed Anglo-Saxon markets. He says: 'The value investor can only operate in very efficient capitalist markets like the US and UK because, in these markets, if the incumbent management won't do what's necessary to realise a company's value, someone else will. You get bailed out of your mistakes if your judgment on asset quality is correct.' Some purchases of undervalued shares pay off spectacularly: when a share yielding 9 per cent goes to 3 per cent, for example. But this happens rarely; a more common success is a share that moves from yielding 60-70 per cent above the market average to yielding 30-40 per cent above it. The trick, says Moule, is to be satisfied with this, and to know the right moment to sell. 'Everything has its price. For every share we own, I know the price at which I'd get out of it.' This approach led him into the mid-cap shares in the FT-SE Mid 250 index late in 1991 and early in 1992. Now, when that index has outperformed spectacularly, he is moving into worse-performing FT-SE 100 stocks, including big drugs companies. The narrowing of Bankers' discount to net asset values in recent years has rewarded long-standing shareholders, and might lead to a new issue of shares if the price goes to a steady 4-5 per cent premium for a while. It has, however, led many traditional insurance company shareholders to sell out (although institutions still dominate the share register). Shareholders buying on such a narrow discount are vulnerable if it widens later on: when investment trusts were most out of fashion, the discount touched 32 per cent. Of course, to a value investor, that would have been a buying signal . . . KEY FACTS At the end of October, 1992, the trust had gross assets of Pounds 229m and net assets of Pounds 219.6m. On April 27, it had net assets per share of 151.2p and the shares were trading at 148 1/2 p, a discount of 1.8 per cent. The yield was 2.9 per cent and the market capitalisation was Pounds 151.2m. Bankers' pays quarterly dividends. Henderson has a management contract with a two-year notice period, for which the annual fee is 0.44 per cent of quoted assets and 1.25 per cent on unquoted assets. BOARD Bankers' has a five-person board chaired by Barker. The other directors are Richard Brewster, chief executive of Jarvis Porter, the printing and packaging group; John Crosland, formerly a director of the Fleming fund management group; Patrick Hedley-Dent, a director of Travel &amp; General Holdings; and Moule. SAVINGS PLAN DETAILS The minimum monthly investment into the savings scheme is Pounds 25, and Pounds 250 for a lump sum purchase. There is a 1 per cent charge on sales and purchases (which falls to 0.5 per cent for transactions of more than Pounds 15,000.) The trust is not eligible for Peps.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the Manuel D'Ornellas' Column: "Playing With Fire"] </F>   [Text] There is no doubt: Alan Garcia is trying to  negotiate with Fujimori's government so that based on the  alleged "ruling," which is just a preliminary report, by the OAS  Inter-American Human Rights Committee, he would be allowed to  return to Peru without any risk of prison or trial.    This strategy was reported by congressman Fernando Olivera  and it is obvious to all: First during an interview with the  U.S. television station CNN, and then with the local RPP [Radio  Programas del Peru], Garcia extends a bouquet to Fujimori,  saying he agrees with him, that he recognizes Fujimori's good  government.    The political message is clear: If Alan Garcia gets what he  wants, he would support Fujimori with his party's vote at the  forthcoming elections slated for next year. That vote could tip  the balance in favor of the president and end the virtual tie,  as demonstrated by the polls between Fujimori and Perez de  Cuellar, should the latter finally launch his candidacy.    Strategists of this rapprochement between the government and  APRA [American Popular Revolutionary Alliance] assume that the  vote controlled by Alan Garcia would be about 15 percent of  overall votes, based on the results of the 1990 elections. This  may be somewhat exaggerated if we consider the latest municipal  elections where APRA was practically torn to pieces at the  ballot boxes. Also, nothing guarantees that APRA members will  blindly follow Alan Garcia's electoral instructions, as happened  over the order given by Haya de la Torres in 1956 and which led  Manuel Prado to victory.    Meanwhile, the possibility that Alan Garcia might be  negotiating some sort of a pact with Fujimori is already  rattling APRA. Agustin Mantilla, who was recently released --  was his release an offering to Garcia? -- claims that it is  impossible to dialogue "with a dictatorship." This position was  immediately supported by Hugo Otero, a tireless applauder of the  former president of the Republic (as we see it, the most fearful  enemy facing the unity of APRA continues to be the former  president's self-exile).    Worst of all, however, is the fact that members of the  government seem to be flirting with the idea of negotiating with  Garcia, of bartering his impunity for an electoral endorsement.  If this is consolidated, it would be an even greater error than  the clumsy rapprochement attempt with Abimael Guzman, which  included sending a birthday cake to Iparraguirre, which deprived  the government of so many votes in the 31 October 1993  referendum. Any whitewash of Garcia would be Fujimori's ethical  and political funeral.</p>

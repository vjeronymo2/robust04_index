			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Long account finishes on strong note A THREE-WEEK trading account that might easily have been expected to end with a whimper closed with a burst of support for London equities yesterday. After initial weakness, the FT-SE 100 Index surged ahead in afternoon trading to end the day 33.2 points up, the high of the day, at 2,643. This left the index 265 points better, since the account opened on April 6 - a gain of more than 11 per cent. Trading began with the sort of world weariness often associated with long accounts. The market was still held back by weakness in the pharmaceuticals stocks and there was an expectation that a Dollars 2bn-plus share offer from General Motors in the US would lead to a weak start on Wall Street. In London, the Footsie tailed off from a shaky opening and was almost 11 points off after the first 45 minutes as dealers locked in profits on selected stocks. However, the Footsie was pulled up by derivatives markets. Strong buying of FT-SE options led to a squeeze in futures which traded at a strong premium to the cash market and pulled it back up. Also, talk that oil exploration company Lasmo might attract a bidder bolstered enthusiasm. Then, the GM share issue failed to dent Wall Street and somewhat disappointing trade and retail figures were discounted. Dealers who had been preparing to straighten their books ahead of the weekend decided that there was still room to manoeuvre upwards and bought heavily, particularly in quality stocks targeted for cyclical recovery. Overseas clients were still happy to pour money into a market which they continue to see as cheap. Mr Robert Rowland of institutional fund manager Lazard Investors said: 'Although the price/earnings multiples of some sectors have expanded to levels that don't look sustainable in the long term in the UK, they continue to look attractive from an international perspective.' Despite the recent rush of buyers, there is apparently still a great deal of money looking for a home and one senior marketmaker said buy orders outranked sell orders by 20 to one. Even the hard-hit pharmaceuticals stocks saw some interest later, although the sector has underperformed the Footsie strongly since the election and, along with oil shares, appears to be on a downward slope. By the close 628.9m shares had been traded. This was up on the previous day's 612.0m, which translated into customer business of Pounds 1.42bn. Retail business in equities maintained the high levels seen throughout the election account as money continued to pour in from overseas.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Observer: Maude transfer The speed with which 39-year-old Francis Maude has jumped from one high-paying job at Salomon Brothers to an even more highly paid one at Morgan Stanley International, is wonderful news for out-of-work MPs. Although his salary is secret it would be surprising if young Maude were not a millionaire by the time he seeks re-election to parliament. He has proved that there are still lush jobs for smart and well-connected boys. Even so, it is far from clear why the former financial secretary at the Treasury is regarded as such a hot property. Apart from a few dogs like British Coal and British Rail, there is not much left to privatise in the UK so Maude's contacts in this area can't be of much use. And given that he has almost certainly not ruled out a return to politics at the first whiff of a safe seat, Morgan Stanley must be seeking an unusually quick pay-back on its latest 'privatisation' investment.</p>

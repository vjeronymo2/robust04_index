			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> DONNA RICE NOW 'BORN-AGAIN'  </P> <P> Donna Rice, a household name after reporters found she spent a weekend with  Gary Hart, has become a "born-again" Christian who spends much of her time  doing charitable work, according to a published report.  </P> <P> A friend of Rice's, Andy Messing, told the Washington Times in a story  Wednesday that she "went back to her roots and because she did, she wound up  coming out of a tailspin that would have killed other people."  </P> <P> Rice, 32, who declined to be interviewed for the story, became an instant  celebrity in 1987 when her relationship with Hart was publicized. Hart dropped  out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, and later made an  unsuccessful re-entry into the contest.  </P> <P> Rice now lives with a female friend in northern Virginia. The newspaper said  she doesn't have a full-time paying job, and quoted friends as saying she has  become quietly involved in charitable work.  </P> <P> The newspaper also said she has a boyfriend and attends some of Washington's  high-profile dinners and events.  </P> <P> "Donna . . . not gone through that much of a change," said Tricia Erickson,  head of a McLean, Va., modeling agency and Rice's designated crisis manager in  1987. "I don't think that she 'went to God,' so to speak. Donna's always been  like that. It isn't some miraculous thing."  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JEOPARDY!  </P> <P> Regarding "Backstage at 'Jeopardy!' " (by Patricia Ward Biederman, Jan. 29): I  was a one-time champion on "Jeopardy!" last March, winning $12,801, a  consolation-prize armoire and color TV, and a headful of golden memories.  People ask me all the time what the experience was like, and rather than talk  myself hoarse, I may just lend them your article, because you really captured  it beautifully.  </P> <P> LESLIE GOODMAN-MALAMUTH  </P> <P> Washington, D.C.  </P></p>

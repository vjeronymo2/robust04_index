			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Minford attacks plans for councils Government plans to scrap Scotland's two-tier system of local government will reduce the Scottish economy's ability to compete internationally and could lead to chaos, Professor Patrick Minford said yesterday. Prof Minford, a rightwing economist and one of the of 'wise men' who advise the Treasury, said large local authorities were needed to take strategic planning decisions involving such things as roads, factories and airports. The costs of such projects were heavily concentrated in a particular locality whereas the benefits were spread widely. Planning powers given to small local councils to block development on 'not in my backyard' grounds would limit Scotland's ability to compete for inward investment. Prof Minford was in Glasgow addressing businessmen and councillors invited by Labour-dominated Strathclyde regional council, which is fighting government plans to replace it and its 19 district councils with 12 unitary authorities under the Scottish local government reform bill.</p>

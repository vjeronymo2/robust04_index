			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Yelena Masyuk] </F>   [Text] [Masyuk] Today, the followers of Lenin's cause met  in Gorkiy Leninskiye at a closed coordinating meeting of  Communist Parties active on the territory of the former USSR.  Oleg Shenin, the chairman of the Council of the Union of CPSU  Communist Parties, noted in his opening speech that the  dictatorial and criminal regimes in the republics of the former  USSR are gaining strength and if communists are idle, then,  according to Shenin, the people will not forgive them.    [Shenin] All the program documents of all the Communist  Parties say that they will strive to restore a single union  state.    [Masyuk] At today's conference the leaders of Communist  organizations discussed two issues. Firstly, the social and  political situation on the territory of the USSR and methods to  strengthen the Communist movement. The second question--a draft  concept for restoring a renewed union. The concept's author is  Yegor Ligachev.    [Ligachev] The concept contains the main principles for the  restoration of a single union state in accordance with the will  of the people.    [Masyuk] Can it be said that the Russian Communist Party is  the leader among the Communist Parties of the CIS countries  today?    [Gennadiy Zyuganov, Russian Communist Party leader] There is  no leading, directing party. There is unity of action.    [Masyuk] In the intervals between sessions a small number of  Communists visited the local Lenin Museum.    Why did you decide to all meet together in Gorkiy  Leninskiye?    [Shenin] I think that it was so as once again to remind all  those who came here and ourselves of the responsibility we bear  toward the founders of our parties.    [Masyuk] Yelena Masyuk, Aleksey Chervyakov, the NTV  television company. [video shows: meeting in progress,  interviews]</p>

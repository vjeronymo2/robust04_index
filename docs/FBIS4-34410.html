			<p>BFN     [Text] Lima, 18 Jun (EFE) -- Alleged commandos of the  Maoist Shining Path [SL] today attacked the Wiese Bank in Lima.  It staged other attacks last night against the Banco Continental  and Banco de la Nacion. The attacks caused damage, but no  victims.    During the attack on the Wiese Bank the terrorists turned  away retirees, who were standing in line to cash their paychecks  before the bank opened. Terrorists yesterday staged an attack  with explosives against the City Hall and a Mormon church run by  U.S. priests in the city of Huancayo, 415 km southeast of Lima,  in the central mountain range of Peru. The terrorist attack did  not cause any casualties, but did cause considerable damage,  according to National Police sources in Huancayo.    With its acts of violence, the Shining Path organization is  today commemorating the killing of 250 Shining Path members  charged with terrorism on 18 and 19 June 1986, during the  administration of Alan Garcia, who remains in asylum in  Colombia. The killings occurred in three prisons in Lima and the  port city of Callao after Shining Path inmates staged prison  riots that were quelled. That date is recalled by the Shining  Path as the "day of heroism."    Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori announced yesterday that  important Shining Path leaders had been arrested. Among those  arrested is Moises Simon Limaco Huayascachi, alias "Ramiro,"  alleged number two man in the Shining Path faction headed today  by Oscar Ramirez Durand, alias "Feliciano."    Also arrested were terrorists Mario Vazquez Rojas, alias  "Roberto," and Walter Tupac Yupanqui Asuquilca. Vazquez Rojas  led the Shining Path's "People's Aid," which plans and executes  crimes and attacks by the band, after replacing Martha Huatay,  who was sentenced to life in prison.</p>

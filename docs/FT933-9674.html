			<p>930809 FT  09 AUG 93 / Deficit plan's impact already discounted CONGRESSIONAL approval of President Bill Clinton's economic plan is unlikely to provoke much reaction from investors when US financial markets open today. The budget measures have been debated for several months, and their impact on the economy has already been priced into both bonds and stocks. In some quarters of industry, the 11th-hour haggling over the package produced noticeable sighs of relief. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association, which represents makers of small aircraft and corporate jets, described the proposed repeal of the luxury tax as good news. 'That has been a deterrent, especially to those buyers who use an aircraft partly for business and partly for their own use,' said GAMA. The trade association also breathed more easily when it learnt that new registration fees would not be imposed on aircraft, and welcomed the much smaller than threatened 4.3 cents a gallon petrol tax. 'That's not going to kill us,' it commented. The National Marine Manufacturers Association was equally encouraged, and glad to see that the tax on luxury items priced at above Dollars 100,000 (Pounds 67,000) died. A spokesman said: 'The tax cost about 25,000 to 30,000 people their jobs on boat lines. It decimated sales of the product, which fell about 70 to 80 per cent. So its demise is good news for boating and for the big boat sector particularly.' Other industry groups were critical of some of the concessions made. The beleaguered commercial airline industry said that it remained adamantly opposed to the imposition of increased taxes on jet fuel - despite the fact that these duties will not now come into effect until October 1995. 'We're continuing to oppose the fuel tax on airlines,' said the Air Transport Association, which represents the main US carriers. 'The two-year exemption is not really the point. . . we think we make our fair contribution already.' Mr Eric Johnson of the Northeastern Loggers Association also criticised some of the last-minute haggling, in which senators won concessions for special interest groups, in exchange for supporting the package. 'I'm afraid the president compromised a bit too much and that may come back to haunt him,' he said. Meanwhile, Monsanto, the big US chemical company, expressed its displeasure over a 90-day moratorium on the sale of bovine growth hormone - a measure designed to appease Senator Russell Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who had pushed for a one-year delay. The moratorium will start after the Food and Drug Administration approves the drug, expected later this year. 'Even if it had come down to a one-day moratorium we would have thought it was wrong,' said Monsanto. 'It violates having a scientific-based regulatory process. There is no reason and no justification for it and we believe that most members of Congress feel that way as well.'</p>

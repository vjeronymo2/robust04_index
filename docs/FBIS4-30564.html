			<p>BFN     [Text] A preliminary contact for top-level talks between  the North and the South is continuing.    At the contact, Kim Yong-sun, chairman of the Reunification  Policy Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly, and head of  our side's delegation, made a keynote speech.    The contents of the keynote speech are as follows:    Mr. Yi Hong-ku, senior delegate, and delegates of the South  side, today we are seated together cherishing the important  mission of preparing for North-South top-level talks. I am  pleased that both sides are holding a preliminary contact today  after reaching an agreement [kyonhaeui ilchirul pogo] on holding  top-level talks.    We are very close to 1995, the year which all fellow  countrymen hope will be the first year of reunification, and  leave but one year before the 50-year mark of national division  which we should no longer pass over.    However, the reality facing our nation is grave. Rather than  removing misunderstanding, distrust, enmity, and confrontation  between the North and the South, they have been accentuated, and  even encouraged by outside forces. In such a situation, we were  faced with a dangerous phase where even unstable peace  [pulanjonghan pyonghwa] was endangered.    Our people are now at the crossroads of choosing one of two  roads, either peace or war, or reunification or national common  destruction [minjogui kongmyolinya], which cannot coexist.    At this solemn point, all fellow countrymen are looking to  the patriotic determination [aegukchogin kyoltanul] of the  top-level leaders of both sides more ardently than ever before.    We firmly believe that the convocation of top-level talks  between the North and the South will be an important historic  occasion for correctly setting the direction of our nation.    Delegates from the South side, the authority of top-level  leaders of the two sides and the destiny of the nation are  entrusted to North-South top-level talks, and the interest of  the world is focused on these talks.    The North-South top-level talks should become, at any cost,  successful talks which achieve national reconciliation and unity  of all of the countrymen and which give a bright hope for the  country's peace and for its independent and peaceful  reunification. We have consistently adhered to the position of  marking the turning point for the start towards realization of  the country's reunification through top-level talks without  outside forces' interference.    As your side knows, the respected and beloved President Kim  Il- song personally initiated top-level talks as early as May  1972, when North-South dialogue first began, and since then, has  paid special attention to seeing to it that top-level talks,  which will be of significance for the country's reunification,  are held.    Our proposal for the exchange of special envoys in May last  year was also part of our efforts for top-level talks. However,  these efforts failed to bear due fruit.    It is indeed fortunate that the top-level talks which failed  to be realized for the scores of years in the past have come to  witness their rays for the first time today, 50 years since the  country was divided. We think that precisely in this foundation  lies our common position of worrying over the nation's today and  tomorrow. We would like to believe that this position is  precisely a manifestation of the independent spirit of shaping  the nation's destiny with our Korean people's own strength.    If there are no differences in this national independent  spirit between the North and the South, we can say that success  of top- level talks has been guaranteed, because the top-level  talks' ideal of linking the North and the South into one body is  based precisely on our national, independent spirit, the source  of our nation's will and strength to shape our destiny with our  own strength, and the firm guarantee for defending the nation's  common interests without falling prey to outside forces  victimizing our nation's interests.    If the two sides start with this independent spirit and the  nation's position, the North and the South will be able to  achieve reconciliation and unity; easily transcend all  differences in accordance with the principles of independence,  peaceful reunification, and great national unity; overcome the  difficult situation with the nation's united, national  independent strength; and, thus, stand on the peak of  reunification and prosperity which all fellow countrymen desire.    The North-South top-level talks that we are now going to  have, will become the creation of a great new national history  where the the history of antagonism that continued for half a  century in our country changes into a history of great national  unity; the history of confrontation becomes a history of peace;  and the history of division becomes a history of reunification.  It will undoubtedly give our 70 million fellow countrymen  bright hope for reunification in the nineties and will also  regain the great pride of our nation which has outstanding  history, tradition, and wisdom.    This will also give great happiness to the world's  peace-loving people who are worried about the situation on the  Korean peninsula.    While frankly stating our basic views on the pressing  top-level talks between the North and South, and emphasizing the  important responsibility of both sides for the successful  preparation of the historic top-level talks between the North  and South, I will now put forth our proposal on the basic issues  to be discussed at the preliminary contact.    First is the issue of the venue of the top-level talks. We  propose that the venue of the top-level talks be held in  Pyongyang. As your side knows, when President Kim Yong-sam was  in the opposition party, the respected and beloved President Kim  Il-song had already asked him to visit Pyongyang, and President  Kim Yong-sam had repeatedly expressed the will that he will meet  with President Kim Il-song, irrespective of the venue, and that  he will visit Pyongyang. We believe that setting Pyongyang as  the venue coincides with the will of the top-level of both sides.    Second is the issue of the date of the top-level talks. We  propose to hold the top-level talks in mid-August. We believe  that this date is significant because it is right about the day  when the North and South all celebrate 15 August.    Third is the issue of the working-level procedure for the  top- level talks between the North and South. We must discuss  various working-level procedural issues for holding the  top-level talks. We believe that except for important issues  such as the venue and date, it is rational to provide a  delegates' contact right after today's contact ends with one  delegate from the preliminary contact of each side and two suite  members of each side to discuss the other working-level issues.  The delegates' contact should start from 1 July, and should be  able to discuss issues such as the organization and scope of the  delegation, schedule of sojourn, dispatch of advance team,  procedures for exchange of visits, guarantee of accommodations,  guaranteeing personal safety, and other working- level issues.    Fourth is the issue of creating an atmosphere for holding  the  top-level talks. If the talks are to be successful so that the  top- levels of the North and South can meet, we believe that it  is important for both sides to create a good atmosphere. Thus,  we propose that from 1 July both sides completely stop all acts  that may cloud the atmosphere for the top-level talks.    As such, while putting forth our proposal regarding the  holding of the top-level talks between the North and South, we  propose that an agreement on the preliminary contact for the  top-level talks between the North and South be adopted along  these lines so that it can be announced today.</p>

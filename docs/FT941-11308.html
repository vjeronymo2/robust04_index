			<p>940204 FT  04 FEB 94 / International Company News: Productivity boost helps CMI cut losses Productivity improvements and the rand's weakness against the dollar helped Consolidated Metallurgical Industries (CMI), South Africa's second largest ferrochrome producer, reduce its pre-tax loss to R3.8m (Dollars 1.1m) in the half-year to December 31 1993 from R21m the year before. Sales revenue fell to R118.2m from R125.7m as worldwide oversupply of ferrochrome, a key ingredient in the manufacture of stainless steel, and high stock levels ensured prices remained depressed. Mr Zed van der Walt, managing director, said any benefit from record demand for stainless steel in 1993 was cancelled out by the surfeit of cheap ferrochrome supplied from the former Soviet Union and China. The company's ferrochrome furnaces were operating at 50 per cent capacity although good export orders for chrome ore allowed its mines to produce at full tilt. CMI reported a reduced operating loss of R1.78m against R16.8m but fell well short of being able to cover its interest charges and preference share dividend payments. Mr van der Walt said minor improvements in sales volumes or the exchange rate would see CMI return to operational profitability in 1994, and there was still room for the company to cut variable costs at its smelters. Lower interest rates and an improved cash position contributed to a fall in net interest to R2.03m from R4.19m on interest-bearing debt of R143.4m, up from R136.3m. The payment of the R5.18 interim preference dividend left CMI with an attributable loss of R9.01m compared with R26.1m. Mr Alan Kuhnert, marketing director, said world ferrochrome demand would rise in tandem with increased stainless steel consumption in 1994. South African producers, with half of their overall capacity lying idle, were well placed to profit from the increase as output from the former Soviet Union stagnated.</p>

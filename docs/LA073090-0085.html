			<p><P> July 30, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NIBBLES AND BITS  </P> <P> Friday's "Battle of the Saxes" to benefit the area's homeless didn't end up  benefitting very many people -- other than those who were paid to help out.  According to Earline Carroll, who organized the benefit concert in which  saxophonists Big Jay McNeeley and Chuck Higgins squared off at the Saddleback  Inn in Santa Ana, 125 tickets were sold for a total of $1,875.  </P> <P> But when the costs of entertainment ($1,600), venue ($400), advertising ($270)  and other incidentals were added in, Carroll found herself about $400 in the  red. Carroll wasn't discouraged, though. She said she plans to begin organizing  another benefit soon. "I came out a little short on this one, but that's OK,"  she said. "I'm going to go back next time and do it right." She added that no  "name" entertainment will likely be asked to contribute next time.  </P></p>

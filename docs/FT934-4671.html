			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / Survey of International Fund Management (5): Rally may soon end - Government bond markets Bond investors will probably look back on the early 1990s with affection, grateful for the generous profits they have reaped from the world's main government bond markets. With the economies of the US, Europe, Japan and Australia in recession, there was plenty of scope for investors to make gains in the fixed income markets. As inflation was brought under control, there was a strong case for lower interest rates in order to stimulate the flagging economies. (Falling rates, with a low inflation background, are generally good for bond markets.) In the first 10 months of 1993, the high-yielding European government bond markets provided investors with returns of over 20 per cent in local currency terms. Spanish government bonds showed a gain of 23.13 per cent, while Italian government bonds rose 22.45 per cent, according to Kemper Investment Management Co. Given the strong performance of the bond markets, what is perhaps so surprising is that many institutions still place a relatively low proportion of their funds in fixed income investments. According to Caps (Combined Actuarial Performance Services), the average holding of global bonds in UK pension funds has steadily declined over the past decade. At the end of September 1993, UK pension funds held 9 per cent of their assets in global bonds (5 per cent in overseas bonds, 4 per cent in UK fixed interest). In 1982, they had nothing in overseas bond markets, but an average of 21 per cent in UK fixed income. The question is: just how much further can the bull run in bond markets go? Japanese yields have fallen steadily since 1991 - the official discount rate fell from 6 per cent in 1991 to 1.75 per cent in 1993, and 10-year government bond yields have declined from a high of 6.81 per cent in 1991 to a low of 3.61 per cent in November 1993. As a consequence, many international investors believe there is little more to be gained from the Japanese government bond market. In the US, the Treasury bond market has suffered jitters recently over whether inflation is likely to pick up, fuelling expectations that interest rates could be edging up again. One international fund manager says: 'We see the global government bond rally as being very close to its end. In fact in some countries - the US, and possibly the UK - it could have gone too far already.' So much of the focus now is on continental Europe, in particular the expectation that the Bundesbank will continue to bring down its key interest rates. In the early 1990s, investors felt they could hardly go wrong in Europe. The prospect of European economic and monetary union meant that European inflation and interest rates were expected to converge gradually, while investors saw little risk on the exchange rate front because of the close currency alliance of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM). The result was that the Bundesbank set the pace at which other countries could lower their domestic interest rates; and as the Bundesbank stubbornly refused to lower its rates as rapidly as some of the other Europeans would have liked, more and more countries were forced either to devalue within the ERM or to abandon their links, and when that failed, they opted for wider fluctuation bands. The UK pound and the Italian lira broke free in autumn 1992, unable to bear the strain. The fluctuation bands were widened for most of the other currencies this summer. For many international investors, these changes have had important consequences. Before the collapse of the ERM, investors had a tendency to lump the European markets into the D-Mark core bloc and the high-yielders. With the system's collapse, they expected not only to see individual central banks using their freedom to ease more rapidly (they were largely disappointed), but they also realised that it was prudent to examine European markets on a more individual basis. Nick Henderson, at Gartmore fund management, says: 'Break-up of the ERM means we have to pay closer attention to individual countries - for example, Belgium. There the government bond market had been swept along on hard core currency status, but following the ERM break-up, spreads have widened and currency has remained weak.'</p>

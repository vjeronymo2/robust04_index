			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Claire Gebhardt] </F>   [Text] Anti-trust legislation remains a priority in the new  South Africa and will follow British competition policy, says  Tito Mboweni of the ANC's economics department. Mboweni said  yesterday legislation was currently being drafted, but that  there was no clarity about when it would be implemented. "I  would stress that we're not plotting the downfall of companies  -- the legislation will simply provide a framework for effective  competition in the South African economy."    Mboweni said anti-trust measures existed in most countries,  and more so in the developed world. Companies which had  suffered from the activities of monopolies and cartels were  strongly in favour of the move, he said. "Those who have  benefited, obviously aren't."    In an interview, Mboweni said he hoped that anti-trust  legislation would lead to greater competition domestically as  well as internationally and would break up the concentration of  economic power. He said there was a long way to go for full  black empowerment.    Mboweni thought many South African companies were going  about  affirmative action in "completely the wrong way" and said the  ANC had no intention of introducing quotas. "Putting Africans  in highly visible positions without giving them authority has  inflated the cost of affirmative action."    "Many black people are now beyond the reach of some  companies  and this action has promoted the tendency for black people to  `job hop' for the highest salary, rather than for job  satisfaction." Mboweni said companies should not lose sight of  the fact that affirmative action was not the exclusive domain of  one group, but included coloureds, black and white women and the  disabled.    Mboweni said some consultants had made a killing advising  companies on affirmative action -- in most cases wrongly.  However, the situation would become clearer once a framework  for affirmative action had been legislated, he said. "There  will be no quotas, but from now onwards any hiring, promotion or  salary structures should be completely free of discrimination  and staffing should reflect the demographics of our society."    Mboweni said anti-trust legislation was a cornerstone of  building the economy, as outlined in the ANC's Reconstruction  and Development Programme (RDP). The anti-trust authority would  be independent of government, he said. "The British system is  based on a separation of powers to give integrity and  transparency."    Four bodies in Britain formed the competition authorities --  the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), the Office of Fair  Trading (OFT), the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) and  the Restrictive Practices Court (RPC). "The investigating  authority, usually the Office of Fair Trading (OFT), initiates  the inquiry, but doesn't make a judgment on the issue. This is  done by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) or, in the  case of restrictive practices, by the Restrictive Practices  Court."    However, South African anti-trust legislation would not copy  the British system exactly, but would be adapted to suit South  African conditions, he said. Unbundling, the corporate  community's latest flavour, was not a way to avoid anti-trust,  he said. "We also tend to focus strongly on interlocking  directorates and pyramid structures."    Mboweni said it was hoped that a commission looking into  these matters would shortly come up with recommendations.  Analysts yesterday said the concentration of economic power in  South Africa had evolved over the years, due in part to foreign  exchange regulations, the absorption of local interests from  disinvesting foreign holding companies, a non-growth closed  economy and the lack of a definition of capital gains for tax  purposes.</p>

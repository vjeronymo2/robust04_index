			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondent] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 25 Feb--The Russian Foreign Ministry today  issued a press statement in connection with the arrest of the  Ameses in Washington. It says:    "Sufficiently close contacts exist between Russia and the  United States to raise any questions. As has been announced,  the investigation into the Ames case was going on for 10 months.  We suggest that this was sufficient time for us to be contacted  directly and for them to share their anxieties with us before  making them public.    "We are opposed to the attempts by the special services to  drag the political leadership into their mutual relations. The  appropriate channels are there. And they can be fully brought  into use.    "The political consequences of this story give cause for  concern. Our partnership has withstood a series of serious  tests, the latest one arising from the crisis around Sarajevo.  We shall cope with this misunderstanding, too. However there  are circles in the United States, just as there are,  incidentally, in Russia, who are not interested in friendship  between the two major powers. They became noticeably active  after the successful summit in Moscow, at which a solution was  made to bring relations between Russia and the United States to  the stage of mature strategic partnership. We reaffirm yet  again that within the framework of this course it is possible to  find an appropriate solution to this situation, too."</p>

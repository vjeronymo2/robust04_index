			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] An overall agreement was signed today in Moscow  by the all-Russia trade union associations, the employers, and  the government. The document spells out general principles for  conducting an agreed socio-economic policy in Russia. The  government, employers, and trade unions sign such agreements  every year. But this time, our correspondent Andrey Zenkov  thinks, it contains something unusual.    [Begin Zenkov recording] Although a trilateral agreement is  signed every year, its fate this year gave rise to particular  concern. And if today, before my very eyes, the agreement had  not been signed by the labor and agriculture ministers, the  first deputy economics and finance ministers, two deputy finance  ministers and a whole collection of other senior officials, I  would not have had too much faith in the reality of the  documents myself.    Judge for yourselves. Paragraph two of part one envisages an  agreed settlement and state control of energy prices and fares.  And paragraph 22 of part three talks about clearing all the  wage arrears for workers in state-financed sectors in the second  quarter of this year. Fresh state subsidies worth billions can  be seen with the naked eye, yet no trace can be detected of any  compromise moves by the trade unions, for example. Let's say, a  temporary renunciation of strike action. Anyway, the immediate  future will give analysts the opportunity to assess the document  in detail. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Wing Kay Po] </F>   [Text] Lu Ping, China's top official for Hong Kong, will  meet Heung Yee Kuk representatives tomorrow to discuss the New  Territories inheritance row.    Lu, the director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office,  will discuss how to introduce Basic Law provisions which  stipulate protection of the rights and customs of indigenous  residents in the New Territories, according to sources. His  meeting will be seen as a gesture of support for the indigenous  residents locked in a bitter row with the Government over a  proposal by a legislator, Christine Loh, to give New Territories  women inheritance rights.    It is understood that Lu will discuss internal matters of  the  Kuk, the Government's rural advisory body on New Territories'  affairs. Lu, who last year told members of the Federation of  Women he supported equal inheritance rights for indigenous  women, has recently publicly condemned government plans to  support Loh's amendment.    Lu has threatened the New Territories (Land) (Exemption)  Bill  would be scrapped in 1997. Yesterday, the vice-chairman of the  Kuk, Daniel Lam, said he had not yet received confirmation of  the meeting. Lam said it would be good for the Kuk to have the  opportunity to meet Lu to put the views of indigenous people.    He said if they were to meet Lu, he would want to talk about  the land exemption bill and the impact of the adoption of the  United Nations' anti sex-discrimination convention, Cedaw, on  the indigenous community. The Government is now finalising  recommendations to the Executive Council on the extension of  Cedaw to Hong Kong, which are set to affect discriminatory  practices against New Territories women. A formal announcement  is expected to be made this month. Women's rights campaigners  will stage an anti- feudalism rally outside the Kuk offices  today to protest against objections to grant rural women equal  rights of inheritance.    The protest outside the Kuk headquarters in Kowloon Tong  will  be linked to the May 4 movement in China where tens of thousands  of students marched in Beijing on May 4, 1919 to oppose  oppressive feudal traditions. Lam said he welcomed the  opportunity to exchange views with the women's groups and said  the Kuk supported sexual equality, but said it should not be  rolled into the inheritance debate.</p>

			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Trade-off with France keeps Gatt on course  -EC ministers agree face-saving formula FRANCE last night failed to prevent the Uruguay Round world trade reform negotiations from proceeding in Geneva, but won a face-saving formula whereby EC concessions on subsidised food exports would have to be balanced by 'concrete results' in other trade areas. Following a six-hour wrangle between EC foreign, trade and farm ministers, a French demand that would have put paid to any further progress in the six-year negotiations was beaten back - but without isolating France. Ministers and diplomats from several member states hoped that, as a result, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) negotiations would not become an additional casus belli at this weekend's already fraught summit of EC leaders in Edinburgh. 'What is vital is that France is not cornered,' a senior French official in the European Commission observed. The French were jubilant, although the main result of their effort is more likely to be further financial concessions to EC farmers when agriculture ministers meet again in Brussels next Monday. Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, said after last night's meeting that 'we refused to accept a fait accompli'. France opposes limits on the volume of subsidised food exports, agreed by the EC and the US last month. It maintains this will demand sacrifices from EC farmers which go further than this year's reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The price and production cuts under the new CAP are the effective limit of the Commission's mandate to negotiate within Gatt. 'The consequences of the proposed accord are unacceptable for the farming economy of the Community,' French Agriculture Minister Jean-Pierre Soisson said. Last night France insisted no 'technical' follow-through on the EC-US agreement could take place until it was clear what the other side of the Gatt ledger held - such as openings in financial services and market access. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, told ministers there would be no possibility of talks in these and a dozen other trade areas earmarked for liberalisation unless the agriculture dossier was put aside. The farm trade row has held up for two years any progress in areas like industrial tariff reduction. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture minister, passionately insisted yesterday that what had been agreed on farm trade with the US fell within the remit of Gatt reform. At the summit in Portugal earlier this year France won support from Ireland, Italy, Belgium, Spain and, to a lesser degree, Denmark in insisting that a final Gatt settlement would have to be demonstrably compatible with the CAP reform. One upshot of yesterday's meeting is that next week's gathering of farm ministers is likely to turn into a bazaar. Some senior Commission officials forecast that extra agriculture spending can be justified technically in the light of recent currency turbulence, and that this could help fund concessions to France and others.</p>

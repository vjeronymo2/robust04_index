Dr. Badr Malallah, the general coordinator of the Arab  development funds, has said that the Gulf funds have been  assigned by their governments to fully implement and supervise  development projects in the occupied Arab territories in  cooperation with the World Bank.    He said, in remarks made on the occasion of the 35th meeting  of the coordination group of the national and regional Arab  development organizations, which got underway yesterday in Abu  Dhabi, that contacts were ongoing between the funds and the  World Bank to set up a mechanism for future cooperation in the  development process in light of the $2 billion "assistance deal"  that was decided upon in the assistance donor countries last  October in Washington.    The Gulf states have so far promised to give $150 million,  of  which $100 million will come from Saudi Arabia, $25 million from  the United Arab Emirates, and the same sum from Kuwait. Malallah  indicated that these amounts were not final, but merely the  first step in supporting "the course of development in  Palestine." He said that the Arab Fund for Economic and Social  Development [AFESD] would present a report in the meeting about  its experience in funding development projects in the occupied  Arab territories. He added that this report would help the rest  of the funds find a common direction for future cooperation in  supporting development in the autonomous Palestinian areas. He  indicated that AFESD had 10 years of experience in this field.    For his part, Isma'il al-Zirani, director of operations of  AFESD, said that the volume of AFESD's operations in the  occupied Arab territories, from the time of its establishment  until the present, amounted to $40 million. He said that AFESD  would fund $30 million worth of projects in those areas in the  current year.</p>

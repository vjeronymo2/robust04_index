			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIVES OF THE 'INTELLECTUALS'  </P> <P> I have just read with disgust your paper's review by Russell Jacoby of Paul  Johnson's latest book, "Intellectuals" (Book Review, March 19). It is bad  enough that you chose a literary competitor of Johnson to review his book,  Jacoby having also written on this topic, but to select a reviewer who could do  little more than savage a respected historian is despicable.  </P> <P> Jacoby neither reviews the book's content, nor effectively refutes either  Johnson's premise or his supporting data. Rather, your collegiate reviewer  seems content to demonstrate an intellectual phenomena which probably  encouraged the creation of "Intellectuals" in the first place: Hysterical  intolerance for any thought that is not ideologically collectivist in content,  sympathy or tone.  </P> <P> It appears to be Jacoby's position that knowledge of these intellectuals'  personal lives is unnecessary or unfair. Doubtless, Jacoby would advance  simpatico arguments which would bleat that we should do as such men as Karl  Marx said, and not as Karl Marx did; and above all, we would probably hear the  refrain that collectivist ideas are more important than the people upon whom  they are imposed. Johnson opposes this intellectual trend, and ably points that  those who would impose their views on society must bear scrutiny of their own  backgrounds. I say "Bravo" to Paul Johnson for giving us the truth with the  bark on; all intellectual scoundrels deserve their comeuppance sometime.  </P> <P> STANLEY L. MOERBEEK  </P> <P> BREA, CALIF.  </P></p>

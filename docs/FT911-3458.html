			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Firmer tone but volume remains thin THE UK stock market turned its attention back to the domestic scene yesterday, when the FT-SE climbed painfully above 2,500 again after Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer, made favourable comments on the progress of inflation. But the immediate gain of 17.5 Footsie points, following Mr Lamont's speech to the Institute of Directors, was trimmed later and trading volume remained disappointing. Equities opened lower, reacting to the further fall of 38 Dow points on Wall Street overnight. Mr Lamont's statement that UK inflation is falling fast revived hopes that the next cut in base rates may not be quite so far away as feared; the market's swift response was also fuelled by firmness in stock index futures. The stock market topped off fairly quickly, however, also discouraged by news of a widening in the UK monthly current account trade deficit to Pounds 432m in March. A further attempt to move forward when Wall Street opened higher was checked when the Dow slipped back from its early high to show a gain of about 8 points in London trading hours. The final London reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,503.8 for a net rise of 13 points. Equity dealers found the recapture of the 2,500 area unconvincing, largely because turnover was unimpressive. Equity strategists continue to take a cautious view of the near-term outlook for the equity market. However, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said there are some grounds for mild optimism about the UK economy, in spite of 'an exceedingly grim first quarter'. It warned that political factors could unsettle sterling and hence keep real interest rates high. Seaq volume of 520.6m shares yesterday, against 403m on Monday, was inflated by turnover of 101m shares in Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, comprised largely of a deal of 45m shares in the advertising group, double-counted on Seaq. More detailed data from the London Stock Exchange indicated that retail, or customer, interest in equities continues to fall well below the Pounds 1bn daily level still seen as the target for the London securities industry to trade profitably. The revived uncertainties in the industry were revealed by the decision of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the UK investment bank, to pull out of the US equities market; Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank, disclosed financial write-offs in its US arm. However, there was better news on progress at County NatWest, the securities arm of National Westminster. The stock market was also waiting for news on the proposals to merge the London Traded Options Market with Liffe, the London International Financial Futures Exchange. The market took on board two more rights issues, the most significant being a call for Pounds 162m from Taylor Woodrow, one of Britain's largest housebuilders. The construction and building sector also had to face a disappointing trading statement from Tarmac. The blue chip stocks were mostly a shade firmer on the day, responding to the more optimistic views on inflation rather than to yesterday's moves by central banks to sell the US dollar. ICI, with first-quarter trading figures due tomorrow, edged higher. There was a scattering of modest gains among the high street retailers, which continued to respond to the unexpected improvement in sales volume in March reported this week by the Confederation of British Industry.</p>

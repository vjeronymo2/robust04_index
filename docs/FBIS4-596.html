			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by M. Schnehage] </F>   [Text] Johannesburg Apr 12 SAPA -- The Pan Africanist  Congress [PAC] on Tuesday [12 April] welcomed international  mediation to solve the constitutional deadlock involving the  African National Congress, the Inkatha Freedom Party, the Zulu  monarchy and the government. A PAC statement issued on Tuesday  suggested mediators consider "dropping" clauses from the interim  constitution which prejudiced certain parties "and leaving the  entire matter of the constitutional future to the elected  constituent assembly to resolve".    "This will level the playing field and should open the way  for participation by all in the elections".    The PAC also suggested that all security forces should  immediately be placed under joint control by the political  parties, "including the IFP". "This will ensure all-round  respect for law and order and increase the chances for an  election which will be free, fair and without intimidation", the  statement concluded.</p>

In the communique, Escobar  claims to be the spokesman for the Escobar family and the  arrested members of the Medellin Cartel in various Colombian  prisons and asks Los Pepes [Persecuted by Pablo Escobar] for  peace. The brother of the former chief of the Medellin Cartel  asks his archenemies to seek a negotiated and public solution to  the conflicts they maintain with his group.    Roberto Escobar said his family has maintained a peaceful  attitude despite the attacks they have sustained following the  death of the Medellin Cartel capo. Roberto Escobar remains  under medical surveillance at the military hospital after the  Pepes attacked him at the Itagui Maximum Security Prison. It  has been unofficially learned that there is little chance that  the brother of late drug kingpin Pablo Escobar Gaviria will  recover his vision following this attack.</p>

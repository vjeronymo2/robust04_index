The visit  was qualified as a protocol visit.    Today at noon, Perez Yoma went to the office of  President-elect Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle on Hindemburg Street to  inform him about his meeting with the Army commander. It was a  cordial meeting, Perez Yoma said, adding that he told Pinochet  of his intention to maintain extremely good relations with the  military during the next administration.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified reporter] Gen. Pinochet  never  paid a visit to Defense Minister Rojas. What do you think of  this?    [Perez Yoma] I did not know that, and I greatly appreciate  the fact that Gen. Pinochet, together with four other generals,  visited me in my home and presented these major generals to me.  So I am very happy about it. [end recording]    Perez Yoma was asked whether the visit was a demonstration  of  Gen. Pinochet's subordination to political power.    [Begin Perez Yoma recording] I think Gen. Pinochet has  demonstrated he is willing to submit to the political power. I  think his visit expresses his good intentions regarding this  subject.

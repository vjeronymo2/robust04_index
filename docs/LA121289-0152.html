			<p><P> December 12, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> NO DATE YET FOR TV NHL REPLAYS  </P> <P> No date has been set for the National Hockey League to begin using television  replays to decide disputed goals but the system will probably be adopted, a  league spokesman said today.  </P> <P> "There is no resolution yet," NHL spokesman Gary Meagher said in response to a  report in the Toronto Star that the league would begin using replays for the  Stanley Cup playoffs in 1991.  </P> <P> The league will experiment with replays during the preseason in 1990, the  newspaper reported. Only the referee would be allowed to seek a television  ruling, it said.  </P> <P> Meagher said replays were discussed at an NHL general managers meeting in  Chicago last month and will be on the agenda at the next meeting in January at  Orlando, Fla.  </P></p>

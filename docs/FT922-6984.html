			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Letter: Second class citizens of the sky Sir, Martyn Thomas, in his letter (May 19) concerning maintenance of national customs and border control for non-commercial aircraft flying between European countries, was right in upbraiding the UK. But he should also condemn the two EC commissioners, Martin Bangemann (industrial policy) and Sir Leon Brittan (competition) for their inaction. Both are aware that a person can today drive his car from the Netherlands to Belgium or from Belgium to France without passport control, but if the same person flies his aircraft from the self same countries to the other, customs and border controls apply and are likely to apply in all EC countries in 1993. My 750,000 members between them operate some 70,000 light aeroplanes, microlight aircraft, gliders, balloons, helicopters, etc. These aerial vehicles are used primarily for sport and recreation. Their pilots will, just like business travellers in their light aircraft, become second class European citizens left to face time and money wasting border controls at designated customs airports, unless the EC commissioners take action. The concept of the single European market will be meaningless unless national customs and border controls for road, rail, sea and air within the EC are abandoned.

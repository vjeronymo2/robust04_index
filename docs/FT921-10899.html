			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian farmers seek more support from government RUSSIA'S FLEDGLING class of private farmers, experimenting with western style lobbying, yesterday hit out against an unpopular 28 per cent value added tax and demanded more support from the government. But a random survey of delegates at a National Farmers Congress in Moscow suggested that most were optimistic about the future despite the additional hardship brought on by a first month of market reforms. President Boris Yeltsin's move to a market economy is partly predicated on the successive attempts - begun more than a year ago but now being accelerated - to boost agricultural supply through the growth of private farming. Last month the government decreed an end to subsidies for loss-making farms in the state sector. Cheap credit was high on the list of demands as speaker after speaker demanded a lowering of interest rates, or special banks to finance farmers. Mr Viktor Paskinov of the Tambov region even suggested that farmers should be included in government committees handling foreign credits so that they would get the bulk of the money. Mrs Galina Khnichkova, 32, a former hospital worker, acquired 10 hectares of land with her husband, who learned farming as a boy on a collective farm. Having acquired equipment relatively cheaply - before the liberalisation of prices last month - her main complaint was a leap in interest rates to 11 per cent (on a bank loan of Rbs50,000) and local authority slowness in granting her another 15 ha. 'All young people should have land, work on it, and stop expecting the government to look after them. If they do, they will look at life differently,' Mrs Khnichkova said in an interview during a break. Until the family fur and bee-keeping business gets off the ground, as she expects it do to in a year or so, she and her husband are living on savings. Mr Sergei Boyakov, 41, has already achieved success, admitting he now considers himself 'a rich man'. His cattle farm occupies 238 hectares in the Penza region and he has just paid Rbs6m for equipment to set up a sausage making plant to process his own meat direct. His friend, Valery, has a much smaller farm, producing both meat and dairy products. Asked how he explained widespread milk shortages in Russia, he said he for one had no means of transporting milk 238 km (148 miles) to the nearest town. Nor did he have any incentive to sell milk to a neighbouring collective farm which had refrigeration facilities because 'they pay me only half of what they get for milk from the state'. His solution was to turn all his milk into butter. He also planned to buy up a privatised cafe in town, where he would sell dumplings made with his own meat. 'The most important thing is that the state should not bother us. All we need is land and freedom,' he explained. But six decades after private farmers were wiped out by collectivisation under Stalin, many speakers, conscious of their new political importance, demanded direct political power. 'All of you have come here with problems,' a delegate from the Orel region told the congress, sponsored by Russia's association of farms and agricultural co-operatives. 'But these problems will remain as long as we do not seize power for ourselves at local level.' He echoed complaints by many farmers that the local authorities that controlled distribution of land and equipment were resisting a switch to private agriculture. A farmer from the autonomous republic of Kabardin-Balkaria complained that the latter's declaration of sovereignty gave it an excuse to shun Russian legislation on land reform. Calling for tough action from Moscow to enforce the law everywhere in the Russian Federation, he promised the government that in 'two or three years time you won't need to take on debts to import food'.</p>

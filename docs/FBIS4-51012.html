			<p>BFN     [Text] The influential Hong Kong General Chamber of  Commerce yesterday signalled its alliance with forces opposed to  the Governor's political reform package.    The chamber's chairman, William Fung, criticised Chris  Patten's plan to give all 2.7 million workers a second vote in  functional constituencies, and to scrap block voting by  companies.    "We felt that the administration's proposals to create new,  large, functional constituencies, representing an electorate of  some 2.7 million from nine industrial and commercial sectors, to  be a major departure from the concept and character of the  existing functional constituencies," Fung said.    Jimmy McGregor, who represents the chamber in the  Legislative  Council but who was voted off its general committee last month,  said Fung's statement was an example of bias as a result of  business interests.    "It shows that the chamber is very much China-orientated  politically, which is not surprising. So many members of the  chamber have investments in China," he said.    Fung said the chamber believed that the nine new functional  constituencies should retain the essential features --  representing specific interests of each group with a limited  electorate -- of the existing 21 functional constituencies.  Although McGregor supports Patten's proposals on the new  functional constituencies, he had reservations.    "I have always supported [the idea] that the nine new  functional constituencies have to be aligned with the existing  21 functional constituencies," he said.    At the last elections in 1991, only about 100,000 people  were  allowed to elect members to functional constituencies. One  constituency is made up of 36 local councillors. A former  representative, Gilbert Leung, was jailed for vote buying.    Functional constituencies will make up half the 60 seats in  the legislature next year. Patten believes widening the  electorate will make legislators more accountable to public  opinion but China has accused him of trying to introduce direct  elections by the back door. A government spokesman denied this,  saying: "Every independent test of the Governor's proposals, be  they by the British House of Commons Foreign Affairs Committee  or independent legal experts who have given evidence, have all  said the Governor's proposals are within the framework of the  Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.    "The Governor's proposals, including that on functional  constituencies, have been considered by the Legislative Council  on three occasions."    Fung also gave his opinion on the establishment of the Court  of Final Appeal, delayed by the Legislative Council's refusal to  endorse a Sino-British agreement. Fung said the chamber backed  its establishment as soon as possible.    "Many members of the chamber would have preferred some  discretion to be allowed on the number of overseas judges to  rest with the court," Fung said. "Nevertheless, agreement has  been reached in the Joint Liaison Group to restrict the number  of overseas judges to one, and therefore this agreement must be  honoured."    Fung said the court needed to be set up as soon as possible  in order to build credibility before 1997 and to help maintain  confidence in Hong Kong's position as a leading commercial and  financial centre.</p>

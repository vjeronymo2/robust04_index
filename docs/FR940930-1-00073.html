This notice should be sent no later than the date the RDFI recovers funds from the account.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Forfeiture of right to limit liability for failure to notify account holder(s).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Failure to provide notice to account holders, as prescribed in &sect;210.11 shall result in the forfeiture by the RDFI of its ability to limit its liability under this part. The Government may require the RDFI to provide proof that written notice was mailed to joint account holders. Proof may include, but is not limited to, a file copy of the notice, a certified mail receipt, or documentation pertaining to the standard operating procedure of the RDFI that such a notice is routinely sent. If an RDFI is not able to furnish proof of notice in response to a request by the Government, it shall forfeit any right it may have to limit its liability for that payment(s) and the Government may request the Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reserve Bank to debit the account of the RDFI for any otherwise unrecovered amount.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;210.12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Erroneous death information, restitution and over recoveries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reporting corrections or errors to the Government.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the RDFI learns that the Receiver or beneficiary is not deceased or legally incapacitated, or that the date of death is incorrect, the RDFI shall inform the Government of the error immediately. Until the RDFI is notified otherwise, however, it remains liable for Government credits as specified in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;210.10 of this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relief from or reduction in liability_error in fact or error in date of death.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Government Originator will determine whether the report of an error in the fact of a Receiver's death or legal incapacity, or the date of death, is correct. After its review, the Government Originator will certify its determination in writing to the RDFI and inform the RDFI of relief from or change to its liability. If the Government Originator agrees that the original notice of death or legal incapacity was incorrect, or the date of death is materially different from the original notice, it shall stop further reclamation activity that it determines to be inappropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Restitution by the Government of RDFI funds improperly reclaimed. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  When appropriate, the Government Originator will remit to the RDFI any funds incorrectly returned or otherwise received from the RDFI.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Over/under recoveries.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the event of an over recovery by the Government for an erroneous credit, the Government Originator will return immediately the excess amount, by appropriate means, to the party suffering the loss.

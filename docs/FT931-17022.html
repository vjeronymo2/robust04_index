			<p>930102 FT  02 JAN 93 / Books: When Puccini threw away his zucchini - Anthony Curtis gives his verdict on the Christmas literary competitions CLERIHEW-composing can easily become an addictive occupation, as many competitors confessed. 'Once one has started,' said Christopher Mylne, 'it is difficult to stop thinking up silly rhymes to fit - though I admit to being defeated by Tchaikovsky. . .' The task, you will recall, was to make up new clerihews about composers and musicians. Mr C. Thwaites reminded me of 'an oldie but goodie' - Jules Massenet/ Never wrote /A Mass/ In A. And Mary Holtby remembered from childhood another vintage item - Palestrina/ Wrote a concerto for the concertina/ Which Monteverdi/ Orchestrated for the hurdy-gurdy. No one thought of including any of my music critic friends on the lines of this one, c1930: 'Next week', said Ernest Newman,/ 'It will be Schumann'./ But when next week came/ It was Wagner just the same. I had to stop counting the number of times conductors such as Henry Wood or Andre Previn or George Solti (another difficult rhyme) sat on/ the baton; or the occasions when Maria Callas/ sang in Dallas; or when some poor composer could not hold a candle/ to Handel. Pavarotti was frequently grotty, and quite often dotty, and there were unkind observations as to the size of his botty. Nigel Kennedy was more often than not discovered playing a threnody with the aggressive termination from Freda Smithson of an over-ripe tomato/ interrupting his pizzicato. Johann Sebastian Bach/ always got up with the lark (Dian Shervinton), or if not, he sat in the dark (W. Roll) but that - as more than one entry pointed out - did not curtail his procreative prowess. In contrast, Mahler sat in the parlour (E Gifford) whereas Bizet/ sat on a bidet (Garbis Haddad), Scriabin/ made an awful din (Graham Green), Souza was/ a bit of a boozer (Andrew Stark) and Liszt was frequently hissed (B. Miller) and often, of course, kissed, and on at least one occasion pissed (Ranald Boyle). No cookie was shrewder, rhymed Eve Turner neatly, than Buxtehude. Sir Arnold Bax Had no FAX (Brian Capon) (they had not been invented); Placido Domingo, was said by Henry Moxon, to be always lucky at bingo, but, added Anthony Brown, of that game Kiri/ Is weary. Hugo Wolf/ played golf (Peter J Andrews), Humperdinck/ had rum to drink (Robin Fuller) and Schumann was only human (Bernard McGinley). Over fondness for pasta seemed to be the main affliction of Italian musicians. Donizetti was addicted to spaghetti (OVS Heath), Boccherini to fetuccini and tortellini (James Robertson) and Stefan Grapelli to tagliatelli (Steven Berry). Puccini, however, suffered from baby marrows and threw away his zucchini (Simon Hubbard-Ford). Duke Ellington's penchant was somewhat implausibly for wellingtons (Catherine Presswood), but Shirley Bassey had, more realistically, an eloquent chassis (Sylvia Trump) and one that is classy (Eric Pearce). Several people had James Galway either leaving or not leaving his flute in the hallway. D. Rhys-Williams envisaged Neil Kinnock in a dispute over Early Music with Trevor Pinnock. And Isobel Baillie/ Raised high notes gaily (WID Scott). It was Peter Read who, when he switched on the Beeb/, ingeniously listened to the strains of Delibes. George Formby, we are assured by John Adams, once passed through the village of Quarmby. No one found a convincing rhyme for Kanawa. Nor for Rameau, who was learnedly celebrated by William and Jo Godfree (though this year is not, as they seemed to think, the 300th anniversary of his birth in 1683). Brahms appeared to be a favourite with the Thane of Glamis and also to have qualms/ When Joachim/ offered to have a go at him (Sir Toby Weaver). Monica G Ribon voiced a universal dilemma when she asked Does Turandot/ Rhyme with 'forgot'/ Or is it Turandot/ As in 'I don't know'? Chopin was hopin' (ouch]) to play with one hand/ on George Sand (Katie Mallett) and Tristan told Isolde/ 'You don't look a day older' . . . (David Hussey). Both Eve Turner and Prudence Raper had musicians taking Valium before embarking on Spem in Alium. The problem in many cases was the second couplet. So often a brilliant beginning had crashed into bathos by line four. It is much more difficult to compose a memorable clerihew than it looks. Perhaps the trick is not to try too hard for your punch-line but just let it come naturally of its own accord. Anyway, Pounds 30 each to all those whose clerihews are printed below. They are the joint winners. CLERIHEWS CON BRIO Pergolesi Doesn't send me crazy But he's a better composer Than Cimarosa. (Ambrose Streatfeild Harriet with icy look Told Berlioz to sling his hook. He then composed the Symphonie Fantastique In utter pique. (Rick Watson) Benjamin Britten Liked to have his ears bitten By Peter Pears. Poor old dears. (B I Straton-Ferrier) The future of jazz got darker With Charlie Parker. It finally sunk With Thelonius Monk. (Philip Skelsey) Beniamono Gigli If he were feeling cigli Sometimes went a bit wobile When singing La donna e mobile. (Mrs Jean Platt) Elton John Goes on and on He's not so funny, But oh] the money. (Donald Lloyd) Maria Callas First signed for Crystal Palace But they let her go To Milano. (Ken Turner) Peter Cornelius Was only a three quarters genius, But his Barber of Bagdad Wasn't half bad. (Garfield Black) de Sylva, Brown and Henderson With only their suspenders on Danced in the street for joy At writing Sonny Boy. (Peter Marks) Julian Bream Dreamed a dream . . . Lute stolen in Cuba Replaced by a tuba. (Alastair Norton) FOR our second competition you were asked to send an extract from the obituary of any fictional character. The deadpan style of the obituarist - often skating on some pretty thin ice - is not difficult to mimic. Many of the many attempts managed it all too convincingly. Subjects for burial began with legendary and biblical figures such as the Devil, Methusaleh (' . . . born into one of the oldest families on record . . . was just at the peak of his career' - Marius Szafianski) Achilles, Jonah, Grendel's Mother, the Ancient Mariner (' . . . although suffering from a withered arm, his eyes never lost their glittering power' - J E Smith). King Arthur, Ulysses, Don Quixote, Brunnhilde ('Following her husband's tragic death in a mugging incident, her name was romantically linked to that of Gunther the Gibichung.' - Anthony Lyman-Dixon), Gandalf, The Pied Piper ('In an inspired career move, he became a pest control officer for the Weser valley' - Mrs H. C Lee), The Wife of Bath ('It is heartening to think that our sister's long battle with the Orthodontists is now over' - J McCormick), were popular obituarees. There were contemporaries such as Adrian Mole ('Although only in his 14th year, Mole's perceptive analyses of family life and the strains implicit in modern marriage, minutely chronicled as part of his daily observations, will be immensely valued by future researchers' - D A Prince), Horace Rumpole and Lord Dixon of Bushy Park ('Populary known as 'Lucky Jim' he made a significant contribution to the dissemination of higher education' - Peter Knight). Characters from crime fiction were also popular candidates with Sherlock Holmes, hotly pursued gravewards by Moriarty, Miss Marple, Poirot, Peter Wimsey, and several James Bonds. Shakespeare was a prime source. Lady Macbeth 'was a legendary hostess. Dinner parties at Forres, begun with a sonorous knocking on the South Chamber door, were eagerly attended by luminaries from every shade of the political spectrum' (Guy Thomas). Evelyn I Stark told us that: 'Financial circles were shocked to learn yesterday of the murder of Polonius in what appears to have been a case of mistaken identity. His 'Neither a borrower nor a lender be' speech, known as the 'Elsinore Document' . . . has recently been adopted by many treasury officials and advocates tight control of the money supply.' S L Valdez chronicled the last days of King Lear: 'After fierce arguments with his daughters, the king declared himself homeless and applied to Berkshire County Council for assistance on the grounds of former residence in Windsor. When this was turned down, the king joined fellow subjects in Windsor Great Park's 'cardboard city' during the worst of the winter storms and later collapsed'. Dickens also inspired some brave efforts - Oliver Twist, for example: 'From the earliest he scandalised devoted carers by his excessive gluttony; then in his first employment, not only bullied his fellow workers, but left without heeding statutory notice requirements' - Ken Turner. There were several shots at Heathcliff with a noble attempt at his family tree from John Rosselli. Then we had Bloom; Stephen Dedalus - ' . . . blown up and killed by a terrorist bomb which he was about to plant in the lobby of the Gresham Hotel in Dublin' - Shedden Alexander; Goldfinger; Anna Karenina; Mr Collins ' . . . distinguished by his opposition to women's ordination' - Mrs Patricia C Atkinson; both Dr and Mrs Proudie; Albertine in one massive Proustian sentence (Alan Leslie) and many Bertie Woosters and Billy Bunters (see the example below). Even more persistent were figures from nursery rhyme and children's literature with the death of Cock Robin way ahead at the top followed by Snow White, Peter Pan, Peter Rabbit, BB Wolf, Miss Piggy, Noddy, Humpty Dumpty - 'he was a good egg' (passim). In fact, there was such a wealth of talent that the task of choosing the eventual winners was even more fraught than usual. However here goes - Pounds 50 each to those whose entries are printed below. They are joint-winners, and thanks to everyone for a splendid record-breaking entry. R I P SHYLOCK Shylock was perhaps the most innovative financier of his time, and his influence put Venetian capital markets on a more regulated footing. In an era of speculative excess, when venture capital was frequently provided on an 'old boy' basis, Shylock, a relative outsider, introduced loan financing by way of the fixed-interest bond. His creative flair, however, was seen to most effect in his novel penalty clauses, which gave the bond-holder an exceptionally strong incentive to redeem the bond at the due date. These instruments became known as 'funk bonds'. His career ended controversially, in the so-called 'Balthazar Affair' (named after the famous disappearing barrister), when Shylock's commercial logic proved stronger meat than the business community of the day could stomach. There are many, however, who believe that his trial verdict was unsafe. (Noel Petty) CAPULET / MONTAGUE The dangers of drug abuse have been highlighted this week by the tragic deaths of teenagers Juliet Capulet and Romeo Montague. Fourteen-year-old Juliet had apparently undegone a form of marriage to Montague against her father's wishes and she went into a coma as a result of a strong barbiturate, taken deliberately to feign death. Young Montague was unaware of her action and took an overdose. Upon waking from the coma Juliet took her own life. The role of the church in this sorry affair is somewhat dubious as it seem the drugs were supplied by churchmen. The Vatican has promised a full inquiry. (Mrs A D Woodhouse) MR DORIAN GRAY The death has been reported of Mr Dorian Gray of Mayfair, the well-known bon vivant and patron of the arts. He was discovered by servants at home, apparently having suffered fatal injuries whilst attempting to repair a previously unknown portrait of a young man, possibly a relative. Although Mr Gray was well known in his role of aficionado of the theatre, opera and the art world, little was known about his background. Even his age was closely guarded secret. (C E Hurst) SIR WILLIAM BUNTER, KBE, MP The death of the former Chancellor, Sir William Bunter, has shocked everyone, especially a surprising number who enjoyed a friendship going back to Oxford and even Greyfriars. Throughout his comparatively short life he remained irrepressibly optimistic, whether over an expected postal order or the green shoots of economic recovery. Sir William's career was not without controversy, both trivial, involving tuck-shops and off-licenses, and of more moment concerning the acquisition of public funds for private use, for example, when his probity was questioned, but always he contrived to extricate himself from a situation that might well, to a lesser mortal, have spelt disgrace. (RG Snoxell) CHRISTIAN Our neighbour Christian will come no more amongst us. Owing to a burden on his back, he had some frenzy-distemper which drove him to seek a Kingdom where he would have a Crown of Glory and be clothed with Immortality. We saw him afar fall into a slough, but he dragged himself out and passed through a wicket-gate. There were lions in the path, a foul fiend, Apollyon, a Fair wherein were many vain persons, and he in danger of execution, Death's shadowy Vale and Giant Despair's Doubting Castle . . . After so vile a journey he crossed a deep river and thence came to a city filled with Trumpets and Harps and Streets of Gold. But he that hath told us of the Pilgrimage hath lately confessed ''Twas but a dream'. Christian is surely lying beneath those waters whither we have no stomach to follow him. (KP Hopkinson) MR S. GRUNDY The premature death of Solomon Grundy was widely mourned by his many relatives and friends. His rapid and brilliant maturation was due to diet - a lesson to us all. He was born on Monday, christened on Tuesday and remained a life-long Anglican. At an unusually early age, he was married on Wednesday. This was an enduringly happy union, despite adverse comment from some sections of the press. An obscure disease overtook him on Thursday. His condition worsened on Friday. Every effort was made to save him, but he died on Saturday. Full of honours, he was buried on Sunday. He is survived by his childless widow. Beatification is in progress. (A G Cheston)</p>

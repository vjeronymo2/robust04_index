			<p><P> July 12, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DOW ADVANCES 18.02 TO A NEW POST-CRASH HIGH  </P> <P> Wall Street's blue chip Dow index advanced to a new post-crash high today as  investors carried the stock market's rally through a seventh consecutive  session.  </P> <P> The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 18.02 points at 2,532.63, bringing  its gain since the start of last week to about 92 points.  </P> <P> Advancing shares outnumbered declines 4 to 3 in moderate New York Stock  Exchange volume of 160.55 million shares.  </P> <P> The market, which has advanced on expectations of falling interest rates and  renewed takeover speculation, faltered earlier in the day. Traders said  investors were growing cautious ahead of a spate of June economic reports due  Friday that could contain some unpleasant surprises.  </P> <P> But futures-related program trading kicked in late in the session to push the  Dow index to a new post-crash closing high, past the June 23 finish of  2,531.87.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bond Prices Flat  </P> <P> Bond prices were unchanged to slightly lower in dull early trading today.  </P> <P> The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond was down 5/32 point, or about $1.50 per  $1,000 face amount, around midday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite  direction from its price, held steady at 8.03% from late Tuesday.  </P> <P> Analysts said trading was extremely light in the absence of economic news to  move the credit markets.  </P> <P> William Sullivan, director of money market research for Dean Witter Reynolds  Inc., said a Treasury auction later today on the seven-year note contributed to  the decline.  </P> <P> "I think basically dealers are beginning to soften prices up slightly in an  attempt to garner some interest in the auction," he said.  </P> <P> The auction of $7.25 billion in notes is designed to raise $2.8 billion in cash  for the Treasury.  </P> <P> A slightly lower dollar this morning also was lending a weak tone to the  market, but wasn't a significant factor, Sullivan said.  </P> <P> In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term governments  were unchanged, intermediate maturities were down 1/32 point to 5/32 point and  long-term issues fell from 1/8 point to 7/32 point, according to Telerate Inc.,  the financial information service.  </P> <P> The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the price of a bond  with a $1,000 face value.  </P> <P> The Shearson Lehman Hutton daily Treasury bond index, which measures price  movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with maturities of a year or  longer, fell 0.98 to 1,192.00.  </P> <P> In corporate trading, industrials were lower. Moody's investment grade  corporate bond index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80  corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.22 to 329.63.  </P> <P> Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.98% as the discount lost 1 basis  point to 7.73%. Yields on six-month bills were down to 7.83% as the discount  fell 4 basis points to 7.44%. Yields on one-year bills dropped to 7.81% as the  discount fell 4 basis points to 7.29%.  </P></p>

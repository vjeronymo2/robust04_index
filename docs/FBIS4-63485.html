			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Murtazin; from the "Novosti" </F> newscast]    [Text] Today, Leonid Kravchuk held a meeting to discuss the  political situation in Crimea. The president of Ukraine intends  to cancel the decision taken by the Crimean Supreme Soviet to  restore the Crimean Constitution of 6 May 1992, according to  which legal relations between Ukraine and Crimea are on a treaty  basis and the people of Crimea have the right to dual  citizenship. Earlier on television, Kravchuk announced that he  will act decisively and consistently within the Constitution to  protect Ukraine's territorial integrity.    At the same time, in Kiev, the republic's Supreme Council is  meeting behind closed doors and the president is expected to  speak. He intends to persuade the deputies to cancel the verdict  by the Crimean Supreme Council and will most likely get approval  for introducing a regime of special rule in Crimea.    [Announcer Nelli Petkova] Our correspondent has just  reported  that Ukraine's Supreme Council has adopted the following  decision: To recommend that Crimea's Supreme Soviet reexamine  and cancel its constitutional decision. If it fails to do so,  in 10 days a decision by the Ukraine's Supreme Council on  suspending the acts in question adopted by the Crimean  parliament will automatically come into force. This decision  was made at about 2000 Moscow time.    The deputies then started to set up a special deputies'  commission, which, along with people's deputies from Crimea,  will go to Simferopol to settle all these problems.</p>

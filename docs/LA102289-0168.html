			<p><P> October 22, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> JUNIOR COLLEGE FOOTBALL ROUNDUP  </P> <P> Pierce 30, West L.A. 15 -- The Brahmas, who had allowed an average of 37 points  and a WSC-high 470.4 yards per game, turned in their best defensive effort of  the season, snapping a four-game losing streak in a game at West Los Angeles  College.  </P> <P> Pierce (2-4, 1-4), which had not allowed fewer than 28 points in a game,  limited the Oilers to 283 yards while using its second defensive unit for much  of the game.  </P> <P> The Brahmas' offense also snapped out of its slump. Pierce, held to 17 points  in its past two games combined, equaled that amount in the first half.  </P> <P> Quarterback Jamie Grossman led the Brahmas to scores on their first two  possessions, hitting Shannon Culver with a 27-yard touchdown pass 4:03 into the  game and Chad Zeigler with a 14-yard pass 5:26 later. Andrew Munoz's 23-yard  field goal 1:49 before halftime gave Pierce a 17-0 lead.  </P> <P> West Los Angeles scored four minutes into the third quarter. Wymon Henson  caught a pass from Ruanada Manuel that had been deflected to him at the Pierce  40-yard line and sprinted untouched into the end zone.  </P> <P> The game's final 15 points came in a 15-second span. Manuel tossed a 10-yard  touchdown pass to Jeff Epps with 3:33 left, then Culver returned the ensuing  kickoff 91 yards for a score.  </P> <P> Holder Mike Knieriem bobbled the snap on the conversion attempt, and his pass  was intercepted by Demetrius Jennett. The 5-foot-10, 230-pound freshman nose  guard ran 95 yards for two West Los Angeles points, under a rule instituted  last season. STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

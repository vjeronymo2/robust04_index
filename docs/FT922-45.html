			<p>920630 FT  30 JUN 92 / Observer: Nunneley's turn It is always rather sad when a respected chairman resigns because something untoward happened on his watch. Even so, George Nissen's departure from the chairmanship of Imro is little more than a symbolic act and must undermine the position of John Morgan, the watchdog's full-time chief executive. At least Robert Fleming's Charles Nunneley, who will be Imro's acting chairman, is a professional fund-manager. But otherwise his views about how Imro should conduct its affairs don't sound terribly radical. In a letter to the Securities &amp; Investment Review magazine, Nunneley says that 'pressures to change the system whenever a fraud is discovered will lead only to greater expense and uncertainty, and are particularly ill-advised when the system is only just beginning to settle down'.

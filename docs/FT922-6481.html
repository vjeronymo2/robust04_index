			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: CU preference issue Commercial Union, the composite insurer, made a Pounds 100m preference share issue this week. At the same time it announced that it had made a loss in the first quarter of this year, but this was not as large as expected. CU has increased its market share, and the move was seen as showing that the group was still expanding. Its shares were down slightly on Wednesday, but had regained most of this by the end of the week.</p>

			<p>930714 FT  14 JUL 93 / Revenue ruling on bank is reversed COMMERZBANK, one of Germany's largest banks, has won a long-running legal dispute with the UK's tax authorities. The European Court of Justice ruled yesterday that efforts by the Inland Revenue to hold back about Pounds 5m in compensation for interest built up on incorrectly assessed tax were contrary to the Treaty of Rome. Mr Stephen Kon, partner of SJ Berwin, the UK solicitors which represented Commerzbank, said the case had 'important implications' for tax legislation in the UK and other EC countries. Commerzbank successfully contested a UK tax assessment in 1990. But the Inland Revenue refused a repayment of interest that would have been earned on the wrongly assessed payments on the grounds that the bank operated through a branch office and was not resident in the UK. The High Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice after the bank challenged the decision. Mr Kon said that the judgment 'creates considerable scope for dealing with discriminatory provisions of this nature both in the UK and other EC domestic law, and a good deal of litigation may well follow'. He pointed to other UK tax reliefs in UK law which are not available to non-residents, including relief on low earnings for corporation tax for small companies and relief on interest deducted on payments to non-resident lenders. Mr Kon said similar anomalies arose in 'legislation in other EC countries, all of which will now be subject to challenge'. The Inland Revenue said that it would write to companies which it believed would be affected by the decision and make the necessary repayments. It added: 'We will give some publicity to the case so that everybody is aware of the change.' The European Court ruling followed a preliminary ruling by the advocate-general in March. It says: 'Articles 52 and 58 of the Treaty of Rome prevent the legislation of a member state from granting repayment supplement on overpaid tax to companies which are resident for tax purposes in that state, whilst refusing the supplement to companies resident for tax purposes in another member state. 'The fact that the latter would not have been exempt from tax if they had been resident in that state is of no relevance.'</p>

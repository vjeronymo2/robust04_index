			<p>940507 FT  07 MAY 94 / Finance and the Family: Merger splits investors - The latest building society link-up plan This week's announcement of a proposed merger between the Northern Rock and North of England building societies again throws the spotlight on the financial sweeteners - societies prefer the word bonuses - which members may be offered to support such deals. Last month's announcement that Lloyds Bank wanted to take over the Cheltenham and Gloucester increased the stakes. If that take-over overcomes the regulatory hurdles, C&amp;G voting investors can expect an average payment of Pounds 1,700, with the biggest savers getting a maximum Pounds 10,000. In the Northern Rock/North of England merger, bonus payments will not be on the C&amp;G scale, although their size has yet to be decided. For many members of the two Tyne and Wear-based societies, however, the most interesting point in this deal could be that, while the North of England's 272,500 investors and borrowers will be offered a sweetener, the Northern Rock's 1.3m will not. The reason? Although North of England is much the smaller of the two, with assets of Pounds 1.5bn against Northern Rock's Pounds 7.3bn, it has a larger reserve ratio - 5.45 per cent against the Northern Rock's 4.3. Since the merger will dilute the North of England's reserve ratio, members are to be compensated. Many Northern Rock members are not impressed with this argument, judging from customers' reactions at one of its biggest Newcastle branches this week. 'I think we should get something,' said Alistair Brown, of North Shields, a Northern Rock saver and mortgage-holder. He warned that the disparate treatment could affect the way he votes in August when both societies' members will be balloted for their support. Lynn Gatenby who, with her husband, has a mortgage at the North of England and savings in the Northern Rock, was philosophical: 'You can't win all the time.' She added: 'Together, they will be stronger.' But graphic artist Robert Carr and his wife, Maureen, both of whom save with Northern Rock, were less phlegmatic. 'We should get the same benefit,' Carr said. 'And if they can afford to buy the North of England, they can afford to give a lower interest rate on mortgages and higher interest on savings.' At the North of England, there seemed less unease - and there was no sign that the sums talked about in the Lloyds/C&amp;G deal had turned heads. 'I don't think the bonus will come to very much,' said mortgage and account-holder Jean Marron. Butcher Phillip Spoors, a North of England saver, supported the merger. He thought a bigger bonus coupled with loss of mutual status, on the lines of Lloyds/C&amp;G, would be acceptable, too. Janet Kean, a housewife who saves with the North of England, disagreed. While likely to vote for the merger, she would not have welcomed a bigger bonus and loss of mutual status. 'I prefer a building society to the banks. I have more control over my money with a building society.' Carr also felt building societies were 'far friendlier' than banks: he was worried that the trend to bigger societies would lead to poorer service, with machines replacing counter staff. Fears about the seemingly relentless merger tide were voiced, too, by Northern Rock current account-holder John Harrison, a legal executive. He warned that bonus payments might be a short-term gain. 'It's very worrying - the number of building societies is getting smaller and smaller,' he added. 'Eventually, there will be so few that there will be a virtual monopoly among them and interest rates and investors will suffer.'</p>

			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Chevron to Stop Selling Solvents: Citing the growing cost of environmental  regulations, the San Francisco firm said it would stop making thinners and  solvents by Jan. 31.  </P> <P> Chevron is the largest West Coast manufacturer of thinners, used in paints, dry  cleaning, charcoal lighter fluid, concrete curing, food processing and  industrial cleaners. The company makes thinners and solvents at its El Segundo  and Salt Lake City refineries. Discontinuing the products, which are byproducts  of gasoline and jet fuel manufacturing, will reduce operating costs at the  refineries but not result in the loss of any jobs, Chevron said.  </P></p>

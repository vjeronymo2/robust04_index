Australia finished at a two- month high. HONG KONG had an eight-day rally brought to an end as the Hang Seng index retreated 60.98, or 1.1 per cent, to 5,362.41. Turnover eased to HKDollars 2.93bn from HKDollars 3.16bn. The index dropped 50 points in the first 15 minutes on rumours that HSBC Holdings was to increase its Pounds 3.3bn bid for Midland Bank, of the UK, in response to the rival offer by Lloyds Bank.

The All Ordinaries index moved ahead 24.1 to 1,629.8 in turnover of ADollars 257.1m.

The composite index climbed 15.48 to 612.72 in turnover of Won387.3bn, after Won394.8bn. Expectations of an improvement in economic relations between North and South Korea gave a boost to Daewoo group subsidiaries, which stand to benefit. Daewoo Corp and Daewoo Electronics both rose by Won600 to Won11,700 and Won10,600 respectively. TAIWAN reversed early gains to close mildly lower. The weighted index lost 10.76 at 4,513.19, after recording an intraday high of 4,557.93. Turnover was TDollars 21.45bn, after TDollars 24.3bn.

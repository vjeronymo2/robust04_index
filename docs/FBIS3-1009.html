A Ugandan daily newspaper the NEW VISION said today  that a former major, Mr. (Bernard Busokoza) and a lieutenant,  Mr. (Paul Kamana), had secretly crossed the border from Uganda  to Zaire between late February and early March. It said the two  were suspected by authorities in Burundi of masterminding a coup  attempt last October in which President Melchior Ndadaye was  killed by renegade troops. About 100,000 people died in the  ensuing ethnic bloodletting.    Burundi had said in December that the two men had fled to  Uganda and President Yoweri Museveni ordered their arrest but  said they could not be extradited, as the two countries have no  extradition agreement.</p>

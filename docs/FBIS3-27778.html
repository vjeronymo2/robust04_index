Maragay] </F>   [Text] National Security Adviser Jose Almonte said  yesterday the stalled peace talks between the government and  various insurgent forces have been a cause of alarm for the  Ramos administration but added that the government could not be  faulted for the slow progress of the talks.    In an interview with Malacanang newsmen, Almonte admitted it  was very difficult to give a time-frame for the conclusion of  the peace negotiations with the communist rebels, Moro National  Liberation Front (MNLF) and rightist rebel soldiers.    "It depends on several factors which are not within the  control of the government," he said.    The exploratory talks between the government and the  National  Democratic Front (NDF) scheduled this month in Vietnam have been  shelved anew because of certain conditions being demanded by NDF  leader Jose Maria Sison which are unacceptable to the government.    The peace talks between the government and the MNLF have  also  bogged down because the government has rejected a demand of MNLF  Chairman Nur Misuari that he be allowed to have 500 armed  security men while attending the negotiations outside of his  base in Sulu.    The Rebolusyonaryong Alyansang Makabayan [Nationalist  Revolutionary Alliance] (RAM) led by former army Colonel  Gregorio "Gringo" Honasan has been very critical over the lack  of progress in the peace talks.    Almonte expressed the view that the various rebel groups  will  not go back to the hills to resume the fighting just because the  peace process has been faltering.    The national security adviser said the basic reforms which  the government has instituted has "pulled the rug from under the  feet of the rebels."    "There was a pre-emption of the cause of the rebels," he  said, stressing that the government's programs also reflect the  cause of the rebels in many ways.    "Therefore, there is no reason for the rebels to continue  fighting the government, in addition of course to the changes  happening in the world," he said.    "Insofar as the socio-political framework is concerned, we  could say that the nation is ready for the economic thrust as  defined by the government," he added.    Almonte rated the restoration of social and political  stability as one of the major accomplishments of the Ramos  administration during the past 540 days.    He said the best indicator of stability is the fact that the  various rebel groups are talking with the government about the  peaceful resolution of the armed conflict.    Asked about his opinion on the current confrontations in the  political arena, Almonte said these are indicative of a vibrant  democratic process.    "We expect these activities. We should be worried when they  no longer take place," he said.</p>

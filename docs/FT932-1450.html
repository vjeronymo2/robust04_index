			<p>930623 FT  23 JUN 93 / Survey of Spain, Banking and Finance (9): Caution and consolidation - Domestic Banks SPAIN'S private banks association, the AEB, forecast this month that 1993 profits for the sector as a whole would be similar to the Pta529bn that it posted last year. The estimate suggests, on the one hand, that bank results are now stabilising and, on the other, that a division between the more and the less profitable institutions that emerged decisively in 1992 is likely to remain in place. The bankers will be pleased to see no further losses in 1993. Nobody in the sector cares to recall 1992, a year that was characterised by most bank chairmen as the most difficult in a decade and which saw the overall profit of the domestic banks fall by 15 per cent. The fall was not, however, evenly spread. A breakdown of the 1992 results showed tumbling profits for Banesto, for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV) and for Banco Central Hispano (BCH), but improved income, albeit by less than in the past, at Banco Santander and at the always extremely profitable Banco Popular. Argentaria, which was reporting its first full financial year, showed a healthy profit. The wide gulf that can exist in Spain's banking sector is illustrated by comparing the extreme cases of Banesto and Popular. Banesto's average assets last year were more than double those of Popular but Popular's market capitalisation this month was nearly twice that of Banesto; Popular's ROA in 1992 was staggering 2.12 per cent, while Banesto's was 0.26 per cent. The losers last year blamed their poor results on a sharp decrease in extraordinary income through disposals. This will no longer be necessarily the case for profits from non-banking business for the sector as a whole was up to Pta20bn in the first quarter of this year against the Pta12bn total in the first three months of last year. Since January, Banesto and BCH, who were both notably below the fault line that separated the profitable from the less profitable, have disposed of a national branch network and three regional networks respectively. But the chief reason that the losses may have bottomed out is that the alarming increase of non-performing loans that set in last year appears to have peaked. On the strength of the first-quarter figures, the AEB estimated that the non-performing loans this year will rise to Pta300bn against the 1992 total of Pta500bn. First-quarter provisions by the sector as a whole this year were up by 40 per cent against the first three months of 1992. At Pta80bn, the first-quarter total was similar to the average volume of three-month provisioning in 1992, when bad debts, and provisions, escalated sharply in the second half of the year. Caution and consolidation are now the watchwords and the banks have considerably tightened their loan policies. They are also dragging their feet over cheapening their credits and passing on to their clients the lowered rates that the monetary authorities introduced following the peseta's May devaluation. The tardiness over the rate cuts underlined a clear policy difference between the private banks and the state-controlled Argentaria group which brought its prime lending rate in mid-June down to 11.50 per cent, just 25 basis points above the benchmark rate set by the Bank of Spain. Mr Francisco Luzon, Argentaria's chairman, said the move anticipated general cuts throughout Europe and that it represented his banking group's contribution to economic recovery. The rival banks in the private sector believed however that Argentaria had acted in response to the pleas by the Economy Ministry, which is, after all, its master, for cheaper money. The AEB said it would be 'very difficult' for the sector to shadow the official cuts in the short term. This was in part because the interest rate-sensitive interbank market provides only 10 per cent of the funds raised by the private banks. It was also because margins are already very squeezed; the average current account was delivering an interest of 8.7 per cent at the end of March against 8.34 per cent at the begining of the year. In their different ways all the banks are presently very active: Banesto, the weakest of the big banks, is undergoing a remarkable capital increase with the aid of J. P. Morgan of the US; BBV is demonstrably improving its operating profits; BCH is determinedly tackling its merger traumas; and Santander, ever the domestic sector's pacemaker, is out in front with an attempt to break into the mortgage market. The heightened competition will no doubt be a factor against any swing towards greater profitability for the sector as a whole. Gone are the cosy quasi-cartel days that existed until the late 1980s when domestic banks respected each other's business and were tightly regulated. The competition will also ensure that the division between the more and the less profitable big banks remains very much in place. The present slump for the banks is not unlike the one at the start of the 1980s when the economy also ground to a halt and there was a dramatic increase in bad loans. But there is one key difference. 'In the early 1980s, we all came out of the banking crisis in step. Now our starting positions are quite different,' says Mr Luis Valls, co-chairman of Banco Popular. Investors are going to have to chose between those who are starting well behind and offer very attractive prices and the expensive front-line favourites. Across the field, however, none is likely to fare worse than in 1992.</p>

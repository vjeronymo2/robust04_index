			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Education department shake-up announced The Department for Education yesterday announced a package of radical internal reforms aimed at answering the claims of rightwing educationalists that national curriculum reforms have been sabotaged by civil servants. Officials admitted that reforms had been 'bogged down in detail', and restructuring would allow civil servants to discover more of what was happening 'at the ground level and in the regions'. The changes, which follow a review by the consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, will be backed up by replacement of the department's two most senior personnel to allow more direct ministerial control. From the end of next month the department will have both a new permanent secretary - after the departure of Sir Geoffrey Holland to the University of Exeter - and a new deputy secretary in charge of the sensitive issues of the national curriculum, teacher-training, and teachers' pay. Both appointments will be filled from outside the department, with Mr Peter Owen moving from the Cabinet Office to take up the post as deputy secretary, and Mr Tim Lankester moving from the Overseas Development Administration to become permanent secretary. Task forces will be created to tackle key issues, while officials will have individual responsibilities for different regions. Mr John Patten, the education secretary, said: 'The changes in the education world mean that the department itself needs to be even more flexible and responsive.' Quangos have been created to cover grant-maintained schools, the curriculum, further and higher education, student loans and teacher-training. The Department for Education is also for the first time creating an international relations branch. This will deal with the European Union, which has an increasingly important role in education, and promote educational exports on the international market. Mr Tim Boswell, further and higher education minister, said that the UK was attempting to boost exports by attracting foreign students and exporting educational materials such as books and software.</p>

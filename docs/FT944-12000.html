			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / UK Company News: Confident in the ability to deliver - John Weston puts BAe's case for taking over VSEL The battle over VSEL, the Barrow-based submarine maker, is starting to get aggressive. In part that is because the fight is not just about the future of one shipyard in Cumbria, but about the future direction of the entire UK defence industry. And as it is so important, it is a fight which neither side can afford to lose. So what kind of industry will it be and will British Aerospace or GEC lead it? Mr John Weston, chairman of British Aerospace's defence arm, speaks with obvious conviction about who should be in the driving seat. 'If the government has to pick a national champion in defence, then I think leadership by GEC is not the best solution.' His view is that British Aerospace has the right skills, right products and the imagination necessary to succeed in the increasingly complex world of defence manufacturing. For good measure he adds that while BAe has had its fair share of problems with its civil operations, its defence arm has been consistently profitable with good margins and is 50 per cent larger than GEC's defence operation. 'Systems integration and the ability to manage prime contracts are the most important areas for a defence company now,' he argues. Mr Weston's point is that modern military systems are so complex that controlling the process of putting the parts together is as important as the ability to design new equipment itself. With the ministry of defence pushing more of the financial risks of developing and manufacturing equipment on to defence companies, the skill of being able to control a project with hundreds of subcontractors and suppliers, and millions of components, is vital for profitability. These are two skills which, he claims, BAe has in abundance. 'Things have changed enormously over the past 50 years. The Spitfire was probably designed by a team of at most 50 engineers. We have between 4,000 and 5,000 people working on the Eurofighter design. It is no longer possible to talk of individuals designing aircraft. You need the systems to be able to control that hugely complex process.' In the case of VSEL, the job of bringing together the electronics, nuclear reactor, sonar, weapons and manufacture of the pressure hull of a submarine and making them work is a similar job to the production of a fighter aircraft. Hence Mr Weston's belief that, despite the obvious differences between silent submarines and fast jets, BAe is well placed to run the shipyard. On the wider issue of the future of the defence industry in Europe, Mr Weston is looking to strengthening cross border alliances, and as prime contracting skills are the most important element, he thinks BAe is well placed to take a leading role. In military affairs 'European integration is going on, none of the armed forces can now afford a fully independent set of skills, and they are becoming interdependent. Industry is following that trend.' The process has been slower in Europe than in the US, where mergers and rationalisation have been happening at breakneck pace. There is also a strong suspicion among many observers that when continental Europeans talk about rationalisation, they mean someone else. 'The UK has started to grasp the rationalisation issue. Some of our continental partners have taken a little longer to get there, but there is now a consciousness that change is necessary,' he says. Some moves towards cross-border links are already happening. BAe is negotiating to merge its missile business with Matra of France. It has also looked at a merger of its Royal Ordnance operation with Giat, the French ammunition manufacturer. Mr Weston also points to the way BAe's military division has retrenched in the 1990s as proof that the company has taken the hard decisions. 'In the past five years we have reduced the number of people in our military business from 66,000 to 31,000, at the same time as increasing sales by 10 per cent.' According to Mr Weston, BAe is also doing all the other Good Things which any switched-on manufacturer must do to survive in the 1990s. 'We have had a major drive to find out what our customers want and give it to them. We are now trying to get the most out of our people, and encouraging them to learn from other parts of the business and outside. We want to eliminate the 'not invented here' mentality which can be so damaging.' In the end, however, doesn't GEC's greater financial muscle give it an enormous advantage over BAe? If it does, Mr Weston professes not to be impressed. 'Financial strength is undoubtedly helpful. But the defence business is not ultimately about financial strength and making black boxes. It is about delivering systems to spec and on time.'</p>

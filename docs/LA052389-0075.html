			<p><P> May 23, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> A bomb expert for the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General  Command, a group suspected in the downing of Pan Am Flight 103, was freed 15  days after his arrest in West Germany because he worked for Bonn's intelligence  service, Stern magazine reported. Marwan Khreesat, 44, was among 16 suspected  Palestinian terrorists arrested in raids in October but was released in  November and returned to his native Jordan. "Five weeks later, a radio bomb of  the type that Khreesat had built . . . blew up in the Pan Am jet over Lockerbie  (Scotland)," Stern said. The bombing killed 270 people. The magazine said  Khreesat worked for the West German BND intelligence agency, but an agency  spokesman denied the report.  </P></p>

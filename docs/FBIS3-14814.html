			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [Passage omitted] [Announcer] The State Duma has  decided on a political amnesty. The resolution was published on  25 February, and on the 26th, Aleksandr Rutskoy, Ruslan  Khasbulatov, Albert Makashov, Viktor Anpilov, Ilya Konstantinov  and others emerged from detention. [passage omitted]    Yegor Gaydar, of Russia's Choice, was one of the few who  voted against the political amnesty.    [Begin Gaydar recording] I am absolutely convinced, no  shadow  of doubt, that this decision is a step towards destabilizing the  situation in Russia. I am absolutely convinced that the people  just released from prison will in the coming months take charge  again of forming armed gangs who will hit the Moscow streets. I  am absolutely convinced that their conduct will lead to  bloodshed. I would like Russia to recognize who are its heroes,  and who is leading it along this path. [end recording]    [Announcer] Now the opinion of those whom we approached for  their comments. Mikhail Gorbachev is the ex-president of the  former USSR, the former general secretary of the former CPSU,  and a witness in the SCSE case.    [Begin Gorbachev recording] (?Regarding this decision), I  feel that the State Duma is of course entitled to make it. That  is its prerogative, as in the Constitution. So everything is  clear from the legal standpoint.    Secondly, an amnesty is not an acquittal. It is clemency.  This has to be kept in mind. The main aspect of it is that if  three-fourths of the deputies equate Russia's current situation  to one of grave crisis and conclude on the need to abandon all  that drives us apart, if in this situation such a majority  decision is reached by deputies, then I am ready to agree with  them.    So in the given situation, I would say this: I agree with  the decision as understood in my first point. Recriminations  must not be allowed onto the scene. This is a signal, the  alarm, that we have to abandon secondary considerations. Given  that, I am in favor of the State Duma's decision. But if it is a  move back to the previous strife, recriminations and tension in  the country, then I condemn those who want to use the State Duma  in this way to provoke civil conflict.

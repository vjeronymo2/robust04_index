			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a communique issued on 9 January, the government  announced that it had met the demands of the Federation of  Chadian Trade Unions [USC]. The government also called for the  resumption of work in the public sector. However, for the USC,  these demands have not been met. Its secretary general, Jibril  Hassan Hamdallah, explains the situation to Nourem Souleymane  Nourel:    [Begin recording] [Hamdallah] This government statement is  not exact. Since 11 December, when we launched the strike order,  until now, few civil servants have been paid their two months'  salaries. The majority have not been paid. This concerns  workers in Ndjamena. Regarding the interior, no payments have  been made yet. From telegrams coming from Bongor, Moungare,  Maho, Sar, Moundou, and everywhere, I am told that they have not  been paid a single month's salary. Negotiations with the  government began on 17 December. On 21 December when we held  the last meeting, the government affirmed that it had paid two  months' salaries to all civil servants until the end of the  first week of January 1994. Today is 11 January and the  situation is what I have just described. In the interior  payments have not even begun.    Regarding the negotiations, they have been interrupted since  31 December -- as I have been saying -- and they have not yet  resumed because the payment of two months' salary arrears in  Ndjamena and three months' salary arrears in the interior is the  condition for the continuation of the negotiations. But until  now, this condition has not been met. We are waiting for the  government to fulfill its promise and also see to it that civil  servants in the interior are paid a month's additional salaries.  We will be ready for negotiations at any time, but for now, no  one has contacted us and so the negotiations are at a standstill.    [Nourel] What solutions do you envisage?    [Hamdallah] An order must be given to pay workers, for  example. In certain prefectures, the funds are available but the  treasurers say they have not been instructed to pay; we are not  sure why this is the case. There are funds in the departments.  The prime minister himself informed us that there was 60  million CFA francs in Sar and 60 million CFA francsin Moundou.  But no payments have been made since the prime minister said  this. We do not know why civil servants are not being paid.  [end recording]</p>

			<p><P> June 23, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAKER'S MESSAGE FOR SHAMIR'S NEW GOVERNMENT  </P> <P> I surely agree with your June 13 editorial about the obdurate character of the  new Israeli government and Shamir's unfortunate choices for his cabinet. The  uncompromising fundamentalist extremists have put a halt to the peace process.  </P> <P> But I disagree that Shamir was "forced" to turn to these extremists for  support. No, he did it to perpetuate his power. Elections were an option.  </P> <P> More to the point are the words of Israel's prize-winning novelist, Yizhar  Smilansky: "Why do we abandon the field to all sorts of obstinate little  politicians who don't care about blood or death or the corruption of the soul  -- who have endless patience for death? Hundreds have died and countless more  will die; what matters to them is that they hold the winning political card."  </P> <P> ELIZABETH NAUSS  </P> <P> North Hollywood  </P></p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Letter: No simple regulatory answer for BBC Sir, The picture of the BBC by Robert Baldwin and Martin Cave (Personal View, July 30) is a painting done by numbers. It misses the significance of our annual review, which reflects a clear separation of powers (currently being carried out) between the governors who, as trustees of the public interest, authorise the BBC's strategy and aims, and the management, which is responsible for their execution. And it does not recognise that the performance indicators being put in place are more comprehensive and sophisticated than mere audience measurement. Instead it takes the view that we can top and tail a utility regulator and add the word 'broadcasting' to the title. But there is more to public service broadcasting than regulator and client, consumer and supplier. There is more to the BBC than just broadcasting; it is a patron of the arts, a cultural entertainer. There is more to trusteeship than regulation. BBC governors are there to protect not the interests of a particular group of shareholders but those of the public as a whole. They and the management have a common interest in providing the range of services that will meet that trust. It is hard to see how some three-tiered system could secure even the minimum necessary for compliance - still less to safeguard the BBC's independence (admired around the world if not always at home) as the governors have done for almost 70 years. Robert Phillis, deputy director-general, BBC, Broadcasting House, London W1A 1AA</p>

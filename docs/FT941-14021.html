			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Caterpillar wins derecognition vote White-collar staff at Caterpillar (UK) have agreed by a large majority to end collective bargaining and accept the derecognition of their unions in return for a package of inducements including lump sum payments of Pounds 500. The vote was 103 in support of the offer with 45 against. Last week supervisors and senior technicians at the company's digging-machinery plant outside Leicester voted for union derecognition. The company - the world's biggest manufacturer of construction equipment - said staff had 'expressed their preference for working directly with the management'. The unions involved were the MSF technical union and the Apex white-collar section of the GMB general union. The company added that this was 'part of an on-going strategy to expand employee involvement'. It refused to say whether it would extend its offer to manual workers.</p>

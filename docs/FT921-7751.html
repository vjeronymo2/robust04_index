			<p>920220 FT  20 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Southdown BS incurs Pounds 9.8m loss Southdown Building Society incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.8m in 1991, after bad debt provisions of Pounds 14.1m. The loss was the fourth to be announced by a society in 1991. In November Southdown agreed to merge with Leeds Permanent after it was evident it was heading for a loss. Southdown said that about half the provisions were made against residential mortgage lending and the rest against losses on building finance and commercial lending. At the end of 1991, the society had assets of Pounds 746.3m.</p>

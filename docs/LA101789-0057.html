			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PROSECUTOR ENDS PHASE OF MCMARTIN ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> Telling an attentive jury in Los Angeles Superior Court that the totality of  evidence "draws the ring around Ray Buckey and Peggy McMartin Buckey closer and  tighter, to the extent that you should find them guilty," Deputy Dist. Atty.  Roger Gunson on Monday wound up the first phase of the prosecution's final  arguments in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial. Gunson spent three days  tying together more than two years of evidence and attempting to demonstrate  how the defense's own witnesses frequently corroborated the prosecution's case.  He cited the testimony of the alleged victims and their parents, medical  findings, a jailhouse informant's account of conversations with defendant Ray  Buckey, and testimony by both Buckey and his attorney, Danny Davis.  </P> <P> He also raised questions about what is contained on a missing half-page snipped  from the diary of nursery school founder Virginia McMartin. The missing entry  was for the date a child who attended the Manhattan Beach school was allegedly  molested. The child's accusations triggered the case.  </P> <P> Defense attorney Dean Gits, who represents Peggy McMartin Buckey, will present  his arguments today, followed by Davis.  </P> <P> Each side has been allotted 6 1/2 days.  </P> <P> Deliberations are expected to begin by the end of this month.  </P></p>

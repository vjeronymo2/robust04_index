			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by staff reporter Su Hung-ju (5685 7703 0320): "Lu </F> Ping Says To Maintain Hong Kong's Prosperity, It Is Most  Important To Preserve Its Economic Value"]    [Text] Shenzhen, 4 Mar (WEN WEI PO)--Lu Ping, director of  the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, today  made a speech at the 34th annual meeting of the Rotary Club of  the Hong Kong and Macao regions; he said that, to maintain Hong  Kong's prosperity and stability, the most important thing to do  is to maintain Hong Kong's economic value, and this is the most  basic point. The Preliminary Work Committee has now been  established, and its purpose is to enable the Hong Kong people  to participate in the preparatory work for the Special  Administration Region [SAR] during the transition period, to lay  a good foundation for the future SAR government and create  conditions for a high degree of autonomy and for Hong Kong  people to run Hong Kong. He pointed out that this duty is very  difficult.    Lu Ping said in his speech that the economic development,  reform, and opening up on the mainland has promoted Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability; conversely, Hong Kong's prosperity and  stability have also supported the economic construction of the  motherland. As 1997 draws closer, these kinds of ties will  become closer; this trend is in accordance with the interests of  both places as well as with the common wish of the people of the  two places.    Lu Ping went on to say that these kinds of relations will be  developed on the premise of "one country, two systems."  Although the two places will be reunited as one family in the  future, Hong Kong will continue to practice capitalism, while  the mainland will keep practicing socialism. On 1 July 1997,  the Hong Kong people will find that Hong Kong remains the same  except that the red five-star flag and the bauhinia [flower that  is the emblem of Hong Kong] flag will flutter outside their  windows; as for civil servants, all of them will go to work as  usual on that day, except for a few major officials who must be  nominated by the chief executive and appointed by the central  people's government.    Lu Ping pointed out that this is not a dream and expressed  his firm belief that each element of this vision will come true  on 1 July 1997. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office's  primary duty is to enable all of this to come true, and it is  also the goal of everyone's struggle.    Lu Ping said that, in order to maintain Hong Kong's  prosperity and stability, the most important thing to do is to  maintain Hong Kong's economic value. Hong Kong brings benefits  to the country with its economic value, not its political value.  He pointed out that a series of policies and principles  formulated by the central government has also proceeded from  this point and added that one of the important factors  contributing to Hong Kong's success is its status as an economic  city -- not as a so-called political city, which it never was.    Lu Ping also said that 99 percent of the Hong Kong  compatriots are patriotic and hope to get along well with the  mainland and do not want to see confrontation. This is the  reason why the Chinese side firmly believes that "one country,  two systems" will surely succeed in Hong Kong, that the Basic  Law will surely be implemented, and that Hong Kong can maintain  its prosperity and stability in 1997.    Lu Ping explained that, in the past when Deng Xiaoping  proposed "one country, two systems" to solve the Hong Kong  question, he wanted to maintain Hong Kong's original appearance  in every area, to enable it to become a bridge linking the  economy of the East to the economy of the West. This is a  superiority for Hong Kong which the other three small dragons do  not have. The Chinese side has no intention of imposing the  mainland's system on Hong Kong; nor does it seek to influence  Hong Kong. That type of behavior would not be consistent with  "one country, two systems."    Lu Ping pointed out that allowing Hong Kong's capitalist  system to remain unchanged, allowing Hong Kong people to run  Hong Kong, and allowing Hong Kong to have a high degree of  autonomy was not an outcome of the Sino-British talks, for it  had been decided long before the Sino-British talks started and  had been written into the Joint Declaration and its annex as a  statement by the Chinese Government. After 1997, the central  government will only be responsible for Hong Kong's foreign  affairs and defense, and other matters will be handled by the  SAR itself.    Lu Ping pointed out that, by establishing the Preliminary  Work Committee at this time, the Chinese side has primarily  sought to embody participation by the Hong Kong people, to  enable the Hong Kong people to take part in the preparatory work  for the SAR, to lay a good foundation for the future SAR  government together and give it a good starting point, and to  create conditions for a high degree of autonomy and for Hong  Kong people to run Hong Kong. By so doing, what the Hong Kong  people will receive on 1 July 1997 will be an SAR which is  economically prosperous, financially overflowing, socially  stable, and all set and orderly in every aspect.    Lu Ping admitted that this is a difficult duty, but he and  his colleagues will view it as a sacred mission entrusted to  them by 1.1 billion people and will contribute their own efforts.</p>

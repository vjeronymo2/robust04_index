			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (6): Principality House may set pace - The property sector LATER THIS summer, just off the main pedestrian shopping area of Queen Street, Principality House, a new 62,500 sq ft office building, will be completed at a cost of around Pounds 12m. The development, undertaken by the Principality Building Society, could well act as the new benchmark for Cardiff office rents. The reason why the property sector is excited about the completion of Principality House is that the 50,000 sq ft to be let (the rest will be occupied by the society) could set a new high for office rents in the city. At present, office rents are stalling at a Pounds 16.40 per square foot high. Rents at Principality House could possibly reach Pounds 18. Traditionally, rents in Cardiff have tended to be lower than in many other regional centres, although prime office rents almost doubled from Pounds 8 per square foot in 1987 to Pounds 15 in 1990. A survey last year, by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, indicated that, while Cardiff was on a par with Newcastle and Manchester, prime office rents in the Welsh capital were Pounds 3.20 per square foot less than in Bristol, often used as a comparison with the city. The property market in Cardiff has held up in the economic downturn. A review by the property advisers Debenham Tewson showed that Cardiff had felt the effects of recession less than cities such as Bristol and Leeds. Mr Rhys James, a director of Debenham Tewson, said that rents in Cardiff had not fallen during the past year. Mr Roger Thomas, regional director of Cooke &amp; Arkwright, another of the city's leading surveyors and estate agents, reports similar findings. Activity in the commercial property sector has slowed over the past year, but companies in the market for property are more selective, with continued demand for good quality new or refurbished accommodation. 'We need to get the picture in perspective. The so-called property recession does not compare with that of 1973-74 and 1983-84,' he said. 'Despite short-term pressure, there are still underlying reasons for optimism about the long-term future in Cardiff.' The commercial property sector is predominantly office and retail space. By the end of 1990, the city had nearly 4.5m sq ft of office space. However, much of it consists of 1950s and 1960s buildings, which will either have to be refurbished or pulled down in order to meet tenants' rising expectations. New developments since the late 1980s have provided opportunities for pioneering projects. 'Design is an important element of what contractors now want, and there is a strong architectural tradition here,' commented Mr Terry Hoggett, of architects Hogget Lock-Necrews, the firm which designed Principality House. Cardiff's property market falls into three distinct areas: the city centre; the M4 corridor with business parks at St MelIons and Llanishen on the outskirts of the city, and several retail projects located at Culverhouse Cross; and the Bay area. Rents in the centre and on the M4 corridor area are roughly the same, but it is the Bay which could have the most impact in the long term. The development is to be phased over a 15-year period, but the office space allocation in the Bay area is more than 5m sq ft, rather more than Cardiff's stock of office space at present. However, in the city as a whole there is still a shortage of large office units. It is a shortage that worries Mr Graham Moore, the property director of the Welsh Development Agency: 'If we get a large company relocating and it needs 60,000 sq ft immediately, we have got a problem. There is a window of opportunity in Cardiff, and developers need to be encouraged to build speculative projects,' he said. The WDA is not actively involved in the Cardiff office market. It is concerned about the lack of institutional investment in speculative development in the city, and the discrepancy in rents between the city and other regional centres. The Knight Frank &amp; Rutley report found that institutions were reluctant to invest in Welsh office space. 'The small investment market in south-east Wales has not yet reached the critical mass for a flourishing market to develop,' it stated. Mr David Swallow joined the WDA last year in a newly-created post of private funding director. The agency hopes that its Welsh Property Venture Initiative, which seeks generally to attract institutional money into Welsh property, will have a spin-off effect on the Cardiff commercial sector. Mr Swallow has found no such reluctance among the institutions to invest heavily in the retail sector. Demand for retail property has been hit by the general cutback in high street spending, although with a catchment area of 1.3m shoppers several new developments have come on stream. GRE Properties, which has opened a specialist centre called the Capitol site, in the city centre, has introduced a number of turnover rental deals, a new feature of retail rents in South Wales. Industrial property in Cardiff often tends to be overshadowed in what is essentially a service city. The market was affected by the loss of land to B1 use, and the relocation of business from parts of Cardiff Bay as that area was prepared for redevelopment. Consequently it has been difficult to identify trends. Rents have been sustainable with modern units of under 3,000 sq ft reaching between Pounds 5 and Pounds 5.50 per square foot. Medium-sized modern units are fetching rents in excess of Pounds 4 per square foot, and larger units around Pounds 3. Interest in the sites and units being developed in Cardiff Bay is continuing to grow, although there are unlikely to be any mass building programmes in the city in the immediate future.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Unsigned article: "The World's Big Problem"] </F>   [Text] The illegal import transaction carried out by  Produquimica is not an isolated case. Between 1986 and 1993,  Greenpeace documented 120 export proposals for toxic waste from  developed countries going to the Third World. Over the past five  years, the industrialized nations shipped more than 100 million  t of toxic waste to the underdeveloped countries. More than  90%  of the waste sales projects going to the Third World claimed  that there was a possibility of recycling.    Companies that do business with toxic waste cargo are using  all kinds of expedients to get rid of those cargos. In 1992, the  German Schmidt-Cretan Company exported 463 t of insecticides to  Albania labeled as "humanitarian aid." Environmental legislation  classifies this product as being extremely dangerous and its use  is prohibited on German territory. In March of that same year,  one of the two Albanian Government companies that coordinated  the receipt of the donations asked that cargo shipment be  interrupted, charging that this "humanitarian aid" had not been  correctly packaged and that the deadline for its use had already  run out.    After the request, the German company sent another three  loads of obsolete insecticides to Albania. After they had been  returned to Germany and once again shipped to Albanian  territory, the toxic products are today stored in a railroad  station in Bajza.    Another two German companies, ATG and Rimex, likewise  participated in this new form of "philanthropy," shipping waste  to the countries of Eastern Europe. ATG signed a presumed  contract with the Government of Estonia for the export of  between 500,000 and 800,000 t of used tires per year. According  to company managers, the tires could be incinerated for the  production of energy to be used in home heating. Following  bitter discussions in the Estonian Parliament, 5,000 t were  burned in the open air in the port of Tallin without producing a  single watt of energy and emitting a large quantity of particles  into the atmosphere.    Rimex tried to send 78 barrels of burned engine oil to  Ukraina as donation of "paraffin to the Central Committee of the  Red Cross for investigations on the biosphere." This "research"  could not be carried out because the shipment was confiscated by  Polish customs officers who did not allow the cargo to be  transported through Polish territory. Cases involving German  companies gave Germany the title of world champion in the export  of toxic waste, according to Greenpeace.    Other big exporters are Switzerland and the United States.  Stoller Chemical of the United States in 1992 sold more than  3,000 t of fertilizer contaminated with ash produced by the  smelting of copper to the Government of Bangladesh. The  transaction was financed by the Asian Development Bank. Analyses  done in the State of South Carolina, where the company is based,  proved that the fertilizer contained a large quantity of lead  that causes neurological problems in children as well as cadmium  that causes damage to the kidneys and is also cancer-causing.    In June 1992, the Government of the United States sued  Stoller and another three companies involved in this case. In  spite of that, the environmental authorities of the United  States allowed the toxic cargo to remain in one of the world's  poorest countries (per capita Gross Domestic Product $220,  according to UNICEF). Almost one year after the toxic substances  were found in the cargo, the fertilizer continued to be sold  freely in Bangladesh. Unofficial reports indicate that the  government of that country stopped the distribution of toxic  fertilizer after having sold 33% of the entire shipment.    Switzerland annually exports 126,000 t of toxic waste,  according to the Environmental Ministry of that country; this  volume is greater than the volume of cheese exports (60,000 t)  and chocolate exports (67,000 t).    The Swiss companies treat the developed and underdeveloped  countries in a rather egalitarian fashion, shipping toxic cargo  both to Germany, France, and Belgium as well as to Slovenia and  Somalia.    This European country constantly disregards the Basel  Convention which was signed on its territory and which calls for  the sale of toxic cargo only between countries that signed the  treaty or with others, provided there are bilateral agreements  between the importing country and the exporting country. The  Convention's host country has zeroed in on Germany as one of its  preferred targets for the shipment of toxic waste; Germany did  not sign the treaty nor does it have an agreement in force with  Switzerland.    The second meeting of the Basel Convention will be held in  March in Geneva. Greenpeace will submit a proposal to the  meeting calling for the complete prohibition of exports of toxic  and hazardous waste from the industrialized countries to those  of the Third World. According to Marijane Lisboa, Latin American  coordinator for the Greenpeace Campaign against Trafficking in  Toxic Waste, the Basel Convention as it stands now "only  legalizes the immoral commerce in toxic waste."</p>

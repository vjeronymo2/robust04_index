			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Survey of Using Computers in Business (18): Teleworking opens up new horizons A CAREER with computers no longer means working in an office for eight hours a day. Many programmers already work remotely. And salespeople, too, are now home-working and travelling with laptops and modems. On this page, CLAIRE GOODING looks at some of the arguments in favour of teleworking, and introduces some case-studies. This topic was also examined in detail in the recent issue of the FT's 'Software At Work' survey, published on Wednesday September 8. The next issue of 'Software at Work' on November 29 will look at: office automation; geographical information systems; object orientated technology. For more information, see details on page four of this survey.</p>

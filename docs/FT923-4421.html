			<p>920907 FT  07 SEP 92 / Observer: All clear? Would Brian Quinn, the Bank of England's head of banking supervision, really give a speech on 'Banking supervision after Bingham' if he had anything to fear from the conclusions of Lord Justice Bingham's overdue report into the BCCI collapse? The cautious Quinn is not known for sticking his neck out, hence his decision to give a talk on the subject to a group of 25 Bank of England high-flyers last week, suggests that he and his department will still be in a job after Bingham's report is published.</p>

			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / Survey of UK Property (3): London leads the revival - The upturn in demand, most visible in the capital, has been led by overseas investors, particularly from Germany / The office market THE OFFICE market, long the sickest sector of the commercial property industry, is beginning to stage a recovery. The value of well-let properties has increased, as a marked decline in investment yields - the ratio of income to capital - has compensated for a continuing decline in rental values. High-yielding office buildings, with financially secure tenants and long leases, have become increasingly attractive to investors, as bond yields have declined. This upturn in investment demand has been noted throughout the UK, as investors' traditional preoccupation with location has taken second place to their concern about security of income. The turnaround in sentiment has been particularly apparent in the London office market, which was long spurned by investors who were dismayed by the large oversupply of buildings and the weakness of tenant demand. This upturn in demand, which was led by overseas investors, particularly from Germany, has been particularly apparent in the market for highly over-rented offices - where there is little prospect of any rental increases in the foreseeable future, because the rent payable exceeds the market rate. The attraction of the building's high, secure yield outweighed the poor prospects for rental growth. The state of the office rental market shows less promise than the investment market. The twin problems faced by the industry - oversupply of buildings and weak demand - are still forcing rents downwards in most regions. There are sharp variations between different parts of the country. The over-supply of offices is most pronounced in London which, as a result, has suffered the sharpest decline in rents. A recent report by Chesterton, chartered surveyors, found that nearly 18m sq ft of new or refurbished space was available to let in city centres around the country, of which 15m sq ft is in London. Outside London, office rents have tended to fall more as a result of weak demand than sharp over-supply. Vacancy rates have remained much lower than in London, because there was much less speculative development. Chesterton, chartered surveyors, estimated that the London vacancy rate was about 18 per cent, compared with a rate of about 12 per cent in regional centres. As a result, rents have not tumbled to the same extent as in London. Whereas in London's west end rents have fallen by 62 per cent from their peak, in the north-west rents have fallen by 9 per cent, while in the East Midlands they have fallen by 14 per cent. These large variations in demand and supply between different UK cities result in marked differences in the prognosis for rental recovery in different parts of the country. On average, growth is expected to return in 1995 or 1996. However, cities with a relatively tight supply of office buildings, such as Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow and Edinburgh, may see rental growth before 1995. The factors governing rental prospects are complex. First, much depends on how fast tenants respond to an improvement in the economy. Many will delay expanding into new offices, because they already have plenty of unused space in their existing offices. Second, the difficulties of reletting old offices mean that many tenants who wish to move to new premises are unable to dispose of their old leases. Third, the over-supply figures may prove to be exaggerated, because much of the empty office stock is virtually unusable. There is already a two-tier market: the new or good-quality second-hand accommodation attracts far more lettings than the poorer-quality space, where availability rates remain stubbornly high. The difficulties in securing lettings of low-grade offices may lead to these premises being taken off the market. Office owners have an incentive to decommission buildings, because it removes their liability to pay rates. This possibility that older offices will never find a tenant raises yet another uncertainty. At what stage will property owners be prepared to resume development? In general, market rental values are too low to justify development on a speculative basis. Moreover, banks are unwilling to lend on a speculative basis, so the only developers capable of undertaking projects are those with their own resources or institutional backing. However, there has been an upturn in the number of schemes winning finance, because they have secured pre-lets. Tenants with leases that expire in several years time would often prefer to take advantage of low land and construction costs by agreeing to lease a building now than wait until their leases expire when the supply of suitable offices may have greatly diminished. Even the speculative developer is making a come-back. Pearl Assurance and Arcona Properties are developing a 30,000 sq ft speculative office scheme in London's West end. Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier at the helm of Lonhro, and Lord Palumbo, chairman of the Arts Council, have announced proposals for developing Number One Poultry, on a speculative basis. Great Portland Estates recently announces its intention to start development on a 80,000 sq ft building in Great Portland Street. These first stirrings in the development market do not yet signal a full-blown revival in the property market. Nonetheless, they are a sign that the first building blocks for recovery are firmly in place.</p>

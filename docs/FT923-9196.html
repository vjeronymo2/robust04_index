			<p>920806 FT  06 AUG 92 / Brazil ponders radical reforms: A parliamentary system is on the cards ONE of the most popular plays showing in Rio de Janeiro is a reconstruction of the events of August 1954, when President Getulio Vargas was driven to suicide by a wave of financial scandals surrounding his government and family. Not surprisingly, the play provokes parallels with President Fernando Collor's attempts to hold on to power amid a torrent of corruption allegations. The current crisis and Brazil's history of a succession of civilian presidents failing to finish their mandates, is prompting increasing debate over the viability of the presidential system. During the last few weeks, as Mr Collor's position has become increasingly untenable, the campaign for a parliament-based system has been gaining weight and political leaders from all sides have been meeting to discuss a sweeping reform of the political system and electoral laws. Mr Ibsen Pinheiro, president of the chamber of deputies, believes reform is more pressing than the parlous economic situation. Under Brazil's present system candidates are elected individually rather than by party on a state-wide basis in a confusing 'open-list' version of proportional representation. This has resulted in weak parties divided into factions, and a lack of accountability in politicians. Representation is skewed in favour of smaller rural states while, in reaction to 21 years of military regimes up to 1985, the rules governing party formation are completely liberal. Any group of 110 people can form a party and gain access to free television time and this, combined with a lack of ideology and no rules governing party discipline, has led to the constant creation of new parties. The 1990 congressional elections were contested by 30 parties and no party won anything approaching a majority. The president's party secured only 23 out of 503 seats, making governing almost impossible. Under the current system responsibility lies with the president and authority with Congress, which must approve his actions. Thus Mr Collor has had to build new coalitions for every project. Mr Carlos Garcia, the minister for special projects, says: 'No president can last five years in this situation - it's crisis after crisis'. Congressional leaders are now hard at work on new laws changing the electoral system from statewide proportional representation to district voting similar to that used in Germany, introducing rules on party loyalty and insisting on a minimum percentage of votes for a party to be represented in Congress. They also hope to legislate on campaign contributions from businessmen. Many of the allegations surrounding Mr Collor have resulted from the presidential campaign costs of as much as Dollars 100m (Pounds 52.3m), yet contributions over a few hundred dollars are forbidden. Politicians say this October's muncipal elections will be the cheapest ever, because in the current climate of suspicion no one dares accept or make major contributions. The estimated cost of being elected mayor of a medium-sized city has dropped from Dollars 15m-Dollars 20m to Dollars 100,000. Brazil is due to hold a nationwide referendum on the form of political system next April. Voters will have to choose both between a return to constitutional monarchy or maintaining the republic, and between a presidential or a parliamentary system. The latest polls show a majority in favour of the latter. Mr Ulysses Guimaraes, perhaps Brazil's most respected politician, now in his 44th year in Congress, says: '103 years of presidentialism in Brazil has been a disaster right from the first president, Marshal Deodoro Fonseca, who was forced out before finishing his mandate. It's time we accepted that the system doesn't work.'</p>

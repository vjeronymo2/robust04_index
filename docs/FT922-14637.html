			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Latin American Finance and Investment (2): World appetite has been strong - Investors are attracted by strong growth prospects / New Funding HARDLY a month passes without an international equity issue from a Latin American company, and the steady flow looks set to continue as countries such as Brazil and Mexico proceed with the privatisation of state-owned companies and initial public offerings in family-controlled groups. So far, the bulk of the issuance has come from Mexico. Last year, Mexican companies issued Dollars 2.369bn in equities, consisting of Dollars 2.016bn in IPOs and Dollars 353m in primary issues, according to figures produced by International Financing Review. (By comparison, international equity issues worldwide last year amounted to Dollars 18.153bn). By far the largest Mexican equity issue was Telmex, the telephone company, which raised about Dollars 2.2bn. The appetite for Latin American international equity offerings has been strong so far. Investors in the US - and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia - are attracted by the strong growth prospects for the Latin American economies now that many of these countries have become more democratic and have started to introduce important reforms aimed at opening up the economies. 'The ability of Latin America to deliver good economic growth in a period when OECD countries are experiencing a slowdown has been confirmed. We believe the 1990s will be a decade when Latin America will make up for the wasted years of the 1980s and this view has been reinforced by the strong stock market growth and increasing investor interest in the major markets of the region,' says Mr Michael Hart, chairman of Latin American Investment Trust, in the company's recent preliminary statement. Investors point out that it has become far easier and much more attractive to invest in the region as restrictions have been lifted and the individual markets have become more liquid and better researched. However, investors would still like to see further improvements when it comes to financial information, the liquidity of some of the stock markets, dividend yield, and insider trading regulations. Mr Lincoln Rathnam, managing director of the Latin American group at Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, points out that many of the companies in Mexico - such as Telmex, the telephone company, and Cemex, the former state-owned cement company - are well researched: 'Mexico is still the best-researched of the (Latin American) countries even though the information available is rather limited.' Another manager adds that to all intents and purposes 'Mexico is not an emerging market, it has emerged and is considered by many investors as being within the North American bloc'. While fund managers concede that the quality of the financial information they receive has improved considerably over the past couple of years, some complain that companies can be rather lax about providing figures on request. There is also a tendency to present a quarter-by-quarter comparison of results, rather than year-on-year figures which iron out any seasonal variations, says one fund manager. Improving liquidity in the underlying markets has also helped to encourage overseas investors to buy Latin American equities, either through an international equity offering or once the company has been listed. 'The markets themselves are quite illiquid by our standards but this aspect has been improving in the last couple of years,' says Mr Rathnam. He points out that average daily turnover in Buenos Aires has grown from Dollars 2m-Dollars 3m in 1990 to about Dollars 45m this year. Meanwhile, turnover in Mexico has risen from Dollars 25m a day in 1990 to Dollars 200m a day in 1992. But whereas markets such as Brazil and Mexico can be sold at short notice, 'in general it is quite difficult to sell quickly,' Mr Rathnam says, and that can be a problem, especially in a falling market. Dividends from Latin American companies tend to be on the low side, with the exception of Chilean companies. Some investors point out that overseas demand would probably increase if companies were to offer higher dividend yields. 'Small dividends can be a problem for a (Latin American) fund, though on the whole the bigger investors are looking for capital gains rather than income,' says one fund manager. Fund managers report that some companies are starting to offer more generous dividends to appeal to foreign investors. For example, Telmex put up its dividend from 25 pesos to 75 pesos recently - although as one analyst pointed out this still represents a dividend yield of less than 1 per cent. The two Argentine telecom companies which were recently privatised - Telecom Argentina and Telefonica de Argentina - have also attracted some attention from international fund managers for paying above-average dividends, and investors hope that more companies will follow this example. With such improvements under way, the emerging markets of Latin America are likely to remain popular with international investors over the next year, ensuring the success of future international equity issues.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                 STOCK MARKET TAXES/COMMISSIONS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Characteristics    Argentina   Brazil     Chile      Mexico   Venezuela  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Capital gains tax    none        none     35% rate    none  30% tax rate  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Dividends tax      22% for     15% on     35% rate  No tax if    non                      cash    remittances            paid from                    dividends   abroad.              previously                              Otherwise 8%           taxed profits.

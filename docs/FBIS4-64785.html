			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Jagoda: Rays of Hope Visible in </F> Western Germany"]    [Text] In April, the number of unemployed persons in  Germany fell by 93,800 to 3.807 million because of seasonal  trends. Commenting on this in Nuremberg, Bernhard Jagoda, head  of the Federal Employment Agency, said that the labor markets in  eastern and western Germany "appear somewhat friendlier than in  previous months."    The effects of the recession are continuing in the old  laender, but they are weaker than they used to be. "Rays of  hope are visible," said Jagoda. In western Germany in April,  there were 2.59 million unemployed, 49,700 less than in March,  and 393,600 less than in March 1993.    In April, some 175,300 job vacancies were reported to labor  exchanges in western Germany, 2 percent more than in April 1993.  "Even if the observers only expect the fall in employment to  cease at the end of the year, we already detect positive signs  judging from the job vacancies that are being reported," said  Jagoda.    The demand for jobs in the processing industries has  improved  in particular. This branch of industry was hit relatively hard  and early by the recession. In April, 35,400 jobs in this  industry were reported to labor exchanges, 15 percent more than  in the previous April. The best prospects are to be seen in the  electrical, machine construction, and chemical industries.    Temporary employment has sunk remarkably quickly in western  Germany. One-month jobs fell by almost 100,000, and one-year  jobs by 675,000, reaching 367,800. "Most enterprises have  reverted to full-time work," Jagoda observed. This confirms the  forecasts of research institutes, which said at the beginning of  the year that following an economic improvement, working hours  would be extended first of all, but manpower levels would only  be increased after the economic upturn had gathered momentum.    In the new laender, the number of unemployed in April fell  by  44,100, to reach 1,216,000. The number of temporary employees  in eastern Germany fell by 10,900, reaching 124,900, half the  level of April 1993. Particularly noticeable is the fall in  employment in the construction and machine industries.    Concerning the development of the labor market for women,  Jagoda opposed any discrimination of the feminine sex. Women do  not have to be considered a general problem of the labor market,  he said. After all, in the old laender, there is hardly any  difference between male and female unemployment figures. At the  end of April, 9.3 percent of women of working age were  unemployed, and 9.4 percent of men. The labor administration  says this is because female employment has decreased only  slightly in recent times, and female unemployment has increased  at a below-average amount.    But Jagoda had "few good things to say" about the female  labor market in the new laender. There, women continue to be  more affected by unemployment than men, and constitute almost  two-thirds of all unemployed people.    Altogether, judging from 1994 figures so far, Jagoda expects  a better future economic development than expected. The labor  market need not revise its figures, he said. The labor market  had reckoned previously that the number of unemployed persons  would increase by between 300,000 and 400,000 during the course  of the year.</p>

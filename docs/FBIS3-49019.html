			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Statement by Sefik Teslic, president of the Zepce War </F> Presidency, to Sarajevo Radio; place and date not given --  recorded]    [Text] The town of Zepce and parts of the commune are  temporarily occupied by the Croatian Defense Council [HVO] and  its most extremist segment, the ustashas. However, there is a  large part of the territory that is free. We have consolidated  there, politically and militarily, as a precondition for the  liberation of the entire territory and linking with the  surrounding territories of Tesanj, Maglaj, and Teslic communes.    The true faces of all who were, until yesterday, our alleged  friends and neighbors have been clearly shown by the example of  Zepce. The ustashas and the chetniks have jointly done what  they have done. However, I am truly puzzled that the Serbs have  forgotten what the ustashas have done [words indistinct] they  have committed a massacre upon the innocent civilians on that  occasion, but are now friends with a common objective of  destroying everything Muslim.    The trust in neighbors, peace, and respect for oneself and  one's property has backfired on Zepce in the most brutal  possible way. Bearing in mind the betrayal and humiliating  surrender of a great part of the command and soldiers, a clear  message remains to all Zepce residents regardless of where they  are: To those who have not done so yet, join a brigade as  quickly as possible; to those who can help in any other possible  way, do this immediately to help the brigade that has been  formed very hastily with the help of other brigades which are  situated on the free territory of Zepce commune and which are  taking an active part in the combat.    We shall return to Zepce. We do not doubt this. We will  punish all criminals, ustashas, and Mate Boban. To those who  did not bloody their hands and commit crimes, we will guarantee  freedom and life together. We know who the criminals are and  what they have done, and they have done many things not  befitting civilized people.</p>

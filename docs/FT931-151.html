			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / Isosceles's banks facelosses of Pounds 500m BANK LENDERS to Isosceles face losses of up to Pounds 500m on their Pounds 1.09bn of loans to the owner of the UK Gateway supermarket chain which is restructuring its debt. Bankers said yesterday they were close to reaching agreement with other Isosceles investors on the restructuring, which is likely to involve the conversion of its bank loans and mezzanine, or subordinated, debt into five new forms of debt and equity. Slightly more than Pounds 500m of the bank loans is expected to be converted into new debt held by Isosceles's Gateway subsidiary. The banks believe Gateway can service this debt, and that they should not have to make loss provisions against it. However, after the restructuring, the banks will still hold around Pounds 140m of debt provided to the parent, Isosceles, plus some deep discounted bonds, some preference shares and possibly some ordinary shares. The value of the Isosceles debt is difficult to assess, bankers said. Most are hopeful that the company will be able to make payments on it, but cannot be certain. 'Some banks may make provisions to cover possible write-offs on everything except the Gateway debt,' said a banker. Those provisions could be as high as 50p for every Pounds 1 lent, he said. Of the 38 Isosceles banks, Bank of Nova Scotia, the Canadian bank, has lent around Pounds 80m. Midland Bank of the UK, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Scotland are all thought to have provided around Pounds 70m each. Chemical Bank of the US lent less than Pounds 60m. Bank of Scotland, which has to date avoided most of the high profile UK corporate bankruptcies, is expected to make Isosceles provisions of at least Pounds 30m in its next financial results, due in May. In the negotiations, General Electric Capital Corporation of the US has been representing providers of Pounds 375m of mezzanine debt, which face huge losses. They are likely to get none of the new Gateway debt, but around Pounds 60m of the Isosceles debt, plus deep discounted bonds, preference shares and ordinary shares. GE Capital and Standard Chartered, the banking group, each hold more than Pounds 100m of the mezzanine debt.</p>

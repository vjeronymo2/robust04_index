			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: BP Norway's crude output 'to plunge' BRITISH PETROLEUM Norway will see its crude oil production plunge by 36 per cent over the next three years, according to the second annual Norwegian oil and gas league table soon to be published by Edinburgh-based analyst Wood Mackenzie. Total Norwegian crude oil production is forecast to increase by 6 per cent over the same period. WoodMac's league table, which ranks the top 20 oil companies in Norway by the total value of their oil and gas assets, including pipelines, also reveals that BP Norway has dropped out of the top ten - its NKr6.553bn (Pounds 625m) valuation having been overtaken by Conoco Norway, valued at NKr6.743bn. Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, remains the undisputed leader with a valuation at NKr49.204bn, more than twice that of second-placed Norsk Hydro. According to WoodMac, Statoil's most valuable assets include the Statfjord, Gullfaks, Oseberg, Snorre and Sleipner East fields. Also included are the Statpipe and Ulapipe pipelines, which between them contribute some NKr9bn, or about 18 per cent, to Statoil's asset base value. Of the foreign oil companies operating in Norway, Elf Petroleum retains the highest ranking at number three overall, valued at NKr13.987bn, followed closely by Esso Norge, valued at NKr13.321bn and Phillips Petroleum Norway, at NKr11.848bn. Saga Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent, retained sixth place, valued at NKr9.960bn, thanks to last year's acquisitions of DNO Olje and Norminal, two tiny domestic independents.</p>

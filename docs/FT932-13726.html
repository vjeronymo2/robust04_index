			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cross-party unity thwarts referendum move LABOUR AND the government joined forces in the early hours of this morning to reject Euro-sceptic demands for a referendum on the Maastricht treaty, as the bill's marathon five-month committee stage entered its final lap. A proposal to delay the bill's entry into force until 1996 unless a referendum was agreed to in the meantime was defeated by 363 votes to 124. The referendum debate, which could act as a curtain-raiser for a similar debate in the Lords in June or July, came after MPs had given a ringing endorsement to deputy speaker Mr Michael Morris's handling of their tortuous deliberations. Starting his speech just before midnight, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, said that allowing a decision on Maastricht to be made not by parliament but through a referendum would be 'a shirking of the responsibilities we were given only a year ago.' The Commons was 'doing its job' by preparing for the final decision that 'it  -it - will take at third reading.' It was 'certainly not for fear of a negative result' that the government opposed holding a referendum on the issue, he said. In a relaxed and buoyant address, Mr Hurd allowed frequent interventions from Tory Euro-sceptics, rebutting one suggestion the government had hurried the bill along by saying it was not the general view that it had been 'hustled through.' It was 'odd' that those who put the most emphasis on the sovereignty of parliament felt it needed to be 'buttressed' by a referendum, he said. For Labour, Mr Jack Cunningham, foreign affairs spokesman, said reliance on referendums was 'the biggest single threat to the authority of parliament and the undermining of parliamentary democracy.' Liberal Democrat president Mr Charles Kennedy said the issue deserved a free vote among MPs - and confessed that his own party was split. He said that, for example, he backed a referendum while Liberal Democrat European affairs spokesman Sir Russell Johnston opposed one - even though both wanted to see Maastricht ratified. Earlier, the endorsement of Mr Morris came when a motion criticising him for not allowing a vote on a potentially crucial Labour amendment was heavily rejected by 450 votes to 81 after a three-hour debate. Little extra light was shed on whether MPs would have the chance to vote on the amendment - known as amendment 27 - which would remove the protocol containing Britain's opt-out from Maastricht's social chapter. But it was confirmed that the vote could not come in what remained of the committee stage. Labour is pressing for a vote at the report stage, which is set to follow the current line-by-line consideration and will be presided over by Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker. But Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday argued it would be difficult for Miss Boothroyd to allow this course of action if another social chapter-related Labour amendment - known as new clause 74 - which the government has accepted, was duly passed during the committee stage. MPs are likely to debate this new clause today in what will be the bill's 23rd - and possibly last - day in committee.</p>

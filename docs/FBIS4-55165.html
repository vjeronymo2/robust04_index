			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus: "Central European </F> Initiatives"]    [Text] It was not until after I returned from South America  that I was able to read methodically the newspaper commentaries  on the meeting involving the presidents in Litomysl and on my  alleged nonparticipation in their talks.    I would just like to say, on the margin, that I was not  invited to any "talks" in Litomysl. Incidentally, this would  have been inappropriate at an exclusive meeting of presidents. I  was invited to a concert (and one cannot talk there) and to a  dinner (and, despite the many interpreters, one can only talk to  one's immediate neighbor). Given the sudden emergence of a whole  series of problems just before my visit to South America (the  talks on the jurisdiction of the regions were held in my office  late on the Friday [15 April] evening at the time of the  Litomysl dinner), I gave intentional priority to an apology and  chose to deal with the matters that, at the given moment,  especially after the morning meeting of the Coalition Four, I  considered to be the most pressing. It seems pointless to me to  continue speculating about this.    However, the very idea of Central Europeanness, which was  declined in all its cases in the media after the meeting, is  something else.    I would like to publicly acknowledge my Central  Europeanness.  Indeed, I feel that neighboring countries are closer to us than  the countries that are not our immediate neighbors, that we are  linked to them by thousands of visible and invisible and  conscious and unconscious ties, and -- at the same time -- I am  convinced that the policy of the current Czech Government  corresponds precisely to this. Emphasis on these neighborly  relations is enshrined in its policy statement of July 1992 and  most of our foreign visits are made to these countries.  Everyone who wants to know knows that, five days before  Litomysl, I held day-long talks (and I emphasize talks and not a  concert!) with Prime Minister Pawlak of Poland, that my previous  foreign policy meeting was with German Social Democratic Party  Chairman Scharping (the hot favorite for the post of German  chancellor), and that the two most recent "prime ministerial"  letters I wrote were to our neighbors -- to Bavarian Prime  Minister Stoiber (about the oil pipeline from Ingolstadt) and to  Saxon Prime Minister Biedenkopf (about Czech involvement in the  only engineering enterprise in Erfurt). I cannot accept,  therefore, criticism of my lack of Central Europeanness.    I even think -- more strongly than some other Czech  politicians -- that there is something in Central Europeanness,  that there is really something specific about this region, that  it has a common historical experience, a common cultural  heritage, and -- last but not least -- some common contemporary  problems, and that it would perhaps be possible to retrieve  something positive from all of this. The somewhat strange idea  of the Pentagonal (for example, Italy with its Sicily and  Sardinia is hardly part of Central Europe) did not play this  role and, similarly, I am not sure whether the institution  called the Central European Initiative has a real chance of  playing any historic role.    Despite this, I would be willing to try something. When I  was preparing to go to Budapest last July to attend a meeting  involving the prime ministers of the 10 Central European  Initiative countries, true to my beliefs, I said that it does  not make sense to rattle off a couple of courteous phrases  prepared in advance and then calmly return home again.  Therefore, I prepared phrases by which I asked: Do we want to  take our Central Europeanness seriously or not? Do we want to  derive something from it on an institutional level? Do we want  to assert our "Central European" attitudes -- if they exist --  on other forums? If the answer is yes, I am willing to go into  this, if the answer is no, then let us stick to the cordial  dinners and concerts. Our foreign minister talked me out of  saying this by arguing that it could be interpreted as a step  oriented against integration with the European Community. I  respected this view and I delivered something like a "polite  nothing." Everyone was satisfied. Even in the lobbies, where I  tried out my Central European ideas with a little exaggeration  and irony in my voice, it was clear that no one was interested  in such a thing.    Let it be so. Then only good neighborly cooperation, which  the Czech Republic is striving for on all forums, the attempt to  obviate possible disagreements and conflicts, the maximum  possible openness of the borders, and freeing and facilitating  as much as possible the flow of people, ideas, cultural values,  goods, money, and capital remain. I have the feeling that, in  this sense, the Czech Republic has a good conscience. We are  negotiating calmly with Slovakia, without dramatic threats,  about recognizing the undisputable Slovak debt that evolved with  the break up of the Federation. We are not the ones  complicating the Customs Union, we are not the ones slowing down  the completion of the process for establishing a free trade zone  with Poland and Hungary, we are not protesting against this or  that project in Austria, we are not sending alarming signals  about the Sudeten Germans, and so on and on.    Nevertheless, we have to talk to each other as much as  possible. In this sense, the meeting in Litomysl certainly  played a positive role.</p>

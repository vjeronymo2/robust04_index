			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Survey of Romania (8): Same team is still in charge - Romanian politics After winning the sympathy of millions around the globe who watched the 1989 Christmas revolution on their television sets, Romanians confounded their new-found western friends by electing former communists to power just five months later. Four years on, the same team, grouped behind President Ion Iliescu, is still in charge, having won general elections in 1990 and 1992 despite its dubious political tactics, notably the use of coalminers to intimidate or assault opponents on several occasions in 1990 and 1991. However, even President Iliescu's most fierce rivals recognise that, under his leadership, Romania has undergone great political and economic changes albeit at a pace slower than many would have wished. 'The team which hijacked the revolution from the young generation has been forced to accept several democratic changes such as a multi-party political system, a free press and the right to hold demonstrations,' says Mr Corneliu Coposu, a 77-year-old former dissident who heads the National Peasants Party, mainstay of the Democratic Convention (DC), the main opposition group. Since narrowly winning the September 1992 elections, President Iliescu's party, now called the Party of Social Democracy of Romania (PSDR), has sought to change its image as a group of unreformed, unrepentant communists by co-opting younger members and espousing market-led reforms. 'The challenge is to combine the experience of the old with the imagination of the young,' says Mr Adrian Nastase, 43, the former foreign minister who became executive president of the PSDR last year. To this end, the party has begun talks with the Democratic Convention and the Democrat Party, the other main opposition group which is led by Mr Petre Roman, Romania's first post-revolution prime minister, and which has become the standard-bearer of International Monetary Fund and World Bank-backed reforms. The talks are aimed at broadening parliamentary support for the PSDR minority government which relies on three small former communist and extreme nationalist parties to reach a slim 53 per cent majority. The hope is that a political pact will make parliament more effective after a year and a half in which internecine battles over often minor issues have held up important reform legislation such as the bankruptcy and securities laws. Few, however, believe the talks will be successful in the near future, despite opinion polls indicating popular disenchantment with the PSDR government. According to Irsop, a local market research organisation, most Romanians perceive the government as lacking direction, moving too slowly on many key reforms and acting to protect its own interests rather than those of the country. Irsop polls indicate that two thirds of the population would like to see the opposition form a government or take part in a coalition with the PSDR. Despite the government's breakthrough this spring with the IMF, the opposition says the ruling party still has no clear reform strategy and remains held together only by allegiance to President Ion Iliescu and by the desire to stay in power. PSDR members, they say, cover too wide a political spectrum to formulate coherent policies. The opposition has conditioned any political pact on the exclusion of the PSDR's extremist allies, the Socialist Labour Party (SLP), the former communist party, which is led by Mr Ilie Verdet, a Ceausescu-era prime minister, and the Greater Romania (Romania Mare) party, a xenophobic, anti-semitic organisation. However, it is not clear the PSDR is prepared to ditch the two groups which in the past year have acted more like satellite parties than separate entities. Both have faithfully supported the PSDR in parliament and taken up second-level posts in the administration. Their intemperate outbursts and slur campaigns against reformers in the government and opposition have drawn little public criticism from the PSDR. The opposition says the real agenda of the PSDR and its allies - drawn from the former communist nomenklatura of state factory bosses, secret police and second-level bureaucrats - is to stall reform while they attempt to maintain their control of state institutions and state property. 'They are no longer fighting for Marxist-Leninist ideals but to protect their interests,' Mr Coposu says, alluding to many recent corruption cases involving members of the PSDR or those close to it. The PSDR has attempted to consolidate its power not just in central government but in state enterprises and at the lower levels of the administration where competent technocrats have been weeded out in favour of the loyal. The party has also been unwilling to devolve power to local government, preferring to rule the country's disparate and ethnically diverse regions from Bucharest. It is only now introducing local tax laws to provide revenues for elected local governments which, in many areas, are controlled by the opposition. The opposition, which includes the party of Romania's 1.7m ethnic Hungarian minority, is pushing for western European-style subsidiarity and a high degree of local autonomy. However, the inclusion in the Democratic Convention of the Hungarian party has been one of the many sources of tension within the Convention. The DC, a loose coalition of anti-communist, intellectual and liberal parties, has failed to use its time in opposition to resolve differences over issues ranging from economic policy to the restoration of the monarchy and the Hungarian minority. The DC's internal divisions have been exploited by the ruling alliance which includes the Romanian National Unity Party, an anti-Hungarian group which, like the Hungarian minority, is based in Transylvania, Romania's western province which was ruled by Budapest until 1920. With its populist, nationalist slogans, the RNUP, like the SLP and Romania Mare, has won support by playing on the fears and ignorance of a population emerging from totalitarian rule and struggling to survive a severe economic recession. Mr Coposu says: 'After 45 years of Soviet and communist darkness, Romanians have lost their political intuition. The civic level needs to increase for people to be able to fashion political positions normally again.' The fear is that - as in Russia - extremists will gain more ground if an ailing economy causes living standards to fall further and prevents the formation of a solid middle class capable of supporting centre-right parties and western-style democracy.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Mitsubishi to shrink finance division MITSUBISHI Corporation, Japan's leading trading house, plans to shrink its finance division in a move away from zaiteku, the financial engineering popular among Japanese companies in the late 1980s. The decision follows the company's bail-out earlier this year of MC Finance, a group finance subsidiary which suffered from mounting investment losses. In the late 1980s, financial investments became an important profit centre for many industrial companies, which later suffered heavy portfolio losses when the stock market turned sour. MC Finance was created in 1986 to act as a banker for Mitsubishi subsidiaries and affiliates, borrowing at discount rates and passing on the savings to other group companies. MC Finance also turned to zaiteku, pouring funds into the stock market. Along with MC Finance, the group aggressively invested in specified money trusts and fund trusts. Mitsubishi has been reducing its investment stocks, and its outstanding investments stand at around Y230bn(Dollars 2.19bn). Mitsubishi will disband its capital markets division, which had been the centre of group investment operations since 1986, and shift about 30 of its 159 capital markets staff to its corporate information division.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / Builders already on paper-thin margins: Construction THE COST of building in Britain could rise by between 1 per cent and 2 per cent as a result of the devaluation of the pound, according to EC Harris, an international construction cost consultant. Imports account for about Pounds 4bn of annual building material sales of Pounds 32bn. Britain ran a trade deficit of almost Pounds 1.8bn in building materials during the 12 months to the end of June - almost 16 per cent of the country's Pounds 11.25bn visible trade gap during the period. A 10 per cent devaluation of sterling would increase the annual building materials import bill by Pounds 400m, adding about 1.25 per cent to contractors' costs. Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, a UK contractor with annual sales of more than Pounds 1bn, says sterling's devaluation would increase pressure on prices of basic commodities such as timber and oil-based goods not produced in the UK. But competition in depressed UK and overseas construction markets might restrict price rises in the short term, he adds. EC Harris says contractors working on long-term fixed-price contracts would suffer from higher material or labour costs. Many were already working on paper-thin or non-existent margins. Timber - much of it tropical hardwoods - accounts for more than Pounds 1bn of the annual trade deficit in materials, according to the environment department. Copper products amount to a further Pounds 100m. There is also a substantial deficit in manufactured goods, with imports of ironmongery exceeding exports by almost Pounds 200m.</p>

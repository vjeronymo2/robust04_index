			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Survey of Toulouse and the Midi-Pyrenees (2): A tale of three cities - Despite their differences, all face similar challenges The new autoroute from Albi to Toulouse has cut the journey time to just 45 minutes. Still heading south-east, another stretch of highway can get you from Toulouse to Tarbes in an hour and a half. But if expanding motorway links between the region's big cities has brought them closer together, they remain distinct in terms of identity, politics and culture. That much is apparent even from a cursory study of three of the region's largest towns. Toulouse has a right-wing mayor, a developed high-tech industrial base and covers an area almost as large as Paris. Albi, with its picturesque town centre built around a magnificent Gothic cathedral, has a socialist mayor and an industrial tradition in mining and metallurgy. Tarbes, with its Communist mayor, is less picturesque. But it is nestled at the foot of the Pyrenees, close to Spain, with which it enjoys close cultural and social contacts. Such diversity is hardly surprising given the size of the Midi-Pyrenees region and the conflicting pressures and attractions to which it has been subjected over the ages. But there is also a common thread behind the development of Tarbes, Albi and Toulouse. All have been shaped to a certain extent by their relationship with the French state and their strategic importance. The proximity of Tarbes to the Spanish border, for example, explains its role as a traditional arsenal town. It is still home to substantial defence industries, such as GIAT, a manufacturer of tanks and armaments. Albi, one of the strongholds of the Cathar religious movement in the early centuries of the millennium, became a focus of the struggle between central power and regional sentiment. The cathedral, built like a fortress to impress the strength of church and state on the surrounding region, stands as testimony to the tradition of local identity, Toulouse, itself one of the most important power bases outside Paris for much of French history, represents a more modern example of the relationship between the French state and the regions. Through the policies of Datar, the state organisation for regional development, it has become one of France's most successful cases of decentralisation. Its high technology industries in aeronautics and space have been built around the universities and research centres removed to the city in successive stages since the 1960s. Despite the separate historical and economic traditions, all three cities face a common challenge of adjustment. The closure of much of the coalmining industry in Albi-Carmaux has forced the city to look to new investment and a more diversified industrial base. 'The area has been hit by the closure of mines and of a military barracks' says Mr Hubert Gallais, head of development at Adirac, the agency charged with encouraging local investment. 'But we are rebounding. We have created 2,000 industrial jobs through our policy of conversion.' In Tarbes, the economic downturn has been felt through the city's largest employers. GIAT, for example, has shed jobs as a result of reduced defence expenditure in France and abroad. 'First we have to save the big groups,' says Mr Raymond Erracaret, mayor of Tarbes. 'But we also need to restructure the regional economy.' In Toulouse, the problems are possibly less severe. The strength of its high-tech industrial base means the economic downturn is cyclical rather than structural. But it is faced with the need to diversify its production and its markets. The problems of adjustment bring occasional friction between the cities of the Midi-Pyrenees. Mr Erracaret, mayor of Tarbes, for example, criticises the 'Toulousaine imperialism' which has seen the regional capital expand much more rapidly than the rest of the region. 'Development has been too centred on Toulouse', says Mr Michel Castel, his counterpart in Albi. In the case of Tarbes, the physical distance from Toulouse is prompting closer links with neighbouring cities. In particular, Mr Erracaret sees the potential for economic and social co-operation with Pau, which is in the neighbouring Aquitaine region, and Lourdes, the nearest town in the Haute-Pyrenees department. An agreement to share hospital resources could represent the first step in the creation of a 'Pyrenean Metropole'. But there is also pressure to integrate more closely the principal towns of the Midi-Pyrenees region. 'We have to extend regional links,' says Mr Dominique Baudis, mayor of Toulouse. 'There is an important gap between Toulouse and the rest of the region and we should reduce it,' he says. He adds, however, that this should not involve curbing the development of Toulouse, but rather the development of communications and commercial links with the other towns. This process is already under way. In addition to the construction of auto-routes, the towns co-operate in attracting foreign investment. Agreements between metropolitan Toulouse, which promotes investment in the city, and BRIA (the regional development agency) mean, for example, that potential investors are offered sites in Toulouse and the outlying areas. In education, some of the department of Toulouse University have been relocated to regional cities such as Albi. Although at an early stage, this should allow a repeat of the experience in Toulouse, where industry has been attracted by the educational and research base. Political affiliations do not appear to present an obstacle to increased regional integration. Mr Castel's light pink shirt reflects his moderate ideology. Mr Erracaret, like many Communists in the region, comes from a tradition of pragmatism rather than polemics. 'I don't think party politics makes a difference in regional development,' he says. Nonetheless, it is regarded as a vital issue. For many observers it is the most important challenge facing the Midi-Pyrenees. 'We have a situation of two worlds - Toulouse and the rest of the region,' says Mr Robert Marconis, professor of geography at Toulouse-Mirail university. 'It is important to create a more balanced growth.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                    TOTAL POPULATION IN THOUSANDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                        1985     1987      1989       1990      1993  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Midi-Pyrenees       2,346.9  2,362.7   2,385.6    2,430.7     2,475 France               55,061   55,506  54,334.9   56,614.5    57,527  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                       Inhabitants   Density by City               Population (1990)   per sq km    department*  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Toulouse                 650,336         1,052          147 Tarbes                    74,639         1,015           50 Albi                      62,182           650           60 Montauban                 51,224           379           54 Rodez                     39,011           550           31 Auch                      23,135           319           28 Cahors                    20,000           305           30 Pamiers                   17,000           283           28  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * per square kilometre  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: INSEEE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

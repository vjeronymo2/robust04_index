			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: US stock funds remain in favour  -Rising rates have not deterred investors Although the increase in US interest rates this year has taken its toll on stock and bond markets, the equity mutual fund business in the US has held up remarkably well. The hundreds of billions of dollars which flowed into stock funds during the early 1990s as rates tumbled have not flowed out again because rates have reversed course. Yesterday, the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy again, and left the door open to further rate increases in the future. Analysts, however, believe investor confidence in stock funds will not be seriously undermined by the increasingly unfavourable interest rate environment. So far this year both short and long-term interest rates have risen sharply. The rate on overnight bank loans has climbed to 5.5 per cent from 3 per cent, and long-term interest rates (as measured by the yield on the 30-year government bond) have jumped to 8.1 per cent from a low of 5.8 per cent. Also, the stock market has performed poorly - the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has fallen just under 1 per cent so far this year. Yet, in spite of rising rates and flat share prices, individuals and institutions have continued to favour equity funds over other forms of investments. In the third quarter, net new sales of stock funds averaged Dollars 10.5bn a month, slightly higher than the Dollars 10.4bn a month rate recorded in the same three months of 1993, the year sales broke all records. Money continues to flow into stock funds at rates comparable to last year because of several factors, including changing demographics among investors. In the past few years, millions of 'baby boomers' born in the 1950s and 1960s have reached middle-age and have begun to save more of their income to pay for their children's education and their own retirement. As relatively sophisticated savers, many have chosen to invest in stock funds, which they believe guarantee the best return of any form of investment over the long-term. A year of rising interest rates and a dull stock market is not going to persuade these investors to take their money out of funds. As Mr Richard Hoey, chief economist at the Dreyfus investment fund group in New York, says: 'There is a portion of the market where there's an underlying demand to invest in assets for longer-term reasons.' Another factor is the continuing popularity of foreign stocks. With share prices flat at home, more investors are looking to benefit from the growth potential of overseas markets by investing in international equity funds offered by US money managers. Mr Todd Schapera of the Boston-based Scudder investment group says that significant amounts of money have continued to flow into its international equities funds in recent months. For the industry as a whole, net new sales of international funds have been averaging Dollars 2.7bn a month so far this year, up from Dollars 1.6bn a month in the same period of 1993. A third factor supporting demand for stock funds has been the lack of an attractive alternative. While short-term interest rates have risen from their 30-year lows of late 1993, returns on short-term investments remain meagre by historical standards. Bank certificates of deposit and money market mutual funds today yield no more than 4 per cent to 5 per cent, while some stock funds have been able to provide investors with returns as high as 9 per cent or 10 per cent. They have been able to do this by avoiding interest rate-sensitive sectors and concentrating on stocks of companies whose performance is closely tied to the economy As for long-term bond funds, they have been hit hard by the rise in interest rates, which provoked the biggest bond market crash in a generation. As bond prices plummeted, investors rushed to take their money out of bond funds to protect the value of their principal. In the third quarter, bond funds suffered net outflows of cash at the rate of Dollars 3.5bn a month. Although some of that money will have gone into stock funds, much of it appears in the last month or so to have gone into money market funds, where investors are willing - at least temporarily - to live with the low returns in exchange for the knowledge that their capital is relatively secure. Total assets in money market funds held steady at around Dollars 580bn between January and September this year, but suddenly jumped in October to more than Dollars 616bn. Mr Roger Servison, managing director at Fidelity Investments, the largest mutual fund group in the US, says the total of money market fund assets should climb even higher as the year progresses. 'People are looking to protect their principal until they feel that long-term rates have settled down . . . What we've seen in our own market surveys is that most investors feel interest rates are still going higher.' Yet, Mr Servison says that at some stage interest rates will peak, and when they do investors may begin to look at bond funds again, hoping to lock in high yields after having escaped the worst of the slump in bond prices. This could lead to some switching of money from stock funds into bond funds. Determining when the current cycle of interest rate increases will end, however, will not be easy given the Fed's reluctance to discuss future policy. Although many Wall Street analysts believe that the central bank's latest rate increase could be the last tightening for a couple of quarters, investors are unlikely to want to bet on them being right just yet. As Mr Servison said before the Fed raised rates yesterday: 'The Dollars 64,000-question is - Will the next move be enough to change investor expectations?'  ----------------------------------------- US MUTUAL FUNDS: NET NEW CASH FLOWS (DOLLARS BN)  ----------------------------------------- 1994          Equity      Bond &amp; income  ----------------------------------------- January        18.4          11.0 February       14.4           1.1 March           6.6          -7.7 April          11.3          -4.8 May            11.8          -2.1 June            7.7          -1.7 July            9.2          -2.9 August         14.1          -2.8 September       8.1          -4.8  ----------------------------------------- Source: Investment Company Institute  -----------------------------------------</p>

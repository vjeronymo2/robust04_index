			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / World Commodities Prices: Market Report PLATINUM was fixed at Dollars 340.75 a troy ounce in the afternoon on the London bullion market - still Dollars 2 down from the Wednesday's close but Dollars 1 above the morning, its lowest fix since January 22, 1992. 'Platinum is falling although I'm not sure that it wants to. If there is going to be a big move, I think it will be down rather than up,' said one analyst. GOLD traded in a tight range, limited on the downside by good physical demand at Dollars 327 to Dollars 328 a troy ounce. Sentiment remains bearish on the LME following the losses of the last week, and although most markets consolidated in narrow ranges yesterday, rallies were seen as fresh selling opportunities. Three-month COPPER spent most of the day above Dollars 2,150 a tonne, but was unable to push significantly higher, and prices eased back under late liquidation. Final business was at Dollars 2,145. Three-month ALUMINIUM continued to encounter resistance on moves towards Dollars 1,190, and gradually lost heart, settling back to end at Dollars 1,182.25. Compiled from Reuters</p>

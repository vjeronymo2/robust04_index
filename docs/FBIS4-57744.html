			<p>CSO       [Editorial Report] Managua BARRICADA in Spanish on page 6  of its 27 April 1994 edition reports that the Bank of Nicaragua  (Banic), which is near its lending capacity, sold to the Bank of  Central America part of its 60 million cordoba loan portfolio in  order to increase its loans to the production sector. Banic  General Manager Esteban Duquestrada pointed out that while banks  are allowed to lend up to 16 times their capital, the private  banks are "generally reluctant" to grant credit. The sale of the  loan portfolios is being financed by AID, according to the  article. Duqestrada said that one of the drawbacks of the  program is that state banks are losing their best customers to  the private banks, which will only purchase the portfolios of  the best loan risks.</p>

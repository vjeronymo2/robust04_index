			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / Business Travel: Lost luggage leads to Denver delays Denver's new airport, topped with white Fibreglass cones in imitation of the Rocky Mountains in the background, continues to lie empty. It was due to open on May 16, but was delayed - for the fourth time - by glitches in the high-technology baggage delivery system. The new Denver International Airport, with a runway that will be able to handle 99 aircraft arrivals an hour in bad weather - as many as the city's 64-year-old Stapleton airport can cope with on a clear day - is eight months behind schedule and Dollars 1bn over budget. It has cost Dollars 3.2bn to date. When its opening was postponed again this month, city officials decided not to set another target, saying only that the airport would open when the computerised baggage handling system - the most sophisticated and complex of its kind - had been sufficiently tested and proved operational. The system, which has cost Dollars 194m, has 21 miles of tracks that snake through the airport, carrying bags in 4,000 individual containers. Bar codes on luggage labels tell the system the bags' destinations. But the system relies on human co-operation: it keeps going awry when luggage is loaded with the labels face down or otherwise obscured.</p>

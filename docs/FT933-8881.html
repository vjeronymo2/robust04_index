The proposed township - described as Singapore II by the Singapore press - will be developed using Singapore's integrated planning approach as a model. The aim is to attract Dollars 20bn of investment in the town, which will eventually have a population of more than 600,000. The consortium, which includes many of Singapore's most prominent semi-state and private companies, will have a 65 per cent stake in the joint venture company developing the new township, while the Suzhou authorities will hold the remainder.</p>

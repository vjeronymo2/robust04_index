			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / View from down under: Rising backbench influence and policy retreats hold out little prospect of firm government We now know the government's strategy. It is stark, and simple. It can be summed up in one word: survival. Mr John Major and his colleagues will do whatever is necessary to restore their authority, taking each day as it comes, defining the medium term as the week after next and the long term as Christmas. The illusions of grandeur, the aspirations to making Britain the best in Europe at this or that, are in mothballs. We are in the hands of a prime minister who, as the little boy would feel obliged to point out, is adorned by fewer clothes than Madonna. Nothing is settled. The excitements of the past week have got us precisely nowhere. Ten days ago there was a policy for the coal mines, and a strategy of sorts for energy. Today neither exists, and no one can say what will come in their stead. Forty days ago there was an economic strategy - to bear down on inflation by staying within the exchange rate mechanism. Today there is confusion: the announcements made so far constitute not so much a U-turn as going round in circles. There is still a European strategy - to ratify the Maastricht treaty. It is Mr Major's last wisp of apparel. It is not at all certain that it will be in place for much longer. The plan to close 31 coal mines was first threatened, then derailed, by a parliamentary coalition between the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats, and a Churchill-led faction of the Conservative party. The government's retreat has subsequently been played out before our eyes. Last Friday evening there was talk of buying off the rebellion with a compensatory fund for retraining redundant miners. Nothing so cheap was on offer. On Monday the president of the Board of Trade, Mr Michael Heseltine, bid higher. There would, he said, be a moratorium on the closure of 21 of the threatened pits, pending investigations by his department. It looked as though the closure policy was not being withdrawn - it was merely to be phased in. That was a precipitous climb-down, but nevertheless insufficient. On Tuesday the government upped the ante: the 10 pits apparently doomed by Monday's statement would be kept in order during the 90-day statutory review period, in case any could be reprieved. As to the other 21 pits, and energy policy in general, there would be two full reviews, one by the president himself and one by a parliamentary select committee. Under pressure, Mr Humbletine piled on hostages to the government's fortune. The economics of imported coal, and gas-fired generation, would be re-examined; in the end even nuclear policy was put up for review. If the government is true to this week's promises it might even re-examine the electricity privatisation which produced the commanding duopoly that is so patently able to dominate the market. Theoretically, that too could now be changed. In consequence, taxpayers could find themselves maintaining, by subsidy, a larger coal industry than is justified by market demand. To save the parliamentary day, Mr Heseltease goaded the Labour opposition into behaving like a gang of drunken schoolboys. That united the Tories. Humbled Mr Heseltine may have been, but in the practice of pure politics he is still one of the few outstanding professionals in the administration. The retreat from the counter-inflation strategy has been even more dramatic. Only a fortnight ago the prime minister spoke in Brighton as if the pursuit of low inflation was still the overriding objective. That lasted about a week. Under heavy political fire, interest rates fell by a full point last Friday. This Tuesday Mr Major, taking the concept of 'open government' more seriously than previously thought possible, started to make economic policy pronouncements on television. He stressed growth on one news bulletin and forgot to mention inflation on another. Treasury officials must have found it relaxing to hear the prime minister's rapidly changing aspirations explained to them as they sat in the comfort of their own homes, watching the flickering screen. I do not wish to be unfair. The economic question of the moment is whether we are on the brink of a global depression. No British government acting alone can do much about that. Mr Major is painfully aware of this. I am certain that what he wants is sustained non-inflationary growth, as he intimated in answers to parliamentary questions yesterday. Contrary to the mutterings in public bars and around City luncheon tables, he is not foolish. He is a politician of greater personal resilience than is generally acknowledged. His problem is that he is running out of political capital. He can no longer feel certain, as he did until September 16, that with a full term in office ahead of him he could afford to play a long game, battering inflation down towards 2 per cent or less, in the know-ledge that the recovery would come in time for the next election. Worse, he has now lost both the affection of much of the electorate and his authority over much of his party. In such circumstances the prime minister's only political option is to speak stirringly of growth. 'It is our intention to pursue a strategy that will bring recovery, with it growth, with it jobs and with it prosperity,' he said in the house yesterday. 'It is essential that that moves right to the centre of thinking in each and every aspect of Government policy . . .' As to inflation, he is merely keeping his fingers crossed. What will happen next will be dictated by events. Take, for example, public spending cuts, which conventional wisdom says are needed to offset the inflationary effect of reductions in interest rates. If the cuts are serious, public sector pay increases must be held to 2 per cent or less. The Royal College of Nursing is at least as adept at playing on public sympathy as the National Union of Mineworkers. If the government caves in to the NUM, why not the nurses? If the nurses, why not disgruntled householders saddled with the new council tax? We are back to the old days, when proponents of every vested interest have good reason to try their luck. This prognostication of continuing political impotence can be taken too far. Anti-Maastricht plotters are forgetting that the Labour party underpinned the government's defeat on the coal closure plan. Labour is more likely to abstain than to vote against a Maastricht ratification bill. It will nevertheless be a close-run thing, with the prize going to the side with the greatest parliamentary stamina. The opposition is not about to help the government by voting to close off filibusters by Tory Europhobes who seek to talk the bill to death, or postpone its reintroduction. Yet if the bill is defeated, Mr Major's hold on office will become extremely tenuous. Within the Conservative party, a vote for Maastricht is becoming a vote for Mr Major, and vice-versa. Heads will be counted at a debate due on November 4, the Tory backbenchers' 1922 committee permitting. The most likely outcome is still a victory for the bill, and for Mr Major. On that assumption, we can take it that the prime minister will survive, battered but still in office, for long enough to be floated back to safety by an economic upturn - one day. That is the good news. The other half is that, politics being what it is, by-elections are likely to wear down the Conservatives' majority of 21. As his term lengthens, Mr Major will become more, not less, in thrall to the whims of his back-benchers. If firm government is what you are after, it is not a comforting prospect.</p>

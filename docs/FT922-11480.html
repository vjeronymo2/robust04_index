			<p>920425 FT  25 APR 92 / Haulage group names chairman MR Martin Llowarch, who stepped down unexpectedly as chief executive of British Steel last year, is to become chairman of Transport Development Group, one of Britain's biggest road hauliers. Mr Llowarch, who was regarded as a possible future chairman of British Steel until he resigned last May, will succeed Sir James Duncan, who retires at the end of August on reaching 65. Sir James has been chairman since 1975 and has been on the board since 1960. Mr Llowarch joined the board only in February. The decision to bring in an outsider is another sign of the management shake-up at a company, where profits have marked time for several years. Mr Alan Cole, TDG's chief executive, joined in June 1990. He took over from Mr Jim Lockhart, another TDG veteran who had been group managing director for 11 years. Mr Llowarch, 56, also sits on the boards of Abbey National, Hickson International and Johnson &amp; Firth Brown. Before embarking on his career as a non-executive director, Mr Llowarch had spent 23 years at British Steel, including a spell as finance director. Mr Cecil Parkinson, the former Tory cabinet minister, has been appointed non-executive deputy chairman of Starmin, the quarry products company. Mr Peter Ryan is to take over the chairmanship of Torday &amp; Carlisle, the engineering company.</p>

			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / International Company News: Rio Algom declines 28% RIO ALGOM, the Canadian uranium, copper, coal and metals distribution group, was hit by lower copper prices in the third quarter. Net profit was CDollars 11.6m (USDollars 6m), or 25 cents a share, after a CDollars 9.4m loss on the sale of its potash mining operation and a CDollars 15m gain on the sale of portfolio investments. The latest figure was down 28 per cent from CDollars 16.2m, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenues were CDollars 237m, up 3 per cent. Nine-month profit was CDollars 22.7m, or 48 cents, down 22 per cent from CDollars 29.2m, or 63 cents, on revenues of CDollars 712m, up 7 per cent. The international metals distribution business improved and a lower Canadian dollar also helped. Rio, 51 per cent controlled by RTZ until June 1992, will close its last remaining Ontario uranium mine in 1996 as contracts with Ontario Hydro utility run out.</p>

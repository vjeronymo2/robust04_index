			<p><P> November 13, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ISRAEL NOW USING GRAVEL-SHOOTER AGAINST ARABS  </P> <P> Israel has introduced a machine that fires lumps of gravel the size of eggs to  disperse Palestinian demonstrators, military sources said today.  </P> <P> It was designed especially for use against Palestinian demonstrators in the  35-month-old intifada, a revolt against Israeli rule in the occupied West Bank  and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> The sources said the device is not lethal and causes less harm than rubber and  plastic bullets.  </P> <P> Israel has been criticized for using lethal force against Palestinians. At  least 738 Arabs have been killed by Israelis since the start of the Palestinian  uprising in December, 1987.  </P> <P> The gravel shooter can fire up to 600 lumps of gravel a minute over a distance  of 75 yards, Israel radio said.  </P> <P> An earlier gravel shooter proved ineffective at close range.  </P></p>

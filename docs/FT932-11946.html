			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Letter: Pro Ned's future role in non-executive selection In welcoming your review of Pro Ned's first 10 years (April 26), I would like to make two further points. Yes, the non-executive message has been received but appointments are far too often made in an amateur way where selection starts with the man rather than the job. The boards of many UK-listed companies still have to be persuaded of the benefits of a thorough and professional selection procedure which is understood and respected. Our research (July 1992) showed that only a third of non-executive appointments in the previous 12 months were made with the help of professional advisers. Pro Ned was involved in half of these. Research also revealed that more than half of non-executive directors believe they could be more effective. Companies must therefore be encouraged to provide the conditions which allow non-executive directors to contribute fully to boardroom debate. Pro Ned's role is clear: we will continue to provide guidance on practice, roles and responsibilities; we will continue to provide the most comprehensive client-driven register and search facility in the UK; and we will continue to promote the benefits of appointing independent non-executive directors through an open and respected process.

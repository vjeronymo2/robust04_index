			<p>BFN     [Text] On the occasion of the completed Croat-Bosnian  negotiations President Tudjman sent letters to U.S. President  Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Cristopher, as well  as to the foreign ministers of the Russian Federation, France,  Germany, Germany, Great Britain, the Kingdom of Belgium, and  Greece, the president's office has reported. President  Tudjman's letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton reads as follows:    Esteemed Mr. President: It is with particular pleasure that  I wish to inform you that the negotiations between the Croat and  the Bosnian delegations concerning the comprehensive  implementation of the Washington Agreements have been brought to  a successful conclusion. I would like to express particular  gratitude to the U.S. Administration and to you personally, Mr.  President, for your role in the search for lasting and just  solutions for the achievement of peace through the realization  of the Croat-Bosnian Federation and Confederation. Let me once  again assure you that the Republic of Croatia will remain firmly  committed to the spirit and letter of the Washington and Vienna  Agreements, wishing to be a factor of stability in this part of  Europe and a permanent partner of the United States in the  promotion of peace and stability in this part of Europe. The  leading role of your country in the achievement of a lasting  political solution is crucial in this, the final stage of the  peace process. Any freezing of the present state of affairs and  any delay in this solution only prolongs human agony and  threatens peace in the greater European area. This is why the  present peace efforts of the international community should be  focused on shaping the means and guarantees for the  implementation of the achieved agreements and decisions of the  international community. Let me remind you once again that the  problems of the Serbian occupation of parts of the Republic of  Croatia and the Republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina are inseparable,  and let me reiterate the need to seek a lasting solution through  an integral approach of the international community to the  problem. Mr. President, I am firmly convinced that, with your  personal involvement and the moral and every other determination  of your administration, we will soon be able to focus our  efforts on issues such as the return of refugees to their homes,  economic reconstruction, reconciliation, and the strengthening  of democratic processes to create a new, stable international  order in this part of Europe. Signed, Yours Sincerely, Tudjman.    In a letter that President Tudjman sent to U.S. Secretary of  State Warren Christopher and the foreign ministers of the  countries that took part in the Geneva talks, President Tudjman  said, inter alia: I wish to thank the governments of your  countries on their support for the peace process, especially to  the U.S. Government, which actively mediated in efforts to reach  a solution between the Croats and the Bosnians. At the present  stage of seeking a political solution in former Yugoslavia we  see as decisive your determination to bring the Serbian side  around to accepting a just political solution and, if necessary,  impose such a solution on the forces obstructing the peace  process, Tudjman said in his letter to the foreign ministers.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / International Company News: Earnings at Enron jump by 20% NET INCOME at Enron, the fast-growing US oil and gas group, jumped by a fifth, to Dollars 61m, for the second quarter of 1993 - effectively doubling its profits on continuing operations, once a Dollars 18.4m gain on the sale of Mobil stock and other non-recurring items in the same period in 1992 are stripped out. Earnings per share rose from 42 cents to 48 cents. Operating income of the group's natural gas pipelines increased to Dollars 71.1m, from Dollars 51.9m a year ago, while earnings from gas marketing reached Dollars 21.8m, up from Dollars 12.6m in last year's corresponding period. Income from power generation fell, to Dollars 17.5m from Dollars 20.4m, due to construction costs of a new power generating plant at Teesside in the UK. In a separate announcement, Enron Oil &amp; Gas, the group's 80-per cent owned gas exploration and production company, reported net income of Dollars 33.5m, or 42 cents a share, more than double its level for the second quarter of 1992, due to increased production and higher gas prices.</p>

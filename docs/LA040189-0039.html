			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEMONSTRATIONS BY OPERATION RESCUE  </P> <P> I was present at the mid-Wilshire protest by Operation Rescue on Saturday.  Although I have since heard several testimonies to the contrary, the police  officers that I observed carried out their distasteful duties in a  professional, exemplary manner. The blame for the charges of brutality does not  lie with them, but with the policy decision that authorized the use of pain  compliance techniques on nonviolent, almost pacifistic protesters.  </P> <P> I was appalled and not a little bit sickened to see elderly ladies, whose only  "resistance" to arrest consisted of going limp, having their arms, wrists and  fingers twisted into painful positions. Although Gates and Deputy Chief Robert  Vernon were certainly in a difficult position on Saturday, they and my city  councilman will receive a letter asking for an explanation of this particular  policy.  </P> <P> MARK PICHAJ  </P> <P> Eagle Rock  </P></p>

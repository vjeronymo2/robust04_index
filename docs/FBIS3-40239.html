Dozens of aid organisations operating in the war-torn  country  rely on protection from United Nations troops on the ground to  deliver supplies.    Even with this protection, Larry Hollingworth, who is  responsible for all convoys organised by the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Bosnia, estimated that they  were only meeting 20 percent of the need.    "We'll bring in in January, if we're lucky, about 20 percent  of the needs. It was 17.9 percent last month and 10 the month  before," he said. [passage omitted]    "If the blue helmets leave, there will be certain chaos. All  our foreign staff will leave because there will no longer be any  security cover. To stay without them is totally out of the  question," said Dominique Hopital, coordinator for Handicap  International in Zenica, central Bosnia.    Zenica has become the regional base for most of the  non-governmental organisations trying to bring aid to the  population.    But the organisations warn that their already difficult job  will become virtually impossible if the UN troops leave.    "We can't do anything without them. The humanitarian  (organisations) and the military are inextricably tied. Of  course that raises certain ethical problems, but on the ground  we have no choice," said Nathalie Lauriac also from Handicap  International.    From Zenica the UNHCR controls all aid convoys to Bosnia  either via Sarajevo airport or by the so-called Diamond route  linking the Croatian coast with central Bosnia.    Hollingworth said: "I can't see the airlift surviving  because  it needs the UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces] to keep going. For  the other kind of aid it would be possible but it would be  difficult.    "If the decision were taken for UNPROFOR to leave, it may be  possible for UNHCR to stay on its own. But without the military  on the ground, we would certainly feel more exposed.    "The most important thing to remember is that there's a  desperate need for food here. No matter who goes or who stays,  if no one meets that need, then a lot of people are going to  die."    Other aid workers also said they would have no option but to  close down their operations in Bosnia if the UN troops pulled  out.    Christophe Grange from Solidarites (Solidarity) said: "If  everybody leaves, we won't stay."    Added Pierre Dorbes from Pharmaciens sans Frontieres  (Pharmacists without borders): "We would hope to be able to  stay if conditions allowed it, but we have not come here to be  killed ourselves. For the moment we cannot work without  UNPROFOR. If they leave we wouldn't last longer than three to  four days."</p>

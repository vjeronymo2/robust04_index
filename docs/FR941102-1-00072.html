			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposal by TAPP and FUMMC to leave butterfat on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> differential pricing basis and to price protein on a differential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis with a neutral range is not included in this decision. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> continue to pay producers for butterfat and to add payment for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein on the ``traditional'' differential system would confuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and frustrate producers in the understanding of their milk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> checks. Continued use of differentials would perpetuate the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> volume-based pricing system with a high value on water, and would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fail to give producers a true price signal of what the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marketplace wants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The use of differentials in pricing milk components is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> widely understood. There is no valid reason to continue an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outmoded and confusing pricing system in valuing milk components.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Pricing components on a per-pound basis will allow producers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> see clearly what components have the most value, a result which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> plainly fits the goal of encouraging producers to produce those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components which have the highest value in the market place.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Per-pound pricing also makes clear to producers that it is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pounds of components that result in payment, rather than the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percentages of those components in milk. Producers would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> better able to look at the cost of producing pounds of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> components, and compare those costs with possible returns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Application of a neutral zone would discourage producers from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increasing protein production marginally unless such an increase  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would raise the protein level above the neutral range.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> A. Protein <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The protein price for milk pooled under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five north central Federal milk orders should be calculated by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> multiplying the monthly average of 40-pound block cheese prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the Green Bay Cheese Exchange by 1.32, without including a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value for whey protein.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> No opposition was expressed at the hearing to pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein on the basis of its value in the manufacture of cheese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The differences between participants came in determining the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate level of the protein price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A proposal submitted and supported by National All-Jersey,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inc. (NAJ), and supported by a number of cooperative associations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other dairy organizations, would calculate the protein price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in two parts: (1) Multiply the National Cheese Exchange monthly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average 40-pound block cheese price by 1.32, and (2) add the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monthly average whey protein concentrate price multiplied by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> .735. The sum of these two values would equal the protein price.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NAJ proponent witness explained that one of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectives of the NAJ proposal was to establish a protein price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that was high enough to give producers an incentive to produce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein. He added that a second objective was to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protein price from market forces rather than as a residual value,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as is used in other Federal orders. The witness explained that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1.32 factor used in the NAJ proposal comes from the modified  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Van Slyke cheese yield formula that is commonly used by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry. The 1.32 factor represents the pounds of 38-percent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> moisture Cheddar cheese obtained from one pound of protein with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75 percent of the protein going into the cheese.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The witness gave four reasons for using the National Cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Exchange 40-pound Cheddar block price (block price): (1) The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> majority of the cheese in the five Federal orders is priced using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the block price as the base price, (2) the block price is used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining the somatic cell adjustment in the Eastern Ohio-Western Pennsylvania, Indiana, and Ohio Valley orders, as well as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being used in the computation of the Class II price in all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal orders, and in the determination of the Class 4a price in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California, (3) since there is over twice as much American cheese  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured in blocks as is made in barrels, and the Wisconsin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assembly point barrel cheese price is within one cent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> block price, the block price represents a minimum cheese price,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (4) the protein price determined pursuant to this proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gives a greater incentive to producers to produce protein and is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> more equitable to handlers and producers than the (lower) protein  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price contained in the other proposals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

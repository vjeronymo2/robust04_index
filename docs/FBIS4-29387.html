			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From NIHON KEIZAI SHIMBUN 17 June Morning Edition] </F>   [Text] The government appraises positively the UN Security  Council [UNSC] resolution on sanctions against the DPRK (North  Korea) drafted by the United States because "it provides for a  grace period to serve as a warning, and Japan's position has  been taken into consideration to a certain extent," (according  to a top Foreign Ministry official). If the resolution is  adopted, Japan will promptly perform its duties as a UN member.    The government appreciates in particular the fact that the  objective of the sanctions -- to make North Korea change its  mind -- is clearly indicated. It believes that providing for a  grace period of 30 days from the adoption of the resolution  before sanctions are actually implemented is "a result of  accommodating Japan's original proposal" on "step-by-step  sanctions starting with a warning resolution," (according to a  Foreign Ministry source).    Since the draft resolution is being considered at the UNSC,  the focus is now on how China will react. The government says  that "at this point, we have absolutely no indication how China  will act," (according to a top Foreign Ministry official). It  believes that although China's response may change the substance  of the resolution, "it is improbable that the resolution will  become any tougher." It would like to see the resolution passed  in the end in a form conducive to encouraging North Korea to  change its attitude through discussions in the UNSC involving  China.</p>

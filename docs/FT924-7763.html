			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Underlying inflation at 4-year low THE TREASURY'S preferred measure of underlying inflation fell to 3.8 per cent last month, the lowest figure for more than four years, the Central Statistical Office said yesterday. The year-on-year change in this measure - the retail prices index less mortgage interest payments - fell from 4 per cent in September and 4.2 per cent in August. The year-on-year increase in the RPI was 3.6 per cent last month, the same as in September. Both figures underline the weak state of demand and lack of recovery. The Treasury's preferred measure of underlying inflation has fallen in every month since April, when it stood at 5.7 per cent. Government policy is to keep this figure at 4.0 per cent or less. One warning sign on the inflation front was that petrol prices increased last month because of the devaluation of sterling after Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16. The increase in petrol prices - which pushed up the cost of a gallon of 4-star petrol from Pounds 2.25 to Pounds 2.31 - contributed to a 0.7 per cent increase in motoring expenditure for the month. In the year to October, the element of the RPI accounted for by these costs increased by 4.3 per cent. The CSO said that apart from petrol and fuel oil, few other retail items had shown higher prices as a result of the devaluation. However, such increases arising from the higher prices of imports may work their way into the economy in the coming months, especially if demand rises. Upward pressure on the RPI - in October this stood at 139.9 compared with September's 139.4 - was reduced by food prices showing only a 0.2 per cent increase between September and October. Measured over the year to last month this pushed up by 1.4 per cent the element of the index accounted for by prices of these items. In the 12 months to last month the price of seasonal foods fell by 8.3 per cent, largely because of a glut of fresh fruit and vegetables on world markets. Some types of fruit, including apples, seen fell by up to 20 per cent over the year. Clothing and footwear experienced a price rise of 1.3 per cent between September and October, thanks mainly to new stock entering the shops. The year-on-year increase in the prices of these goods remained low in October at 0.1 per cent last month. Among the areas of retail goods and services which still appear to be subject to relatively high inflationary pressures are fares and travel costs, which in October rose by 5.7 per cent compared with a year earlier. The prices of leisure services saw a comparable rise of 6.1 per cent.</p>

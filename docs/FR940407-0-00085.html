			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most comments received on this issue were supportive of the general requirements in the proposal. Of those supporting the general requirements, no commenters offered any specific criteria for levels of certainty or accuracy by which quantification approaches should be evaluated. On the other hand, an environmental group commented that, for trading programs, the EPA should require the use of the most accurate available continuous emissions monitors (CEM's) on every source in an emissions trading program, and, where such direct emissions quantification is not possible, no emissions trading should be allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rules reflect the importance of both ensuring environmental protection with an adequate degree of accountability and fostering the development of innovative and flexible programs. Innovation and flexibility would be unduly restricted if the use of the most accurate available CEM's were a prerequisite for all sources to be included in any emissions trading program. The final rules recognize that other approaches may be more appropriate for various source categories. The final rules reflect that credible approaches necessarily entail levels of accuracy and precision sufficient to determine compliance and allow for effective enforcement of all emission limits in any EIP. Subject to these enforceability considerations, the final rules address uncertainty in emission quantification in determining SIP credit through the use of a programmatic uncertainty factor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A commenter stressed that the need to assure accuracy in trading would further burden State agencies, and argued that EPA could not approve an EIP absent a demonstration that the State agency has adequate resources to handle the additional workload. Many of the additional requirements Congress imposed on States through the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 would place additional burdens on State agencies_EPA intends to implement the Act's requirements that States have sufficient resources (e.g., section 110(a)(2)(E)) in the context of EIP submissions in the same manner as EPA implements these requirements in the context of other SIP submissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Extended Averaging Times  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rules recognize that long-term averaging by individual sources can significantly relax standards that require compliance on a short-term basis and jeopardize RFP and attainment demonstrations that are based on ``typical summer day'' emissions. The proposal also recognized that EIP's which require a number of sources to comply with total emissions caps or average emission rate limits could potentially mitigate this type of rule relaxation. In such programs, random daily positive fluctuations in emissions that are likely to occur from any given source (i.e., emission ``spikes'' that could jeopardize attainment) may tend to be compensated for by random daily negative fluctuations from other sources. Thus, the proposal allowed long-term averaging, provided a statistical showing is made that the long-term caps or limits are consistent with applicable demonstrations of RFP on the basis of typical summer day emissions, demonstrations of attainment of short-term NAAQS, and RACT requirements. The proposed approach provided increased flexibility to sources and to States in their plan development without undermining the EPA's traditional control programs or the validity of RFP or attainment demonstrations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposal recognized the need for additional guidance on such statistical ``equivalency'' showings. The proposal also solicited comments on specific approaches for RACT equivalency showings, including the use of a presumptive norm discount factor of 70 percent to be applied to a RACT limit averaged over 30 days, other rule-specific discount factors determined by States to represent RACT equivalency, and the use of short-term caps in conjunction with long-term caps or limits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Many commenters supported the proposed flexibility to allow for long-term averaging. One State commenter strongly supported the provision to allow States to relate long-term averaging to daily emissions by statistical analysis. Another State agreed that the use of long-term averaging should not come at the expense of attaining short-term standards or demonstrations of compliance. Other States noted the need for consistency in the EPA's RACT guidance on averaging times. Industry commenters endorsed the allowance of long-term averaging, although they expressed differing views about the need for statistical showings to demonstrate consistency with RACT and short-term standards. Some felt that any such showing should not be burdensome, while others disagreed that any such showing was necessary. An environmental group agreed that increasing averaging periods can significantly relax standards and threaten RFP and attainment. This group commented, however, that the proposal understated the difficulties which would flow from such a relaxation, and felt that discount factors would not provide adequate protection against spikes in emissions which could prevent attainment of short-term NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to long-term averaging and RACT equivalency, many commenters disagreed with the use of a presumptive 30-day RACT equivalency factor, such as the 70 percent factor mentioned in the proposal. One commenter felt that a RACT equivalency showing should not be required if some statistical information was provided showing that long-term averaging would not interfere with RFP or the attainment demonstration. Many regulatory agency and industry commenters supported allowing States flexibility in determining RACT equivalency factors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

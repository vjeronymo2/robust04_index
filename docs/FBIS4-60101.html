			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris, May 19 (AFP) -- Israeli Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres announced here Thursday [19 May] that talks would  soon be held on transferring power in five key areas to  Palestinian authorities throughout the West Bank.    Speaking after a meeting with President Francois Mitterrand,  Peres said he believed that, in the near future, Israeli and  Palestinian leaders would discuss "the transfer of power in  certain sectors into the hands of Palestinian authorities on the  West Bank."    Peres, who arrived in the French capital Thursday for a  24-hour visit after talks in Oslo with Palestine Liberation  Organisation leader Yasir 'Arafat, cited health, education,  tourism, and fiscal and social matters as the sectors in  question.    The Israeli army, which finished its withdrawal overnight  Tuesday from the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho,  still occupies some West Bank regions.    The first part of bilateral negotiations had been concluded  successfully, Peres said.    The Israelis "have left Gaza and Jericho and this is the  first time that the Palestinian people have made real,  territorial gains," he added.    Questioned on 'Arafat's recent call for a Moslem holy war --  or jihad -- to liberate Jerusalem, Peres said that he hoped the  comment did not presage a return to PLO militancy.    "The past cannot be changed but I hope that it will not be  repeated in the future," Peres said.    "'Arafat made a mistake that he has tried to correct, but  despite this the negotiations must continue." [passage omitted]    Peres and 'Arafat announced earlier Thursday after meeting  in  Oslo that they had agreed on an agenda for the next round of  talks on the West Bank territories.    Those talks would probably take place in Cairo, Peres said,  adding that further negotiations about the extension of  Palestinian autonomy would be held in Washington at a date to be  arranged.</p>

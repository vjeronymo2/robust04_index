			<p>920402 FT  02 APR 92 / British Coal profit higher than last year BRITISH COAL is to announce record profits for the second successive year, the corporation said yesterday. Profits will be even higher than last year, when the corporation made Pounds 78m, its first profit for 15 years. The corporation also announced its biggest increase in productivity, which rose from an average of 4.7 tonnes per manshift last year to 5.3 tonnes this year. British Coal also set a new productivity target of 7.5 tonnes per manshift within two years. Mr Neil Clarke, chairman, said: 'It's quite clear British Coal has made another tremendous leap forward in terms of efficiency'. Last year, 15 pits closed, but the corporation still produced 70.5m tonnes of coal, just 1m tonnes less than the year before. The corporation's improved record will be an important bargaining counter for British Coal as it negotiates important new contracts to sell coal to the electricity generators, National Power and PowerGen, who buy about 80 per cent of the corporation's coal.</p>

			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Why not take a kick at another obsession? Sir, Christopher Dunkley frequently delights in making jibes about religion, his latest (Arts: 'Go tell it to the Martians', December 7) being to speculate about why the media pay so much attention to church affairs when only 2.3 per cent of the population are regular Anglican churchgoers. Leaving aside the fact that most churchgoers are other than Anglican, it is often rightly pointed out that more people go to church on Sunday than to football on Saturday. So why does not Mr Dunkley question the obsession of much of the mass media with football, which receives far greater coverage than church affairs?

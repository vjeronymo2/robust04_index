			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Arts: Glyndebourne's 'Onegin' revisited In the middle of its Glyndebourne run, Eugene Onegin - or 'Yevgeny Onyegin' as Glyndebourne calls it - has been passed to conductor David Angus for a couple of performances while Andrew Davies takes a break. On Monday there was no sense of blurred carbon-copy about the music; it sounded alert, fresh, crisply balanced. Now that Graham Vick's production is thoroughly played in, its cool virtues stand out in relief. (Like Richard Fairman after the first night, I find myself on the qualified-admiration side.) The first act is played as if observed from a detached distance: Vick likes his actors to behave as if in a sober historical film, and nobody is to play directly to the audience for sympathy. As Elena Prokina's Tatyana writes her letter in a bare room, she remains withheld, privately at grips with herself. Her small, natural gestures are extremely touching, like her broken phrases; at the climax, however, the voice is a touch strident, and therefore less expressive - not quite the outpouring of feeling we wanted, just an operatic outburst. Only Martin Thompson's appealing, desperate Lensky (and John Fryatt's ineffable Monsieur Triquet) is allowed off the rein to make his full impression. And that is brusquely extinguished with the duel scene, which we watch through open barn-doors: he and Onegin march out of sight in opposite directions before the fatal shot, and Lensky is of course never seen again. Suddenly he is no more than a old grief of Onegin's, near-forgotten. In productions more generous with feeling, the big formal dances at the start of Act 3 often jar. With Vick's cooller vision, they are hardly more formal than the rest, and he can use them satirically without contradicting the overall tone; in fact he makes a tour de force of them, the better to set off good, decent Prince Gremin's avowal (Frode Olsen is admirable here). As always, Vick insists upon a moral point, and the final scene - Tatyana's rebuff to Onegin - is played to reinforce that, not to let us wallow in sympathy for Onegin or Tatyana. One thing about Angus's conducting: in markedly rhythmic passages, he tried to allow his singers time to round off phrase-ends gracefully - but they pressed on unremittingly, leaving him to catch up. Evidently they were too well-drilled in a tougher reading to bend. I should have liked more bending; but it might not have suited Vick's stern style.</p>

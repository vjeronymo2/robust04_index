			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NEVADA VOTERS TO TAX GOLD MINERS  </P> <P> Voters have overwhelmingly approved a new tax on miners, many of whom are  enjoying a gold bonanza rivaling this state's famed Comstock Lode era.  </P> <P> Voters also approved a plan to double the money Nevada can borrow for new  construction.  </P> <P> The temporary mining tax, which is expected to raise $52 million, won with  107,679 votes to 30,663 in Tuesday's election. Voter turnout was 36%.  </P> <P> Nevada is the nation's leading producer of gold. In the last eight years, mines  here have produced more than 12 million troy ounces of gold with a value of  about $5 billion.  </P> <P> At today's prices, that amount equals the value of all the gold and silver  unearthed in Virginia City during the two-decade Comstock Lode era that began  in the late 1850s.  </P> <P> The mining tax was submitted to voters after a bitter debate in which  Democratic Gov. Bob Miller accused mining industry lobbyists of deceit in  trying to derail his proposal for a tax.  </P></p>

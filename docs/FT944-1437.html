			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Margins under pressure as Brasway rises 20% Brasway, the West Midlands hose and fittings, lubricants and property group, lifted pre-tax profits by 20 per cent in the six months to October 29. However, Mr Mark Swaby, chairman, said there was pressure on margins and further action to cut costs would be taken in the second half. Profits were Pounds 505,000 (Pounds 420,000) giving earnings per share of 0.43p, against 0.36p, and the interim dividend is maintained at 0.24p. A total of 0.53p was paid in 1993-94. Turnover rose to Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 15.3m) but the performance of its divisions was uneven. At Europower, the hose and fittings business, the order intake has been strong. As a market leader, Brasway has been able to impose price rises to ease margin pressure. But it is still seeking productivity improvement through rationalisation at its Whitby and Market Weighton plants. At Excelube, the lubricants company which was responsible for a large part of Brasway's improved 1993-94 profits, business was sluggish in the first quarter, although better in the second. But margins have been squeezed and the company is too small to do more than follow the price lead of the oil majors. Property rents provided the biggest element  - Pounds 252,000  - of the pre-tax profits.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / Polly Peck may face accountancy inquiry The accountancy profession is poised to launch a high level disciplinary inquiry into Polly Peck International, the collapsed conglomerate formerly controlled by Mr Asil Nadir. The joint disciplinary scheme, the most senior regulatory body within the profession, is expected to announce an invest-igation within the next few days. It is likely to concentrate on the role of Stoy Hayward, the accountancy firm which was the principal auditor to Polly Peck. Officials may examine the conduct of any member firms or individual accountants connected to the company. The development comes just over a year after Mr Nadir broke his bail conditions and fled Britain for his native northern Cyprus while facing charges for theft and false accounting totalling Pounds 34m. The joint disciplinary scheme, which represents the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland and the Chartered Association of Certified Accountants, only examines the most serious and public of incidents. It received a substantial blow last month when the House of Lords ruled against it and in favour of accountants Price Waterhouse, which was under inquiry for its audit of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International. In a blow for self-regulation, the Lords supported the court of appeal's ruling that any inquiry by the profession must wait until after civil litigation on the case is completed, which could be into the next century. Just four other investigations are currently underway: into Barlow Clowes, the disgraced fund management group; Ferranti, the electronics group; the Maxwell business empire; and War on Want, the third world charity. Stoy Hayward and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which is under investigation for its audit of the Maxwell companies, are believed to be among several firms considering deferring their responses to the joint disciplinary scheme's inquiries as a result of House of Lords ruling on BCCI.</p>

			<p>920725 FT  25 JUL 92 / The Barcelona Olympics: Power and the glory - but can it continue? - Samaranch's triumph WHAT a homecoming the Barcelona Olympics represents for Juan Antonio Samaranch. The years of self-imposed exile surely will slip away as the Spanish president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) enters the stadium this afternoon wreathed in glory. Undoubtedly, these Games are a triumph for him: no political boycotts, no cash worries, and all staged in his home town. Samaranch, 72, concedes that the death of Franco, the long-time Spanish dictator, in 1975 left him with little future there. Already in late middle-age, Samaranch was associated too closely with the regime to hope that his public life as a diplomat could continue. But his time at the helm of the Lausanne-based IOC has been a brilliant renaissance for this frugal, driven individual. Yet Barcelona could turn out to be a briefly-shining hour. Samaranch will be at the heart of the fiercest politicking in town during the fortnight of the Games. He will have served 12 years as president when his present term ends next year. Will he stand again? Until he announces his decision, his potential heirs will be lobbying and vote-gathering in the corridors of the Princessa Sofia hotel. In this, they will be as fiercely competitive as the athletes down on the track. Students of the IOC constitution - and no organisation loves its protocol and conventions more - are quick to tell you that 'His Excellency' is entitled to stand again. Loyally, they add that he probably would not be challenged should he do so. Among rank-and-file IOC members, merely abstaining from voting on a motion approved by Samaranch is regarded as spine-tinglingly rebellious. Nevertheless, should the king of world sport die - or just fade away - there must be a successor, and key candidates are already jostling for position. Their names will be unknown to most sport fans, but one of them will become the new leader of the 'Olympic family,' a nation-state without a country, the secular equivalent of the Vatican. Within the IOC, everyone's favourite for the race is Canadian lawyer Dick Pound. He has been Samaranch's able lieutenant for a decade, acting willingly as a stormtrooper where the president's role dictates a need for public caution. Pound has played the blunt Anglo-Saxon to his boss's silver-tongued Latin. Aged only 50, the tall, granite-featured Pound has become the second most powerful man within the IOC by virtue of heading the financial negotiations with the world's TV networks for Olympic rights. That the IOC grossed Dollars 1.9bn between 1989 and 1992 is due largely to Pound's commercial acuity. He also works as a lawyer for Adidas and is at the heart of the complex commercial relationships that link the IOC to its commercial agent, ISL, created by the late Horst Dassler. Pound is exceptionally close to Samaranch. As happened to Samaranch during his diplomatic career, though, Pound could find himself associated too closely with the ancien regime. Commentators - including the authors of a controversial recent book, Lords of the Rings, who took a highly-critical view of Samaranch and the Olympic movement - have begun to view its overt commercialism with pragmatic rather than philosophical distaste. Unlike a government or corporation, there is little in the way of checks or balances to counteract the IOC's sweeping powers. Few within the organisation seem to believe there can be too much Olympic money, or even that it could be misdirected. Outside, the perspective is different. Samaranch misjudged badly the world's view of his fiefdom when he attempted to shield and defend Robert Helmick, a lawyer caught lining his pockets in his capacity as a US member of the IOC. Those who found their loyalties jolted by the sophistries that emerged from Lausanne at that time may turn to a somewhat different sort of candidate for president. Pound is, after all, a younger member of the old guard rather than a new broom. Kevan Gosper, an Australian member of the IOC for nearly 20 years and a senior executive with Shell, based in London, is another leading contender. A silver-medal runner at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, he is more independent than Pound within the IOC, but equally respected. Gosper is due to retire next year from his job controlling the Pacific rim for Shell and, at only 59, would have a full 15 years to devote to the Olympic movement. He confirms that he would stand if Samaranch decides to go but adds, firmly: 'He has told us he will make a decision after Barcelona and, should he decide to stay on, he'll get my full support.' Optimistic myopia is virtually a chronic condition within the narrow ranks of the IOC - there are only 92 members - but Gosper seems curiously immune. 'In aggregate, I think there's an impression abroad that we've become less Olympic and too pre-occupied with our administration and financial structure.' There has been recent criticism that TV companies (particularly US networks), having paid millions for the rights to show the Games, have influenced the content and scheduling of events, sometimes to the detriment of competitors. To this, Gosper says: 'We need television to broadcast the Games, but there must be no question of them (the networks) deciding the content or timing of the programmes. I think we need to find a better balance with commercialism.' Of course, it might be that the task of heading the IOC is becoming rather like occupying the White House - an impossible job from which the most suitable candidates shy away. Peter Tallberg, a respected Finnish IOC member, has noted that the IOC presidency is now a position that brings trouble to both the individual and his country. Perhaps Samaranch will go quickly, at the zenith of his power and acclaim. On the other hand, courtiers have never been too strong on advising monarchs about their state of undress.</p>

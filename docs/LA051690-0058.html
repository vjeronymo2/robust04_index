			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: OXNARD;  </P> <P> NEIGHBORS ASSAIL NEW ELECTRIC PLANT  </P> <P> A new electric plant on Diaz Avenue in Oxnard prompted complaints Tuesday from  neighboring business owners who said it has produced excessive noise and  pollutants.  </P> <P> Two business owners in northeast Oxnard asked the City Council to take action  to regulate E.F. Oxnard Inc. Energy Facility, a cogeneration energy plant that  opened last month.  </P> <P> Kevin McCulloch, who owns McCulloch Towing on East 5th Street, told the council  that the plant on Diaz Avenue has been producing excessive noise in recent  weeks.  </P> <P> "I can't even hear the phone ring in my own office," he said.  </P> <P> Last month, when the plant began its start-up phase, steam pipes from the plant  sprayed nearby businesses with a black, ash-like substance, he said.  </P> <P> The plant operators paid to wash the substance off cars that were stored in the  tow yard, McCulloch said.  </P> <P> Another business owner who said he owns property behind the plant said the  high-pitched noise from the plant made him ill.  </P> <P> Plant Manager John Koerber apologized for the noise and told the council that  the plant operators will try to address all the complaints.  </P> <P> Koerber said he is not sure what black substance was emitted from the plant,  but said it might have occurred when high-pressure steam was used to clean out  the plant's pipes.  </P> <P> Councilwoman Dorothy Maron asked the city staff to investigate the complaints  and draft a report for the council's review.  </P> <P> Community Development Director Richard Maggio said complaints about noise are  common during the start-up of an energy plant. But he said the city will  monitor the plant's operation and recommend ways to reduce the noise. HUGO  MARTIN  </P></p>

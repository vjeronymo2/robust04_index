			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / Reuters' news flurry dispels mature image: UK business information group's aggressive return to the acquisition trail has cheered analysts Reuters Holdings may have bought a loss-making business from Citicorp, the US bank, yet the deal has done nothing but good for the business information group's share price. Since it was announced last Thursday, the shares have gained 95p, closing yesterday at a new high of 1920p. The purchase of the data service business fulfils a long-held aim of Reuters  -expansion in US equity markets - and confirms that the UK-based company is not just sitting back on its position in the global financial markets, where it has long dominated foreign exchange trading. Quotron is the latest in a flurry of acquisitions since July, when Reuters spent half its cash mountain on a Pounds 350m share repurchase scheme. Analysts who were concerned last year that Reuters was facing mature markets have been cheered by the group's aggressive return to the acquisition trail. They say the group's record and prospects also compare well with other media companies in a sector which has been uprated recently. Some Reuters acquisitions - such as last month's Dollars 121.5m (Pounds 81.4m) cash purchase of Teknekron Software Systems, a Californian software supplier and systems integrator - are obvious additions to the core business. Other smaller deals represent a 'testing of the water' in emerging areas such as multimedia products. Mr Rob Rowley, Reuters' finance director, heads a small team which for the past 18 months has been looking at new business opportunities. The brief from Mr Peter Job, Reuters' chief executive, was a rigorous appraisal of which of the group's skills had the most value. Mr Rowley says: 'We used to be heavily involved in engineering, designing our own hardware. Increasingly, we buy off the shelf because we can buy things in more cheaply than making them ourselves. We don't want to be in the low-added-value end of the business.' An example of Reuters' more speculative approach is last month's decision to take a Dollars 3m minority stake in AdValue Media technologies, a private New York company which markets interactive transaction services to advertising agencies, sales representatives and media outlets. It was the first deal struck since the formation of Reuters NewMedia, a US-based subsidiary operating in emerging markets for multimedia products. Mr Rowley says of AdValue: 'It is involved in real-time changes in bookings and transactions, an environment we were familiar with.' Reuters has identified television as a potential contributor to its core financial business and as a route into new business areas. The group increased its television interests in 1992 by taking full control of Visnews, the international TV news agency. Last week Reuters announced it would launch a financial TV service for the foreign exchange market around the middle of this year. Traders will have important news events delivered digitally to their trading screens. However - just as in its financial business - Reuters would rather not become over-committed to any particular hardware. Mr Rowley says: 'It would be easy to spend Pounds 200m on a cable TV company - but on a 10-year view, cable will become a utility. We try to avoid looking into the technological void and instead concentrate on developing good products.' He believes that growing familiarity with personal computers has made them more important than television. 'If people become PC-expert at work, they are more likely to use them at home. We aim to exploit these high-value opportunities.' This interest in what products will appeal to prosperous, professional customers helps explain Reuters' recent Pounds 13.3m acquisition of VAMP Health, a private UK company which provides computer services to about 2,000 general practitioners. Mr Rowley says: 'Computers in UK doctors' surgeries is a somewhat limited market, but we'll learn about an industry before we invest large sums of money in it.' When Reuters announced its share repurchase scheme last year, Mr Job said: 'We have absorbed two messages from shareholders: they want us to continue to invest in the business, but they don't want us to invest just for the sake of investing.' Reuters says most of the group's larger acquisitions in the 1980s were relatively successful - such as Instinet, the computerised share trading system, and Rich, the designer of communication systems for trading rooms. But Mr Rowley concedes 'we picked up a few scars along the way. We need to be careful of personality.' He added: 'In the 1980s there was a Reuters culture that we had to own or have effective control - we're much more open-minded now.' Mr Rowley says group capital expenditure was up last year and will grow further, involving both acquisitions and organic growth. 'We have lots of ideas, not necessarily multimedia. Our existing markets are still very exciting. One way people stay ahead is by constantly innovating.' Reuters would certainly invest more in Globex, its electronic futures trading system, if and when the wrangling between the participating international futures markets is sorted out. The UK group has also been promising to respond to the challenge from the products of Bloomberg, the US group which has done so well in the fixed-interest market. However, Mr Rowley has no fears over Reuters' survival in a world which might be dominated by multimedia giants. Recent rumours that it might be a target for takeover by Reed-Elsevier were quickly denied by the Anglo-Dutch publishing group. Mr Rowley merely points out that Reuters' independence is guaranteed by a single 'founder's share', created when the company was floated in 1984. A link-up with a newspaper and magazine publishers such as Reed-Elsevier would take Reuters closer to the mass market - not the differentiated, high-value areas which the group is determined to keep in focus. He says: 'We've no feel of being threatened - we're used to working in an open environment.'

			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CLIPBOARD;  </P> <P> HOW TO ADOPT AN ANIMAL AT THE SANTA ANA ZOO  </P> <P> Always wanted a swamp wallaby? Would you love to have a white-handed gibbon to  call your very own? You can, through the Something Wild animal adoption program  sponsored by the Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo.  </P> <P> The 3-year-old program allows people to choose an animal on exhibit at the zoo  to adopt. Even the animals that roam the grounds, such as peafowls, and the  pond animals -- Japanese koi and western pond turtles -- are available for  adoption.  </P> <P> There are about 75 animals at the zoo, according to Pat Taylor, executive  director of the Friends of the Santa Ana Zoo (a nonprofit agency that creates  awareness of and raises funds for the zoo).  </P> <P> The animals are divided into native land categories, as well as aviary,  barnyard and education animals. They range from the California king snake to  the Toco toucan, from the red-backed squirrel monkey to the African-crested  porcupine.  </P> <P> The adoptions are tax deductible, Taylor said, adding that many people choose  to give the adoption as a gift.  </P> <P> The following lists the six types of adoption and what you receive.  </P> <P> The $50 Walkabout  </P> <P> Your name on the in-park signs in front of your adopted animal for one year  </P> <P> A Certificate of Adoption (suitable for framing)  </P> <P> A Something Wild car window sticker  </P> <P> An invitation to the annual Something Wild picnic  </P> <P> A one-year subscription to Animal Tales, the zoo's bimonthly newsletter and  calendar  </P> <P> The $100 Wildlife Protector  </P> <P> All of the above, plus . . .  </P> <P> Your name displayed in gold letters on a recognition sign indicating your  concern for endangered and threatened wildlife.  </P> <P> The $250 Outback Explorer  </P> <P> All of the above, plus . . .  </P> <P> An invitation to the special Something Wild cocktail party, where you will meet  other zoo "parents" and learn more about wild animals from a noted expert.  </P> <P> The $500 Savanna Club  </P> <P> All of the above, plus . . .  </P> <P> The zookeepers will design a personalized "zoo experience" just for you.

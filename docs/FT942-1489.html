			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / French recovery 'slow and uneven' The French economy is showing signs of improvement, but recovery from recession remains slow, partial and fragile, says the Patronat, France's employers' association. Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, vice-president of the Patronat, said that while the French economy had moved from a period of contraction to growth of 0.5 per cent in the first quarter of the year, a survey of industrial federations and management unions belonging to the employers' association revealed concerns about the strength and composition of recovery. According to Mr Seilliere, a significant minority of companies believed that the economy was still in a phase of stagnation in the first quarter. Most thought the situation was showing improvement in the second quarter, but 71 per cent felt that recovery would be modest. Overall, 65 per cent of companies said they believed the economy was in a phase of fragile recovery while 30 per cent said they did not yet see any recovery. The survey also revealed an uneven pattern of performance across France's industrial sectors. Basic industries including chemicals, paper, metals and steel had seen some improvement. But manufacturers of capital equipment sector continued to suffer persistent weakness of demand. Consumer goods industries, excluding the automobile sector which has benefited from stimulatory government measures, have suffered from a weakness in household spending. Textile companies, however, have partly compensated for this by improved exports. Faced with the uncertain outlook, the Patronat urged support France's economic recovery. These include increased financial support and credits for exporters, funding for trade promotion in overseas markets, assistance for small and medium-sized companies facing financial difficulties and tax incentives to revive investment. According to the Patronat, measures to support investment are increasingly important because of the upward pressure on long-term interest rates resulting from the falls in the bond market.</p>

			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Nigeria's crude truths The oil market is taking a fairly sanguine view about Nigeria. The Brent crude price, which shot up to Dollars 19 a barrel at the start of the month when worries about the oil workers' strike were at their peak, has fallen back below Dollars 17. Traders are heartened by the fact that the strike has cut Nigerian supply by only about 20 per cent. With the political crisis in Nigeria worsening, such an analysis may look complacent. In the worst case, the ethnic rivalry now being stoked up between the Yoruba tribe from the south and the Hausas from the north could spill over into civil war. Even if this can be avoided, the negotiating positions of General Sani Abacha and Chief Moshood Abiola are so entrenched that an early resolution of the conflict is unlikely. Nevertheless, there is hard-nosed realism in the oil market's analysis. So far the strikers have been treated relatively leniently. But so dependent is Gen Abacha's regime on oil revenues that stepped-up strike action is likely to provoke tougher measures to keep the oil flowing. And the government's ability to achieve this should not be doubted. Angola, which managed to expand oil production sharply during its civil war, is a telling parallel. Further supply shocks in Nigeria would of course affect crude prices but a bigger determinant is likely to be what happens to world oil demand. After signs that US demand was flagging in July, the latest figures show it picking up. If the stronger economic growth in continental Europe spills over into oil demand, Brent could push up to Dollars 19 again.</p>

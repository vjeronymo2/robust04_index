			<p>910425 FT  25 APR 91 / Survey of the Electricity Industry (9): Pressures mounting - The US IT SOUNDS like the antithesis of capitalism: in several US states electricity supply companies can now raise their profits by persuading customers not to buy their product. The move is part of an energy conservation effort that underlines the severe economic and environmental pressures facing the US supply industry in an era of increasing competition, rising anti-pollution costs and huge capital spending demands. A combination of all these forces has started to produce a merger wave in the highly fragmented industry. Since the early 1970s, US electric power utilities have been battered by a combination of rising costs and increasing regulation on pricing, new plant construction and other issues. Many are still paying for the nuclear power plants ordered in the 1970s but then, abandoned or not, built on time or to cost. According to the Edison Electric Institute, an industry body, the companies are producing an average return on equity of about 10 per cent, compared with the 13 per cent that state regulatory commissions usually allow. Foremost among the new challenges facing them now is the cost of complying with last year's Clean Air Act which mandates that sulphur dioxide emissions, a key component of acid rain, be reduced at coal-fired power stations by about half by the end of the decade. Utilities make some 60 per cent of their power from coal and they have two choices in complying with the legislation. They can switch from burning soft, high sulphur coal to hard coal, but this will push up transport costs. Alternatively, they can install expensive flue gas desulphurisation systems, otherwise known as scrubbers, or experiment with newer technologies such as fluidised bed combustion. The Edison Institute says that meeting the demands of the act will cost the industry up to Dollars 105bn (Pounds 58.60bn) by 2010. In addition to modifying old plant, the industry is going to have to build much new capacity over the next 10 to 20 years to replace old plant and meet new demand. It is expected to add more than 90,000 net megawatts of new capacity by the end of the 1990s. Several factors have made the business climate more helpful to non-utility companies which wish to generate power. The Bush administration, keen to foster competition in the wholesale power market, has proposed in its recently unveiled energy strategy to remove 55-year-old restrictions on companies owning independent power stations. The Public Utility Holding Act of 1935 has kept industrial companies out of the power business and prevented utilities from building generating plant outside their territories and then selling that power on the open market. Other groups have been free to jump into this market: the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978 opened the door for small producers of alternative energy to sell power on the open market. Repeal of the 1935 law has stirred up controversy within the utility industry, with some wanting the freedom to build stations around the country and others unhappy at the presence of independents in their areas. Federal regulators also want changes in control of utilities' transmission lines. At present, while the utilities are required by law to buy power from independents, they control the electricity after that. The regulators would like to allow the independents to find their own customers. That has brought howls of outrage from the industry, which argues that the interlopers will simply steal their best clients. All these factors are forcing some radical changes on the industry. The more far-sighted utilities have been slashing costs and many have set up their own independent power ventures. They have also turned to management of the demand side through energy saving, prompted by changes in the regulatory climate: regulators have begun to offer the companies a return on their energy savings outlays which is broadly the same as the investment they have been making in power plants. The rule changes - instituted in states such as Massachusetts, New York and California - have turned conservation from a costly chore for the utilities into some of their most profitable operations. The so-called 'megawatt' business involves handing out to customers efficient new equipment and sharing in the savings by charging higher rates. The trend has brought together some unusual bedfellows, with conservationists pleased that this means less power station construction and utilities pleased that they are spared the capital costs of new facilities. The new competitive pressures are forcing the utilities to consider the once-outrageous suggestion that they should get together in mergers. There has been a rash of bids over the past year, including the industry's first important hostile offer, when Kansas City Power &amp; Light made a run at neighbouring Kansas Gas and Electric. Behind the merger wave lies a drive for greater efficiency. Mr Edward Tirello, an analyst at Smith, Barney Harris Upham, and a long-time merger advocate, estimates that about Dollars 3.6bn of annual cost savings for the industry could be generated through more economic and efficient operation of plant. The largest economies from consolidation would come from pooling - the ability to use a more economic generating plant mix in the consolidated service area during periods of low demand. The long hand of the regulators could slow down this movement. Only last month officials of the California Public Utilities Commission dealt a heavy, though not yet fatal, blow to the 1988 proposed merger of South California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric, which would create the largest utility in the nation. The officials agreed that the deal would provide about Dollars 1bn of benefits to customers but complained that its anti-competitive impact outweighed this.</p>

			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL'S DECISION TO TURN AWAY PREGNANT WOMEN  </P> <P> After reading Vance Gardner's "Taking Responsibility for Medical Care" (June  11), I want to state that I have no problem whatsoever seeing to it that my tax  dollars go to aid the health of indigent or elderly people who are in need.  </P> <P> But I resent having to subsidize indigent Hispanic women who seem to think that  their mission in life is to bear more and more children. Not only are these  women unable to support themselves but they cannot support those kids.  </P> <P> We are no longer living at a time when infant mortality was high and many  children were needed to see if any survive to take care of aging parents.  Enough is enough!  </P> <P> JOE GAGE  </P> <P> Villa Park  </P></p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Investment trusts eye US: Industry delegation to press for changes in protectionist law Representatives of the UK investment trust industry arrive in the US today to press for legislative changes that would allow investment trust shares to be sold to US investors. A delegation from the Association of Investment Trust Companies will lobby for changes to a protectionist law of 1940 which makes it almost impossible for shares in foreign investment companies to be sold in the US. The law in effect requires foreign investment companies to operate as US companies under US regulation. Only 19 have ever managed to comply, all of them Canadian. Unsuccessful attempts have been made in the past to overcome the obstacle. Mr Ernest Fenton, the association's director-general, said there were signs that the new administration was more amenable to dismantling protectionist barriers. A possible solution is for US authorities to recognise UK regulation as being of an equivalent standard to the US, without requiring compliance with exactly the same rules. Mr Patrick Gifford, chairman of Fleming Investment Management and a member of the association's delegation, said that expanding into the US market would not only give UK investment trusts a wider potential investor base, but might also make it feasible to launch new funds for which the UK market alone would not provide sufficient demand. Mr Fenton said one attraction of UK investment trusts for US investors was that while many US closed-end funds trade at substantial premiums to asset value, UK funds normally trade at discounts or very small premiums. Additionally, UK investment houses could offer greater expertise in certain specialist areas than their US counterparts. Even without changes to the 1940 act, it is possible that investment trusts could issue American Depositary Receipts which are traded like shares on US stock exchanges. However, these could be bought only by qualified institutional buyers, not private individuals. There are a number of other obstacles such as differences in the personal tax system. US investment trusts distribute all realised capital gains while UK ones do not. Private investors holding UK investment trust shares would be taxed on the undistributed gains, causing possible cashflow problems. Also, it could be hazardous for UK investment trusts to become too popular with US pension funds because US pension protection legislation has extraterritorial provisions.</p>

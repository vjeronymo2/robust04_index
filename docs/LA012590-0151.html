			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DYMALLY LINKED TO DIAMOND IMPORTER;  </P> <P> CONGRESS: LAWMAKER WITHDREW SUPPORT OF SOUTH AFRICA SANCTIONS. BUSINESSMAN  LATER DONATED $34,200 TO CALIFORNIAN'S SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.  </P> <P> Rep. Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) took a leading role in the fight for stiff  sanctions against South Africa in February, 1987, when he introduced  legislation to ban U.S. imports of South African diamonds.  </P> <P> He continued to support strong diamond sanctions as late as March, 1988. But in  April of that year, Dymally changed course. Accepting arguments that his  initial bill was unworkable and unfair, he proposed changes to pending  sanctions legislation to weaken its impact on diamond importers in this  country.  </P> <P> Dymally's change of heart followed a meeting in his Washington office with New  York diamond importer Maurice Tempelsman, a buyer of uncut South African  diamonds whose business could have been crippled by stiff sanctions. The  lawmaker offered an amendment drafted by Tempelsman's lobbyist, Howard Marlowe,  according to Marlowe. The amendment, which effectively headed off such  sanctions, was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.  </P> <P> Two months later, Tempelsman donated $34,200 to support a Dymally scholarship  program for minority students. Later in 1988, after the donation, Dymally  agreed to lobby his colleagues to support other changes that Tempelsman wanted  in the sanctions bill.  </P> <P> A Dymally aide solicited the donation from Tempelsman when his lobbyist first  sought a meeting with Dymally to discuss diamond sanctions in April, 1988,  according to an account by Marlowe.  </P> <P> The House later approved a version of the amendment drafted by Marlowe and  backed by Dymally. It called for a study of the enforceability of diamond  sanctions and headed off the policy change that Tempelsman opposed: a  requirement that importers of uncut diamonds certify that they did not come  from South Africa. In March, Dymally had proposed just such a requirement.  </P> <P> Two months after meeting with Dymally, Tempelsman donated $34,200 to the Ana G.  Mendez Foundation that was used to fund the 1988 Mervyn M. Dymally Young  Minority Scholars Program, according to Jose Mendez, foundation president. That  was the amount suggested to Tempelsman in a prospectus sent to him by Amelia  Parker, a Dymally aide.  </P> <P> The Mendez foundation set aside part of Tempelsman's $34,200 to pay  "honoraria," according to a 1988 foundation document. Dymally reported  receiving a $2,000 honorarium from the Mendez foundation in July, 1988.  </P> <P> The bulk of the gift financed trips by 14 minority students from Dymally's  California congressional district to Puerto Rico for four weeks of academic  work.  </P> <P> Dymally declined to be interviewed, and did not respond to repeated queries  from a reporter this month. In response to a summary of this article delivered  to him Tuesday, Dymally on Wednesday sent a one-page statement to the  Washington Post in which he said he did not "solicit contributions from Mr.  Tempelsman."  </P> <P> Dymally also said that the amendment he backed to soften the sanctions was  based on the unenforceability of diamond sanctions against South Africa, the  opposition of other House members and a desire not to hurt Botswana, another  African country that exports diamonds.  </P> <P> According to House rules, members may not accept from a person with a direct  interest in legislation "favors or benefits . . . under circumstances which  might be construed by reasonable persons as influencing the performance of  governmental duties."  </P> <P> How to distinguish between behavior covered by this rule and ordinary  cooperation with interest groups or constituents who also make political  contributions or give honorariums to members is a matter of ongoing debate in  Washington.  </P> <P> In a five-page reply to questions about these events, Tempelsman wrote: "I do  not fault Congressman Dymally for bringing the foundation to my attention or  for sponsoring the participation of a group of California students in the  foundation's science program.  </P> <P> "At no time did he so much as hint that a contribution from me to the  foundation would affect his position on the diamond sanctions or any other  matter."  </P></p>

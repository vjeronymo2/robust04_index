Quantity of lamps in package.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> There was no disagreement with the proposal to require the disclosure on packages of the number of bulbs contained in the package if there were more than one. This requirement, therefore, appears in the final labeling rules. See &sect;305.11(e)(1)(A)(i) in ``Text of Amendments,'' below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Supplemental Disclosure Options  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To supplement the disclosures of wattage, light output and laboratory life, the Commission proposed in the NPR requiring disclosure of an efficiency measure of each lamp's performance. The Commission proposed two alternatives for primary consideration: (1) An energy efficiency measure such as lumens per watt; and (2) a disclosure of the estimated energy cost of the lamp based on a specified unit energy cost and usage period. The NPR also described similar suggestions made by ACEEE and NEMA. As is further set forth below, the Commission has concluded that neither a lumens-per-watt disclosure nor an operating cost disclosure is likely to increase consumers' abilities to choose the most efficient lamp for their needs. Instead, the Commission has concluded that the basic information required to be disclosed should be supplemented by the Advisory Disclosure described in Part IV.C.2.c, below.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Energy index.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission explained in the NPR that a lumens-per-watt disclosure ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , the ``Energy Index'' that had been suggested by NEMA), which would rate the efficiency of a lamp product in converting electric energy into light output, has the advantage of simplicity. It pointed out, however, that such a disclosure could suffer from the drawback identified by ACEEE ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , because higher wattage bulbs often have disproportionately greater light output, they often will use more energy as well as have a better energy index). Thus, a lumens-per-watt disclosure alone could lead to lumen and watt over-purchasing. The Commission inquired whether this drawback could be avoided by requiring that the Energy Index be accompanied by a disclosure such as: ``Select the light output you require before comparing the energy index of different bulbs.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Most of the comments supported requiring a disclosure of the energy efficiency of lamp products in the form of lumens per watt and that it be called an ``energy index.'' <FOOTCITE>94</FOOTCITE>  One participant compared this to a miles per gallon disclosure for gasoline, which consumers presumably understand. <FOOTCITE>95</FOOTCITE>  Although consumers could otherwise ascertain the information from the separately required disclosures of lumens and watts, the energy index reduces this information to a single figure. <FOOTCITE>96</FOOTCITE>  Several comments favoring this disclosure also recommended that it be no less than 50% of the size of the light output disclosure and that it be accompanied by a definition or explanation of its meaning on the same or another panel. <FOOTCITE>97</FOOTCITE>  Two comments recommended that the Commission require disclosure of a ``range'' of energy indices for available general service incandescent lamps and compact fluorescent lamps like those the Commission requires for other products under the Appliance Labeling Rule, with the performance of the labeled lamp indicated on the range. <FOOTCITE>98</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 94 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> NEMA, G&hyph;3, 34&hyph;35, (Supp.), G&hyph;10, 12;

Although support was expressed in the rulemaking proceeding for this proposal, disclosing such an index could result in consumers purchasing more watts than they need. This overbuying may occur because a lumens-per-watt index will rise with wattage of incandescent lamps. Thus, a consumer who buys the lamp with the highest lumens-per-watt index may select a lamp that has a higher than required light output and wattage. For example, overbuying may occur if a consumer selects a 100-watt incandescent lamp with a 17 lumens-per-watt index as a replacement for a 60-watt incandescent lamp with a 14 lumens-per-watt index or a 75-watt incandescent lamp with a 16 lumens-per-watt index.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An energy index based on lumens per watt also could confuse consumers who understand correctly that higher wattage lamps use more energy. Because a lumens-per-watt index tends to increase with the wattage of incandescent lamps, these consumers might be led to believe that lamps with higher energy index numbers generally cost more to operate. In that event, the much higher energy index numbers that would appear on the labels of compact fluorescent lamps actually could mislead some consumers into believing that these lamps were less energy efficient.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

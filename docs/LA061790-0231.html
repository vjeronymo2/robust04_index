			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> Correction Appended  </P> <P> WESTERN DIGITAL PULLS TOGETHER  </P> <P> Roger W. Johnson believes in corporate togetherness.  </P> <P> So much so that the chairman and chief executive of Western Digital Corp.,  which makes circuit boards, disk drives and other electronic innards for  personal computers, is moving his company's decision-makers and chip designers  into a house that Johnson built: a gleaming headquarters that springs up 14  stories in the Irvine Spectrum business park.  </P> <P> By corralling the company's executives, engineers and designers in one spot,  Johnson hopes to overcome traditional rivalries that block innovation. This new  sense of togetherness is especially important for Western Digital, which  employs a motley crew of chip architects brought together by six acquisitions  over the past five years. The concept is also the key to setting the company  apart from its competitors.  </P> <P> Johnson wants to instill in Western Digital's culture his idea of  "interarchitecture," or designing and manufacturing a family of electronic  parts to work together so that the net result is better overall computer  performance than if they were built independently.  </P> <P> But he knows that it will take more than fancy terms like interarchitecture and  a splashy new building to sway outside skeptics who think the latest  incarnation of 20-year-old Western Digital is a crazy collection of companies  bound by aimless acquisitions.  </P> <P> While the company's financial performance has improved this year, some industry  observers criticize Western Digital management for spending too much time  acquiring companies instead of executing its business. And by trying to be all  things to all computer manufacturers, Western Digital, they fear, may only make  itself vulnerable to competitors in each of its five business categories.  </P> <P> "It's too early to claim a victory for Western Digital's strategy," said Steven  Ossad, an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "They are having  a change in fortunes, but a lot remains to be seen. They've been a  disappointment before."  </P> <P> Says Johnson: "We've spent time swallowing acquisitions. Now we have to  execute."  </P> <P> To be sure, Johnson's scheme for gathering various pieces of the production  process at a single site is not original.  </P> <P> Other manufacturers, such as Hewlett-Packard Co. and Apple Computer Inc., have  designed new products by combining resources from all levels of the company,  said Jim Mottern, a manufacturing with the accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Young  in Irvine.  </P> <P> Johnson isn't straying from his no-nonsense management style to follow the  likes of flashier Silicon Valley executives such as Steve Jobs, the Apple  Computer co-founder who is now chairman of NeXT Inc. Rather, Johnson, whose  conservative approach matches the dark three-piece suits he favors, believes  the togetherness concept will bring Western Digital operating efficiencies.  Companies that have pursued it found that they can get products to market much  more quickly and cut development costs, Mottern said.  </P> <P> "We're all going to be a lot closer together (in the new headquarters), and  inter-architecture should be a lot easier," said Kathryn A. Braun, senior vice  president and general manager of Western Digital's largest division. "People  were skeptical about it at first, but they're learning that we all have to be  headed in the same creative direction."  </P> <P> Johnson also hopes that the new headquarters will be a symbol that bolsters the  stature of Western Digital. The company's circuit boards and disk drives make  possible smaller and faster computers, yet its name remains largely  unrecognized outside the industry because it doesn't make consumer products,  such as personal computers.  </P> <P> Western Digital's financial performance about a year ago didn't help the image.  The company's earnings suffered last year, the result of a slow PC market and  the cost of absorbing several acquisitions. The company lost $2.7 million in  its fiscal 1990 first quarter ended Sept. 30, 1989, and laid off 950 people --  or 12% of its work force.  </P> <P> Earnings have bounced back for the past two quarters, but the first-quarter  deficit will hold profits below last year's levels. For the first nine months  of the current year, the company earned $14.7 million on revenue of $776.6  million, compared with earnings of $30 million and revenue of $748.6 million a  year earlier.  </P> <P> Analysts are estimating earnings of $20 million to $25 million for the fiscal  year ending June 30, and Western Digital is expected for the first time this  year to top $1 billion in revenue.  </P> <P> "The financial performance (in the past few years) has been bumpy," said David  W. Schafer, vice president of worldwide sales. "It's not so hard to understand,  but it's painful that people on Wall Street didn't see what we were up to. It's  becoming clear now."  </P> <P> While not everyone on Wall Street is sold on Western Digital's strategy, most  analysts agree that the Irvine firm is at a transition point in its history.  Its stock has risen sharply on persisting rumors of some big contracts from  International Business Machines Corp. "I think they have made excellent  progress in turning around their business and their image in the past two  quarters," said Edmund C. Spelman, analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New  York. "There is a healthy degree of skepticism because of their erratic track  record, but they aren't promising more than they can deliver."  </P> <P> While Western Digital's financial recovery can be attributed in part to  improving conditions in the PC industry, Johnson believes that the company also  is beginning finally to reap the benefits of a strategy he put in place when he  joined the firm in 1982.  </P> <P> Johnson's plan from the start was to assemble a collection of computer  component suppliers and make Western Digital a one-stop supermarket for  personal computer makers worldwide. This strategy was intended to help Western  Digital in two ways.  </P> <P> The company could gain efficiencies from co-manufacturing the various products  and then packaging the products together and selling them at reduced costs to  PC makers. And once it owned each of the component businesses, it could develop  an advantage over competitors through interarchitecture.  </P> <P> To expand into the computer graphics market, Western Digital acquired Paradise  Systems in 1986 and Verticom Inc. in 1988. To strengthen its business in  devices that control data storage, the company acquired Adaptive Data Systems  in 1987, and it entered the business of making core logic chips that control  communication between computer peripherals and the central processing unit with  the 1987 purchase of Faraday Electronics Inc. It moved into the fast-growing  market for networks that link PCs, printers and related equipment by buying  ViaNetix Inc. in 1987. And finally, by buying Tandon Corp.'s disk drive  business in 1988, the company entered the intelligent disk drive business.  </P> <P> Johnson says Western Digital remains unique among PC components manufacturers  because of the wide array of products it makes. On a value basis, they account  for about 50% of the cost of a PC's parts. The only parts it doesn't make are  the central processing chip and mass memory chips.  </P> <P> To a casual observer, Western Digital's acquisitions might look like a  hodgepodge of loosely connected companies. But Johnson said the businesses  share much in common: They are in markets where success means exploiting  advances in semiconductor design.  </P> <P> And in that respect, Johnson says, his company has a leg up on its competitors  through its alliance with AT&amp;T Corp. in which AT&amp;T makes  state-of-the-art chips for Western Digital.  </P> <P> But Western Digital has been careful not to become overly dependent on  AT&amp;T. So Johnson is building a $119-million wafer fabrication manufacturing  plant in Irvine that is scheduled to open in January.  </P> <P> The core logic chips introduced by Western Digital in March allowed the company  to integrate the functions of more than 30 chips into three. The Western  Digital-designed chips are faster when used together than when they are used  with non-Western Digital products, making them the first products that exhibit  interarchitecture.  </P> <P> "For the first time, our parts are all designed by Western Digital people,"  Johnson said. "We've been planning to get into this position for eight years.  We think we have built an engine that will give us an inherent advantage over  our competitors."  </P> <P> Some skeptics, such as Montgomery Securities' Ossad, say there is little  concrete evidence that Johnson's business strategy or inter-architecture plan  will give the company a competitive advantage over such Silicon Valley rivals  as Conner Peripherals, a disk drive maker, or Chips &amp; Technologies, which  makes core logic chips that control communication between computer peripherals  and the central processing unit.  </P> <P> Western Digital's challenge is to get each of its major product lines  profitable at once, but that's easier said than done because of fierce  competition in each area. As Braun put it, "If all Roger's kids can perform in  the same quarter, we would blow Wall Street away."  </P> <P> The task is made more difficult by a lack of industry design standards and the  need to redesign the same components for different types of computers, such as  laptops or workstations.  </P> <P> The disk drive business, for example, has been a particularly volatile segment  of the industry with thin profit margins. But disk drives are quickly becoming  Western Digital's bread-and-butter business, accounting for 37% of its sales  now compared to 8% in fiscal 1987.  </P> <P> Despite its growing dependence on disk drive sales, Western Digital was  hampered in its efforts to become a major player in the field when it was slow  to develop a line of 3.5-inch "intelligent" disk drives. The delay allowed  Conner Peripherals to grab a bigger share of the market, said Crawford Del  Prete, an analyst at International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.  </P> <P> But Del Prete said Western Digital has performed a good balancing act in making  the transition to more profitable, higher-capacity disk drives and is in a good  position to enter the next generation 2.5-inch disk drive market, examples of  which are expected to hit the market in the next two years.  </P> <P> Analysts say it will take more than two consecutive profitable quarters to  persuade them that the seesaw days are over at the Irvine computer company.  </P> <P> The company says last year's layoffs were the last tasks in eliminating  duplication from its many acquisitions. Almost as quickly as its fortunes sank,  Western Digital recovered and its employment has grown to 7,500, above the  pre-layoff level of 7,000 in April, 1989.  </P> <P> "This company looks like it's on the verge of a turnaround," said Richard L.  Whittington, an analyst at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. "But looks aren't  everything. I'd like to see them report good results for three to five quarters  in a row."  </P> <P> With 50% of its business overseas and sales to all personal computer  manufacturers except Apple Computer, the company is no longer dependent on any  one source or geographic region for its future well-being. In addition, the  business is balanced between computer manufacturers, accounting for 62% of  sales, and resellers, which provide 38% of revenue.  </P> <P> And analysts are encouraged by the company's ability to reduce inventories and  debt despite a heavy capital spending program that includes building a new  semiconductor plant.  </P> <P> Although the domestic PC market is not expected to grow as quickly as it did in  the early 1980s, Johnson believes that the unification of Western European  markets after 1992 and political liberalization in Eastern Europe offer  opportunities for increased sales abroad.  </P> <P> Johnson said the days of big acquisitions are behind Western Digital, but that  doesn't mean the company will not dabble in new markets. Eventually, Johnson  believes Western Digital components will be used not just in PCs but also in a  range of consumer electronics products.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Western Digital has been attracting attention recently because of  rumors that it has been awarded a large contract to manufacture IBM's  long-expected notebook-size computer. Western Digital and IBM refused to  comment on any such deal.  </P> <P> But, last month, Western Digital announced a cross-licensing agreement with  IBM, and company officials have been dropping hints that the company has won  some major design coups. And rumors of an IBM deal have helped Western  Digital's stock, which reached a 52-week high of $14.75 per share on Thursday,  but fell to $14.25 at Friday's close.  </P> <P> Phil Devin, an analyst for market researcher Dataquest in San Jose, said he  expects an announcement during the next several months that Western Digital  will manufacture IBM's notebook computer.  </P> <P> If Western Digital has beaten its competitors to the IBM deal, analysts say it  would be proof that Johnson's strategy, particularly the interarchitecture  approach to chip design, is beginning to pay off.  </P> <P> Buying into the PC  </P> <P> Western Digital has parlayed its success as a maker of disk-storage circuitry  into a billion-dollar-a-year business. Chairman Roger W. Johnson's strategy has  been to acquire component manufacturers and weld diverse technologies into a  unified PC architecture.  </P> <P> A.

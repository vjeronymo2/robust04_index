First,  there is the economic recession and economic collapse. Given  mutual support it will be possible to achieve the restoration of  the old economic links and the establishment of new ones. Given  mutual support and mutual solidarity and active help from the  West it will be possible to make 1994 the beginning of economic  recovery, the revival of all our economic life and on that basis  an improvement in social conditions for each citizen of our  countries.    Second, I have in the past had occasion to say that after  the  end of the cold war and the disintegration of the Soviet Union  aggressive and bellicose separatism would become the main threat  to peace and stability in various parts of the globe. We have  experienced for ourselves what separatism means. It means  thousands of people killed and shot dead and hundreds thousands  of refugees. It means genocide and ethnic cleansing in actual  reality. It seems to me that in 1994 we shall be able to  achieve a real breakthrough in the fight against this evil and  establish peace and stability in our countries.    Third, in recent years much has been said about the threat  of  approaching dictatorship and the revival of fascism. In  Ashgabat it seemed to me that we have now realized the whole  stern reality of the reconstruction of fascism, the spread of  fascism. Once we have realized this I am confident that we  shall beat fascism and beat this 20th Century plague. It seems  to me that 1994 will be a crucial year in the fight against  fascism.    Success in these three areas will bring peace and prosperity  to each family within our independent and free states. I wish  you happiness and prosperity. Thank you.</p>

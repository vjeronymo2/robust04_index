			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. ARMS TALKS ENVOY DEFENDS VERIFICATION STAND  </P> <P> Chief U.S. arms negotiator Richard R. Burt declared Tuesday that the Bush  Administration's proposals to seek ways of verifying any reduction in strategic  arms should accelerate steps toward such an agreement in the talks here.  </P> <P> He denied that the Administration, after a long review of the START  negotiations, had decided to slow progress toward a treaty in favor of pushing  the conventional arms talks in Vienna.  </P> <P> "There is no higher priority" than the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks, Burt  said, echoing the statement President Bush made in Washington on Monday as the  new round of talks began here.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Insists on No Linkage  </P> <P> Burt, who comes to the arms post after serving as ambassador to West Germany,  also insisted that there be no linkage between a START agreement and the  Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) of then-President Ronald Reagan, popularly  known as "Star Wars."  </P> <P> "We do not think the START agreement should be held hostage to agreements on  space or our legal rights to SDI," Burt said.  </P> <P> This position placed the United States in direct opposition to the view  enunciated Monday by the chief Soviet negotiator, Yuri K. Nazarkin, who  indicated that agreement on limiting nuclear missiles is contingent on  adherence to the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Under that agreement, the  Soviet negotiators argue, the United States is not allowed to test or deploy  weapons in space.  </P> <P> In 10 sessions of bargaining over four years, the United States and the Soviet  Union have completed an estimated 80% to 90% of a strategic arms treaty aimed  at reducing the number of their intercontinental nuclear missiles by 50%.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Emphasis on Verification  </P> <P> After its review of the negotiations, the Bush Administration announced Monday  that it wants to put new emphasis on finding ways to verify long-range nuclear  arms cuts, perhaps even before completing a treaty.  </P> <P> Burt said the United States is not presenting this emphasis on verification on  a take-it-or-leave it basis. Rather, he said, the United States is seeking  realistic verification procedures in order "to win the necessary political  support" in Congress.  </P> <P> He said that "verification is not the centerpiece of the talks but a  component," adding: "We see this as expediting our purpose (to reach an  accord), not to slow down the process but the opposite. We want to make as much  progress as we can."  </P> <P> Burt declined to estimate the time needed to reach an accord on a START treaty,  declaring, "In this business, we don't talk about time frames."  </P></p>

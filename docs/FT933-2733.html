			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Tax windfall helps soften budget deficit A TAX windfall from the tobacco industry and repayments of debt by local authorities were behind a lower-than-expected budget deficit last month, the government said yesterday. The gap between public spending and revenues in August was Pounds 3.54bn, compared with City expectations of about Pounds 3.7bn. The seasonally adjusted figure brings the deficit for the first five months of the financial year to Pounds 18.4bn, 28 per cent up on the Pounds 14.4bn at the same time last year. The figures are roughly in line with Treasury estimates that borrowing for the full financial year will come to Pounds 50bn, up from Pounds 36.5bn last year and Pounds 13.7bn in 1991-92. Customs and Excise duties in August were boosted by an extra Pounds 400m in tobacco duty resulting from a delayed price increase. Also the overall deficit was contained by local authorities repaying Pounds 762m in August, with repayments from public corporations totalling an additional Pounds 521m. However, the government borrowed Pounds 4.56bn, compared with Pounds 1.49bn in July and Pounds 3.96bn in August last year. Cash receipts by the government came to Pounds 15.6bn last month and Pounds 82.4bn for the first five months of 1993-94, an increase of 3 per cent on the Pounds 79.7bn collected in the equivalent period last year. Government spending was Pounds 20.4bn in August and Pounds 101.4bn in the five-month period. This was 7 per cent up on the Pounds 94.9bn spent in the first five months of 1992-93. Tax revenues suffered last month from a Pounds 5m net refund by the government to companies on previously paid corporation tax. However, August is normally a poor month for corporation tax revenues. The overall borrowing figure benefited from privatisation revenues of Pounds 138m, arising from sales to the public of the third tranche of shares in British Telecommunications. Excluding privatisation proceeds, borrowing for the first five months of the financial year came to Pounds 21.9bn, after Pounds 17.8bn in the equivalent period last year.</p>

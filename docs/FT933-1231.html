			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (2): Investors flex their muscles - Financial markets / Hard-pressed governments, lured by the attractions of global money, may find that the political price is embarrassingly high WITHIN THE past few weeks a number of governments of member states of the European Community have experienced the power of today's free-wheeling global capital markets. The European Monetary System has effectively collapsed and several governments have had to abandon pledges on exchange rates. Global money is attractive but dangerous. On the one hand, the international capital market has offered hard-pressed governments an attractive opportunity to raise capital. It might, for instance, have been much harder for countries such as France, the UK and Spain to sustain large budget deficits without the ability to sell bonds in large volumes to international investors. On the other hand, the global investors impose a price. If a country's economic policies are not attractive to them they will attack first the short-term financial markets, with pressure on the currency, and second they will withdraw support from government bonds. For developed countries these constraints can be politically embarrassing but by no means fatal. But in the third world the choices are often harsher. Many governments of developing countries have in fact regarded the global capital market as no more than an unacceptable arm of economic imperialism. But in cutting themselves off to secure political independence they have often condemned themselves to the economic backwaters. Now, many developing countries are at last embracing the dangerous opportunities offered by international capital. In terms of equities, large volumes of money are flowing into so-called 'emerging markets' and even certain third world debt securities, for instance in South America, are finding international takers. There may be a very long-term cycle to all this. Global capital flowed freely across borders in the 19th century, when the City of London was financing railroads in North America, mines in Africa and ranches in Argentina. The risks turned out to be fairly high. Investors in South American bonds, for instance, were usually the victims of default - a lesson which banks relearned in the 1970s. By the time of the first world war the barriers were going up, and episodes of hyperinflation and depression in the inter-war period had a negative effect. When the second world war followed, cross-border flows were almost completely snuffed out, and most international assets of European countries had to be sold to meet war debts, or were forfeited. For a long time afterwards a capital-starved Europe hoarded its resources behind a system of controls on capital movements. But these were steadily dismantled, especially in the 1980s, as more liberal philosophies became dominant. Moreover, the opportunities for investment in Europe have diminished as the economic growth rate has slowed. As in the 19th century, the best opportunities for high returns are seen to be in the developing world, probably in the east rather than in the west. How big is the international capital market? There are various ways of measuring it, but a recent research paper from the London securities house NatWest Markets starts from the proposition that the total resources of the international financial institutions are of the order of Dollars 14,000bn. Of these institutions the most important are those in the US, Japan and the UK. The degree of international diversification varies substantially, from 25 per cent for UK pension funds to about 5 per cent for their US counterparts. UK funds are not changing their allocations much at present, and the US funds are at the centre of the stage. They are rapidly increasing their overseas investments, which on some expectations will eventually rise to the 10-12 per cent range. According to the US consultants InterSec Research the value of US tax-exempt assets with international mandates rose from Dollars 154bn to nearly Dollars 200bn in the first half of 1993. Certainly, big flows are now being seen. The latest available figures, for the first quarter of 1993, show that American investors poured Dollars 22bn into overseas bonds and some Dollars 6bn into foreign equities, with an emphasis on Europe. On the other hand, Japanese institutions have been fairly quiet recently, whereas in the late 1980s they became huge buyers of international bonds, especially US Treasury securities. There are three strands to this cross-border activity. The dominant motivation is a search for geographical diversification in developed countries, with global portfolio managers seeking a balanced exposure to the US, Europe and Japan. Second, there is the desire for investors in mature economies to seek higher returns, albeit with more risk, in faster-growing areas. The movements of funds are comparatively small as a proportion of global cross-border flows, but in absolute terms, in the context of individual third world markets, the sums can loom large. In the first quarter of this year US bond investors put almost Dollars 800m net into Mexico, for instance. As for equities, US funds allocated some Dollars 900m to the Hong Kong stock market in the three-month period, and were also net investors in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico and Korea to the extent of Dollars 200m or Dollars 300m in each case. Hong Kong now has a market capitalisation of about 1.6 per cent of the FT-Actuaries World Index. Retail investors are also being drawn into so-called emerging markets funds which are being launched by more and more institutions - with a new one in the UK from Mercury Asset Management last month, for instance. Such funds tend to emphasise the high growth rates of parts of the developing world. The MAM launch publicity quoted IMF forecasts that economic growth in the emerging markets will reach 6 per cent over the coming five years compared with a mere 2 1/2 per cent in the developed world. The third motivation for cross-border flows relates to tax or politics. For instance, a few years ago Japanese life assurance companies were being urged to buy vast quantities of US bonds to offset US-Japanese trade imbalances. A current example is the big flow of German retail savings into Luxembourg to escape withholding tax. Such flows can be substantial for a time, but usually prove temporary. For the time being, the tide remains strongly in favour of internationalisation of the capital markets. The message that capital can be better employed elsewhere is not one governments like to hear. Similarly, the ability of the free-wheeling markets to impose their judgments on the politicians can be resented. But the politicians are on the defensive and global investors have gained the upper hand.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------        NET PURCHASES OF FOREIGN STOCKS BY US INVESTORS (DOLLARS M)                         IN FIRST QUARTER OF 1993  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                Equities         Bonds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPE                                            3,889        13,268  European Community                               2,392        12,066   Belgium/Luxembourg                                158           122   Denmark                                           (42)          109   France                                            117           680   Germany                                           204            15   Greece                                             10            (5)   Ireland                                          (112)          312   Italy                                             285           275   Netherlands                                        70         1,933   Portugal                                           (3)          (20)   Spain                                             102           342   UK                                              1,603         8,303  Switzerland                                        224          (176) CANADA                                            1,261         6,962 LATIN AMERICA &amp; CARIBBEAN                         1,291        (1,514)  Argentina                                          213  Brazil                                             331  Mexico                                             291           796 ASIA                                              2,715          (456)  Hong Kong                                          929  Japan                                            1,676           606  Korea                                              210 OTHER                                              (749)          752  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOTAL ALL COUNTRIES                               8,407        19,012  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: US Treasury and Securities Industry Association  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    PORTFOLIO FLOWS - NET PURCHASES OF FOREIGN SECURITIES (DOLLARS BN)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                              1989       1990       1991      1992  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- United States   bonds                       6.0       23.3      16.8       18.8   equities                   13.1        8.3      31.1       32.4 Japan   bonds                      94.1       28.9      68.2       35.6   equities                   17.9        6.3       3.6       -3.0 Germany   bonds                      25.0       14.8      14.5       42.5   equities                    1.6       -0.3*      1.4        1.4 United Kingdom   bonds                      34.0       27.3      28.7       61.1   equities                   24.1        0.9      21.5       -4.1*  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- *Net repatriation  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: NatWest Securities  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

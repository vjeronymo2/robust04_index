			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Chill in the air of US-Soviet relations: Superpower diplomacy has taken a turn for the worse It is not a hot war nor a return of the cold war,' says Mr Georgy Arbatov, the grand old man of US-Soviet diplomacy and still head of the US-Canada Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. 'But I do see a worsening of relations between the US and Russia.' Mr Arbatov was speaking yesterday two days after President Boris Yeltsin sounded an ominous note when he said he feared the US Republican congressional victory would 'embitter' relations between the two states, and then went on to call for stronger armed forces to cope with a rising threat of conflict. It was not an isolated remark. 'There is a growing anti-American, anti-western mood among our politicians,' says Mr Arbatov. 'The circumstances of the last election (in December 1993) with the failure of economic reform pushed upon us by the IMF and others and the growth of crime, mean that we have a very powerful nationalist wing.' This has influenced all political rhetoric for over a year - and it is gaining strength. Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the once fiercely pro-American foreign minister, now attacks the US for failing to respond to his initiative to persuade Iraq to recognise Kuwait's independence by lifting sanctions, and for halting the enforcement of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Moslems. The spreading of Nato into eastern Europe through the Partnership for Peace has not been accepted, even though Russia itself joined the system. Mr Sergei Karaganov, a prominent foreign policy adviser, said yesterday that to 'prevent or at least postpone the taking of the decision to increase the size of Nato' is the main task facing Russian diplomacy at next month's Budapest Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe. This is the body which Russia wants to promote in Nato's place. The west and its institutions are no longer objects of official hate, but they do excite general suspicion: there is little or nothing left of an earlier feeling of gratitude towards the US and the west in general for welcoming and assisting the democratisation and reform process. Mr Arbatov dismisses as 'small change in today's conditions' the Dollars 3bn in US aid to Russia - and though he admits that President Bill Clinton's early meeting with Mr Yeltsin in Vancouver in March 1993 was an important gesture, he believes the US president is now weak and hobbled, and unable to reach out to Russia even if he wishes to. Mr Andrei Kortunov, one of the leading younger policy analysts at Mr Arbatov's institute, agrees that the significance of the US elections is not so much that the republicans won but that right-wing, isolationist and strongly anti-Soviet republicans won, like Mr Jesse Helms, thought certain to be chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. 'And one must say, if these people are looking for faults in the way in which aid has been administered to Russia they will find rich material.' Mr Kortunov says the understanding extended to Russia by the Clinton administration - heavily criticised by today's resurgent Republicans for putting 'Russia first' - will now end. That probably means, for example, that Russia's constant complaint that it cannot observe the terms of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty it signed with some 30 countries, because it needs to strengthen the armour of its southern forces, will be unheeded and its breach of the treaty will become a major issue. Besides, he says, the Republicans will have 1996 in their mind - the year of the next US presidential elections, and also the year when Mr Yeltsin must step down, or run again. They will thus, he argues, have much less interest in supporting Mr Yeltsin. 'They will instead be looking for a relationship with the next Russian president, in the ranks of the opposition.' 'The problem here,' says Mr Graham Allison, former US assistant secretary of state for defence and now a consultant to the Defence Department, 'is that where you have a partisan battle going on between the Republicans and the president you tend to get attention focused on second and third order issues between the US and Russia where there will be conflict and people forget about the first order issues where there are common interests.' But neither Mr Arbatov nor Mr Allison - with some experience of each other's defence establishments - believe the chilling need be serious. Mr Arbatov says that in the Middle East, a historic battleground for states who were in part superpower proxies, the interests of Russia and the US are firmly for peace - 'in our case', says Mr Arbatov, 'because we want our debts which these countries have with us to be repaid'. 'There is a normalisation of the relationship going on,' says Mr Allison, 'and that will continue. There is no need to deny we have different interests. There is no need to have constant big symbolic events. Our real state interests dictate co-operation. People in both countries are beyond thinking of each other as the enemy.'</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Lonrho faces shareholder criticism LONRHO, the international trading conglomerate, is facing calls from some of its biggest shareholders for changes in its corporate governance as a consultancy published a report containing criticisms of the group. Pensions Investment Research Consultants (PIRC), an adviser to the pension funds with investments in Lonrho, has called for the appointment of four 'high-calibre' non-executives; a change to the company's memorandum and articles to provide for the election of all directors; and the creation of an independent pay committee. Some of Lonrho's institutional shareholders expressed support for PIRC's proposals. Ms Ann Simpson, PIRC's joint managing director, said: 'All the major issues affecting the share price have been removed from the process of accountability. Some of the group's biggest shareholders have told us of their dismay at the group's inability to respond.' On Friday, Lonrho's share price fell to a six-year low of 95p after a spate of bad news. Lonrho does not believe PIRC to be representative of its shareholders, which include a high proportion of small shareholders. PIRC is recommending that Lonrho's shareholders set a deadline for the company to comply with guidelines set by the Institutional Shareholders Committee arguing for the appointment of independent non-executive directors to its board. Failing this, PIRC says shareholders should put forward their own candidates for election. It also recommends that shareholders question management about the group's articles of association which exclude Mr Tiny Rowland, chief executive, aged 74, from the need to seek re-election. Postel Investment Management, an institutional shareholder, has been arguing that all directors over 70 should be up for re-election every year. In light of Mr Rowland's salary increase from Pounds 1.53m to Pounds 1.6m against a fall in Lonrho's pre-tax profits, PIRC calls for the creation of an independent pay committee.</p>

			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Freedom delayed for German hostages THE whereabouts of two German aid workers, the last western hostages in Beirut, remained unclear yesterday despite announcements that they were being freed, writes Lara Marlowe in Beirut. Mr Bernd Schmidbauer, the personal emissary of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, kept his appointment with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi where he had expected to receive Mr Heinrich Struebig and Mr Thomas Kemptner, whose release was announced by the Iranian news agency on Monday night. A statement from the kidnappers had promised the Germans would be turned over at Mr Hrawi's residence. It was widely held that the two spent Monday night at Syrian military headquarters in Beirut. Responsibility for the delay was widely attributed to Damascus. Mr Schmidbauer thanked Mr Hrawi and Lebanese officials for 'their valuable support' in freeing the Germans. But he pointedly failed to thank the governments of Syria and Iran.</p>

			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1994 - Office Automation (25): An end to the paper-chase - Insurance industry applications / A big investment in automation has paid dividends for a small insurance firm Document image processing and work flow automation have made quite an impact on insurance company Motor Claims Services (MCS). They have streamlined and imposed discipline on working methods to speed up the handling of claims, halved paper and telephone costs and enabled the company to expand without moving to bigger offices. Insurance companies of all sizes are awash with paper and have been prime targets for document systems suppliers. MCS was set up in 1988 by broker Bennetts Group with three staff and moved to document image processing when it outgrew its claims management system (and the supplier went out of business) in the early 1990s. MCS insures against risks not normally covered by motor insurance. These range from car hire costs to legal expenses and the pursuit of civil actions in cases of injury. MCS has 18 staff at its Reading offices handling 10,000 claims a year and issuing 200,000 policies. It expects to grow to 500,000 policies in two years. MCS chose the Stormforce system from Mitre Technology, partly on price and partly on the recommendation of its auditors, who had already worked with Mitre. MCS now has a system including a central Hewlett-Packard Unix processor running Mitre's Stormforce document management and work flow software and an Informix database management system. Stormforce can access client data held in the database. The system serves 20 personal computers, a Fujitsu document scanner and three laser printers. The contract, including consultancy and training, cost Pounds 250,000 - quite an outlay for a company which typically charges premiums of about Pounds 10 on those 200,000 policies. But the impact has been quite dramatic and the company is considering adding more facilities. - 'a year ago we had 16 filing cabinets, six feet high and four feet wide,' says Mr David Green, admin and systems manager. 'Today, we have six - and the number is still falling. 'Once, we had sheer mountains of paper and every piece went through several moves. Someone would open the post, find the appropriate files, take them to the case handlers, who would generate letters which would go to the typing area and then back to the handlers and eventually into the files and back to the filing clerks. 'All this paper-chasing might take a day or two and during that time it was difficult to find where a file was, which meant delays in dealing with clients' calls.' Today, says Mr Green, 'we now store absolutely everything on the system, from incoming correspondence, diagrams and photographs, which are all scanned in, to brief details of phone calls, even if it's just a call asking for a reply to a letter. Once documents are scanned in, we keep the physical copies for just seven days, simply as a precaution. The only documents kept for longer are those that might be needed in court. 'When staff log-in each day, the system gives them a list of tasks which are due on specific claims. They can review the entire history of a claim, all the documents, correspondence and phone calls, and can generate standard letters, without moving from their desks. These daily reminders force people to do the most pressing tasks, while the quick access to documents helps them to do those tasks. Previously, people would have a pile of papers on their desks and tasks would gradually work their way up to the top. 'Claims are handled much more quickly. That means we have more satisfied customers and we cut costs, because the more chasing and monitoring we have to do, the more it costs us.' He adds: 'Our paper costs have been cut by half, partly because we used to keep a paper copy of every letter that went out,' says David Green. 'Photocopying costs have also fallen. Phone bills have been reduced, because the information is always on hand and we don't have to hunt out files and call people back.' MCS is now planning to provide fax links to and from the system, reducing use of paper even further - 'at present, we have to scan in incoming faxes and we print documents simply to put them through a fax machine, which is silly,' says David Green. 'If we can send and receive directly through the system we can speed everything through even more quickly. Stormforce This is a document imaging and work flow management system with fax links and automatic generation of standard letters. It was introduced in October 1992 and is on release 2.3. Hardware and operating systems: Unix and IBM-type personal computers running Windows. Supplier: Mitre Technology, part of K2, a UK computing services group. K2 was formed in1988. K2's latest results show that it grew 72 per cent to a turnover of Pounds 4.3m and operating profit grew 64 per cent to Pounds 201,000. It has 48 staff. Sales and support are direct from the company in Watford.</p>

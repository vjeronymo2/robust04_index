			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Lilian Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, April 29 (CNA)--Vice Economic Affairs  Minister Sheu Ke-sheng will lead a delegation to the United  States next month to attend the second round of tariff talks  between Taipei and Washington under the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT) framework.    At the top of the agenda during the May 12-13 talks will be  the size or Taiwan's tariff cuts, revisions to Taiwan's alcohol  and tobacco monopoly system, government procurement agreements,  and the opening of Taiwan's agricultural markets.    In addition, sources said that the United States will soon  submit a list of tariff requests for Taiwan's service industry.  The U.S. is expected to ask Taiwan to open its transportation,  telecommunications, banking, stock and futures markets.    Economics Ministry officials said they hope the two sides  will reach an agreement during the talks, which will then  encourage other countries to hold bilateral tariff talks with  Taiwan.    The successful conclusion of Taipei-Washington talks will  also facilitate Taiwan's bid to enter the world trade body, the  officials said.    After the first round of talks in Taipei, Taiwan agreed to  reduce tariffs on some of the 699 farm and industrial products  on a U.S. list within the near future. Other reductions will  come later after revisions of related laws and regulations,  according to the Board of Foreign Trade.    Sheu will leave for the United States May 9. After the  talks, he will travel to Geneva where he will attend the fifth  meeting of the GATT working party responsible for reviewing  Taiwan's bid to enter into the world trade body.    Sheu is expected to hold tariff talks with Mexico and Canada  during the meeting.    Taiwan was granted GATT observer status in September 1992  and  hopes to become a full member by the end of this year.</p>

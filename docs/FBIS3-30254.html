			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] The Chamber of Counties of the Croatian Assembly  today adopted a statement on the implementation of foreign  policy, expressing its support for a joint declaration of the  Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  Here is a report by Jasenka Dudic and Kreso Zadravec on the  statement and the course of the session, which was addressed by  Mate Granic, Croatian deputy prime minister and minister of  foreign affairs:    [Dudic] The Geneva declaration is in accordance with  fundamental efforts of the international community and the EU  action plan, is in line with the essence of President Tudjman's  peace initiative, and is a concrete step in its implementation.  This is what the Chamber of Counties says, among other things,  in its statement. In the statement, the declaration was  assessed as a step toward mutual recognition of the two  sovereign states, a decisive act for the permanent resolution of  the crisis, and a path leading toward a political solution for  the temporarily occupied parts of Croatian territories. This is  leading toward the final and unconditional incorporation of UN  Protected Areas into the Republic of Croatia.    The declaration will not only contribute to the  normalization  of the situation and to relations between the countries that are  signatories to it, but also to the beginning of general  normalization, which is a precondition for the establishment of  the new world order and the promotion of stability and security  in the whole of the southeastern part of Europe. An important  initial step on that path is the open recognition of all states  within their legitimate international borders in accordance with  the UN Charter and basic CSCE documents.    In the statement, the Chamber of Counties calls on the  Bosnian Muslims unconditionally and immediately to halt their  offensive actions against Croat-populated areas, particularly in  central Bosnia. Otherwise, the Chamber holds that the  government and the president of the Republic ought to analyze  and reexamine the current situation in diplomatic relations  between the Republic of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina and, in  accordance with the assessment of this situation, take  appropriate steps.    Alongside the condemnation of all misdeeds, crimes, and acts  in contravention of the law on international war and the  humanitarian law, in its statement the Chamber of Counties  encourages the Croatian Government to do everything in  diplomatic, political, humanitarian, and all other areas to  secure the continuous presence and the normal life of the Croats  in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The statement was adopted with 38 votes against. A separate  statement was adopted by the club of deputies of the Croatian  Social and Liberal Party [HSLS], Croatian Peasants' Party,  Istrian Democratic Alliance, Social-Democratic Party, and  Croatian People's Party.    I am sorry that, despite all our efforts, we did not succeed  in formulating a joint statement that would be acceptable to the  deputies' club of the HSLS, Granic said in his address to the  deputies. He explained the important objectives of Croatian  foreign policy.    These are, first of all, to reintegrate the occupied  territories into the state system of the Republic of Croatia, to  resolve the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina in such a way that the  survival and equality of Croats is guaranteed, to have  good-neighborly relations with all states, and to integrate  Croatia into European and world processes.    Granic stressed that the current situation in the occupied  territories is untenable, since the Serbs have completed ethnic  cleansing and do not respect the human rights of Croats;  however, opting to liberate the occupied territories militarily  would cause great casualties and, probably, the international  isolation of Croatia. This is why Croatia opted for the  strategy of negotiation, in order to first establish  communication and to resolve humanitarian and other questions,  which should eventually bring about a peaceful reintegration of  the temporarily occupied territories into the Croatian state  system, Granic said. He added:    [Begin Granic recording] This path, which includes primarily  peacemaking and a peaceful option, does not -- at the end of the  day -- exclude any methods of achieving the final goal: the  goal of a completely free Republic of Croatia. We shall try to  do our utmost, however, to exhaust the peaceful option and to  get the international community's support for it.    As regards Bosnia-Herzegovina, this means that lasting  relations between Croats and Muslims should be established, that  all confrontation should stop immediately, and that the  Bosnian-Muslim state should develop as a secular state,  acceptable to Europe, to its entire environment. Croats should  also stay in their areas, with their safety and development  guaranteed. [end recording] [passage omitted]</p>

			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> LOCAL ELECTIONS;  </P> <P> KEY'S BID TO UNLOCK VOTES TO OUST MCCARTY IN DISTRICT 7 SEEMS DOOMED  </P> <P> To mention unassuming, mild-mannered San Diego City Councilwoman Judy McCarty  and "The Godfather" in the same breath seems thoroughly incongruous, yet  McCarty's campaign consultant does just that to summarize her 7th District  reelection campaign.  </P> <P> "Whenever I think of Judy, I'm reminded of a line from 'The Godfather,' " said  John Kern, who was McCarty's City Hall administrative assistant before leaving  to start his own consulting firm. "The line is, 'Your friends should always  underestimate your virtues, and your enemies should always overestimate your  faults.' That's the way it is with Judy.  </P> <P> "Because for someone who's been taken lightly, she's put together a pretty  impressive record. And, for someone who was considered a pretty easy target  this year, she drove nine people out of this race before it even began."  </P> <P> Indeed, early this year, McCarty's critics approached many community leaders  throughout the 7th District, trying to find a strong challenger to block her  bid for a second four-year term. Not only did each person approached decline to  run, but some reported the entreaty to McCarty, who could only chuckle that her  opponents "don't even know who my friends are."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 11th-Hour Opposition  </P> <P> Until shortly before the filing deadline, it appeared that McCarty might be the  first council incumbent in nearly two decades to run unopposed. Although  retired firefighter Kenneth Key entered the race at the eleventh hour, he is  regarded as little more than token opposition for McCarty in the sprawling  northern district, which includes the College area near San Diego State  University, Allied Gardens, Grantville, Del Cerro, San Carlos, Tierrasanta and  the Lake Murray area.  </P> <P> With only two candidates on the ballot, the 7th District contest is the only  one of the four council races that appears guaranteed to conclude in next  Tuesday's primary. Under the new district-only election system, a candidate can  avoid a November runoff by getting more than 50% of the primary vote.  </P> <P> Viewing complacency and overconfidence as their major obstacles, McCarty's  backers have waged an aggressive, well-funded campaign designed to produce the  landslide victory widely expected of her. Though Key has raised less than  $6,000, McCarty will end up spending about $120,000 -- a 20-1 disparity that  Kern characterizes not so much as political overkill as necessity to meet the  high expectations of an easy win.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Battling Perceptions  </P> <P> If the perception of the campaign as a race more in theory than in fact  concerns McCarty, it is even more troublesome for Key, a 52-year-old Allied  Gardens Democrat in his first race for public office. With most voters paying  only cursory attention to an election predicted to draw less than a 20%  turnout, Key's task of persuading them to share his view of McCarty as  ineffectual, overly cozy with developers and preoccupied with her own community  of San Carlos, to the detriment of the rest of the district, is all the more  difficult.  </P> <P> "Mrs. McCarty has done nothing to improve major problems such as drugs and  traffic, and, on other issues, her actions have actually made things worse,"  Key said. "Like some others on the council, she's very beholden to developers,  and her votes show that."  </P> <P> To her supporters, however, McCarty, a former aide to then-Assemblyman, now  state Sen. Larry Stirling (R-San Diego), is the archetypical  citizen-politician. Professing disinterest in higher office, the low-keyed,  soft-spoken McCarty describes herself as "just plain Judy from San Carlos."  </P> <P> Having once described City Hall as being "like the PTA -- only the people are  not as friendly," the 49-year-old McCarty approaches her job with a  common-sense simplicity that has led critics to accuse her of lacking a deep  understanding of complex issues.  </P> <P> As highlights of her first term, the Republican councilwoman points to her role  in securing funding for the completion of California 52 and three major  connector roads or highways, the purchase of Rancho Mission Canyon and the  addition of 680 acres to Mission Trails Regional Park, and pushing for creation  of the Metropolitan Sewage Task Force, which is reviewing city plans to build a  secondary-sewage treatment plant.  </P> <P> Though she usually sides with the council's pro-growth majority, McCarty also  co-authored, along with Councilman Bob Filner, a compromise growth-management  plan. Rated as the council's third-worst member on growth issues by the Sierra  Club, McCarty opposed the city's unsuccessful effort to halt the toxic-burning  Ogden plant in La Jolla and supported the proposed SANDER trash-burning  project, which has been withdrawn.  </P> <P> However, environmentalists also applaud her strong support of recycling  programs, water reclamation and plans to eliminate products that contain  ozone-damaging fluorocarbons. She also led the fight to preserve landscaping on  California 163 through Balboa Park, causing state transportation officials to  back away from a plan to remove trees because of concerns over the state's  liability in accidents.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Detractors' Perspective  </P> <P> But, from her detractors' perspective, McCarty's own actions have undermined  the very goals she espouses. Peter Navarro, chairman of Prevent Los  Angelization Now, charged that McCarty has "gutted" growth-management measures  and initially "walked blindly" into a plan that would have established "a  dangerous precedent" by permitting a major Tierrasanta developer to shift costs  for public facilities such as roads and sewer lines to home buyers. After a  community uproar, McCarty and the council reversed positions and opposed the  plan.  </P> <P> Key has blamed McCarty for the eviction of a group of seniors from a city-owned  campground at Hollins Lake in order to replace the habitat of an endangered  bird displaced by the California 52 extension. McCarty, though, notes that the  highway would not have been completed otherwise, adding that an improved  campground will be built with state funds.  </P> <P> Key's own platform includes proposals to revamp Navy ships to use as jails to  help ease the county's longstanding jail crowding, and to alleviate parking  woes near SDSU by having students park at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and  take a shuttle to campus. As a corollary to the latter proposal, Key favors  expediting the timetable for extending the trolley from Old Town to the  stadium.  </P> <P> Lacking the funds to match the half-dozen mailers sent to voters by McCarty,  Key has been forced to rely on simpler tactics, such as having supporters stand  along roadsides with signs urging people to "Help Unlock City Hall . . . with  Key." He also draws encouragement from his striking resemblance to country  singer Kenny Rogers, describing his facial features as "one of my real  attributes in this campaign."  </P> <P> Barring a major upset, however, the blues may be more indicative of what lies  ahead for Key on Election Day.  </P></p>

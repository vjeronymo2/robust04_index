			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Buenos Aires LA NACION in Spanbish on 10  January 1994 publishes on page 15 an 800-word report on an  interview with French economist Philippe Revault d'Allonney by  Ernesto De Paola and Cristian Mira. The report notes that the  Northern Electricity Company (Edenor) will invest $100 million  in 1994 to upgrade networks and service. According to  d'Allonney, president of Argentine Electricity (EASA), the  private consortium that took over Edenor, the company will show  a profit in 1994 if things go as planned. "We knew we would have  losses in the first two or three years," explains d'Allonney."We  are very close to breaking even and are certain that we will  show our first month of profit before the middle of the year."  The quality of service, he predicts, will "gradually" reach the  same level as in France.</p>

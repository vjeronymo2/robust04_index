			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Smadar Peri: "This Is How the Palestinian Shin </F> Bet Will Operate"]    [Text] Israel has opposed the involvement of Amin al-Hindi  in the Gaza-Jericho talks, claiming that his hands are smeared  with the blood of the 11 Israeli athletes massacred in Munich.  Now al-Hindi is the strongest man in the Palestinian secret  intelligence services.    Al-Hindi, one of the returned deportees, was born in Gaza 45  years ago. His job as the head of the PLO's intelligence  apparatus in Tunis has provided him with considerable power and  exposed him to very sensitive information. He was in charge of  the interrogation of 'Adnan Yasin, the Mosad agent uncovered  less than a year ago in Abu-Mazin's [Mahmud 'Abbas] office, and  was involved in dozens of discrete investigations and the  gathering of intelligence material on personages and  institutions in the Arab world and Europe.    Al-Hindi crossed at the Rafah border terminal three weeks  ago  accompanied by a large number of Palestinian bodyguards who  prevented all attempts to photograph the man put in charge of  the overt and covert Palestinian intelligence services in the  territories.    After rumors spread that al-Hindi was involved in  interrogations, pursuits, and initiating intelligence activity  in the Gaza Strip, he was very quickly dubbed "the bad man."  Indeed, he has full authority to detain, interrogate,  incarcerate, and make use of all the means he deems necessary to  achieve calm in the Gaza Strip. For the time being he is not  dealing with Jericho, where the routine security problems are  much simpler.    Immediately upon his arrival in Gaza, the Israeli media  reported that al-Hindi wasted no time in entering office. He  summoned to his office a group of senior Palestinian police  officers and asked them to update him on the situation.    The first conclusion that can be drawn from that meeting is  that we are not dealing here with a Palestinian police force,  but rather with units of military soldiers and officers.  'Arafat himself proved this point when he surprisingly replaced  Ziyad al-Atrash, the Palestinian liaison officer, with  'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, head of the Palestine Liberation Army.  'Arafat did not offer any explanation for this move. One can  hazard the assessment, however, that 'Arafat did not approve of  the close cooperation between al- Atrash and Brigadier General  Yom-Tov Sami', the Israeli officer who worked opposite him.  Perhaps al-Atrash was bad mouthed in Tunis, and venomous  comments were directed to the all too receptive 'Arafat.    Like all Middle East leaders, 'Arafat is crazy about  classified documents, is in love of briefings, enthralled by  intelligence information -- even if it amounts to nothing more  than morsels. He is especially enamored by information provided  by the uniformed men who were brought to Gaza and Jericho from  Arab countries, where they have resided in the shadow of local  armies: Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco, Iraq, Libya, and Sudan.  There are new faces in the area who obey their commanders and  wear ironed uniforms. None of them have read the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, and they have not received a precise description of  what they are supposed to do.    The mission given by 'Arafat to al-Hindi -- his intelligence  affairs confidant -- is not simple. First, he must prepare the  ground for the chairman's arrival in the territories and make  sure there will be no "bad surprises" such as an attempt to harm  'Arafat and his entourage during his visit in Gaza and Jericho.  Beyond this, 'Arafat has put al-Hindi at the head of a pyramid  of five overt and covert intelligence networks.    Al-Hindi pulls all the strings. He has to maneuver between  intelligence services incited against each other by 'Arafat  through devious means and by remote control from Tunis.    Al-Hindi, who compares his status to that of the Israeli  Mosad chief, has arrived from Tunis with a well-oiled and  organized intelligence apparatus. He is surrounded by some 200  to 300 agents, among them field agents, intelligence-gathering  personnel, researchers, analysts, and intelligence  implementation experts. This group, which is very close to  al-Hindi, is keeping a low profile. In addition to these  associates and his bodyguards, al-Hindi has transferred to his  Gaza Strip offices an incalculable treasure: computers and  boxes of disks including the PLO's intelligence archives, which  includes thousands of names and tens of thousands of details.  Only a handful of people know where to locate this rare archive  which took years of hard labor to amass.    Under the umbrella organization of the Muhabarat 'Amma  (general intelligence) we can find Muhammad Dahlan in the Gaza  Strip and Jibril al-Rujub in the Jericho area. Al-Rujub, who is  in love with the media, initially refused to limit his efforts  to Jericho, until Israel limited his freedom of movement in  order to curtail his operations over the entire West Bank.  Al-Rujub brought with him from Tunis a dozen of well-trained  intelligence officers, and until his movements were limited he  managed to recruit local intelligence- gathering officers.    Dahlan, who is in charge of the Gaza Strip intelligence  services, prefers to maintain a much lower profile than  al-Rujub. Two local clans hold a grudge against him for the  murder of Shaykh As'ad al-Saftawi and another figure suspected  of cooperation with Israel. Dahlan, who since his deportation  from the Gaza Strip has led the al-Shabibah -- Fatah's youth  movement -- via facsimile machines, is a much less frightening  figure than he was in the past.    Dahlan's main rival is Muhammad Sakir, whose life over the  last three decades has already become something of a legend.  Sakir, who surfaced in Gaza only 10 days ago, holds the title  of "head of the general security service," a title that al-Rujub  and Dahlan begrudge him. Before his arrival the journalists  were told that during the 27 years in which he was a fugitive he  has managed to move from one hiding place to another while  carrying out terrorist activities, and that he has never left  the Gaza Strip. Not everybody is convinced by this story.  There are those who are willing to swear that a completely  different version regarding his real whereabouts during this  period will be uncovered soon.    Using his "divide and rule" tactics not only on the  political  level, but also on his newly formed intelligence community,  'Arafat has explained to Sakir that he is putting him in charge  of al-Rujub and Dahlan. These two, who are much younger than  Sakir, are making no bones about their opposition to the  appointment of Sakir over them.    The third body among the general Palestinian security and  intelligence services is the Amn al-Ri'asah, or president's  security. Nobody has yet been put in charge of the elite force  -- which will include Force-17 members -- which will be in  charge of 'Arafat's life. The name most frequently mentioned is  that of Abu-al-Za'im ['Atallah 'Atallah], who after a quarrel  with 'Arafat defected to Jordan and who has been residing in  Cairo over the last few years.    Abu-al-Za'im has made no secrets about his desire to head  the  Amn al-Ri'asah again, and 'Arafat has summoned him at least  twice to Tunis to check the extent of his support for the  agreement and his determination to exert firm control over the  force. 'Arafat, however, does not regard Abu-al-Za'im as the  only candidate for this sensitive post.    The fourth body among the Palestinian services is the  police force under Nasir Yusuf's command. Like the Israel  Police, this force deals with criminal offenses, violence,  theft, drug abuse, and preventive action against undesirable  developments. The police intelligence must report to al-Hindi,  who in turn reports to Tunis.    The fifth, and for the time the last body is "special  intelligence." 'Arafat gave this elite unit the job of snooping  around the other intelligence networks in the Gaza Strip and the  West Bank. The members of this unit have to report to al-Hindi,  but are also permitted to phone directly to the PLO chief in  Tunis.    It is interesting to note that the PLO's intelligence and  secret service community in the territories has been copied from  the Arab multifaceted model. This is how this community  operates in Beirut, in Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Tehran: A  combination of compartmentalization and secrecy, with each  network invading the jurisdiction of the other, all this with  the knowledge and supervision of the chief.    At least three of the Palestinian intelligence bodies have  recently entered a wild internal competition for solving two  murder cases: The murder of two IDF [Israel Defense Forces]  soldiers at the Erez checkpoint two weeks ago, and the murder of  two Palestinian civilians suspected of having been Israeli  collaborators.    For Amin al-Hindi this is a matter of professional pride and  prestige; he has to prove to himself, to 'Arafat, and to Israel  that he can control the area and conduct things in a  professional manner. He has to prove that he is no less  proficient than his Israeli counterpart.    So far al-Hindi's performance appears to be very impressive  and he is receiving good grades. Those who follow his  performance are also taking into account the time factor: Only  three weeks have passed since he entered his complicated office,  which is only made more complicated by the clause named 'Arafat,  who is not making al- Hindi's life any easier.    How is Palestinian intelligence operating? What is on the  agenda of the secret intelligence services? It transpires that  half of the very busy daily agendas of the three top men --  al-Hindi, Dahlan, and al-Rujub -- is occupied with dialogues  with Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad  members, as well as with members of Ahmad Jibril's and Nayif  Hawatimah's rejectionist organizations.    The rest of their time is occupied with guarding potential  trouble spots: The Gaza Strip refugee camps, mosques, the  central areas of the Jericho enclave, and the passages between  Jericho and the Gaza Strip. They also make certain that no harm  comes to the settlers, for example, in the Jewish synagogue in  Jericho.    So far, they have scored quite a success on the ground.  Spokesmen for Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement], for example,  announced their divorce from violent activity and their  intention to become an opposition party. In a determinant and  unequivocal campaign, al-Hindi has managed to stop calls of  instigation by Hamas and Islamic Jihad preachers at the Friday  prayers at the mosques.    The presence of the new forces in the Gaza Strip has already  created an additional change. The Palestinian policemen who  arrived from Tunis behave in Gaza as they had in their previous  place of residence: They drink alcohol, woo women, and look for  fun. Changes on the ground have become visible: Local women  allow themselves to walk down the streets without a veil and are  no longer afraid to cruise the beaches.    "We are on hold for now," the Hamas spokesmen admit,  "studying the situation." One of them, Mahmud al-Zahhar, a  spokesman for the returned deportees, last week revealed that  his men have decided to declare a temporary timeout in  inter-Palestinian terror. They are also waiting to see how many  prisoners Israel will release and who they will be.    The current tension between Hamas and the Palestinian police  is referred to as a dormant volcano. If this continues, they  say with satisfaction, there is room for optimism. Yet, if the  shortage of money and medication continues, if no real changes  take place in living conditions in the refugee camps, and if  foreign investors call off their plans to turn the Gaza Strip  into the Singapore of the Middle East everything will collapse.  Hamas will gain power, the refugee camps will become sources of  unrest, and the big frustration will burst out in violence  against Israelis.    Two weeks ago, Nabil Sha'th and Dr. Zuhdi al-Nashashibi came  to Gaza with $5,000 -- a first U.S. grant to pay the policemen's  wages. Initial reports indicate there is a deliberate class  distinction: A Palestinian policeman/soldier will be paid $400  a month; a senior Palestinian police officer receives between  $1,000 and $1,200 a month.    According to 'Arafat's explicit guidance, the wages will  only  be paid to the "men from abroad." After he threatened not to  come to the territories before the donor countries act on their  promises, allowing him to pay all the policemen, 'Arafat is  creating a total disassociation between "local" and "foreign  PLO" in the territories. Senior posts will be given to only  returning Palestinians.    Is this logical? It certainly is. 'Arafat learned from  Saddam Husayn. Paying a salary and taking care of your  subordinate's needs ensures loyalty to the employer. The  locals, whose intentions 'Arafat doubts, will have to make do on  their own until the big money comes from abroad. 'Arafat wants  to see his intelligence men well fed and free of material  problems.    In the Gaza Strip last week they suspected that, though he  is  not in perfect health, 'Arafat in his twisted ways decided to  act ill and spread rumors about a graver illness than the one he  actually suffers from in order to once again postpone his  arrival in Gaza and Jericho.    And, if the Palestinian Shin Bet believes that 'Arafat is  really afraid of coming to the territories, our intelligence  community believes that before his arrival, al-Hindi will take  steps in advance to garner the most support possible from his  own camp, as well as from us, to protect himself against  surprises.</p>

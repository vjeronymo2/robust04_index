			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special Feature" by Hong Fei (7703 7378)] </F>   [Text] The levying of the value-added land tax by the  Chinese Government beginning from 1 January this year has evoked  strong repercussions among real estate circles in Hong Kong and  Taiwan. Some people pointed out that the tax rate is too high,  it hits both speculators and honest businessmen, and if  developers make no profits, they will be compelled to give up  their development plans. In the middle of January, a Hong Kong  delegation consisting of 30 people (including real estate  businessmen, surveyors, lawyers, and accountants), went to  Beijing to air their views and to ask the authorities not to go  too far in levying the value-added land tax, but to ensure  appropriate profits for honest Hong Kong developers.    According to the "Provisional Regulations on Value-Added  Land  Tax," anyone who transfers real estate and earns an income shall  pay tax on the added value according to the regulations. The  regulations state that four progressive rates shall be applied  in levying the value-added land tax, including: 1) A rate of 30  percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value  that does not exceed 50 percent of the total amount of  deductions; 2) A rate of 40 percent shall be levied on the  amount of the increment value that exceeds 50 percent but is  lower than 100 percent of the total amount of deductions; 3) A  rate of 50 percent shall be levied on the amount of the  increment value that exceeds 100 percent but is less than 200  percent of the total amount of deductions; 4) A rate of 60  percent shall be levied on the amount of the increment value  that exceeds 200 percent of the total amount of deductions.    According to reports, the aim of authorities in formulating  the regulations on the value-added land tax is to standardize  the business order of the land and real estate market,  rationally readjust benefits from value-added land, and  safeguard state rights and interests. It happened that the  Constitution revised in 1986 states "the right to use land owned  by the state can be transferred according to law," and that  since foreign businessmen were allowed to develop and manage  large stretches of land in 1990, the real estate business has  developed vigorously in all provinces and municipalities on the  mainland, large quantities of land have been approved for  development, and the number of real estate development companies  has increased to thousands upon thousands. Therefore, many  undesirable practices have emerged. For example, local  governments, in a bid to attract foreign land developers,  compete with each other in lowering land prices, approve at  random the establishment of development zones, and development  companies which have bought large stretches of land have engaged  in land speculation. At the same time, high-grade houses and  houses to be sold abroad constitute a greater part of the  structure of land investment. As a result, the development of  real estate was not balanced and was partially out of control.  For example, according to the national plan for 1992, 2 million  mu of land should have been approved for development, but 3.6  million mu of land was actually approved, exceeding the target  by 80 percent. The input of funds on a large scale into the  real estate industry has also affected the development of the  energy, communications, raw material, and other industries.    Mainland specialists pointed out that an important cause of  the appearance of overheated real estate business is that the  burden of tax on buying and selling land and real estate is on  the light side. For example, foreign real estate companies only  need to pay a three percent commodity house business tax and  they reap substantial profits. Therefore, more and more foreign  investors have invested in real estate.    The original intention of the Chinese Government in levying  value-added land tax is to regulate and control the real estate  market on the mainland in addition to increasing revenue from  taxes. According to analysis by specialists, another purpose of  increasing the value-added land tax is evidently to curb  construction of excessively large quantities of garden villas,  holiday resorts, and high-class apartments which have taken up a  large amount of resources, which have not much to do with the  ordinary people, and which do not have clear market prospects,  and to guide the developers to make investment in the  construction of common residential houses for domestic sales,  which have a great market demand and are closely related to the  people's living standard, and to make investment in power  plants, highways, and other industries. This can be said to be a  means of macro regulation and control.    However, because of a different considerations of interest,  the increase in the value-added land tax on the mainland has  evoked much dissatisfaction in Hong Kong and Taiwan. A real  estate businessman said that in additional to paying 30 to 60  percent of value-added land tax according to the regulations on  the mainland, it is necessary to pay 33 percent of profit tax  for profits from selling houses. This means double taxation.  According to this way of calculating taxes, the maximum amount  of taxes to be paid for investment in real estates may reach 73  percent, and the minimum tax rate is also as high as 53 percent.  Because investment risks and investment returns are out of  proportion, some real estate developers may suspend their  projects to avoid losses. Guangzhou Mayor Li Ziliu also pointed  out that according to the method of calculation of the central  authorities, the implementation of the new tax system will raise  production costs of investment by 5 percent and lower profits by  30 percent. If this rate is put into practice, investors will  not be able to make any profits. However, he pointed out that  the added value tax is a kind of local tax and the local  government can formulate detailed rules for implementation  themselves. Guangzhou has its own standard in formulating the  detailed rules. Therefore, he said that Guangzhou's investors  may set their minds at rest. A director of the China Department  of the Hong Kong Jones Lang &amp; Wooten Consultants held that  the  levying of the value-added land tax on the mainland is mainly  aimed at short-term speculators and its impact on the real  estate market as a whole will not be too great. Some people  expected that the temperature in real estate investment on the  mainland this spring will fall, but in the latter half of the  year, the real estate market will tend to become more vigorous  again. The number of transactions will be no fewer than that of  the same period last year. The selling prices of various kinds  of real estate will rise by 15 to 25 percent.    According to reports, the Chinese Government, in a bid to  speed up the construction of residential houses for urban  residents, is encouraging foreign businessmen to take part in  plans for the development of inexpensive residential houses.  Major Hong Kong financial groups have responded positively to  this. The New World Development Company Ltd. and Cheung Kong  (Holdings) Ltd. have already signed a letter of intent on the  development of inexpensive houses. Various signs have indicated  that China's real estate market has broad prospects and is still  attracting Hong Kong businessmen's investment in development.</p>

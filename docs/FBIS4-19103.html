			<p>BFN     [Text] This afternoon 60 Italians were evacuated from  Rwanda, which is in the throes of a civil war. One of our air  force Hercules C-130's took 40 Italians from Kigali to Nairobi.  Another 20 Italians left Kigali onboard a Belgian aircraft.    The C-130 that evacuated the 40 Italians has taken 80  Italian  special boat squadron marines to Kigali, and they have already  been deployed alongside Belgian and French paratroopers to  defend the airport.    Another Italian C-130 is flying from Nairobi to Rwanda.</p>

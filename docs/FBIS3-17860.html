This was  reported to INTERFAX on Tuesday by the South Ossetian leader  Ludvig Chibirov who pointed to the high turnout. A total of 80  of registered voters cast their ballots.    The second round of voting is scheduled for April 10.  Chibirov will also run the second time because there are five  more candidates in his electoral district.    Meanwhile, an aide of the leader of Georgia, that does not  recognize the republic, has described the elections as illegal.  In an interview Vazha Khachapuridze said they were aimed at the  separation of South Ossetia from Georgia. He said the step  contradicts the trilateral Dagomys agreements and could  aggravate the situation. "International experts will pass their  verdict on the lawfulness of the elections", the aide said.</p>

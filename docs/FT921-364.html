			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Construction Contracts: Upgrading trunk road in Scotland The north east of Scotland civil engineering company of MORRISON CONSTRUCTION has won a contract to improve 6.4km of the A929 Dundee to Forfar trunk road, north of Tarbrax. The Pounds 7.85m contract, from the Scottish Office, includes the construction of 4km of carriageway along the east side of the existing road, and 2.4km of dual carriageway in diversion to the west. The 78-week contract includes transporting 400,000 cu metres of fill material for embankment construction and the disposal of 150,000 cu metres of unsuitable soil is planned to be carried out nearby, eliminating excessive additional haulage traffic on the main road. Three reinforced single-span underbridges are required. One, at Gateside, will be built in stages around the existing bridge which will be demolished in the process. Another bridge will create a minor grade separated junction with the B9127 road at Spittalburn.</p>

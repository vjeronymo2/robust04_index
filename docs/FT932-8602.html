			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / International Company News: Profits at Argentine telecoms group soar TELEFONICA de Argentina, the largest of the country's two privatised telephone companies, has unveiled net profits of USDollars 143.7m for the first half to March 1993 on sales of USDollars 853m. This compares with first half net profits of USDollars 93.7m the year before, on sales of USDollars 731.4m. Argentina's telephone system has become hugely profitable following its privatisation in 1990. In the financial year to September 1992, Telefonica earned taxable profits 81 per cent ahead at USDollars 293.2m on sales 38 per cent up at USDollars 1.58bn. Telefonica, controlled and operated by the Spanish Telephone Company Telefonica de Espana, holds a legal monopoly over services in the southern half of Argentina. Its smaller rival Telecom de Argentina, which is controlled and operated by the French and Italian state companies, reported a 172 per cent rise in net profits to USDollars 150.3m in the year to September 1992, while revenues rose 36 per cent to USDollars 1.2bn. Telefonica said it would invest USDollars 2.5bn over the next three years, after investing USDollars 1.2bn in the two years since privatisation. Telecom de Argentina plans investment of USDollars 3.3m for the same period. Telefonica financed 80 per cent of the investment programme out of cash flow and raised the rest from banks and the capital markets. The company is planning a bond issue of USDollars 150m.</p>

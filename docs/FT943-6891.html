			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Arts: A conductor who fits the bill - Antony Thorncroft finds the LA Philharmonic full of the spirit of enterprise Esa-Pekka Salonen, the boyish (36 going on 18) music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic which plays the Proms at London's Albert Hall next week, says: 'It is pleasing to be part of the underground'. A symphony orchestra in Los Angeles, the popular entertainment capital of the world, is distinctly left field. 'When we are playing Bruckner we are the alternative culture', maintains Salonen. Salonen has been at Los Angeles two years now, and 'it is very enjoyable. Musically it is exactly as I expected, although the non-musical part of being music director takes up a lot of time and energy'. Los Angeles likes stars (previous music directors include Mehta, Previn and Giulini) and Salonen, a composed, even cool, Finn, accepts the burden. 'The conductor in his person represents the values of classical music in this area'. In a city where looks matter, he fits the bill to perfection. He is also professional enough to command respect in a place which makes its money by taking entertainment very seriously. The crucial time for the Philharmonic is now, when subscriptions are renewed for the winter season of concerts. With over 80 per cent of supporters signing on again, Salonen, and managing director Ernest Fleischmann, can breathe more easily. Running a major orchestra in Los Angeles is a tough business. The arts in the US are dependent on rich patrons and although there are plenty of wealthy people in LA, they tend to be the insecure producers and stars of the movie and pop industries who are too preoccupied with their roller coaster careers to feel charitable. A few Hollywood personalities back the Philharmonic - Walter Matthau is a friend and Sharon Stone is expressing an interest - but apart from taking a socially desirable box at the Hollywood Bowl, where the Philharmonic undertakes an ever longer, financially essential summer season, the orchestra survives in an apathetic environment. Fleischmann looks hungrily at cities like Boston where old money has enabled the orchestra to build up an endowment of Dollars 110m. Although the LA Philharmonic has an annual turnover of almost Dollars 37m, large by orchestral standards, it has amassed an endowment of only Dollars 24m. Fleischmann is embarking on a fund raising drive to raise this to Dollars 75m, which would produce an extra Dollars 5m a year in revenue and go some way towards meeting the current Dollars 7m deficit. He is optimistic that the money will come. Apart from the impact of Salonen, in 1997 the Philharmonic moves into a new home, the Walt Disney Hall. This has been paid for with the largest cash donation in the history of the arts in the US. Lillian Disney came up with the initial Dollars 50m in memory of her husband Walt and the rest of his family rallied round to produce Dollars 95m towards the Dollars 130m cost of the building. The smartest LA architect, Frank Gehry, has been commissioned to produce something startling and his design, which wraps the building in swathes of limestone like a ship in full sail, is expected to become as much a landmark in the city as is the Opera House in Sydney. Change is whirling around the classical music scene in LA. Salonen is fanatical about contemporary music. 'A symphony orchestra should maintain the tradition that exists, but it should also create new things.' So most of the world's leading composers have been commissioned to provide works for Walt Disney Hall. Salonen has naturally brought a northern repertoire, more Sibelius and Nielsen, to the orchestra, but he has also attempted to improve its variety to give it 'a palate rich enough to accommodate a more flexible approach', as he diplomatically puts it. The aim is to keep the warmth associated with American bands but to make it tighter. The strings are also to be coached in the 18th century repertoire by Roger Norrington. Behind the scenes the Philharmonic is determined to get back into the black. Staff has been thinned, some outreach programmes axed. It will pay for performing in the new hall, which cuts its seating capacity from over 3200 to less than 2400, by playing each programme more frequently. Seat prices will also rise. Chairman of the board Stanley Beyer wants to play up the orchestra's involvement with the Hollywood Bowl. For years this was where the Philharmonic lets its hair down during soft summer nights. But now, with audiences regularly topping 13,000, its short 11 week season in the Bowl contributes almost Dollars 15m of the Dollars 21m the Philharmonic earns at the box office each year. Last week at the Bowl Salonen was previewing the music he is taking on the European tour: Lutoslawski, Sibelius, Carter and all, tough stuff in fantasy land. But the audience, much of it young and bussed in from the satellite communities which make up LA, appreciated the fact that their new young maestro was treating them as adults. Like Simon Rattle in Birmingham, Salonen is toughening up the programme but taking a larger audience along on the ride. As he says, 'there is a certain spirit of enterprise in LA. People are ready to experience new things. There is no preconceived idea of what is right or wrong. Audiences are more able to accept the new. You can be unconventional easier here than anywhere else. It is a city of disasters and entertainment.' He will be hoping to emphasise the entertainment side at the Proms next week.</p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> N.Y. STRIFE CAPTURES MINORITY INTEREST  </P> <P> Blacks and members of other minority groups paid more attention to articles  about racial tensions in New York City than any other news story in the last  month, and most believe that the press has done a mediocre job at best of  covering the issue, according to a monthly survey by the Times Mirror Co.  </P> <P> Among nonwhites, 38% said that they were "very closely" following accounts of  the New York trial of two young white men convicted of charges related to the  killing of a black teen-ager in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn and of the  boycott of Korean-owned stores in Brooklyn by some blacks. Only 13% of whites  said that they were giving those stories "very close" attention.  </P> <P> The racial disparity in how much attention those stories received was a  departure from the usual pattern that has been found by the Times Mirror News  Interest Index. The monthly survey about which news stories people follow  generally has found that interest in news breaks down along lines of income and  age, but not of race.  </P> <P> Those who were paying close attention to coverage of the tensions in New York  indicated unhappiness with the press. Only 7% said that they thought the  coverage was excellent -- usually about one-quarter of respondents give an  excellent rating to news coverage they are interested in -- and 58% said that  the coverage was only "fair" or "poor."  </P> <P> In New York itself, press coverage of racial tensions has been highly  controversial. Both blacks and whites attending the Bensonhurst trial shouted  epithets at reporters and photographers, and some photographers were injured in  melees after the verdicts were announced last month.  </P> <P> Overall, in a month when no single news story captured an overwhelming amount  of public interest, the Bush-Gorbachev summit was the story cited by more  people than any other as the one they were paying attention to, with 38% of  those polled saying that they were following it "very closely." That was about  the same percentage as said they were "very closely" following news coverage of  the presidential election in 1988 or the Navy's escort of oil tankers in the  Persian Gulf in 1987.  </P> <P> As is usually the case, older people and those with more education -- core  readers for most major newspapers -- were more likely to say that they were  paying close attention to the summit than others.  </P> <P> Among people under 30 who were polled, more said that they were paying very  close attention to reports of floods in the Southwest (29%) than the summit  (26%).  </P> <P> However, asked what the "most important" news story of the last month had been,  roughly 50% of those who had an opinion named the summit, whether or not they  were paying attention to it. The remaining respondents split, with no more than  a handful specifying any other story.  </P> <P> Times Mirror Co., which conducts the survey every month, owns several  newspapers and magazines, including The Times.  </P></p>

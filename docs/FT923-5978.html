			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Observer: Klapped out The fayre at Simpsons, the famous City watering hole, has been the same for years - stodgy dumplings, watery gravy and a grill nicknamed the 'heart attack on a plate'. Diners in the Square Mile like it that way. However, a group of dissident shareholders is threatening to spoil things at today's extraordinary general meeting. Businessmen deserve better, says rebel diner Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select Appointments. Unfortunately, he and his chums haven't banked on the City's appetite for jam roly-poly and lumpy custard. Customers like nothing better than to be reminded of school lunches by the 'eat what you're given' attitude of Simpsons' staff. Managers of the Cornhill chop house and its sister eatery, the Jamaica Inn, are keen to preserve the status quo. Most diners seem to agree. Do I hear a loud burp for Klapp and his new boys?</p>

			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / International Company News: Second shake-up at Posco in six months SENIOR management at Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the world's third largest steel company, changed yesterday for the second time in six months. The reshuffle is related to the forced resignation from the state-run steel company of Mr Park Tae-joon, its founder, for his political opposition to South Korea's new president. The departure yesterday of Mr Park as Posco honorary chairman triggered the resignation of two top aides, Mr Hwang Kyung-ro, chairman, and Mr Park Tuk-pyo, president. The two men were promoted last October when Mr Park stepped down as chairman due to his refusal to support Mr Kim Young-sam as the presidential candidate. Posco's new chairman is Mr Chung Myung-sik, current vice-chairman. The new president is Mr Cho Mal-soo, vice-president for new business investment and purchasing.</p>

			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RTD OKS FREE RIDES IF BUSES ARE LATE;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: THE TRIAL PROGRAM IS AN EFFORT TO REGAIN LOST RIDERSHIP. UNDETERMINED  IS WHETHER THE DRIVER OR RIDER WILL DETERMINE IF A BUS IS LATE.  </P> <P> A public relations experiment that would provide free rides whenever buses are  15 or more minutes late won the endorsement Thursday of the Southern California  Rapid Transit District's governing board.  </P> <P> The board's 8-1 vote gave RTD officials the go-ahead to plan for the four-month  program, which is slated to begin Sept. 1 and is designed to get people back on  buses. Since the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, RTD ridership has  plummeted by about 500,000 customers from a high of 1.8 million daily.  </P> <P> "This is a good and bright idea," said RTD Director Marvin Holen, who supported  the novel concept.  </P> <P> RTD board President Nick Patsaouras, who unveiled the proposal at a news  conference Wednesday, told fellow board members that the RTD needs to do a  better job of persuading consumers that public transportation is reliable.  </P> <P> The free rides, he said, are merely a way to provide an attractive alternative  to cars and congestion.  </P> <P> RTD officials realize that many freeway commuters simply won't give up their  cars.  </P> <P> "We've tried different things in the past," said one RTD official. "Maybe this  will get them out of the car."  </P> <P> In addition, the RTD has been stung by publicity about problems, ranging from  violence on buses to late buses. Officials concede that a 60-cent fare hike in  1985, bringing the basic one-way fare to $1.10, drove off customers by the  thousands.  </P> <P> The specifics of the experimental program, which may cost the RTD between $1  million and $2 million in lost revenue, have yet to be worked out. Among the  unanswered questions is how the program might affect corporate-sponsored bus  plans.  </P> <P> Also unanswered is who will decide if a bus is at least 15 minutes late -- the  driver or the rider. Patsaouras said he thought the often-heard axiom -- "The  customer is always right" -- should prevail, even if a customer says the bus is  15 minutes and 1 second late.  </P> <P> "I believe the rider should be comfortable and depend (on the bus) to be on  time," he said.  </P> <P> RTD officials are expected to work out the details and bring them to the board  for approval next month.  </P> <P> Not everyone on the board, however, favored the idea.  </P> <P> "This is an ill-conceived plan," said La Puente City Councilman Charles H.  Storing, who voted against it. "It assumes the buses are intentionally running  late, but a lot of the reasons are traffic congestion, traffic accidents, road  repairs, engine trouble or train crossings.  </P> <P> "For us to penalize the district is unacceptable."  </P> <P> The leader of the RTD bus drivers' union said he favored the idea as long as  the drivers did not become scapegoats for poor on-time performance.  </P> <P> "A driver could get into a dispute on whether a bus was 15 minutes or 14  minutes or 12 minutes late," said Earl Clark, general chairman of the United  Transportation Union. "They got a lot of other things to deal with without  getting into that."  </P> <P> Several bus drivers in downtown Los Angeles said they supported the RTD board's  action.  </P> <P> "I want happy riders, not hassles," said one Route 30 bus driver as he headed  toward East Los Angeles. "If it's my fault that the bus is late, the riders  deserve a free ride."  </P> <P> Another bus driver, battling to keep his schedule to the Eagle Rock Plaza  shopping center, tersely told a reporter, "Can't talk right now. You don't want  to make me late, do you?"  </P></p>

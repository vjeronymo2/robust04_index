			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Training on job needs better image Sir, Your leader 'Leaving school' (August 10) summarised the dilemma facing pupils in the 14-19 age group in the UK educational system. The changes to the national curriculum and the transformation of GNVQ into vocational A-levels will help to bridge the divide between the academic and vocational routes, but the apparent stigma of the work-based vocational route after the age of 16 still remains. There can be no escaping the fact that for a significant proportion of 16-year-olds staying on at school is not the most appropriate method of personal development, and the acquisition of skills is best achieved in a job with structured training leading to vocational qualifications. The enhancement of the image of this route is just as important as the elevation of GNVQ, and an acknowledgement of the value of the apprenticeship approach by schools and government would do much to achieve parity of esteem across the whole spectrum of education.

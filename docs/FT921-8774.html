			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Peps are safe says Labour ARE YOU investing your hard-earned cash in personal equity plans (Peps) simply out of fear of a Labour government? It might be time to think again. Labour has until now suggested a number of possibilities for changing or improving the scheme, while retaining the option to abolish Peps altogether. The party's pronouncements have become steadily warmer over the past year. Chris Smith, Labour's Treasury spokesman, declared this week in the most definite statement yet: 'We believe Peps do have a role to play within the savings and investment market. We don't necessarily share the present government's view that they are the best thing since sliced bread but, nonetheless, they have their uses and we don't have any intention of sweeping them away.' Much present financial marketing is, however, based on the premise that the next tax year could be the last for Peps. The attitude is: 'Buy now while stocks last]' The validity of this approach is already in question following a successful complaint to Lautro by Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's City spokeswoman. She claimed a letter from an Abbey Life sales representative to clients was misleading because it said: 'It is no secret that a Labour government would abolish a number of tax-planning opportunities.' Some Pep advertisements have used arguably stronger language. An article Smith wrote in the trade newspaper Money Marketing on January 30 said: 'We do  .. believe that Peps can be of some value as a savings and investment vehicle  .. Where a Pep-linked mortgage has been established, we would seek to ensure that the mortgage would continue to be linked to a Pep.' This appeared on the same page as an advertisement for the Henderson Election Pep which featured the slogan: 'Will the First Election Pep Be Your Last?' Neil Kinnnock is pictured saying 'Yes]' Smith described this as 'wholly misleading.' He said: 'We would simply ask organisations like Henderson to stop engaging in advertising which misleads the public.' But Robin Berrill, managing director of Henderson Investment Management, defended the advertisement strongly, saying Smith had made no categoric promises to maintain Peps untouched. He pointed to one phrase: 'What role, therefore, should Peps have? They probably do have a role to play in the overall patchwork of savings provision, but the Labour party is not entirely convinced that they merit their high relative status in the tax system.' To which Berrill retorted: 'If he says that clearly states their position, I would say he needs a dictionary.' He said the advertisement had been based on a comment by Mowlam, to Money Marketing last year, that 'we would not continue the tax relief to Peps.' But Henderson is prepared to review the advertisement if Smith provides a categorical written assurance that Labour will not abolish Peps in their present form. Mowlam said this week that Smith's statements reflected the party's position and superseded her earlier comments. Labour certainly intends making significant changes to Peps. The proposals Smith is considering are similar to the 'XPep' (or extended Pep) advocated by the Institute of Fiscal Studies. This would include cash deposits, bonds, or collective funds on an equal footing with equities. Such a scheme would convert Peps into a vehicle aimed directly at encouraging saving. Introducing such an XPep would also go some way towards alleviating any pain caused by the proposal to levy National Insurance contributions on investment income above Pounds 3,000 a year. There is no reason not to commit money to a Pep if you think it makes sound investment sense. In the next tax year, however, you could well have a broader choice of Peps. Once the election is over, it should also be clearer how much money you are able to commit to this long-term investment vehicle.</p>

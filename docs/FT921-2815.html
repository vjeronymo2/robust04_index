			<p>920318 FT  18 MAR 92 / Australians unsure over recession AUSTRALIA may have limped out of recession in the three months to December, but the economy remains fragile and recovery is likely to be weak, figures published yesterday suggest. The picture of the economy revealed by the quarterly national accounts was more confused than usual because of the introduction of a new statistical definition of changes in gross domestic product. A new measurement, GDP(A), showed growth of 0.3 per cent in the three months to December, following growth of 0.1 per cent in the September quarter. GDP(A) measures the average of the three traditional definitions of GDP, based on income, expenditure and production measurements. GDP(I), the income based measurement which is the government statisticians' preferred index, rose by 0.4 per cent in the three months to December, but fell 0.1 per cent in the September quarter. The contrast between the two raises doubts over whether the economy has fulfilled the technical definition of recovery, which requires growth over two successive quarters. The government statistics bureau also said the trend estimate, which smoothes out quarterly fluctuations in the figures, remained subdued. On this basis, GDP(A) was flat, following six successive quarterly contractions. Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the figures showed that a ADollars 2.3bn (Pounds 980m) public spending package announced last month was 'about right'. He said the government was 'entitled to be confident that the economy is on the turn'.</p>

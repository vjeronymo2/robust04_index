			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / Sharp rise in vacancies for executive posts reported INDICATIONS that the economy may be reviving have been supported by a survey pointing to a sharp increase in the demand for executives to fill top jobs in industry. According to a survey by InterExec, a recruitment consultancy, the number of top jobs for which candidates are being sought increased by 17 per cent in the first quarter compared with the same period last year. Mr Philip Burton, marketing director, said: 'This gives a strong sign that companies are trying to get their top management teams sorted out.' He added: 'It may be an indication of a pick-up in economic activity.' The survey comes as economists hunt for clues to whether the 18-month recession is drawing to an end. Indications that companies are stepping up their recruitment efforts may be a signal that industry as a whole is more hopeful about the chances of increased sales. Interpretation of InterExec's data is difficult, however, since its survey is only four years old. The survey is based on information collected from about 1,000 separate employers and recruitment companies, and may not provide a complete snapshot of the jobs market. According to the survey, companies were trying to fill 1,749 vacancies for top jobs in the first quarter compared with 1,490 in the first quarter of last year, a rise of 17 per cent. In the fourth quarter last year the year-on-year rise in vacancies was 4 per cent. Most of the vacancies are for posts of managing director or head of a corporate function such as sales or finance. Virtually all involve salaries of Pounds 25,000 or more. Efforts to fill all the vacancies in the survey are focused on methods other than advertising, for instance use of 'search' or recruitment consultants. InterExec reckons its survey covers between a third and half of all vacancies filled by such means.</p>

			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A consortium with some political clout - Breakaway union casts its eyes on the British Coal assets Mr Arthur Scargill must have viewed events at the Union of Democratic Mineworkers in the last year or so with some pleasure. The president of the National Union of Mineworkers feels the same sort of contempt for the UDM, a breakaway from his union, as he does for the forthcoming privatisation of the coal industry. So the UDM's early difficulties over the privatisation process will have provided him with a few wry smiles. Last year it announced it would be bidding for British Coal assets with companies including East Midlands Electricity and Jim Walter Resources, of the US, only to find its prospective partners drop out later. It must be hoping its latest liaison - with Coal Investments, the mining company led by Mr Malcolm Edwards, a former British Coal director - is more soundly based. Mr Edwards and the UDM announced last month they had formed a consortium to consider bidding for British Coal assets which are being sold later this year. They have applied to NM Rothschild, the merchant bank advising the government on privatisation, to 'pre-qualify' to bid in three English regions and are thought to have been successful. Coal Investments is looking at the possibilities in south Wales alone and in Scotland with another consortium. For the UDM, the attractions of Coal Investments are obvious enough. Mr Edwards has his critics, among them Mr Neil Clarke, chairman of British Coal who sacked him as marketing director two years ago after a series of clashes. And although former colleagues at British Coal admire and like Mr Edwards for his intellect and humour, some agree with Mr Clarke's assessment that he was too outspoken and individualistic. 'He had his own agenda and sometimes he did not confide in us what it was,' complained one. 'He was not a team player.' Others say that as British Coal's commercial director in 1990 he should have negotiated a five year rather than three year deal with the generators but at lower prices. This would have secured a larger market for the industry, even if only temporarily. Mr Edwards says he would have been in favour of such a deal but that in practical terms it was never on offer. Whatever the merits of the 1990 deal, few dispute Mr Edwards' enthusiasm for coal and his ability to motivate employees he rates and the investors whose funds are needed to develop the ind-ustry. Since Mr Edwards reversed Coal Investments into Geevor, Britain's oldest quoted mining company, last October, shares in the enlarged company have risen more than sevenfold. That makes Coal Investments the stock market's best performer in the period; no mean achievement for a company whose main selling point is its plans to reopen up to five pits rejected as unprofitable by British Coal. Only one is so far in full production. In spite of doubts among other coal companies about potential markets, Mr Edwards says there is no problem selling coal. 'I wish I had more,' he says. 'The market is screaming for it.' However, he is cautious about the possibilities of bidding for the five regional packages which include British Coal's opencast sites and 16 operating collieries. Mr Edwards believes the five regions may be a riskier investment than the pits he is already operating under leasing and licensing arrangements because of problems over liabilities. 'We need to see what is on offer and if they can be made to work,' he says, adding that bids are by no means certain. The UDM, led by Mr Neal Greatrex, may be more enthusiastic. Although it has kept proportionally far more of its members than the NUM since 1985, it now has less than 4,000 still working, against a peak of more than 26,000. It is seeking a more substantial role. However, the union has yet to show that it can transform itself from a traditional union to a more business-oriented organisation. Mr Greatrex says that in the new consortium, management decisions would be left to Mr Edwards but adds he would expect UDM directors to have a right of veto on working practice changes. That will raise an eyebrow or two among potential investors. The UDM does, however, possess an asset in the goodwill of the government. Tory MPs are still conscious of the UDM members' role in helping to defeat the NUM strike of 1984-85. Some, though probably a declining number, believe the party still has a debt to discharge to the UDM. That perceived debt would give a UDM/Coal Investments consortium some political clout if it entered the bidding fray. In addition the union can tap into funds promised by the government to help employee buy-outs. Although the Coal Investments/UDM consortium has the option of tendering for the three English regions of British Coal, the chances of it bidding successfully for all of them are remote. Developing them would involve an outlay of several hundred millions of pounds, including the tender prices. Mr Edwards may have worked wonders on the stock market but his company is still valued at less than Pounds 35m. And with most of its mines yet to produce coal in significant quantities, the company is still largely untested. In addition, any consortium involving the UDM would have to think long and hard about launching a bid for the central north region where Mr Scargill's NUM is predominant. The consortium is considered a much more likely bidder for central south, where virtually all miners are members of the UDM.

Shemyakin at Russia's  Academy of Sciences, Moscow; UDC 547.963.320.57:577.214.622]    [Abstract] The powerful general immunostimulating activity  of thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/]--one of more than 30 peptides with  a low molecular mass of 1,000 to 15,000 isolated from the  thymus--which is synthesized in the body in the form of a  precursor from which it is cleaved off prior to N-terminal  acetylation, and the shortcomings of known thymosin  _a_[.sub]1[/] synthesis gave an impetus to designing a hybrid  gene using a carrier which encodes a small-sized protein which  does not contain methionine residues and is easily expressed in  bacterial cells. Chemical enzymatic synthesis and cloning of an  artificial gene in E. coli which encodes the  immunoactive peptide thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/] is reported. The  semisynthetic gene of the mutant human tumor necrosis factor  (TNF) in the pTNF3314 plasmid used earlier to construct hybrids  with antigen determinants of the foot and mouth disease virus  which contains a unique BamHI restrictase site in the  C-terminal part meets all of the necessary requirements. A  preliminary investigation of the biological properties of  recombinant fusion proteins shows that the Thy-TNF fusion  protein is characterized by complete biological activity of the  tumor necrosis factor in a cytotoxicity test on transformed  fibroblasts of L-929 mice while the TNF-Thy fusion protein is  considerably less active. The findings confirm the earlier  conclusions about the important role played by the C-terminal  TNF segment in the biological (cytotoxic) activity  manifestation. Thus, artificial genes which encode the TNF and  thymosin _a_[.sub]1[/] hybrids are constructed, and their  expression in E. coli and the properties of the  proteins encoded by them are examined. The cytotoxicity of the  fusion proteins is determined according to Meager, Leung,  et al. The authors are grateful to V.Ye. Zhemchugov,  O.A. Kaurov, A.A. Kolobov, and V.A. Kulikov for proving  assistance and supplying the serum. Figures 7; references 26: 6  Russian, 20 Western.</p>

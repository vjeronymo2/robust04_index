			<p>BFN     [Text] Xian, March 17 (XINHUA) -- Northwest China's Shaanxi  Province is to adopt the joint stock system for the construction  of an expressway linking Weinan city with Lintong County, where  the world-renowned museum of ancient life-sized terracotta  horses and warriors is located.    Due to start in June this year, construction of the 40.7-km  expressway is to be completed in two years, with an expected  investment totalling 500 million yuan.    This will be the country's fourth expressway and also the  first one in an inland province to be funded through the joint  stock system.    Opening up more channels for fund-raising compared with the  former dependence on state allocation of funds alone, the joint  stock system is sure to streamline the construction of the road,  according to local officials.    A share-issuing limited company is to be set up in June.  Apart from responsibility for construction and preservation of  the road, it will undertake the task of managing various service  facilities along it and tapping the great potentials of real  estate, tourism, advertising and entertainment in the area.</p>

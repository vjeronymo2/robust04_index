			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Arrogant Welsh agency is humbled: How the WDA's new chief aims to restore the organisation's reputation IF ONE word sums up the ethos of the Welsh Development Agency in the past few years, it is arrogance. The tone was set by Dr Gwyn Jones, its chairman until July. In his last annual report he did not even refer to the Commons public accounts committee inquiry into the agency's 1991-92 accounts. The consequence of that inquiry came this week when Mr John Redwood, Welsh secretary, apologised for what the MPs had described as 'a catalogue of serious and inexcusable breaches of expected standards of control and accountability'. At the WDA, heads have rolled as the new chairman, Mr David Rowe-Beddoe, sets about putting the house in order. Dr Jones was only 39 and had run a Swansea software business when he was appointed chairman in 1988 by Lord Walker, then Welsh secretary. A strong personality, Dr Jones, who is now BBC governor for Wales, raised the profile of the agency which helped to transform the image of Wales from a land of steel mills and coal tips to one where high-technology companies flourish. The agency is admired even by its critics for its success in attracting inward investment, for land reclamation, and for its role in urban regeneration. Mr Redwood told the Commons it was easy to look only at the criticisms and to neglect the WDA's 'very real achievements'. While Dr Jones played the role of travelling super-salesman, his dominating influence inculcated a mentality within the WDA that this was a style to be imitated. Some of the practices that occurred under Mr David Waterstone, who was chief executive until 1990, and then under Mr Philip Head, who resigned this week, might have attracted little attention in the private sector, but were not acceptable in a government-funded agency accountable to parliament. The practices included a loss of Pounds 1.4m on an unauthorised redundancy scheme for 127 staff; a retirement package of Pounds 228,000 for an international director, which was preceded by eight months of 'gardening leave'; free private motoring for senior executives; an apparent attempt to conceal a so-called Operation Wizard, in which large fees were paid to consultants to consider partial privatisation; and the appointment of Mr Neil Smith as marketing director. He was a fraudster whose bogus credentials were not checked. There were other matters which made the WDA look like 'a cosy club with jobs for the boys'. Too many people were promoted because they were long-serving. At a senior level, Dr Jones became a director of Tesco, while Mr David Malpas, Tesco's managing director, sat on the WDA board. Although an independent investigation into a land deal involving a Tesco subsidiary found no conflict of interest, Dr Jones's directorship hardly looked appropriate. One of the recommendations made this week by the inquiry panel set up by Mr Rowe-Beddoe, was that board members should discuss any invitations for outside appointments. Now some senior staff have paid the price. Mr Head has resigned. The executive director in charge of managing the budget, Mr Michael Henry, has been dismissed. Mr Ian Rooks, the executive director for marketing, has been demoted. Another senior executive, Mr Alun Daniel, has been reprimanded. Mr Rowe-Beddoe, an international businessman, has already impressed observers. He seems to have been surprised by the WDA's combination of arrogance on the one hand and cumbersome civil service attitudes on the other. He is adopting all the 43 recommendations of his inquiry panel. In addition, he is carrying out a thorough review of the management structure. Meanwhile, the Welsh Office, which was castigated by the public accounts committee for lack of supervision, is tightening its monitoring of the non-departmental public bodies.</p>

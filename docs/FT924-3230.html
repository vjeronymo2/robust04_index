			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Parliament and Politics: Extra help promised for jobless A TOTAL OF 60,000 career development loans are to be made available over the next three years, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, announced yesterday. This is part of the government's strategy of focusing resources on practical help for job-seekers, she told MPs. During a Labour-originated debate on unemployment, Mrs Shephard also said an extra 180,000 new places were to be provided next year in Jobclubs and on the Job Interview Guarantee Scheme. Job Review Workshops will get an additional 10,000 places. The figures confirm, as indicated last month at the time of the Autumn Statement, that the government intends to target a greater proportion of funds on non-training initiatives. Expenditure on training programmes is to suffer a 3 per cent cut in real terms. Mrs Shephard said the career development loans - which are provided by the clearing banks with the government paying interest until training has been completed - would be available for people in and out of work. The government's focus in drawing up its plans was on individuals in greatest need and measures that had proved themselves successful, she said. Mr Frank Dobson, the shadow employment secretary, placed his emphasis on training, claiming that the government's training budget per unemployed person was less than half of what it had been only 'three short years ago'. Statistics showed the unemployed stood less of a chance of getting a job if they had been on employment training than if they had not, Mr Dobson argued. The Autumn Statement had been 'so feeble' that Ms Shephard and her colleagues had refused to estimate how many jobs it might create. Labour's motion attacking the government's 'total failure' to tackle rising unemployment was defeated by 309 votes to 276, a government majority of 33.</p>

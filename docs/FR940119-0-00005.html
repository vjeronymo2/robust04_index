			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In section 911 of Public Law 102&hyph;237, which was signed December 13,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1991, Congress resolved this issue by providing that for an IHE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim, ``the household shall be given notice permitting it to elect  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> another means of repayment [other than allotment reduction] and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given 10 days to make such an election before the State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commences action to reduce the household's monthly allotment.'' The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department understands by this language that no action to reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household's monthly allotment may be taken by the State agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> until the eleventh day following the household's receipt of notice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the IHE claim.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Typically households first receive notice about IHE claims through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mail in demand letters. Consequently, there is no practical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> way to determine exactly when households receive such notices and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in turn, the eleventh day afterwards. There is also the problem of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing for return mail time. This rule provides that within 20  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> days of the date of the demand letter, households must notify State  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies of their choice of repayment method or be deemed to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elected allotment reduction. This timeframe should allow for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> newly required 10-day decision timeframe and adequate mail time,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> five days for delivery to households and five days for household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> return mail to State agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed below, the provision is restated to deal with IHE and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IPV claims separately and to clarify that the timeframe for the IHE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim repayment decision relates both to initial demand letters and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to demand letters following fair hearings which sustain IHE claims.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, to take account of demand letters which may be handed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the household, the language makes clear that the 20-day period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begins on the date the demand letter is mailed or otherwise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivered to the household.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several commenters objected to the statement in the preamble to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule to the effect that the claim itself was the adverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action, not the collection action. (This statement was made in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> connection with exempting the initiation of allotment reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the adverse notice requirements when households have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided notice about appeal rights on the underlying claim. That  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal is discussed later in this preamble.) The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would like to clarify this matter. Current rules require that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> households be provided specific information about their rights to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeal recipient claims. Once this information is provided, if a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fair hearing is requested and a determination to sustain the claim  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is made, the household's remaining decision is how it will pay the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claim. Making that decision should take relatively little time.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To clarify how this policy applies to IHE claims, the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides that in cases of IHE claims, if a fair hearing sustains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim, the household must notify the State agency of its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> election of repayment method within 20 days of receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notice of the hearing decision or be deemed to have elected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allotment reduction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to IPV claims, the final rule provides that households  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must elect a method of repayment on the date of receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand letter required by 7 CFR 273.16(e)(9), 7 CFR 273.16(f)(3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and (g)(3) of current rules (or if the date of receipt is not a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business day, on the next business day) or be deemed to have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elected allotment reduction. The final rule requires that for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> IPV claim, the first claim demand letter following an action which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes the claim, inform the household about this timeframe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for election of a method of repayment and the consequence of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failing to meet it. This is intended to clarify that the timeframe  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for electing a repayment option begins with the demand for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule also provides that each State agency must, for IPV  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims, determine a deadline for the return of completed election  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forms in order to determine if the election is timely. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department does not expect State agencies to set such deadlines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> case by case. State agencies should establish uniform timeframes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for responses to demands for repayment of IPV claims, if necessary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowing for situations such as mail time to and from remote areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule states that the deadline cannot exceed 10 days from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the date that the demand letter is mailed or otherwise delivered to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liable households. The time period is set at a maximum of 10 days  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the law requires a ``same day'' decision from households and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a relatively short response time is appropriate to that statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to these changes, to accommodate the different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for IHE and IPV claims relating to repayment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decisions, the final rule treats IHE and IPV claims in separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections. Furthermore, since recoupment is a method of collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which is used only for participating households, when appropriate,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the final rule refers to ``participating households.'' In 7 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 273.18(d)(4), which contains the policies on repayment decision  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timeframes, the heading is changed to ``Further collection actions''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> since that more accurately describes the material in the paragraph.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, because IHE and IPV claims are treated in separate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subparagraphs, the first sentence of paragraph (4)(i) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule has been deleted to eliminate potential confusion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This deletion also eliminates the redundant phrase ``do not respond  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely or fail to respond.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department was concerned that a significant number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters believed that in reducing the time for electing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment for IHE claims the proposed rule would also have abridged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the right to appeal the claim. Consequently, in addition to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treating IHE and IPV claims separately, the final rule sets forth  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for the content of the initial demand letter for IHE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims separately from the content of a demand letter for IHE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> claims which are sustained by fair hearings. An initial IHE demand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letter needs to inform the household that it has an option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> timely electing a repayment method <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 -->  or  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> requesting a fair hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A demand letter provided after a hearing decision which sustains  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the claim would not offer the hearing option. Similarly, the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand letter for an IPV claim can only be issued following an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative disqualification hearing or other action which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> establishes an IPV claim. The rule adds a phrase to clarify this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> point.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In response to other comments, the final rule makes several other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes with respect to the required content of the demand letter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for IHE and IPV claims. One commenter recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed list of repayment methods in 7 CFR 273.18(d)(3)(iii) be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expanded to include repayment in coupons. However, a full list of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repayment methods is already contained in 7 CFR 273.18(g).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (d)(3)(i) of that section already requires that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand letter inform the household of these methods of repayment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Consequently, in addition to being incomplete, the proposed list in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paragraph (d)(3)(iii) is redundant, and so the final rule deletes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> it.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

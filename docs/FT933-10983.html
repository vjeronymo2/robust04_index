			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Bank Perhaps the most depressing aspect of Lloyds interim figures is the results of its retail bank. The limits to growth show clearly in profits before provisions down 4 per cent despite a 5 per cent fall in costs. Lloyds blames weak loan demand and the lower income earned on its interest-free liabilities as a result of lower base rates. But its high return targets make life particularly hard in such difficult markets. They may have caused the bank to forgo some lending opportunities, for example in the mortgage market where other banks have been taking business from the building societies. Nor do accounting changes under new European Community rules help. While Pounds 120m of last year's first half group operating income disappears in the restatement, the cost income ratio rises to 65.5 per cent and the tier one capital ratio is suddenly a mere 6 per cent. In short, Lloyds starts to look much more like an ordinary bank and one with a strategic problem to boot. Certainly the stock market seems less impressed by Mr Brian Pitman's magic touch as chief executive. The shares fell over 4 per cent yesterday even though LLoyds reported a net return on shareholders' equity of 21.3 per cent. If Mr Pitman really believes future growth opportunities will be limited by a non-inflationary environment, he should be rushing to pay surplus cash back. Ambivalence on this score suggests he is still tempted by the acquisition route to growth. A weak share price will not make that approach any easier.</p>

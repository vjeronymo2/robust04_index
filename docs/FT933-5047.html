			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Management: Back to school for industry - Managers are sharpening up their skills through educational placements Time was when industry's involvement in schools was regarded as a good public relations wheeze, paid for out of the same budget as charitable donations. Today, however, UK companies are realising there are important career development benefits for their managers. Sir Allen Sheppard, chief executive of Grand Metropolitan, is one business leader who supports participation by employees in community action and education programmes. 'It's a big part of career development,' he said in a recent interview with the FT (Management Page, July 2). 'I like to see people in the trenches, not stuck in the back office. It's better than 1,000 management courses. It's playing the game for real.' On Sir Allen's analysis, sending staff on educational programmes is an act of enlightened self-interest - training is helped, while the company's image, and the long-term health of the community around it, improve. Sending employees into classrooms can also be a valuable first step to finding good new recruits. The bodies that co-ordinate education and the private sector are now trying to ensure that their programmes will be useful for industry participants. These include Young Enterprise, which uses corporate managers as advisers to 'boards' of 16-18-year-olds running dummy companies for vocational business qualifications, and Understanding Industry, which arranges for managers to give sixth-formers lessons in how industry works. Research by Oxford University's delegacy of local examinations found that companies are using secondments to the Young Enterprise scheme as a formal and informal means of developing management skills. Work as a YE adviser also conforms with the standards of the Management Charter Initiative, the government-backed body for establishing common standards of managerial training, which is backed by 1,614 companies. Each Young Enterprise 'company' has a board of directors composed entirely of students who raise starter capital of Pounds 250, and a workforce taken mainly from friends at school. Over the next year, they attempt to make as much money as possible from business activities. The children gain vocational qualifications, and have the chance to win prestigious prizes in competition against other youthful companies across the UK and Europe. Managers from industry are required as advisers for each managing board. Last year, more than 5,000 advisers were seconded to Young Enterprise companies. Corporate training managers say a young manager can derive excellent experience by overseeing the birth of a small company, run by usually highly enthusiastic teenagers. Midland Bank now has more than 400 Young Enterprise advisers, and uses the scheme as a standard appraisal tool for any recruits who hope to become small business advisers. According to Oxford University's research, each adviser must play roles as team players and managers, but must also work as a 'catalyst', consultant and manager of learning. They must also assess and audit their students' work. It is a big commitment, involving one two-hour session each week with the youthful boards of management, plus duty on some Saturdays towards the end of the year when the companies take their wares to trade fairs and make presentations. But former YE advisers find the experience invaluable. Isobel Day, remunerations and benefits officer for Guinness Brewing in north London, advised a company called Le Pose at Queens Park Community School in Brent. In a turbulent year of existence it appointed four separate managing directors, and drastically revised its accounts several times. Day said she learnt to take an overview of the range of a company's functions - not otherwise easy in a company the size of Guinness - and also gained insights into the problems of team leadership and co-ordination. Under Day's guidance, Le Pose eventually raised enough money by offering car washes and making Christmas cards to go to France and take advantage of the then favourable exchange rates to buy cheap goods, which the children then sold in north London. Its campaign came to a climax with a highly regarded presentation to a group of business leaders, including Martin Sorrell, chief executive of WPP, which had been organised by Business in the Community. According to Day, Guinness has now established Young Enterprise involvement as 'very much a useful career development tool'. This judgment is shared by United Biscuits, another big employer in Brent, which also involves its managers in YE programmes. Understanding Industry organises a less onerous programme that also allows junior managers to gain extra perspectives on their work. UI courses are offered as a bloc to Sixth Form colleges, and lead to a diploma at the end of the course. During the term, the aim is to introduce students to all sectors of industry, and to each of the various management functions. Different volunteer managers from industry address the class each week to explain their job, and to take them through model exercises. Past volunteers attest that the experience of explaining themselves to a group of curious sixth-formers helped their communication skills. They must act as ambassadors for their companies, but avoid technical jargon, and also review closely what their job is aiming to achieve. Students also have an ability to ask questions that managers would otherwise never have asked for themselves. Like Young Enterprise, UI aggressively promotes its programmes as useful training for managers, as well as for students. Powerful backers for its latest campaign include Allied-Lyons, Esso, Marks and Spencer, Thorn EMI and Boots. Allied-Lyons expects all its managerial employees to take on external community positions, with a particular emphasis on school governorships and participation in Understanding Industry courses. The company sees educational involvement as a part of overall managerial development, and an opportunity to widen contacts. Educational involvement, though, does not come cheap. Allied-Lyons calculates that each secondment of a manager to take a UI course amounts to a gift of Pounds 800 for the school.</p>

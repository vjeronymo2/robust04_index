			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Political Notebook: Scoring points with Essex man We should never have expected enlightenment. British election campaigns have long since lost the central democratic purpose of illuminating the choices before the electorate. That sort of politics is too complex for a generation weaned on the tabloid press and the 15-second television sound-bite. But even by the standards of the recent past, the European election campaign has been an unedifying spectacle. Around the country, candidates for the Strasbourg assembly have dutifully knocked on doors, climbed on to platforms in village halls and picked up babies in market squares. But at a national level the campaign has produced an entirely predictable game of charge and counter-charge in which important issues have been trivialised and trivial issues elevated. So far the voters have been offered a synthetic dispute about the national veto, a protracted row over begging and a fruitless argument about the definition of federalism. Other, real European issues have occasionally intruded - the social chapter, the path towards a single currency, the shape of Europe's future defence among them. But the tactics adopted by all three parties have ensured that rational debate is minimised in favour of cheap sloganising. So nobody should be surprised if, once again, the great mass of the electorate decides on June 9 that there is nothing, or nobody, worth taking the trouble to vote for. The Labour campaign understandably has lacked political focus. The death of John Smith left the party's leading figures pre-occupied with the succession. In any event Labour has yet to work out the difference between a strategy of attacking the Conservatives for leaving Britain in Europe's slow lane and a discriminating approach to the policies of other European Union governments. After some initial slip-ups, Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats have looked effective in promoting themselves as the party to beat the Conservatives in the south-west. But like Labour, the party has been wary of sounding too positive about Europe. It has looked more comfortable when attacking Mr John Major over domestic policy. On a technical rather than intellectual level the Conservative campaign cannot be faulted. The strategy has been to prevent a bad result from turning into a catastrophe. The judgment from the outset was that the party needed to counter the disgruntled apathy of its hard-core supporters. The instincts of these voters are those of the Tory Euro-sceptics. They are reflex chauvinists, suspicious of most things foreign and of all things emanating from Brussels. They believed Baroness Thatcher when she told them that a Britain free of the shackles of Europe could rediscover its past greatness. Coincidentally they also favour a hard line against beggars. To win them back, the Conservatives concluded their best role in this campaign was not that of a government but of an opposition party. The central message has been constant: Mr Major would persuade the Europeans from doing that, would veto this, and would opt out of whatever else proved unpalatable. If Central Office is to be believed, the strategy is working. Even those Tory MEPs who find the focus of the campaign distasteful are acknowledging that many of the punters like what they are hearing. It is against this backdrop that Mr Major sketched out the possibility of a multi-speed, multi-track Europe. This so-called variable geometry - a ghastly phrase first uttered in public by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - would allow a wider, more flexible union to operate with the grain of public opinion. All would participate in core activities such as the single market. In other areas - defence, monetary union, social policy - individual nations would choose whether or not to enhance co-operation. It is an idea with merit. In some respects it is a reflection of the status quo. In any event the cohesion possible among 12 states will not be so in a union of 20. But the context and tone in which such arguments are framed are as important as the actual words. In Mr Hurd's multi-speed Europe, Britain would play a positive part, setting the pace of co-operation in defence and foreign policy. Mr Major, locked in the poisonous embrace of his party's Euro-sceptics, appears more interested in opting out than opting in when the union reshapes its future in 1996. The national veto - threatened by nobody in Europe - has become a virility symbol. The prime minister is right to argue that Europe has changed during the past few years. But scoring easy points with Essex man sits uneasily alongside a pledge to keep Britain at the heart of Europe.</p>

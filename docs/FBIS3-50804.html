The ministry also  expressed hopes that the conflict would prove temporary because  commercial relations could be negatively affected in both Mexico  and Guatemala.    The Foreign Trade Ministry emphatically denied that the  meeting between Mexican and Guatemalan trade authorities  scheduled for 30 November in Tabasco was suspended due to the  recent armed conflicts, saying that the meeting was postponed  for administrative and strategic reasons and noting that the  conflicts had not even begun when the decision was made. The  Foreign Trade Ministry also emphasized that talks are being held  with Mexican economic authorities to establish new routes for  the products.    If the armed conflict continues, it is highly probable that  trade will practically come to a standstill, thus bringing  negative consequences, the ministry concluded.</p>

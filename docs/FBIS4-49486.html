			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 5 (XINHUA) -- The Preliminary Working  Committee for the Preparatory Committee of Hong Kong Special  Adminstrative Region (SAR) will further strengthen contacts with  Hong Kong residents and collaborate with them to prepare  formation of the SAR government. Wang Fengchao, member of the  political affairs panel of the committee, made the remarks here  today during talks with leaders of the Democratic Alliance for  Betterment of Hong Kong and Hong Kong Progressive Alliance.  Wang said in the past few days, the political and economic  panels of the committee met representatives from some political  organizations and grass-roots bodies and listened to their  opinions on the political structure, the economy and the  people's livelihood in Hong Kong beyond 1997. Some of these  opinions, he said, are very constructive and he believed the  committee will do a better job together with the support and  participation of Hong Kong people. He hoped various  organizations, through communication with Hong Kong residents,  will jointly take part in formation of the SAR and in preparing  "Hong Kong people manage Hong Kong" after 1997. There will be  no "through train" as the Sino-British talks has broken down,  Wang said, adding the Chinese side still hopes to cooperate with  the British side in fields of the economy and the people's  livelihood. However, this cooperation depends on the attitude  taken by the British side, he said.</p>

			<p>930216 FT  16 FEB 93 / International Company News: Lehndorff restructuring approved LEHNDORFF Group, the Canadian property finance and management group backed mostly by German investors, has gained the approval of creditors for a debt and business restructuring plan. The Toronto-based group, which owns or administers about 230 properties, said that it aimed to implement the plan towards the end of April following what is expected to be a successful placing in Europe of CDollars 40m (USDollars 31.7m) worth of investment units. The new securities, which will have both an equity and a bond component with a minimum return, are being sold to existing investors through JP Morgan of New York. An offer to outsiders is possible at a later stage. Lehndorff functioned as a group of limited partnerships and a management company until the slump in the North American property market forced it to seek court protection last December. The group, which has debts of about CDollars 540m, will emerge as a single partnership managing its own properties. As part of the plan, it has shed peripheral activities, such as property syndication and mutual funds, as well as some of its least profitable limited partnerships. A new management team has also been installed.</p>

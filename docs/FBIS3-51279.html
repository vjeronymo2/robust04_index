			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Minister of Health Juan Luis </F> Londono by Gilda Sarmiento; place and date not given]    [Text] When the bang of the gavel marked final  congressional passage of the Social Security reform bill, Health  Minister Juan Luis Londono leaped in the air to show he was  "happy as hell with life."    And this was no small achievement; the law culminates a year  of work and provides for a reform that will, in his opinion,  revolutionize a service that has been in the doldrums. It will  also realize a constitutional dream of universality, solidarity,  and efficiency.    Others, in contrast, believe it will pull the plug on health  care. They say it is an immature effort at privatization with an  excessively complicated and unintelligible text, in which each  article is two pages long.    What no one doubts is that if the goal of giving every  Colombian--including the 10 million who live in extreme poverty  today--a whole package of health services is achieved over the  next seven years, a veritable social revolution will have  occurred.    To achieve this objective, health contributions in 1994 will  rise from 7 percent to 12 percent, and of those funds, 1 percent  will be earmarked for subsidizing the poorest of the population.    With a view to expanding coverage, 374 billion pesos in new  resources is guaranteed in next year's budget, a social tax on  weapons has been created, and beginning in 1997, 15 percent of  the tax on Cusiana oilfield revenues will go to subsidize poor  people's health care.    In addition, the budget for social investment in health will  increase each year as a percentage of GDP.    It is true that such resources have never been allocated in  the history of health care, but to leap from that to the notion  that by the year 2000 there will be no difference between rich  and poor would seem to be a revolution on paper, a mere utopia  in the mind of Minister Juan Luis Londono, who defended the plan  in an interview granted to EL ESPECTADOR. The striking thing  about Colombia, he maintained, is that it spends less than it  should on health care, but it is totally surprising that  coverage under the system is so low. It is barely higher than  that of Haiti and Bolivia. And ironically, when serious  projections are made of how much good it would do to eliminate  poverty, one of the principal difficulties is pessimism. This  attitude is deeply rooted among intellectuals, who are very  disparaging about the possibilities of social policy. "We have a  discourse that attempts to persuade us that nothing ever changes  in this country, and since nothing ever changes, it is not worth  making an effort, because what the hell is social policy for?"    [Sarmiento] What is the real purpose of health care reform?    [Londono] The general purpose is to provide health care for  all Colombians, because that is the main thing they lack today.  Some 10 to 12 million Colombians have no health care, but there  are 25 million who do not have Social Security.    [Sarmiento] But Colombia is too poor a country to guarantee  health care for everyone from one year to the next.    [Londono] It is not from one year to the next. It is a  gradual program. That is one of the obsessions people have had,  thinking that overnight you can produce miracles. I call it the  totoya theory: todo para todos ya  [everything for everyone right now], which is a fundamentalist  vision shared by some segments of society that are so desperate  they have lost touch with reality. We have designed a plan so  that over a period of 8 to 10 years, people will have that  access. Why 8 to 10 years? Because that is how long it has taken  in the most successful countries in the world: Costa Rica and  Korea, which began their reform with per capita income figures  not far from those of Colombia.    [Sarmiento] Where will the money come from?    [Londono] This is not just rhetoric. In the 1994 budget, the  fiscal allocation, which is the contribution the nation makes to  the departments in relation to what is allotted for health care,  will rise by more than 50 percent. Not only will the departments  receive more money, so will the municipalities. Altogether, they  will receive 60 to 65 percent more. In addition, the Social  Investment Fund (FIS) has been created, spending on the  Colombian Family Welfare Institute (ICBF) will increase  considerably, and the National Health System will receive 400  billion pesos in net new resources. Part of these funds will  come from the 100 billion pesos derived from the reform of  Social Security, which basically will come from the provision  that all Colombians will pay to give the poor access to health  care; that provision represents about 50 billion pesos, and the  government and the municipalities will contribute a similar  amount. If we combine them, that makes 400 billion pesos in new  money for health care, something unprecedented in this country.    [Sarmiento] What was the greatest obstacle in the debate on  the bill?    [Londono] The program basically was attacked from two  flanks,  by those who long for a single public monopoly, and by those who  accuse us of being privatizers. The interesting thing in  Colombia is that we have managed to create our own model, and it  is a lie that we are privatizing. What are we going to do?  Define a single health care plan that will be equal for everyone  and that will gradually converge, because there is not enough  money for totoya, and if people want to have it all,  we have lost the battle at the outset.    [Sarmiento] What can a poor man and his family expect  beginning in 1994?    [Londono] We cannot create false hopes. The reform will not  give health care to the entire population as of 1 January next  year. It is a program that requires the construction of a  system: On the one hand, we must get the money; 400 billion  pesos is a lot of money, and we need much more. What can they  expect? We are generating a program so that the poorest people  in the country and the families of those who have the ability to  pay will move closer together right away, and in the not too  distant future--eight years--they can be equals in a  comprehensive plan, like the one that Social Security Institute  (ISS) beneficiaries have today.    The reform will take full effect in May, so the principal  goal, in terms of equity, is to give access to the system to a  million poor families, the most downtrodden in the country,  through subsidies in keeping with demand. We have 150 billion  pesos that will enable us to reach a million families, to whom  we will provide a health care plan amounting to 150,000 pesos  per family per year. The rich people in this country may think  that a pittance, but you have to understand that the poorest 10  percent of this country have annual family incomes of 600,000  pesos, and we are going to give that group a raise equivalent to  25 percent.    [Sarmiento] What guarantee is there that this reform will  not  become paralyzed under the new government?    [Londono] The reform has two advantages: It is very good,  and  it has been the product of a great effort at coordination.    [Sarmiento] Many think that you are excessively optimistic,  and that the program is really not that good, that it was  debated less than the pension program.    [Londono] They have the wrong impression. The problem is,  pensions have sparked much more interest in the private sector  and have drawn much more press coverage. Since the program I  proposed was for the poor, a lot of people said what the heck,  that does not matter to me, and there was this idea that it was  not very important. Meanwhile, a process of consensus was  created. I spent a year, during which 70 percent of my time was  devoted to meeting with people. There has been an incredible  degree of consensus; the problem is that I do not reach such  consensuses in the press.    [Sarmiento] There are those who say that the next few years  will be spent reforming the reform.    [Londono] I would hope that this process would have the same  dynamic as the economic liberalization, which was very  controversial three years ago, the focus of a lot of fear. Many  groups pinned their hopes on reversing the liberalization  process, and today they see that it is irreversible, that it has  had some undeniable benefits, and that it may need some small  adjustments.    [Sarmiento] Do you think this reform is ambitious, but it is  a revolution on paper?    [Londono] No. I think that what makes the program  interesting, and very different from other reforms that have  been launched in the past, is that it has two conditions of  viability: first, financial viability, because it is not  demagogic; and secondly, political viability, in the sense that  it is not a reform imposed by technical experts, but the product  of a very broad democratic consensus. And in spite of  everything, it is a very technical reform; it is consistent and  comprehensively articulated.</p>

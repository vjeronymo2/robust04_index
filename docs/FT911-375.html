			<p>910513 FT  13 MAY 91 / Survey of Cardiff (3): The barrage meets its first storm - Cardiff Bay / The future of the plan, after a parliamentary jolt MANY PEOPLE describe Cardiff as a major international city waiting to happen. After the confusion in parliament last month, the wait may be longer than they expect. Progress of a locally-sponsored private bill, to allow a barrage to be built across Cardiff Bay, creating a non-tidal 500-acre freshwater lake, was blocked at an all-night sitting. A group of Labour MPs who oppose the scheme, largely on environmental grounds, made long speeches and raised persistent objections. The government says it will now take over legislation to build the barrage, and bring in its own bill. Without the barrage, which would cost about Pounds 80m, says the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation, Cardiff will not be transformed into an important maritime city. The corporation is charged with renovating and developing 2,700 acres of partly-derelict land around the bay. Although Cardiff is the national capital of Wales, it has yet to find a new wider role. The bay was once the port for heavy industry; but coal and steel went into decline, and Cardiff, though still active as a port, conducts a fraction of the business it once did. Much of the land around the bay has fallen into disrepair. The bay itself is heavily tidal, with an average drop of 40ft between tides. At low water, it is a vista of unattractive mud flats. Under Mr Peter Walker, the former secretary of state for Wales, new industries, both British and foreign, were attracted to the valleys and other parts of Wales. Cardiff has begun to develop as a financial centre, servicing these industries. It has also become something of a media city, with many independent film-production companies. But in terms of rebirth, it trails behind such cities as Bristol and Cambridge. Some relocation towns along the M4 have developed London-type congestion and high costs. Cardiff, towards the end of the motorway, has not yet been overrun by developers. Land and property were cheap, and skilled labour was available. What was needed was for the land around the bay to be revived. In 1987, the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was set up. Like many of the other 10 urban development corporations, its purpose was to rejuvenate and restore degraded acres, using government money as a catalyst. Its plans were drawn on a grand scale: 1,000 acres of the 2,700 under its control were considered to be immediately developable. Within 10 years, some 4m sq ft of office space and 5m sq ft of industrial factories could be built. There would be 6,000 houses, a quarter of them social accommodation for low-income families. There were plans for an opera house and a maritime museum, as well as marinas, hotels and shops; 30,000 jobs would be created directly, and up to 15,000 indirectly; around Pounds 2bn of private capital would be invested. Cardiff would become a grand maritime city, a bit like Sydney. The barrage across the bay was the basis for the grand design - but without it, the mudflats were so unattractive that investors and developers would not take the bay seriously. Three years were put into preparing the private bill. It had to be a parliamentary private bill, because the barrage was a single engineering project, albeit a large one. But now the bill has now been thrown out. What has gone wrong? In a sense, nothing. David Hunt, the present secretary of state for Wales, has said that the government will pick up the parliamentary bill, and make it part of its official business. With the government whips behind it, it will almost certainly get through at some point. But the question is: when? Much of the opposition to the barrage was on environmental grounds. The mudflats are the habitat of wading birds, and the bay has been designated a site of special scientific interest. There were fears that a barrage would cause flooding. The rivers Taff and Ely flow into the bay, and there has been flooding in the past. A fresh-water lake would create problems with algae, said opponents of the barrage, so that the lake would be muddy brown rather than blue, making swimming impossible. Finally, it was suggested, the ground water-table would be affected by a lake, so that houses would suddenly start to develop fungus in their basements. The seven Labour MPs, who conducted the filibuster that blocked the private bill, emphasised these issues. But many of the criticisms have been met by the development corporation. It says research has shown that algae can be dealt with, as can the threat of flooding. The corporation proposes to spend Pounds 5m to provide an alternative wildlife sanctuary for the wading birds a few miles way. The ground-water problem is being investigated. At bottom, the opposition of the Labour MPs ' not all of them Cardiff members ' seemed to centre not simply on environmental problems, but on a mix of arguments. These ranged from the view that Cardiff should become a better capital of Wales rather than an international city, to the belief that too many developers would make too much money out of lakeside projects. The development board may have done itself a disservice by inadvertently creating the impression that, without the barrage, there would be no development around the bay. This is not the case. So far, the private sector has invested about Pounds 250m in the bay area. The board itself has been active in infrastructural development. It is spending money on a peripheral distributor road, which loops off to the east and west of the M4. Perhaps because of the time taken over the bill, it has studied other development areas and learned from their mistakes. Unlike Southampton, say, where the waterfront developments are divided from the old town centre, Cardiff Bay projects will be locked on to the established city centre. The development corporation is anxious to begin; the South Glamorgan county council supports the barrage; Cardiff city council wants it. The danger is that the government bill, which Mr Hunt now promises, may be a long time coming. A general election might bring a change of government, and the Labour party does not have the same commitment to the barrage. Further delay could mean the difference between a piecemeal waterside development and a dream enterprise. Opinion polls in the local press suggest that most of the people favour the dream.</p>

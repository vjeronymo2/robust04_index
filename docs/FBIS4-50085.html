			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yuan Yang (6678 3152): "Where Does the </F> `Southbound' Road Lead? -- Commenting on Taiwan's `Southbound  Policy'"]    [Text] On the 10th of the first lunar month of 1994, Subic  Bay, 80 km northwest of the Philippine capital of Manila,  received an industrial and commercial investigation delegation  from Taiwan. This large delegation of nearly 100 people included  Taiwan officials and entrepreneurs. Having heard the hosts'  introduction to the investment situation there, a Taiwan  entrepreneur of the delegation thought that the preferential  treatment offered was poor, and indicated that he "would not  invest in a factory in Subic Bay."    Subic Bay is an excellent natural port of the Philippines.  It is surrounded on three sides by mountains, the water is  deep, and the port is spacious. In 1941 the United States and  the Philippines signed an agreement to lease Subic Bay, which  the United States turned into its largest naval base in Asia.  At the end of November 1992 the lease ran out, and American  troops withdrew from Subic Bay.    For the Taiwan authorities to invest in Subic Bay and  develop  an industrial zone in cooperation with the local people is an  important component of Taiwan's implementation of its southbound  economic and trade policies.  <H5>  The Major Contents of the "Southbound Policy" </H5>   The southbound economic and trade investment and cooperation  plan drawn up by the Taiwan "Ministry of Economy" requires that  "state- operated" enterprises belonging to the "Ministry of  Economy" and the Kuomintang party-run enterprises take the lead  and, at the same time, bring along nongovernmental enterprises  to participate in the southbound investment plan.    The region covered by this investment plan is Southeast  Asia.  The plan includes four aspects: Investigate and study the  economic and trade movements of Southeast Asia and come up with  corresponding measures, expand bilateral trade between Taiwan  and Southeast Asia, strengthen bilateral investment and  technical cooperation, and effectively promote substantive  bilateral economic and trade relationships.    This so-called economic and trade plan actually contains  political motives. An official of the Taiwan "Ministry of  Economy" pointed out frankly: "Choosing Southeast Asia as an  economic and trade emphasis of our southbound policy is because  we want to use economic and trade exchange to expand room for  diplomacy."  <H5>  The Background and Reasons Behind the "Southbound Policy" </H5>   Beginning in the early seventies, Taiwan developed economic  and trade relations with Southeast Asian countries, and by the  mid- eighties bilateral economic and trade relations had become  heated, reaching a peak at the end of the eighties. In the  nineties, these relations began to decline. Statistical data  indicates that by 1993, Taiwan's investment volume in Southeast  Asia had already exceeded $16 billion.    During the late eighties, when Taiwan capital flowed into  Southeast Asia the most, the Taiwan authorities had not raised a  "Southbound policy", they were, on the contrary, worried about  the "gutting of Taiwan industry." In that case, why do they  push hard for a "Southbound policy" today? This is closely  related to the problems faced by Taiwan economic development,  the rapid economic development trend of the Asia-Pacific region,  including Southeast Asia, and the economic trade development  trends between both sides of the Taiwan Straits.    Since the eighties, the economy of the Asia-Pacific region  has developed rapidly, leading the regional economic development  of the world. Taiwan, belonging to the Asia-Pacific region,  beginning in the mid-eighties has suffered from a drastic  deterioration in its internal investment environment, rising  labor costs, land price-hikes, a rise in the environmental  protection movement -- facing medium and small enterprises with  huge pressures for survival. It is from such a background that  a large batch of medium and small enterprises have moved to  regions where land and labor are relatively cheap.    The Taiwan authorities have thought that, with its economic  power and geographical factor, Taiwan can play an important role  in the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region, becoming  an operating center in the Asia-Pacific region. According to  this concept, the Taiwan of the future not only wants to become  the transportation center of the Asia-Pacific region, but also  wants to become the center of information, business, and  personnel training. Large corporate groups and multinational  corporations would all set up their headquarters in Taiwan,  while other Asia-Pacific countries would only have their branch  and representative offices. The manufacturing center of various  high-tech products would be in Taiwan, with product assembling  distributed in the Asia-Pacific region, forming an industrial  structure with a vertical division of labor.    In this ambitious grand plan, the southbound economic and  trade policy has been a component, and the promotion of a  southbound policy has been to create the conditions for the  realization of Taiwan becoming the operating center of the  Asia-Pacific region.    Early in the 1990's, with the gradual reduction of tensions  in the relationship between both sides of the Taiwan Straits,  economic and trade relations have developed rapidly. In 1993,  indirect trade volume between both sides exceeded $10 billion,  and the negotiated capital of Taiwan investment in the mainland  during recent years has exceeded $10 billion. This  complementary and mutually beneficial economic and trade  cooperation between the two sides has promoted economic  prosperity for both parties. However, out of political  considerations, and not from the economic interests of both  sides, the Taiwan authorities think of all kinds of ways to  continuously lower the temperature of the island's "mainland  investment fever" and advocate the "scattering of Taiwan  businessmen's investment in the mainland" and the "weaning of  ourselves from dependence on the mainland market." The other  purpose of its "southbound policy" has been to persuade Taiwan  businesses into increasing their investment in Southeast Asia,  hence "counterbalancing" their investment in the mainland.  <H5>  The Political Motivation of the "Southbound Policy" </H5>   In order to promote the "southbound policy," some  decisionmakers of the Taiwan authorities have spared no effort  to visit countries in Southeast Asia to conduct so-called  "vacation diplomacy." Various signs indicate that the  "southbound policy" is an important measure in the Taiwan  authorities' promotion of "pragmatic diplomacy"; it is an  attempt to obtain the status of a political entity in Southeast  Asia.    In order to "expand room for survival in the world," as it  is  called, the Taiwan authorities again and again have disregarded  the principle of "one China," and have used all kinds of means  -- from the "silver-bullet diplomacy" and "money diplomacy" of  the early eighties, to the "dual recognition" of the early  nineties, to the promotion of "substantive relationships" with  certain "influential countries," all the way to the unbridled  activities last year of trying to "return to the United  Nations." However, the "result" they have obtained has not been  ideal. The Taiwan authorities, especially after encountering  defeat in last year's attempt to "return to the United Nations,"  have decided to make 1994 "the year of seeking a new orientation  in diplomacy." As such, the Taiwan authorities have turned their  foreign relations emphasis to the neighboring areas of Southeast  Asia, attempting to become a dialogue partner of ASEAN, and to  obtain the status of a political entity, and then to further  squeeze into regional international organizations. At the same  time, they have also modified their methods and come up with  disguises such as "vacation diplomacy" and "informal visits" in  order to cover up the substance of striving for "two Chinas," or  "one China, one Taiwan."    Taiwan has no "diplomatically related country" in Asia, and  all countries only recognize the government of the People's  Republic of China as the only legitimate government representing  China, with Taiwan as a part of China. This situation is not  something that the Taiwan authorities can change with its  "economic and trade advantages" or by using "vacation diplomacy."  <H5>  The "Southbound Policy" Arouses Wide Discussion </H5>   After the "southbound policy" was raised, it attracted  discussion from the political circles, media, academia, and  business circles of the mainland. They expressed opinions on  the economic significance and political intention of the policy,  the practicality of its implementation, the relationship of the  "southbound policy" with mainland policies, and various other  aspects.    A Taiwan economist has analyzed the important significance  of  the "southbound policy" for Taiwan's economic development. He  believes three major economic forces may appear in the  Asia-Pacific region in the future: Japan, mainland China, and  ASEAN. Being sandwiched between the three powers, Taiwan must  maneuver among these economic forces to maintain its economic  development. Establishing an industrial division of labor with  Southeast Asia countries is the most advantageous to Taiwan.    An influential Taiwan newspaper expressed, in an editorial,  doubts that the "southbound policy" would realize a "diplomatic  opening up." That editorial stated that if the basic diplomatic  policies of the Southeast Asian countries did not change, then  no matter how hard Taiwan pushed its "southbound" policy, it  would be difficult to turn economic and trade forces into  diplomatic forces. The editorial said that "it will be  difficult" for Taiwan "to turn its economic and trade relations  with ASEAN countries into diplomatic pressure against Communist  China."    A Taiwan newspaper reporter expressed the following thoughts  after visiting Subic Bay in the Philippines: The "southbound  policy" is an up-current movement in the general movement of the  Asian market. That reporter likened the mainland to a "super  magnetic field," while Southeast Asia was a "small magnetic  field." He believed that the Taiwan authorities were now "using  the state- operated and party-operated businesses as a main  electric current to divert Taiwan businessmen from the large  magnetic field to the small magnetic field." He wondered: "Is  the power of this electric current really that strong?"    A Taiwan businessman who has invested in both the mainland  and the Philippines said that, within a short period of time, it  will not be easy to see the investment results of Taiwan  businessmen answering the "southbound" call because the cost of  investment opportunities is still the most important  consideration of Taiwan businessmen. In addition, language  problems are also an obstacle to Taiwan businessmen investing in  the south.    Another large Taiwan newspaper expressed doubts that the  "southbound policy" could turn Taiwan into the operating center  of the Asia-Pacific. This newspaper said in an editorial that  if enterprises took Southeast Asian countries as their targets  for market development, then from the perspectives of  geographical location, humanities, and social conditions, the  best central depots were Singapore and Hong Kong, not Taiwan.    In discussing the relationship between the "southbound  policy" and the mainland policies, this editorial made this  analysis: The key to implementing the "southbound policy" is a  more open mainland policy. If the transport and business  channels between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits can be  opened up, then the key position and central depot function of  Taiwan in Southeast Asia region will have a better chance of  showing itself.    In sum, the Taiwan authorities' promotion of the "southbound  policy" is, on the one hand, to seek a road for the island's  economic development in an attempt to use Taiwan's economic  power to obtain the crucial position of being a business center  in the flourishing economic development of the Asia-Pacific  region and, on the other hand, to divert Taiwan businessmen's  investment from the mainland towards the Southeast Asia region  in order to be rid of a "dependency on the mainland market."  The political intention of this policy is to open up and build  up "substantive relations" with the so-called "economic and  trade advantages" -- first to obtain the status of a political  entity in the Southeast Asia region, and then gradually to  squeeze into regional international organizations in order to  realize the goal of "one China, one Taiwan" or "two Chinas."    As some foreign media have pointed out, some important  policy  measures of the Taiwan authorities have been far from the  objective reality. These are often "self-inflated propaganda or  wishful suggestions." It seems that the "southbound policy" is  no exception.</p>

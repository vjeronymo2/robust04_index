			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sets record high as bond weakness ignored Wall Street IN SPITE of continued weakness in bond prices, US stock markets retained their firm tone yesterday as program buying and short-covering spurred equities to record levels, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 25.26 at 3,276.83, an all-time peak. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 advanced 3.37 to 417.13, while the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks surged ahead 11.55 to 644.92, a new record. New York SE turnover rose to 237.6m shares from Tuesday's 200m. Doubts about the direction of US monetary policy (recent statements from within the Federal Reserve have dampened hopes of an interest rate cut), and the lack of fresh economic news, have recently left the market without direction. Repeated weakness in bond prices, prompted by the pressure of Dollars 36bn in fresh supply this week, had also cast a cloud over stocks. Yet, yesterday some more good corporate earnings news and technical buying kept the market on course to set new records. News Corp climbed Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 24 5/8 on the news that the media group expects to report improved fourth-quarter results, and that operating profits in its fiscal first half rose 38 per cent. CBS put on Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 144 7/8 after the broadcasting group revealed a fourth-quarter profit of 61 cents a share, compared to the Dollars 6.81 a share loss incurred a year earlier. CBS also said it expected to return to profit for 1992, and envisaged no further writedowns on its sports programming. Loews jumped Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 109 5/8 in the wake of a sharp increase in fourth-quarter earnings to Dollars 4.04 a share, up from Dollars 1.66 a year ago. Chrysler dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 15 in turnover of 3m shares on news of a ratings downgrade from PaineWebber and reports that the car manufacturer might boost its preferred stock offering from Dollars 400m to Dollars 1bn. Insurers were in the limelight following full-year results announcements. Travelers improved Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 on reporting a Dollars 380m after-tax profit for 1991, against a big loss in 1990 after large property tax write-offs. Aetna climbed Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 46 1/4 in the wake of full-year net profits of Dollars 505m, down from Dollars 614m a year earlier. Coca-Cola Enterprises, the bottling operations of the soft drinks giant, lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 14 1/2 after the company unveiled a fourth-quarter loss of Dollars 125m. Car accessories retailer AutoZone fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 38 3/8 after its chairman and partnerships led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialists, said they would sell a total of 4.75m shares in a secondary stock offering. Over-the-counter stock Egghead forged ahead Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 23 1/4 , a 52-week high, after the personal computer software retailer revealed fiscal third-quarter net income of 36 cents a share, well up on market estimates. Applied Materials advanced Dollars 6 3/4 to Dollars 45 1/2 in the wake of fiscal first-quarter net income of 37 cents a share. Canada MODERATE losses in financial services issues countered gains in the communications and media and the gold sectors, leaving Toronto mixed overall. The heavily weighted banking sector began to slide around mid-morning. Standard &amp; Poor's said it might downgrade Toronto-Dominion Bank's long-term debt because of its asset quality, which led to selling across the sector. The composite index ended 2.0 off at 3,595.8, but rises narrowly led declines by 318 to 306 after volume of 33.3m shares.</p>

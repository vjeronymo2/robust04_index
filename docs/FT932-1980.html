			<p>930621 FT  21 JUN 93 / France's four-letter word Count on France to rail against Gatt at today's EC summit in Copenhagen. It will. Yet there is a case, which few in France dare make, for arguing that nothing could better serve the interests of France, the world's fourth largest exporter, as well as those of Europe, than a new international trade agreement. The French have never incorporated Gatt into their culture, even in a literal sense. They spit it out as a nasty four-letter word, forever a foreign acronym of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, itself rarely translated into French. Anti-Gatt feeling is at a record high in France. Gloom about rising unemployment has given way to a sudden panic about delocalisations, or the shift of production to lower-cost regions. But this has been happening for years; Thomson Consumer Electronics now employs more than three times as many people in Asia as it does in France. Why the panic now? One reason is an alarmist French Senate report on delocalisations. Another is that the new strength of the French franc and the continued weight of payroll taxes in France do not help the competitiveness of French goods. In services, the development of electronic teletravail, enabling French companies to get their accounting done in Bombay, also frightens people. Finally, there is the possibility that the Gatt Uruguay round might soon end in a further lowering of Europe's trade protection against the rest of the world. Many French fear Gatt is about to gobble them up. Mr Philippe Seguin, the Gaullist president of the National Assembly, last week put the fear graphically. 'Gatt is the picket tying down the European lamb and making it prey to the voracity of ever more ferocious world competition.' The fear he raises is that Europe's unemployment is not the result of a general, cyclical, world crisis, but of a more permanent crisis, confined to Europe, because of the way free trade operates against it. So, up has gone the old French battle cry of 'Community preference'. To some, including the Senate, this means raising EC tariffs all round; to the others it means graduated tariffs  - relatively low for the EC's immediate eastern European and north African neighbours, higher for the rest of the world, and punitive for countries with industries that employ children. 'Community preference' certainly exists in EC agriculture; its variable levies always bring the price of food imported into the Community up to that produced domestically. But the EC was lucky to get away with this in the early days of Gatt, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur's government ac-knowledges that it is unrepeatable in the industrial field. It is largely, they concede, a warm-sounding phrase that sounds nice to French ears, but does not constitute a realistic battle plan for the Uruguay round. What, then, is their battle plan? One suggestion is to limit the benefits of Gatt trade liberalisation to countries subscribing to International Labour Organisation conventions on free trade unions and the like. The idea is presumably that unions would push up labour standards, and thus costs, in developing countries. But common social provisions are hard enough (as UK Prime Minister John Major has shown) to negotiate among the EC 12, let along among the Gatt 111. The Balladur government really believes its line that the EC has the world's most open trade system. To the fact that, at the start of the Uruguay round, the EC had an average trade-weighted tariff of 5.7 per cent, America 4.6 per cent and Japan 3.5 per cent, it retorts that America has far more high tariff peaks on textiles, shoes and glass, and that Japan's barriers are all non-tariff ones, but still prohibitive. True enough. In any case, Paris complains, any margin of average EC tariffs above others is negated by monetary swings in general, and the dollar's undervaluation in particular. True again. But part of the problem lies in Europe's own monetary system, and there is no hope of adding 'a monetary Gatt' to a trade one. Another idea circulating in Mr Balladur's office is for temporary EC 'tariff-quotas' (imposing high tariffs when import quotas are exceeded). Brussels has done this on steel from east European countries, which did not complain to the Gatt because they want to join the EC one day. There is no reason why other countries should be so forebearing. By contrast, the French call for Europe to have the same weapons of commercial defence as America strikes a sympathetic chord with many EC partners. Nothing annoys Washington's partners more than its tendency to play the Lone Ranger with the world trading system, using the 'silver bullet' of Section 301 of its successive Trade Acts. But the EC already has a 'European 301'  - in the form of its 1984 'new Community instrument', allowing the EC to take unilateral measures against what it sees as unfair trade practices  - but has hardly ever used it. Most of France's EC partners have generally only allowed it to be used against non-Gatt members, of which there are precious few left. Even its use would hardly rein in the US Congress, the real culprit and conceiver of Section 301. Only a Gatt deal, leading to a World Trade Organisation with some real clout, might give Capitol Hill pause. In contrast to arrangements in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank (reflecting America's dominance in 1944), the European Community's role in a WTO would reflect the fact it now accounts for the largest share (20 per cent) of world trade. Over time, too, a WTO might acquire a monetary and social dimension.</p>

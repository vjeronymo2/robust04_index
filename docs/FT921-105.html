			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US urges Japan to increase semiconductor imports THE US yesterday warned the Japanese government of its 'serious concern' over the 'stagnation' of foreign makers' share of the semiconductor market and advised Japanese companies to increase their purchases of imported chips. The warning by Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, followed release of jointly calculated statistics showing that the foreign share rose only slightly from 14.3 per cent to 14.4 per cent in the last quarter last year. In a semiconductor agreement signed last year, Japan recognised that foreign chip makers expected a 20 per cent share of the market by the end of this year, although it did not guarantee a 20 per cent share. However, Mrs Hills indicated the frustration of both Washington and the US semiconductor industry with the marginal growth of the foreign share. The US industry recently raised the prospect of sanctions against Japanese products, if the market share target is not met. 'It is critical that the Japanese government and industry intensify their efforts to improve access to their semiconductor market over the coming months,' Mrs Hills said. Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti) blamed the stagnating share on a downturn in domestic demand for semiconductors, which has led to 'inventory adjustment.' But the ministry, conscious of Washington's impatience, said that 'it is important for Japanese users to strengthen effort's' to expand purchases of foreign chips. The countries released two figures, with the 14.4 per cent not including 'captive' sales, semiconductors manufactured abroad, but used internally by the same company, in particular, IBM Japan. The second figure, which does include captives, showed a fall in foreign share from 16.2 per cent to 16.1 per cent. Meanwhile, the Electronic Industries' Association of Japan, yesterday released a report forecasting that international demand for semiconductors will reach Dollars 92.8bn in 1995, up from Dollars 53.2bn in 1989. The association predicts that Japan will be the largest market in 1995, worth Dollars 32.6bn, followed by north America Dollars 30.7bn, and Europe Dollars 21.8bn, up from Dollars 12.9bn in 1989.</p>

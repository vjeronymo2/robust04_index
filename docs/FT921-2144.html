			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / International Company News: ConAgra advances 20.5% CONAGRA, the diversified US food group, yesterday reported a 20.5 per cent improvement in third-quarter profits at Dollars 84.1m after tax, writes Nikki Tait. The figures, for the three months to February 23 were scored on slightly lower net sales of Dollars 4.85bn, from Dollars 5.04bn in the year-earlier period, and translated into a 17.9 per cent rise in earnings per share, at 33 cents. In the first nine months of the year, ConAgra - whose brands range from the Healthy Choice frozen dinner line to La Choy oriental products  - has seen net profits increase to Dollars 264.5m from Dollars 228.1m in 1990-91. The company, based in Omaha, said there had been 'unusual industry-wide pressure on a number of businesses and markets', and reported mixed results on a division by division basis. The largest industry segment, processed foods, saw operating profits fall slightly compared with the same quarter last time.</p>

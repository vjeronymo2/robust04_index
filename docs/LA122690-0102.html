			<p><P> December 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DENG SEEN IN PUBLIC FOR FIRST TIME SINCE JULY  </P> <P> Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today made his first public appearance since July,  voting in citywide elections in the capital. The 86-year-old leader, widely  believed to be suffering from cancer, appeared frail.  </P> <P> Deng was shown on state television moving steadily but a bit shakily up to the  voter registration table, where he sat down to sign his name. His daughter held  his arm as he walked to the ballot box and dropped his ballot in.  </P> <P> However, the official New China News Agency described Deng as walking  vigorously to the polling station inside Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party's  vast, red-walled compound in central Beijing.  </P> <P> "With a beaming smile on his face, Deng received a voting slip from a young  election worker after showing his elector's card," the agency said.  </P> <P> Deng had not made a confirmed appearance in public since July when he visited  the Asian Games Village. A Japanese newspaper recently reported that a tourist  saw Deng and President Yang Shangkun eating dinner in a public restaurant, but  there was no official confirmation.  </P> <P> Since the last sighting of Deng, rumors had circulated that he was on his  deathbed, as happens whenever he is long absent.  </P> <P> Although Deng retired nearly a year ago from his last official post, there is  fear that his death will leave a power vacuum, with no single leader strong  enough to hold together competing ideological and regional factions.  </P></p>

Russia estimates the Cairo document as a fore-sighted  political step, that brought Israel and the PLO closer to the  conclusion of a full-scale agreement on the Gaza Strip and  Jericho, says a statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry  circulated here today.    The agreements that regulate the implementation of the  declaration on principles of temporary Palestinian  self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank are the  result of a compromise.    The latter was made possible by thorough work for  rapprochement of the sides' stands on complicated issues that  had hampered the negotiations. These are communications,  including corridors between Jericho and the Gaza Strip,  security, in particular that of Israeli settlements, and check  points.    The Foreign Ministry believes the most difficult part of  implementation of the Gaza and Jericho formula has been done.    The Arab-Israeli negotiations are part of Russian-Israeli  foreign political consultations underway in Moscow, said the  statement.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Sergey Chugayev article: "Who Will Take on the Sin of </F> Violating the Constitution: the President or the Legislators?"]    [Text] As already reported, on 8 May the Russian president  signed the federal Law "On the Status of the Deputy of the  Federation Council and the Status of a Deputy of the State Duma  of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly."    At the same time B. Yeltsin addressed a letter to the  Federal  Assembly deputies in which he pointed out that the decision to  sign had been difficult, since the law contains  "obvious...contradictions with the Constitution." In the very  near future the legislators are to be sent a list of the  president's amendments, which the head of state proposes that  the deputies should adopt without waiting for the Constitutional  Court's decision.    In all, it is expected that there will be four amendments.  In particular, the right of deputies, recorded in the law, to  freely visit all organs of state power without exception, to be  received without delay by leaders of all ranks, and to receive  answers to their questions within reduced times is to be  disputed. The right, proposed in the law, to put a deputy's  question, the inclusion of additional guarantees of a deputy's  immunity in the text of the law, and also the possibility  granted to servicemen-legislators not to be discharged but  merely to suspend their service in the Armed Forces while  carrying out their duties as a deputy have also been deemed not  in accordance with the Constitution.    It is hard to regard the president's step of signing a  rather  debatable document as anything but a continuation of the policy  of achieving civil accord in the country. The demonstration of  a desire to cooperate with parliament really makes an  impression. From this aspect the only question is whether  Yeltsin will succeed in breaking the well-known trend whereby  all previous similar gestures were regarded by his opponents  exclusively as a weakness.    In the opinion of expert jurists, however, the president's  signature on the law, which he himself has publicly described as  running counter to the Constitution, could have by no means so  clear consequences. The prehistory of the appearance of  Yeltsin's signature on the document seems characteristic in this  connection.    According to available information, the Law on a Deputy's  Status elicited a highly suspicious attitude in the President's  Staff when it was still being discussed in parliament. In the  opinion of jurists on the Presidential Staff, it essentially  means the Sovietization of the Federal Assembly. They believe  that the legislators have been unable to overcome the  stereotyped idea of the people's deputy which took shape during  the years of Soviet power -- the stereotype of someone clever  with voters' affairs, a pusher for the interests of his own  enterprises, and a regional lobbyist, although, as stated in  Article 1 of that same law, the chief and only task of the  deputy is to exercise legislative power. An analysis of  deputies' letters received in the staff of the president and the  government confirms this thesis -- an absolute majority of them  represents lobbying for their own interests or narrow group  interests.    But the jurists were chiefly concerned at the fact that the  legislators had shown a desire to correct the Constitution not  by making amendments to the Fundamental Law but by adopting  legislative acts.    The leaders of the power structures also came out  unexpectedly against the law. As a result, even S. Filatov,  head of the President's Staff, started tending toward a  presidential veto of the document. Of the president's immediate  entourage, virtually only G. Satarov believed that the law  should still be signed. A draft edict on a presidential veto  had been prepared by the State Legal Administration. At the  last moment, however, to all appearances, Satarov's opinion  outweighed the opinion of the rest, and Yeltsin signed the law.  A casualty of these contradictions was the State Legal  Administration, debarred from further work on the law.    A number of jurists believe that the president should not  have recognized the unconstitutionality of the law. By signing  it, he assumed responsibility for the constitutionality of the  law and himself violated the Constitution. According to  available information, the leadership of the State Legal  Administration under the president sent Yeltsin a letter which  states, in particular, that, by signing the law, the president  publicly recognized his double violation of the Constitution and  that his political opponents are most likely making use of this  circumstance.</p>

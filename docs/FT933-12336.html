			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges ahead as bond prices tumble Wall Street US stock markets ended the week on a positive note yesterday as share prices posted solid gains across the board on a burst of late buying, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 21.52 firmer at 3,546.74. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 2.59 at 447.10, while the Amex composite finished 0.69 higher at 432.05, and the Nasdaq composite up 4.72 at 700.24. Trading volume on the NYSE was 218m shares. The equity markets ended a week of see-sawing share prices with further fluctuations. Thursday's 30-point sell-off prompted some early buying, lifting the Dow 20 points in the opening half an hour of trading. Prices could not hold on to their gains, however, and continued selling in the bond markets - where the benchmark 30-year government bond fell  23/32 to 105 11/32 , yielding 6.704 per cent - quickly unsettled equity investors, forcing stocks to retreat to opening values. Stocks subsequently staged their second rally of the day in the final hour of trading as futures-related program buying in a thin market lifted prices across the board. Among individual stocks, Walt Disney climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 39 1/2 after the company's stock was upgraded by Prudential Securities and the State of California announced it would fund the building of access roads to Disney's new theme park. Oil stocks were mostly firmer as more companies announced strong quarterly earnings. Exxon, which reported second quarter profits of 98 cents a share, up from 73 cents a share a year ago, climbed Dollars 7/8 to Dollars 65 1/8 . Chevron rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 87 5/8 , Texaco Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 62 1/4 , Mobil Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 71, and Amoco Dollars 3/8 to Dollars 53 1/8 . Sunbeam-Oster jumped Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 18 3/8 after the company announced plans to buy back 12.4m shares from a partnership headed by former chief executive Mr Paul Kazarian. Ralston-Purina dropped Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 39 after brokers' downgraded the stock following disappointing fiscal third quarter earnings of 59 cents a share, down slightly from a year ago and well below expectations. Telmex climbed Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 49 1/8 in heavy trading on news of a solid rise in first half earnings. On the Nasdaq market, Amgen rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 36 1/8 after the chairman said 1993 earnings would come in between Dollars 2.35 and Dollars 2.42 a share, up from Dollars 2.11 a share in 1992. Canada TORONTO stock prices closed lower in quiet, end-of-the-week trading. According to preliminary figures, the composite index fell 8.31 points, or 0.22 per cent, to close at 3,830.19. Declining issues outnumbered advances 353 to 313. Volume was 40.089m shares, down from Thursday's 50.896m shares, and trading value fell to CDollars 417.6m from CDollars 517.9m. The decline was the index's seventh in the past eight sessions, and brought the index's decline for the week to about 72 points. Since closing just below 4,000 points on July 2, the index has tumbled almost 170 points, or more than 4 per cent. Yesterday, seven of 14 sub-indexes finished lower, led by transport and financial services, both off 1.0 per cent.</p>

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / World Trade News: Japan seeks protection from discriminatory deals Japan yesterday sought multilateral protection from pressures, mainly by the US, to strike bilateral deals on trade and investment discriminating against Tokyo's interests. A senior Japanese official yesterday asked the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to issue a declaration 'prohibiting bilateral negotiations by any OECD country' leading to one-sided trade and investment measures. Mr Noburu Hatakeyama, special adviser to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), complained to an OECD conference on 'the globalisation of industry' of recent US pressure to get Japanese electronics companies to buy up to 20 per cent of their semi-conductors from foreign sources, and for Japanese-owned car companies in the US to favour parts from US-owned manufacturers over other sources. Mr Hatakeyama, a former vice-minister of Miti, said he hoped that a ministerial OECD meeting next year would take a general stance against such discriminatory pressures. He claimed quite wide support from other delegations, but acknowledged some like the US regarded it as 'idealistic'. OECD declarations have no binding force on member countries. 'But if we keep stressing the importance of prohibiting bilateral negotiations which result in very discriminatory decisions, ultimately this kind of political declaration will get support, and bit by bit many OECD countries, including the US, will abide by it,' Mr Hatakeyama said in an interview. The Miti adviser also praised Mexican legislation, passed in the wake of US approval of the North American Trade Association, to give other countries the same freedom to invest in Mexico as the US and Canada will have through Nafta. As part of a new round of US-Japanese talks, begun in July while Mr Hatakeyama was still vice minister of Miti, 'the US has recently asked us to issue guidelines to our industry established in the US to purchase parts from 'traditional' - by which they mean American - suppliers, rather than Japanese auto component manufacturers established in the US,' he said. Washington, he complained, was even asking Tokyo to favour the import into Japan of car parts from US companies over those which could be supplied by Japanese-owned companies in the US. If successful, the Uruguay Round will help remove certain 'trade-related investment measures' such as those which require investors to promise to export a certain share of their production, and remove discrimination in the service sector. 'But this Gatt round will not deal with discrimination in industrial or agricultural investment', he said. 'That is a big hole, which perhaps the OECD can help fill'.</p>

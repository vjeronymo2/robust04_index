			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan lacerated by political speculation BOURSES were balanced between interest rate hopes in a number of countries, French fears about oil refining margins and Italy's crumbling economic and political scene, writes Our Market Staff. MILAN was overwhelmed for much of the session by speculation that the Prime Minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, was about to resign. The Comit index fell 10.56 or 2.1 per cent to 476.91. Privatisation issues, now effectively on hold, at least until after the electoral reform referendum on April 18, came under pressure. Credito Italiano fixed L145 lower at L2,580 and slid to L2,555 on the kerb while Banca Commerciale Italiana fell L199 to L4,252. Continuing speculation about the possibility of an international accord provided some support for Fiat. The shares fixed L50 higher at L5,900 but fell back in late business to L5,730. Benetton fell L183 to L14,933 with its 12 per cent rise in 1992 net profit, announced late on Monday, failing to match expectations. FRANKFURT noted Bundesbank supportfor small interest rate cuts, and staged a late rally which took the DAX index up 10.15 to 1,685.07. Turnover recovered from DM4.7bn to DM6.1bn. Mr Nigel Longley, of Commerzbank, said that the main corporate story of the day was Siemens, DM7.90 higher at DM648.90 in turnover up from DM726m to DM1.1bn. Following the German embargo on submarine orders for Taiwan, there was news of power station orders from China. Porsche rose DM23 or 5.8 per cent to DM500 on to a chart signal, trading in unusually heavy lots in an illiquid market. Commerbank itself rose DM6.30 to DM710.60, responding to a story in a New York newspaper. PARIS lost its impetus in late afternoon as oil stocks were hit by worries about refining margins, the CAC-40 closing just 2.05 higher at 2,035.91. Total and Elf Aquitaine fell FFr5.40 to FFr259, and FFr4.60 to FFr384.40 in reaction to Esso SAF results and its chairman's pessimistic outlook for 1993. Esso itself dropped a weighty FFr84, or 10.3 per cent to FFr735. Turnover was FFr3.9bn, a far cry from last Friday's total which, with block activity outside the market or after market hours, added up to an all-time record of FFr8.4bn, said Mr John Fordyce at Ferri International. Yesterday's Kleinwort Benson/Paribas placing of Carrefour's 28.8 per cent stake in Castorama, meanwhile, brought plaudits for the brokers but left Carrefour FFr47 lower at FFr2,686. ZURICH finished at a record high that took the SMI index up 13.0 to 2,189.3 ahead of the Roche results tomorrow. Ciba's 19 per cent profits rise was in line with expectations but the bearers fell SFr9 to SFr637 on news that the group planned to introduce a single share class. The registered rose SFr4 to SFr618. Roche certificates added SFr40 to SFr4,180 ahead of Thursday's results, expected by some dealers to be strong. Among engineering issues, Schindler rose SFr200 or 4.4 per cent to SFr4,670 but analysts said they knew of no particular reason for the rise. AMSTERDAM saw a slight pick up in turnover with renewed optimism about the economic outlook provoking demand from institutional investors. The CBS Tendency index added 0.90 to 107.30. Akzo, the chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, shed Fl 1.70 to Fl 149.30 after a newspaper report about lower German drugs sales. Nutricia, the food group added Fl 3.00 to Fl 128.50 in continued response to Monday's results while the publisher VNU rose Fl 2.30 to Fl 108.60 on raising its stake in a Belgian television company. MADRID closed at a 1993 high, boosted by hopes of a cut in interest rates and a rush of end of quarter trade. The general index rose 1.71 to 241.40 in turnover of Pta33.28bn. COPENHAGEN gained support from recent rate cuts and the KFX index rose 1.35 per cent to 81.20. East Asiatic, the shipping and consumer products group, added DKr13 or 19 per cent to DKr81 after the sale of its shipping activities to AP Moller. HELSINKI continued higher, the Hex index adding 1.45 per cent at 1,033.1, for a rise of 7.6 per cent over the last five trading sessions. Nokia preferred shares firmed FM3 to FM128 on the more positive outlook. ISTANBUL rose another 1.7 pct as fresh cash came in from maturing repurchase agrrements in the bond market, the market index closing 96.87 higher at 5,861.81 for a two-day gain of 3.6 per cent.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 30                                            THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes            Open       10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1148.59    1149.71    1149.37    1150.71 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1218.66    1219.15    1216.31    1216.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100      1151.91    1152.44    1154.26    1152.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1217.87    1218.25    1219.40    1219.87  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 29    Mar 26    Mar 25    Mar 24    Mar 23  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1148.76   1147.31   1133.08   1130.66   1131.55 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1213.37   1213.80   1200.17   1202.55   1203.95  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  1154.33 ; 200 -  1220.19 Low/day: 100 -  1148.59  200 -  1215.75 .  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 6 KYODO -- The Food Agency will halve  the amount of Thai rice it allots to rice wholesalers in May due  to poor sales, agency officials said Friday [6 May]. Stocks of  the Thai grain are beginning to pile up at both the wholesale  and retail stages in reflection of its unpopularity among  consumers, the officials said.    The step is temporary and the agency will decide on further  measures after seeing how sales go, they said.    Rice wholesalers said, however, it will be difficult to  adjust the oversupply in Thai rice unless the government  continues to cut down on its compulsory allocation.    The agency has so far sold domestic rice, imported medium-  to  short-grained rice, and long-grained Thai rice at a 3-to-5-to-2  ratio.    Thai rice has proved difficult to sell, with many consumers  leaving packages at stores after unwillingly buying them in a  set with other types of the grain, according to industry  officials.</p>

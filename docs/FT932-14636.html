			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Lasmo flounders Oil exploration and production group Lasmo ended a difficult week under renewed pressure. The shares closed 5 1/2 lower at 142 1/2 p, having equalled the 1993 low of 141 1/2 p at one stage. Dealers said that the sellers appeared on the scene after SG Warburg Securities lowered its net asset value for the group, along with a general reappraisal on the exploration production sub-sector. Lasmo was the worst performer in the Footsie 100 index last month, falling by more than 14 per cent after the troubled group slashed the final dividend. Dealers said the continued selling also reflected lingering worries that Lasmo might lose its Footsie 100 status when the FT-SE Steering Committee meets on June 9.</p>

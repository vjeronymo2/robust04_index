			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / UK Company News: British Coal sell-off marked Energy Minister Mr Tim Eggar (right) yesterday donned hardhat and overalls to put the seal on the transfer of British Coal's 15 English pits to private ownership. He was visiting the Ashfordby mine, a new 1.5m tonne superpit which, as of yesterday, is owned by RJB Mining. Earlier this month the group surprised its critics by raising Pounds 400m from investors through a placing and public offer to help fund the Pounds 815m purchase. Mr Richard Budge, RJB's chief executive, (left) had been attacked for the assumptions on coal prices and volumes used to devise his offer. RJB's investors were rewarded for backing the controversial bid with a 4p rise in the shares over the 320p placing price. However, the old RJB shares fell by 15p to 333p, reflecting the decline in the mining sector since the shares were suspended at 348p in October. The difference in price is due to the fact that the new equity is not eligible for the promised final dividend of 7.3p. Meanwhile, Coal Investments announced that public investors had taken up more than half the shares available to them in the Pounds 26m placing and open offer. The public has applied for 9.45m of the eligible 18.24m open offer shares on the basis of 4-for-13 at 76 1/2 p. Coal Investments announced the issue earlier this month to help it fund capital expenditure and increase its holding in Mining (Scotland), which has purchased British Coal's Scottish region.</p>

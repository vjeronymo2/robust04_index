			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Poipet, Cambodia, Jan 12 (AFP) -- Khmer Rouge  rebels attacked and disabled a bridge early Wednesday, just one  day before the Thai and Cambodian premiers were due to  inaugurate it, a Cambodian military security officer said.    One Cambodian government soldier was killed and three were  injured in a 30-minute firefight, the officer said.    He quoted officers stationed in [name indistinct] Borei, 30  kilometers (20 miles) east of the Thai border, as saying that  one Khmer Rouge guerrilla had also died.    The bridge, one of two built by Thai engineers on Cambodia's  Highway 5, is now impassable, the Cambodian officer said.    Thai military officials responsible for the border region  could not confirm the report.    Questioned by telephone from Bangkok, they said they were  too  far from the reported attack site to investigate.    Thai Prime Minister Chuan Likphai, on a three-day visit to  Cambodia to solidify economic and political relations, is  scheduled open the bridge Thursday with Cambodian co-premier Hun  Sen.    Both Thai and Cambodian officials maintained the incident  would not affect Thursday's ceremony, though contingents of  military police from the two countries had been reinforced.    Tanks and armored personnel carriers were moved into Poipet,  opposite an area controlled by the Khmer Rouge, and Thailand  temporarily closed its Klong Leuk-Poipet checkpoint, an officer  said.    The Thailand-Cambodian Border Coordination Office has asked  for a temporary ceasefire.    Meanwhile, heavy fighting between Khmer Rouge and government  forces broke out 15 miles south in Phum Takong Krao district,  Thai and Cambodian officers said.    Heavy artillery, rockets and self-propelled guns were  reportedly used in the two-hour skirmish which began at 7a.m.  (0000 GMT), they said. Casualty and injury reports were not  immediately available.</p>

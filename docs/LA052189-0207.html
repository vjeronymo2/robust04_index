			<p><P> May 21, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CLARIFICATION  </P> <P> An editor's note accompanying last week's Letters gave an erroneous figure for  the price of Tokyo real estate. The correct price is $6.7 billion per acre, as  stated in Catherine Collins' May 7 Speaking Out article, not $6.7 million.  </P></p>

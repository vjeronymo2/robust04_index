			<p><P> March 31, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 4 STRANDED CUBANS CAN'T REENTER U.S.  </P> <P> A Cuban family stranded in Canada by immigration problems since December will  not be allowed to return to its home in Miami while the family's application  for asylum is pending, federal officials said Thursday.  </P> <P> Benedict Ferro, district director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization  Service, said that he has denied a request for humanitarian parole for Carlos  Fajardo, his wife, Bermaida Zamora-Powers, and her two children, Yoradlys Diaz  and Yoandys Diaz.  </P> <P> The decision was the result of new information that immigration officials  uncovered about the family, Ferro said. "In this case, the negative aspects (of  granting a parole) far outweighed the evidence on their behalf," he said. Ferro  would not elaborate.  </P> <P> The family has been stranded in Ontario since Dec. 23, when it crossed the  border to view Niagara Falls from the Canadian side and was denied permission  to return to the United States because of what officials said is a history of  immigration fraud.  </P></p>

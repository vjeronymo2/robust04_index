In April 1992, the Generic Drugs Advisory Committee met to consider methods for documenting the bioequivalence of topical corticosteroids. Subsequently, on July 1, 1992, the Office of Generic Drugs issued a guidance document entitled ``Interim Guidance for Topical Corticosteroids:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In Vivo <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Bioequivalence and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In Vitro <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Release Methods.'' The purpose of the September 1994 meeting is to reexamine the 1992 interim guidance in light of new experimental data and methods of analysis. On September 12, 1994, the committee will discuss the pharmacodynamic (i.e., vasoconstrictor) measurement of bioequivalence. On September 13, 1994, this topic will be further discussed along with other issues related to the documentation of equivalence according to the interim guidance. Discussion will be limited to dermatologic products and will not include ophthalmic or inhaled corticosteroid products. Also, on September 13, 1994, there will be a review of the current status of topics discussed at previous Generic Drugs advisory committee meetings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FDA public advisory committee meetings may have as many as four separable portions: (1) An open public hearing, (2) an open committee discussion, (3) a closed presentation of data, and (4) a closed committee deliberation. Every advisory committee meeting shall have an open public hearing portion. Whether or not it also includes any of the other three portions will depend upon the specific meeting involved. There are no closed portions for the meetings announced in this notice.

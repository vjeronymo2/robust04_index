			<p>940620 FT  20 JUN 94 / UK Company News: BET incentive gives directors Pounds 4.6m boost Executive directors at BET, the business services group which returned to the black for 1993-94, stand to gain Pounds 4.6m from an incentive plan established during the year. The annual report also shows that the total remuneration of Mr John Clark, chief executive, rose by 30 per cent from Pounds 708,000 to Pounds 924,000, including Pounds 281,000 in bonuses and Pounds 163,000 in pension contributions. The report says that the group, which is reviewing its remuneration strategy for senior executives, 'continues to view share-based incentive schemes as a key motivator for them to deliver superior performance and increases in shareholder value'. On Friday the shares closed at 118p - just 2p above the year's low. The group's remuneration committee, led by Lord Tebbit, operates the medium-term incentive plan, which is described as a key component of its revised strategy. It has set target benefits for 60 eligible executives 'to recognise the performance and contribution of participants during the turnround period (1991-93) and their continuing superior performance during the next three to five years'. The group has made an initial provision of Pounds 2m. In order to trigger the benefit the share price must reach 'a minimum predetermined threshold' and exceed the FT-SE-A All-Share Index 'by a challenging margin'. However, details are not given. Awards will be made in BET shares bought at the market price. Recipients will have to hold the shares for at least six months. Last month BET announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 92m in the year to April 2, compared with losses of Pounds 9.8m. Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the privatised UK airports group, was paid a total of Pounds 544,000 last year, up 33 per cent on 1992-93, the annual report shows. His performance-related bonus increased from Pounds 82,000 to Pounds 119,000, and he received pension contributions of Pounds 11,000 in addition to salary and taxable benefits of Pounds 414,000.</p>

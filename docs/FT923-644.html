			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / ITN faces cash crisis over lease on offices INDEPENDENT Television News faces a growing financial crisis because of the failure to let most of its new headquarters in central London. The television news organisation, owned by the ITV companies, is facing a deficit on the lease of the building that could rise to Pounds 25m over the next five years. The deficit could lead to further calls for cash from the ITV companies when some are facing severe pressure as a result of the recession and the prospect of paying larger amounts for new franchises. The problems stem from moves by the ITV companies in 1987 to try to make a profit by deciding that ITN should rent its entire building. The shortfall has nothing to do with the efficiency of the news service which has been tightened up since the admission earlier this year that costs had been underestimated by Pounds 9.8m. The ITV companies covered the shortfall. The problems over property, which are unlikely to improve because of the recession in the property market, could be more difficult to solve. Three ITN shareholders - Thames, TVS, and TSW - have lost their franchises and it is not clear how they will react to being asked to fund what is likely to be a continuing shortfall. New companies such as Carlton Television and Meridian, which are not at the moment ITN shareholders, are unlikely to want to pay for deficits resulting from decisions taken before they even applied for their franchises. In the 1990 Broadcasting Act the government insisted that 51 per cent of ITN should be held by companies that are not ITV broadcasters by the end of 1994. At the very least the uncertainties could make it difficult to find new shareholders at an early date. Some senior ITV executives now wonder whether it will be possible for ITN to find any new shareholders at all in time for the government's deadline. Central London is awash with unlet office space, and although ITN has managed to find some tenants it is believed they have had to be given generous rent-free periods. However, talks are believed to be going well between ITN and the ITV companies about a new five-year contract to supply television news. HTV results, Page 10</p>

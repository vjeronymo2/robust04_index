			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / European electorates conclude PR is less than perfect BRITAIN goes to the polls today alone among European Community partners in operating a first-past-the-post system in all its elections, Our Foreign Staff writes. Both the Conservatives and Labour have been put on the spot in the election campaign by demands by their smaller rival, the Liberal Democrats, for the introduction of proportional representation. Those in favour say it is more democratic, while opponents say it produces unstable coalitions and allows parliamentary seats to minority groups with little electoral support. Yet the results of regional and national polls in Italy, France and Germany within the past month are increasing pressure for reform of their varying PR systems. In Italy, a general election has produced political fragmentation to the point that its governability is in doubt. In Germany and France, extreme right-wing parties have squeezed into regional parliaments, some with just a small proportion of votes. Italy's general election on Sunday produced a lower house in which 16 parties won seats, 12 of them with less than 6 per cent of the vote each. Politicians from all the main parties in Italy have long sought to change the system, but a lack of consensus has prevented reform. A cross-party group of MPs is backing a hybrid form of PR for the Senate, or upper house: 268 of the 315 seats would be first-past-the-post with the remainder elected on a proportional basis. Proposals for the more important 630-seat chamber of deputies seek to strengthen the vote for large parties or alliances, to provide a stable majority. The Christian Democrats want to retain proportional representation for 88 per cent of the seats and to introduce a form of premium in the distribution of the remaining seats to the parties or alliances with the largest share of votes. In France, huge losses by the ruling socialists in regional and local elections have fuelled the debate for reform to the National Assembly. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the new prime minister, said yesterday he would appoint a committee to come up with proposals for change by October 15. However, reform would not take place until after general elections due next year. The debate on electoral reform in France has been tainted by accusations of political manipulation and by the effects of PR on recent regional elections. President Francois Mitterrand implied last November a modest dose of PR was desirable. The aim of this was to secure a fairer representation in the National Assembly of the different currents of opinions in the country. The present system for the assembly is based on majority voting in single-member constituencies, but with two rounds of voting. In the first round an absolute majority is required for election; in the second it is first-past-the post. The regional elections showed an enormous push by protest groups not represented in parliament. A further problem is that the wide dispersal of voting has made it difficult to put together stable-looking regional government coalitions. In Germany, lack of leadership rather than a failure of Germany's bespoke electoral system brought about the events of last weekend when 21 far-right members entered the state parliaments in Schleswig-Holstein and Baden-Wurttemberg. The validity of the system, known as 'personalised proportional representation', has been questioned in similar circumstances in the past, but has been found to serve its basic purpose: protecting and stabilising parliamentary democracy. It comprises a 50:50 blend of first-past-the post constituency voting and national representation according to party lists. Every voter has two votes: one for the local candidate, the other for a party. Half the members of parliament are elected with a simple majority emerging in each constituency. The others come from lists of nominees drawn up by local or regional party organisations. The key factor in distribution of the 'list seats' is that, before a party will be considered in the allotment process, it must have won at least 5 per cent of the total number of second votes cast. The purpose is to prevent the extreme fragmentation of the party system, which characterised the dying days of the Weimar Republic. The 5 per cent clause has worked effectively to reduce the number of parties in the Bundestag. From 1949, when there were 12, the figure has shrunk to six, including the remnants of the GDR Communist party. Between 1961 and 1983, however, before the 'alternative' Greens emerged, there were only four. At the weekend, the system kept the Greens - only about 400 votes short of the 5 per cent limit - out of the Schleswig-Holstein assembly, which just allowed the Social Democrats to maintain absolute power. It also allowed in another 'alternative' - the extremist DVU. Few can doubt the possibility of electoral reform in Europe. But as Mr Beregovoy said yesterday: 'No system is perfect.'</p>

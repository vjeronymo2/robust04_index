Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a disease which occurs from the destruction of normal kidney tissues over a long period of time. The individual often does not experience any symptoms until the kidney has lost more than half of its function. The loss of kidney function in ESRD is usually irreversible and permanent.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Related Law and Regulations for Medicare Coverage of ESRD and the Definition of ESRD  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226A(a)(2) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides for Medicare coverage for certain individuals who are medically determined to have end-stage renal disease. Once an individual is medically determined to have ESRD, section 226A(b) of the Act specifies that one of two conditions must be met before entitlement begins. That is, a regular course of dialysis must begin or a kidney transplant must be performed. Section 226A(b)(1)(A) of the Act provides that entitlement begins with the third month after the month in which a regular course of renal dialysis is initiated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The statute does not give a definition of ESRD; however, the Medicare regulations in title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations do define the term. The definition of ESRD is given in two sections of the regulations. For purposes of Medicare eligibility and entitlement, ESRD is currently defined in &sect;406.13(b) as that stage of kidney impairment that appears irreversible and permanent and requires a regular course of dialysis or kidney transplantation to maintain life. A parallel definition of ESRD also appears in &sect;405.2102 which defines ESRD as it relates to the conditions for coverage that must be met by suppliers furnishing ESRD care to Medicare beneficiaries.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Potential Misinterpretation of the Current ESRD Definition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calendar year 1989, 21,200 individuals were certified by their physicians as having an irreversible, permanent kidney impairment and obtained Medicare entitlement solely because of this certification. That is, they could not qualify for Medicare on any other basis, such as age or disability status. In calendar year 1990, the number of similar new beneficiaries was 22,800. Soon after obtaining Medicare eligibility, nearly 1 percent of these individuals terminated their course of dialysis with a return of kidney function. We are concerned that the diagnosis and certification of ESRD for these individuals was incorrect. The regulations in &sect;&sect;405.2102 and 406.13(b) define ESRD as a condition that appears irreversible and permanent; Medicare entitlement on the basis of the patient's need for dialysis is usually terminated only if the individual dies or receives a kidney transplant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Any severe kidney condition (particularly acute kidney failure) may appear to be irreversible and permanent if the diagnosis is based on only limited tests and criteria. We believe that certifications for the patients who terminated dialysis may have arisen from a misunderstanding of the extent of the kidney failure which constitutes ESRD for which the law grants Medicare entitlement. We believe that specifying that the diagnosis must be based on generally accepted diagnostic criteria and laboratory findings may result in not enrolling in Medicare those patients whose renal disease is not ``end-stage''. However, we do not wish to eliminate the word, ``appears,'' from the regulation since the law recognizes that dialysis treatments may end in some ESRD cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Related Laws and Regulations for Termination of Medicare Entitlement and Resumption of Entitlement to ESRD Benefits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 226A(b)(2) of the Act specifies that Medicare entitlement for individuals on the basis of ESRD terminates with the end of the 36th month after the month of transplant or with the end of the 12th month after the last month of renal dialysis treatments. Section 226A(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the Act specifically provides for beginning a new period of entitlement when a kidney transplant fails or a course of renal dialysis begins again, whether during or after the 36 or 12 months, as applicable. Current regulations in &sect;406.13(f) address these situations by specifying that entitlement does not end as scheduled if the treatment begins again during the applicable periods. The regulations in &sect;406.13(g) deal with resumption of entitlement after termination of entitlement has occurred and require the submission of a new application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

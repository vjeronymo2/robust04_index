			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chico Otavio] </F>   [Text] Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, 8 Jun (AE) -- The National  Agrarian Secretariat of the PT [Workers Party] has stated that  the land reform policy it intends to implement in Brazil, if it  wins the elections, will involve 17.5 million hectares. The  plan is included in the program of PT presidential candidate  Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Jose Graziano da Silva, the program  coordinator, said expropriation will be the main instrument for  land redistribution.    Graziano is accompanying Lula on a three-day visit to  Espirito Santo. He released a pamphlet to owners of small farms  outlining some points of the PT-designed "Program for Brazilian  Agriculture." A new feature mentioned in the pamphlet is the  possibility for farmers to use land as a way to repay their  defaulted loans with federal banks.    Graziano said one of the program priorities is the  settlement  of 800,000 families over a four-year period. The PT intends to  settle some 250,000 families in a semi-arid zone in the  northeastern region -- the so-called Drought Polygon. The  objective is to give an average of four hectares to each family,  which would provide work for at least two people per family.  This project will require about 1 million hectares.    Under the project another 550,000 landless families from all  over Brazil will be given between 20 and 30 hectares each,  depending on the region. The federal government will need  approximately 16.5 million hectares to implement this plan.  Graziano said preference will be given to squatters camping  along highways, squatters occupying indigenous land, and  squatters in areas under dispute.    Expropriation will affect mainly unproductive properties  above 500 hectares -- an area that is enough to house 20  families. The use of land to repay the defaulted loans of  farmers is also considered a land reform instrument.</p>

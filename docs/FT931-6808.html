			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Venue for chess match rejected GARY KASPAROV and his British challenger Nigel Short have refused to play their world chess championship match in Manchester and are setting up a rival organisation to Fide, the international chess federation, to stage their own version of the event. Mr Kasparov and Mr Short said they would play for the championship under the auspices of the Professional Chess Association. They would give 10 per cent of the prize fund to set up the association. Manchester City Council said the dispute was between Fide and the players. It hoped problems would be resolved quickly so plans could continue to stage the match in August. Fide refused to comment before it had confirmed a statement issued by the players in London yesterday This claimed Fide had shown 'wilful disregard' by not consulting the players about accepting Manchester's bid, as Fide said on Tuesday it had. The statement was issued by Simpson's-in-the-Strand, the London restaurant which is a traditional centre for chess. But Mr Ray Keene, a British grandmaster who is chess correspondent of The Times and an adviser to Mr Kasparov, said it had been prepared with the players' collaboration by himself and Mr Dominic Lawson, editor of The Spectator, Weekend FT columnist and an adviser to Mr Short. Mr Lawson said: 'Nigel Short was on a boat between Italy and Greece when Fide announced its decision. He had specifically said he wanted to study all the bids, which he was not allowed to do. Players at this level will not be treated as pawns.' Mr Keene said: 'This has been coming for years. We are confident all the world's leading professionals will join the new association.' The players yesterday invited new bids for their match. Mr Keene said the London Chess Group - a group of businesses supporting the game - had yesterday confirmed it would bid again after losing to Manchester. Manchester wants the match but is unlikely to bid for fear of antagonising the International Olympic Committee by going against an official international umbrella organisation for a sport. Manchester is bidding to stage the 2000 games.</p>

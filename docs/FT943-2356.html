			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / Fewer foreign ships held after tests Sixteen foreign ships were detained in British ports in August after failing safety inspections, the Marine Safety Agency said in its third monthly report yesterday. In July 21 ships were held. Many of the detained vessels revealed serious defects. The most common problems were with lifesaving or firefighting equipment, but many ships had faults in their radio installations or carried inadequately qualified crews. The Nesrin A, a Turkish-owned general cargo ship, was held for 17 days because its emergency fire pump did not work, the bridge fire alarm was out of order, charts were out of date and a large number of its hatches were seized up or missing. The Cyprus-owned Concert Trader had badly corroded plating on its bow section, sea-water contamination in its fresh-water tank and a chief engineer who was only certified for journeys between the islands of Indonesia. Three of the ships held were registered under the Cyprus flag, two were registered in Bulgaria, and the same number in Russia. The government started publishing details of unsafe ships after an inquiry into marine pollution incidents, headed by Lord Donaldson. Details of ships detained are passed to 14 other European nations, allowing ships with a poor record to be selected for future inspection. The failure of the 'flag states' adequately to monitor the quality of the vessels they register has led to increased action by the port states, at whose ports the vessels call. Four of the ships detained in August had been inspected and approved by Germanischer Lloyd of Germany, three by Bureau Veritas of France and two each by the Bulgarian Register of Shipping, the Russian Register and Lloyd's Register of London. One Israeli vessel had not been approved by any classification society. The societies have been criticised for failing to impose strict standards but the International Association of Classification Societies, which groups the 11 biggest, said that under the tough conditions at sea defects could emerge after a survey has been carried out.</p>

			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / Tory election leaflet sparks row The Labour party yesterday accused the Tories of making false claims in the Dudley, West Midlands, local election campaign, breaching the Representation of the People Act, Paul Cheeseright writes. The row, in a so far tepid campaign where Labour is seeking to hold on to a two-seat majority, erupted in the Amblecote ward, where Labour won a seat by a handful of votes in 1990. A campaign leaflet sent out by Mr John Martin, the Tory candidate, and published by Mr Colin Banks, his agent, reprinted an article from The Sun newspaper which alleged that three Labour councillors had planned to visit New Delhi and study the Indian Fire Brigade. A Labour official said last night that 'never had any such trip been planned whatsoever'. A letter to Mr Banks from Mr Fraser Kemp, Labour's west Midlands organiser, demanded a retraction, a public apology and threatened to pass the whole matter to the director of public prosecutions. Mr Banks commented that the leaflet had touched 'a raw nerve'.</p>

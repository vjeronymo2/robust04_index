			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 11 Feb--The Foreign Affairs Ministry has  made the following statement available to the Polish Press  Agency:    "The Polish Government resolutely condemns all acts of  violence taking place in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including in  particular, the terrorist shooting of the civilian population in  Sarajevo.    In the opinion of the Polish Government, the stand of the  NATO states, as presented in the decisions taken during the  North Atlantic Council session of 9 February this year, is a  balanced one toward all sides in the conflict. It takes into  account, in the right way, the role of the United Nations and  meets its resolutions half-way. It takes into consideration the  necessity of insuring the complete security of the UN forces and  that of other observation and humanitarian missions that find  themselves on the territory of the former Yugoslavia.    This last matter is of particular importance for Poland in  view of the presence of a Polish contingent in the UN Protection  Force (UNPROFOR).    The Polish Government shares the stand of the NATO states,  and expresses the hope that the present heightening of the  conflict can be defused without the need to use force."</p>

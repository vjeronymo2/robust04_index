			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / Recession and fares war take BA down 23% BRITISH AIRWAYS, the world's most profitable airline, has not escaped the combined effects of recession and the fierce airlines fares war which led to a 22.7 per cent fall in second-quarter pre-tax profits. Lord King, BA chairman, warned yesterday that prospects for the financial year ending March 1993 remained 'uncertain'. Although pre-tax profits for the first half rose 22.7 per cent to Pounds 227m, second-quarter earnings tumbled to Pounds 136m from Pounds 176m in the same quarter last year. This was below City expectations and BA shares fell 8.5 per cent to close 23p lower at 248p. Sir Colin Marshall, chief executive, said second-quarter profits were affected by the absence of aircraft disposals, which produced a Pounds 25m gain in the same period last year, as well as a Pounds 16m negative swing on currency exchanges and a Pounds 6m loss on the start-up costs of the airline's new German subsidiary Deutsche BA. Excluding these factors, second-quarter operating profits showed a modest 2.4 per cent increase to Pounds 169m. Although disappointed by the second-quarter figures, Lord King said the performance was strong compared with other carriers when international airlines are forecasting a loss of more than Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.65bn) this year. 'While we continue to achieve results which are the envy of our competitors, we, like them, have suffered from the effects of the recession,' he added. Although BA continued to experience overall traffic growth, Lord King said it did not expect an increase in high-yielding business and first-class travel until the world economy recovers. BA carried 13.7m passengers on scheduled services in the first half, a 9.7 per cent increase over last year. But passenger yield - the average price paid per passenger for each kilometre flown - fell almost 6.8 per cent because of weakness in premium traffic, aggressive pricing in the industry and the relative strength of sterling during the period. Turnover in the first half increased 7.6 per cent to Pounds 2.89bn. Profits after tax in the first half rose 19.7 per cent to Pounds 182m while per-share earnings rose 17.1 per cent to 24.7p. The interim dividend was increased 4.1 per cent to 3.06p. Lex, Page 20; Details, Page 22</p>

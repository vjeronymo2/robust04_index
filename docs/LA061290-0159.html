			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SPECIALISTS ASSIST GLOBAL FLOW OF MONEY;  </P> <P> TRADE: THE JOB OF FINALIZING AGREEMENTS AND THEN TRANSFERRING SECURITIES IS  HIGHLY SPECIALIZED AND ALSO A MONEYMAKER.  </P> <P> It has become commonplace to speak of global capital flows as though the  billions upon billions shuffling around the planet around the clock were  dispatched at the merest touch of a button.  </P> <P> Sal Ricca knows it's not always that easy.  </P> <P> As president of Sequor Group, a division of Los Angeles-based Security Pacific  National Bank, Ricca is one of an increasingly specialized breed of financial  professionals who enable capital to roam the globe.  </P> <P> Their business is clearing and settlement -- the timely completion of complex  transactions, most often involving institutional investors and government  securities, across borders, time zones and currencies. Clearance -- when the  buyer pays the seller -- and settlement -- when the seller transfers securities  to the buyer -- are what make global markets possible.  </P> <P> "You can't buy and sell to your heart's content in money markets without being  mindful of how you're going to settle the transactions," said Ricca, who  conveys a technician's appreciation of the world markets machine.  </P> <P> "If you could trade and settle simultaneously, at the push of a button, the  amount of transactions that could be done is staggering," he said. "Trading is  gated by the ability to settle a transaction."  </P> <P> Burgeoning global financial activity, not only in New York, Tokyo, London and  other centers, but in emerging markets in Singapore, Manila and Kuala Lumpur  and elsewhere, has made settlement critical. Deals aren't done until they're  done with finality -- market parlance for cash in hand.  </P> <P> Though not the settlement leader, Sequor illustrates how global office services  -- clearance, instrument transferal and safekeeping, foreign exchange money  conversion and movement -- are now banking profit centers.  </P> <P> Sequor's parent doesn't release the unit's results. But Sequor spokesman  Patrick Scorese said the group, created in 1989 when the bank combined five  processing areas, accounts for roughly 10% of the holding company's 1989  earnings of $740.6 million.  </P> <P> "It's a major contributor, there's no doubt," said Robert Manheimer, a Sequor  managing director and president of Security Pacific International Bank, the  group's foreign exchange and trade financing arm.  </P> <P> "Years ago, moving money was merely an accommodation," Manheimer said. "There  weren't specific prices charged . . . it was a different world."  </P> <P> Now, he said, "there's been a tremendous growth in the number of transactions  that have to be settled. Banks realize that this is a good business and their  attention has been focused on this."  </P> <P> "It's something everybody is talking about a lot," said banking management  consultant Steve Runan of McKinsey &amp; Co. "They're paying more attention to  it because it's a fee-based revenue generator."  </P> <P> He offered the caveat, though, that the heavy investment in technology needed  to succeed may limit the ranks of profitable players.  </P> <P> Most major U.S. banks engage in settlement, but some institutions, including  Manufacturers Hanover and Chase Manhattan Bank, have begun to bundle and more  aggressively market such processing services. Revenues from them are all the  more important in a time when banks, just getting past the 1980s Third World  debt debacle, face a new fiasco in real estate lending.  </P> <P> A rough gauge of activity is message volume in the Clearing House Interbank  Payments System, or Chips, in New York, the primary U.S. network for settling  foreign exchange and money market transactions. Chips volume leaders in 1989  were Citibank, Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust, Manufacturers Hanover, J.P.  Morgan, Bank of New York and Chemical Bank.  </P></p>

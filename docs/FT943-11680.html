			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / EU voters support vetting A large majority of voters throughout the European Union support the European parliament's new powers to vet members of the European Commission, according to an EU-wide opinion poll published yesterday. According to the survey, carried out by the European Commission as part of its regular Eurobarometer series, 73 per cent of EU voters say the president and members of the Commission should hold office only if they are supported by a majority in the Strasbourg parliament. Only 9 per cent oppose this view, the survey indicates. Following its narrow vote in favour of Mr Jacques Santer, designated to take the Commission presidency in January, the parliament is due to hold nomination hearings with proposed commissioners in the autumn.</p>

			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / UK Company News: GPA agrees leases for 203 aircraft GPA Group, the aircraft leasing company, yesterday said that in the 12 months to March 31 it had agreed leases for 203 aircraft, up from 161 the previous year. Twenty aircraft had been returned because the lessee had defaulted or the lease had expired. Mr Colm Barrington, GPA's commercial director, said there had been fewer repossessions of aircraft than in the previous year. Last year, to help lessees in difficulty, GPA rescheduled some lease rentals for periods of four to 24 months. For the three months to June 30 1992 - the latest publicly available figures  -profits from aircraft leasing fell to Dollars 11m, (Pounds 7.2m) against Dollars 24m.

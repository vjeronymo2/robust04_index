			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Tokyo struggles to avert fresh stock prices plunge: Emiko Terazono and Robert Thomson on swift erosion of Japan's market reforms On the sixth floor of an otherwise undistinguished Tokyo office building, the electronic boards of a large securities dealing room flicker on the wall as white-shirted men hunch over terminals. The setting is the ministry of posts, part of the government rescue team attempting to prop up stock prices. Stock prices have fallen 56 per cent in the past three years. There are widespread fears that companies, financial and non-financial, will offload stocks, bolstering their own accounts, but further undermining the market. Mr Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), has expressed 'serious concern' about any sell-off and the consequent 'price plunge'. The government has urged banks and life assurers not to sell shares. The Bank of Japan has cut official interest rates. Disclosure rules have been relaxed by the finance ministry, which expects that financial institutions will keep their side of the no-selling bargain. The campaign is however having a serious side-effect. After a decade of slow, selective reforms to make markets more open, financial officials are returning to wink-and-nod tactics. They are reviving the cosy relationships severed during the stock industry scandals of the past two years. The four biggest brokers - Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - are quick to remind ministry officials of the industry's successful Black Monday salvage operation in October 1987, when the Nikkei's fall was limited by concerted buying. Now the aim is to keep the Nikkei average at about the 17,000 level until the close of the financial year next month. The longer-term goal is to hold prices steady until there is a recovery in investor demand for stocks. That is supported by a range of Japanese institutions now under pressure: Banks. The lower the Nikkei, the lower their capital adequacy ratios, which must be above 8 per cent at end-March to meet international standards. The banks also plan to write off some of the their non-performing property loans and are keen to limit write-offs on stock portfolios. Life assurers. They rely on unrealised gains on their stock portfolios to cover other losses, including heavy losses on foreign bond investments. Stock profits are needed to make up the difference between the average dividend, about 6.5 per cent, and the return on the assurers' total investments. Brokers. They must deal with losses on their in-house stock portfolios, and they welcome price support. Industrial companies. Big stock investors during the 'bubble era' of the late 1980s. Each time the Nikkei falls, they are further weakened. Their unrealised stock gains, a measure of corporate strength in Japan, are depleted. Write-offs are rising. Each sector is waiting for the others to start buying stocks. Most potential investors feel prices will continue to fall, and dividends are no incentive to buy; the average yield on Nikkei stocks last year was 0.89 per cent. Japanese brokers were big sellers last year. The finance ministry has 'advised' banks, life assurers, and brokers not to dump stocks this year. The ministry will bend accounting rules and allow assurers to book unrealised gains. The ministry is making other favourable rule changes. It has relaxed controls on employee share ownership. The use of companies' funds to buy their own shares is now being debated. These changes will not be enough if stock prices spiral downward. Last August, the Nikkei hit 14,309.41, its lowest level in six years, prompting the government to announce that an extra Y1,120bn in public funds would be available for stock investment. It also announced an emergency public spending package. Another may be introduced this year, but the use of public and postal funds is controversial. Japanese who deposit money at the local post office do so on the understanding that it will be used conservatively. Japanese brokers, ministry officials, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are looking to history for examples of successful salvage operations. The obvious model for a rescue is the operation of the early and mid-1960s, when investment trusts, the Japanese version of mutual funds, were overwhelmed by loss-making stocks. Demand had virtually disappeared and fears of broker collapse were rife. The government established the Nihon Kyodo Shoken (Japan Securities Co-operative) in 1964, which bought shares with funds received indirectly from the Bank of Japan. The buying operation was unsuccessful, prompting the government to back a brokers-run Nihon Shoken Kumiai (Japan Securities Association), which purchased stocks directly from the ailing investment trusts and was regarded as a success. The difference between the two organisations was that the former attempted to buy against a tide of selling, while the latter attempted to stop the selling by accepting unwanted shares from the investment trusts. Another lesson was the importance of collective action. Commercial banks contributed to the rescue by feeding money into the market. There are clear signs that the collective mentality is returning. The securities industries scandals of the past three years were supposed to end the exclusive relationships among the finance ministry, the brokerages and the banks. Now severe market conditions have begun to draw old players together again. Instead of letting prices fall to a level at which buying will resume, the government and the financial industry are intent on defying gravity. The financial system is reverting to old habits, becoming more opaque, and increasingly serving institutions rather than investors.</p>

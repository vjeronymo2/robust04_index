			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: Saudis to back oil quota roll-over Saudi Arabia will back a six-month roll-over of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' present output ceiling of 24.52m barrels a day at the oil cartel's meeting next week in Bali, Saudi officials said yesterday. The officials said they believed the proposal would be supported by almost all other Opec members, with the possible exception of Iran, which appeared likely to seek a roll-over of the present ceiling only for a further quarter. The Saudis believed that a maintained ceiling, which has been rolled over for more than a year already, would at least support present prices of just over Dollars 17 a barrel for Brent crude in a market they described as 'balanced, leaning towards tight'. The officials said crude prices were unlikely to firm significantly unless there was unexpectedly accelerated growth in Europe, the US and Asia or a particularly cold winter. They said only unexpected increases in non-Opec output, particularly from the North Sea, would be likely to soften prices significantly from their present range. 'The likelihood for a firming of prices is there - especially if there is a cold wave,' said one official. Secondary source estimates for actual Opec production in the present quarter are running in the range of 24.7m b/d to 25.1m b/d, of which Saudi Arabia says it accounts for marginally under 8m b/d. Though Saudi officials would not give their estimates for the call on Opec oil for the next quarters, they appeared comfortable with projections of demand at between 25.5m b/d and 26.2m b/d, with a stock drawdown of between 500,000 and 1m b/d. Saudi policy-makers are backing the roll-over having recognised that Opec is caught between being unable to increase the ceiling without softening the market and being unable to win agreement among members for any meaningful cuts in allocations. At best, they have concluded, Opec can at present serve as a 'very important balancing force' in the oil market, but not a price setter.</p>

			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / German rate cut 'possible by spring' THE looming German recession will dampen inflation and money supply growth and allow the Bundesbank to cut interest rates after next spring, a leading government adviser said yesterday. Mr Rudiger Pohl, one of the so-called five wise men, warned, however, that the bank would move cautiously since it would have to take into account the effects of rising US interest rates on the external value of the D-Mark. The federation of German industry, BDI, said there was a danger that the rapid deterioration in confidence could lead to a longer recession. Production cuts would have to continue, the rate of lay-offs would accelerate, and industrial capacity use would shrink further. At present some 17 per cent of west German manufacturing capacity is idle. An export-led recovery will begin in the second half of next year according to most forecasts. However, the federal trade and industry association, DIHT, said French reluctance to approve the farm production compromise in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks could lead to a trade war. This would obliterate hopes of improved exports. There were no signs that domestic conditions would improve next year, which would be the worst for the German economy since 1982, the DIHT said. In that year industrial production fell by more than 3 per cent and gross national product fell by more than 1 per cent. Control of pay rises and government spending were especially important in the battle against recession. According to Mr Otmar Issing, a member of the Bundesbank's central council, money supply growth would fall during November and December from the year's 10.3 per cent peak last month. Even so, it would still be well above target. On inflation, the only positive sign so far was a drop in import prices. This fall, of around 5 per cent, has stemmed mainly from the recent appreciation of the D-Mark. A critical point would be reached in January when Mr Issing expected inflation to rise above 4 per cent after an increase in value added tax.</p>

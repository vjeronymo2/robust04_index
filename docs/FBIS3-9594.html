			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Mostar today the chamber of deputies of the Croat  republic of Herceg-Bosna is discussing the course and results of  the Croat-Bosnian Muslim talks in Washington, Vienna, and Split.  It is coordinating the positions the representatives of the  Croat people will be advocating at the constituent assembly in  Sarajevo on Monday [28 March]. Zdenko Vranjes has the report.    [Vranjes] If we wish to be realistic we will conclude that  the solutions agreed and signed in Washington serve the  interests of the entire Croat nation, the interests of the Croat  people in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the interests of the Republic  of Croatia, said Kresimir Zubak, president of the Presidential  Council of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna, speaking in  detail about the course and results of the talks. The Croats  have attained a high degree of unity in signing the Washington  accord; we see the agreement as binding, and we are ready to  translate what we have signed into practice, Zubak said. He  called on the deputies to adopt the constitution at the assembly  in Sarajevo.    If we manage to elect experts and capable people to  responsible posts in the municipalities, grand counties  [velezupe], and the federation, then Bosnia-Herzegovina, with  constitutional guarantees, will remain a homeland of the Croat  people in the future, Zubak said. He added that by accepting  the Washington accord, a turnabout was made by those who called  for a unitary Bosnia-Herzegovina and not those who suggested  from the very beginning that Bosnia-Herzegovina be a federal  state in which the Croat people would be equal and  state-building.    Zubak also said in his opening address that the solutions  from Washington were not imposed ones but that it was obvious  that it would have been extremely unfavorable for the Croat  people if the agreement had not been signed.    Before the debate the deputies were informed about the  positions taken by the Presidency of the HDZ [Croatian  Democratic Union] for Bosnia-Herzegovina, positions that were  adopted by the HDZ parliamentary group prior to the session of  the chamber. The HDZ extended full support to the documents  signed and called on the HDZ deputies to persevere in the  adoption of the draft constitution and the election of the  federation's president and vice president in the interim period  at the assembly in Sarajevo. In view of the fact that the  Bosnia-Herzegovina president, in his extended term in office,  came from the ranks of the Bosnian Muslim people, the HDZ  presidency insists that the federation's Presidency in the  interim period be a Croat and that the interim government's  prime minister be a Muslim. The HDZ proposes that the  constituent assembly elect Kresimir Zubak president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    The HDZ Presidency also charged all the bodies of authority  in Herceg-Bosna with the task of creating conditions for the  implementation of the agreement and to strengthen functions and  institutions which, in conformity with the constitution, are to  remain intact until a final and overall decision on the fate of  Bosnia-Herzegovina is reached. The deputies were also informed  that the Croat deputies at the constituent assembly in Sarajevo  will be headed by Ivan Bender, assembly deputy and president of  the Chamber of Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna,  and that Ivo Zivkovic has been appointed as his deputy. This  proposal was adopted by the HDZ parliamentary group at this  morning's session. A debate on this subject is under way and  this part of the session of the Chamber of Deputies is off  limits to reporters.    The agenda of the chamber of deputies of the Croat republic  of Herceg-Bosna also includes several important draft laws --  the laws on defense, internal affairs, refugees, and displaced  persons, and health care.    The session is also attended by guests from the Republic of  Croatia, HDZ officials Ivan Milas and Gojko Susak.</p>

The  state Department of Transportation has warned ferry riders that subsidies will  run out March 23. Although exact figures are not available, officials estimate  that 3,000 riders use the ferries daily, compared to 15,000 passengers daily  when the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was closed after the quake.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, April 5 (MTI) -- "They should go home!",  opposition MP Zoltan Trombitas of the Federation of Young  Democrats (Fidesz) shouted after Deputy Speaker of Parliament  Vince Voros had greeted the Chinese justice minister [Xiao Yang]  and his delegation in the box of honour at Hungarian Parliament  today.    Late, after the scheduled departure of the Chinese  delegation, Trombitas received a public warning from Voros in  front of the plenary session.    Fidesz sources say Trombitas was protesting against Chinese  treatment of dissidents, now being arrested in China, while some  leaders of the 1989 student protests are still in prison there.</p>

			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK / LAURA PALMER: WALTON SCORING RECORD WITHIN CLARK'S RANGE  </P> <P> Tony Clark will attempt to break Bill Walton's 20-year record for points in a  season when Christian plays at Coronado at 3 p.m. today  </P> <P> Clark, who is averaging 44.1 points a game, needs only 35 to break Walton's  record of 960 points set for Helix in 1970. Clark scored 44 points in  Christian's 77-60 victory over Hoover Friday to bring his total to 926.  </P> <P> Clark has been selected to play in the McDonald's Western Wildcat Classic April  21 at the University of Arizona.  </P> <P> Times have finally been set for the section basketball finals March 1-3 at  Golden Hall, according to the San Diego Section Commissioner Kendall Webb:  </P> <P> Thursday, March 1 -- Division III, girls at 5:30 p.m., boys at 7:30.  </P> <P> Friday, March 2 -- Division IV, girls at noon, boys at 2 p.m.; Division V,  girls at 4; Division I, girls at 6, boys at 8.  </P> <P> Saturday, March 3 -- Division V, boys at 11:30 a.m.; Division II, girls at 1:30  p.m., boys at 3:30.  </P> <P> Webb said the San Diego Sports Arena, which had been the location of the  championships for the past 14 years, has been reserved for next year.  </P> <P> Vista Football Coach Dick Haines, who gave his 1985 state championship ring to  the family of Sal Aunese so that it might be buried with Aunese after his death  in September, has been presented with a copy of the ring.  </P> <P> Vista went 13-0 and won the mythical state championship in 1985 with Aunese as  quarterback. The players and coaches were given the opportunity by the Joston  Jewelery Company to buy championship rings, but Aunese chose not to.  </P> <P> Last fall, Aunese's mother went to Haines and inquired about having a ring  made. Aunese died soon after.  </P> <P> "His mom wanted one made, but there just wasn't time," Haines said. "So I gave  her mine. He was a nice young man."  </P> <P> Pat McDonald, who worked for Joston's before retiring, had sold Vista players  the rings in 1985. When he heard about Haines giving up his ring, McDonald  called his former boss, and the company provided a new one.  </P> <P> "It was a pleasant surprise, but it wasn't necessary," Haines said. "I was not  sorry I gave mine up and would do it again in that situation."  </P> <P> Monday was the third meeting of the Sweetwater and Chula Vista basketball teams  this season, and it went like the first two: Chula Vista came up short.  </P> <P> Chula Vista had a 13-point lead before losing, 79-65, in the Hilltop tournament  and then lost, 77-75, in the first Metro Conference meeting.  </P> <P> Monday, Chula Vista had a nine-point lead with 3 minutes 15 seconds remaining  and lost, 73-71.  </P> <P> "It's a mental thing," Chula Vista Coach Carnell Penn said. "Everybody's afraid  to shoot the ball."  </P> <P> Following No. 1 Sweetwater's victory, Coach David Ybarra said, "I'm exhausted."  </P></p>

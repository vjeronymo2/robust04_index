			<p>940816 FT  16 AUG 94 / Prisons on market testing shortlist The Prison Service has drawn up a shortlist of 12 prisons and nine open prisons which have the greatest potential for improved performance as candidates for market testing later this year, John Authers writes. The list is based on statistics for escapes, assaults, prisoner activity, time unlocked and cost per place. Each of the prisons has a month to provide more qualitative information which might explain their performance. The board will then choose one or two prisons to be tested against the market by the end of September. The 12 are: Aylesbury, Coldingley, Erlestoke, Everthorpe, Feltham, Hollesley Bay, Huntercombe, Northallerton, Reading, Rochester, Shepton Mallet and Styal. The nine open prisons to be subjected to more detailed qualitative analysis are: Ford, Hewell Grange, Kirkham, Leyhill, Morton Hall, North Sea Camp, Spring Hill, Standford Hill and Sudbury/Foston.</p>

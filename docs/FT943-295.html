			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Uranium smugglers arrested Four Slovaks were yesterday caught smuggling 750g of uranium 235 into Hungary. Officials from the Slovak interior ministry declined to say whether the uranium was capable of making a bomb. Since May, the German authorities have made five seizures of radioactive material, much of it believed to originate in the former Soviet Union. The seizures have prompted fears that criminals are taking advantage of lax security at installations in the former Soviet Union to smuggle out dangerous nuclear material. This is the third time Slovak police have seized illegal radioactive material in Slovakia since the fall of communism in 1989. Russia's Interfax news agency reported earlier this month that police had arrested thieves in the city of Glazov trying to dispose of 100kg of low-grade uranium - the biggest cache of radioactive material in the recent spate of smuggling cases.</p>

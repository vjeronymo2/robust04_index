			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by Paek Hak-yon, vice chairman of the Pyongyang City </F> People's Committee, at a Pyongyang mass rally held on the  afternoon of 29 March in the Socialist Working Youth League's  hall to condemn deployment of Patriot missiles to South  Korea--recorded]    [Text] All Korean compatriots in the North, the South, and  overseas are seething with surging indignation over the reckless  arms reinforcement maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists and the  South Korean ruling bunches to introduce Patriot missiles to  South Korea.    As has already been reported, while talking about strong  countermeasures and the like at the recent so-called  high-ranking policymakers conference and security-related  ministers' meeting, the South Korean ruling bunches are  perpetrating the extremely provocative [simhi tobalchogin] arms  reinforcement maneuvers of introducing Patriot missiles into  South Korea in conspiracy with the United States.    Not satisfied with turning South Korea into the largest  nuclear powderkeg in the Far East, filled with some 1,000  nuclear weapons, and into an exhibition of murderous weapons  with various types of up-to-date war equipment, the U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean ruling bunches now are  attempting to introduce Patriot missiles and other new armed  forces into South Korea. Such an act is not only an open threat  [kongongyonhan wihyop] against us, but is also a persistent and  open provocative act for a northward invasion to ignite a  nuclear war by intentionally aggravating the situation on the  Korean peninsula [chosonbandoui chongserul kouijoguro  kinjangsikyo kutkunnae haekchonjaengui pulchibul toturiryonun  nogolchogin pukchim tobal haengwi].    I bitterly condemn [chunyolhi kyutan] the reckless arms  reinforcement maneuvers by the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean ruling bunches who are introducing Patriot missiles into  South Korea, branding them as a flagrant challenge to the entire  nation's desire for peace and denuclearization in the Korean  peninsula and as an intolerable nation killing act [yongnap  motal minjok myolsal haengwi] to provoke a nuclear war by  intentionally aggravating the situation. [applause]    The deployment of Patriot missiles to South Korea by U.S.  imperialists and the South Korean ruling bunches despite the  protest and condemnation of all the Korean people at home and  abroad and the peace-loving people of the world is part of the  U.S. maneuvers to make the Korean peninsula the source of a new  war in accordance with its policy toward Korea and strategy  toward Asia. It is also a direct product of the South Korean  puppet clique's insidious political and military attempt to plot  to harm and to crush fellow countrymen on the strength of  outside forces.    Since it pursues aggression, the United States does not  welcome the alleviation of the Korean peninsula's situation and  the improvement in North-South relations. It has promoted  distrust [pulsingamul chosonghago] between the North and the  South and has aggravated confrontation and tensions between them  by (?agitating) antinational elements [panminjok punjadul] of  South Korea in an obsolete way [kutaeuiyonhage].    After reversing the agreement reached at the New York  contact  between the DPRK and the United States to finally rupture  DPRK-U.S. talks, the United States is now expanding steps of  military provocation maneuvers to threaten us. This proves that  the United States has no intention to resolve the nuclear issue  of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful way and that it has only  the insidious aim to threaten, isolate, and crush [apsal] us by  force.    It has been the nature of all successive South Korean  colonial puppet regimes to devote themselves to war provocations  against fellow countrymen by depending upon outside forces, and  this nature has become broader and more vicious under the  so-called civilian rule.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song taught: The South  Korean authorities have frequently conducted large-scale  military exercises against our republic in collusion with  outside forces, and they are driving North-South relations to a  dangerous phase, talking about military countermeasures, an  international cooperation system, and the like under the pretext  of our nuclear issue.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has increased funds for  maintaining U.S. occupation forces in South Korea since he came  into power, and provides over $3 billion to keep the U.S. Forces  stationed in South Korea. The puppet clique has also placed  South Korean harbor facilities at the disposal of the United  States according to the Wartime Host Nations Support Agreement  signed between the two. It did not hesitate even in committing  the flunkyist and nation-selling act of opening the whole rice  market to the United States in return for bagging an  international cooperation system, in the ambition of harming  [mohae] and crushing [apsal] fellow countrymen with the borrowed  sword of outside forces.    Agitated by the United States, their master, the South  Korean  puppets are deepening North-South confrontation by engaging in a  northward invasion maneuver more frantically then ever.    It is the South Korean rulers that stirred up South-North  confrontation and the northward invasion mood by paying frequent  visits to military units and war exercise grounds at the  frontline around the Military Demarcation Line and by talking  about strong military countermeasures. It is none other than  the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique with its civilian mask that has  turned South Korea's entirety into a scene of terrible war with  the daily staging of the provocative Team Spirit joint military  exercise and other titled and untitled war exercises, including  Hwarang, Ssangyong, Ulchi, and Focus-Lens exercises.    Voices of warmongers which aggravate North-South  confrontation have become harsher during South Korea's freeze of  North-South dialogue by the Kim Yong-sam ring. Frantic war  commotions are also being kicked up every day.    On 22 March, the Kim Yong-sam ring called together the  puppet  army's bosses to Chongwadae [presidential office] and ordered  them to put the puppet armed forces in a state of alert by  babbling about the being thoroughly prepared for a northward  invasion through the so-called cooperative system with the  United States. Also, that same day, the U.S. ambassador to  Seoul, the commander of the U.S. forces occupying South Korea,  the boss of the puppet Ministry of National Defense, and the  boss of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held discussions on the  northward invasion and took successive provocative steps against  us.    Following this, the so-called minister of the South Korean  Ministry of National Defense even widely announced a new  operational plan 5027, a northward invasion war plan, which was  formulated in a joint cooperation with the U.S. imperialists.  All these serious moves by the South Korean puppets show that  their provocative plots for northward invasion have been now  reached a very grave stage [maeu omjunghan tangye].    Because of the arms buildup plot and the indiscriminative  northward invasion maneuver by warmongering U.S. imperialists  and South Koreans who are kicking up war hysteria, today the  situation on the Korean peninsula is being strained at its  breaking point in which a nuclear war can suddenly result, even  from an accidental mistake [onului pandojongsenun ubalchogin  silsue uihaesodo pulsie haekchonjaenguro ponjyojilsu innun  ilchokchukpalui wigie chingmyonhada].    The situation on the Korean peninsula, in which the North  and  South even discussed an exchange of special envoys just some  time ago, has rapidly reached the brink of war. This is because  the Kim Yong-sam ring have committed an adventurous military  provocative plot to crush [apsal] us, their same fellow  countrymen by following outside forces.    Such a grave situation in which a danger of new war is  imminent [sae chonjaeng wihomi nunape paktuhago innun] proves  that it is the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique who is the  nation-seller of the times, the peace-breaker, and the  nation-separator who does not want peace and peaceful  reunification on the Korean peninsula.    Reality clearly shows that without removing the  anti-national  ring, such as the puppet Kim Yong-sam clique, we cannot improve  North-South relations at any moment nor achieve national unity  or the reunification of the fatherland, and that the nation  cannot avoid nuclear disaster.    All fellow countrymen at home and abroad, who oppose war but  instead want peace and reunification, must rise up as one to  conduct an anti-Kim Yong-sam struggle. The South Korean people  from all walks of life must smash the Kim Yong-sam ring's  flunkyist and nation-selling plot of relying on outside forces  at every step and smash its fascist, nation-separating plots of  war in all places.    The one who is creating a nuclear crisis on the Korean  peninsula, aggravating the North-South confrontation, and  promoting a war of aggression toward the North is none other  than the United States.    The South Korean people should resolutely block and rupture  the introduction of U.S. destructive weapons, including Patriot  missiles, and more vigorously inflame the struggle against  America and for independence [panmi chajuhwa tujaeng].    The United States must stop its foolish act of exercising  influence over South Korean antinational elements who have been  abandoned by the nation and branded as a target to be trampled,  and immediately discontinue the introduction of nuclear war  equipment and reckless provocation maneuver for a new war.    If the United States continues to place Patriot missiles in  South Korea, resumes the Team Spirit joint military exercise,  and clings to the reckless aggression maneuver against us  babbling that pressure on North Korea should be strengthened  through real actions [silchi haengdong], it will be totally  responsible for the grave consequence [omjunghan huga]  thereafter.    Our people are not the ones who would be frightened by the  military threats by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean  puppets. Our people, who are single-heartedly united around the  beloved and respected Supreme Commander Comrade Kim Chong-il who  has peerless courage, iron-clad will, and ever-victorious wisdom  and tactics, are fully prepared to fight against any provocation  by the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppet clique. If the  enemies dare to challenge us, we will punish [chingbol] them  hundreds and thousands times more. [applause]    If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula due to the  aggression of the U.S. imperialists and South Korean puppets,  what we lose is the Military Demarcation Line, and the only ones  that will disappear from this land are invaders and the nation's  traitor bunch. All the people in the northern half of the  republic should closely watch the enemies' provocation maneuvers  of northward aggression with keen alertness. If the enemies  challenge us, all the people should firmly hold a rifle in one  hand, hammer and sickle in the other, strengthen the might of  socialism by effecting a great revolutionary upsurge in all  sectors and units, and turn the entire country into an  iron-walled fortress so that we could sweep them with a single  blow.    Along with this, we should vigorously carry out the movement  to consider our factories, our farms, and our schools as our  outposts, to care about and love the People's Army with family  love and to wholeheartedly support the Army.    As long as we have the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il, who  is an ever-victorious iron-clad courageous general and  outstanding military strategist, and as long as we bear the  undoubted belief and firm will of the iron truth that we will  win without fail, we have nothing to be afraid of, and even if  the globe breaks up and the sky falls down, our chuche  fatherland will stand aloft as the sanctum of socialism in the  world, forever flaunting a socialist banner. [applause]    Let us all single-heartedly unite around the great leader  Comrade Kim Il-song and the dear leader Kim Chong-il, and all  the more vigorously fight on to smash [chitpusida] the  antirepublic maneuvers of the imperialists and their hunting  dogs and to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification  of the fatherland and the perfect victory of socialism.  [applause]</p>

Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> HURT MURRAY RESTS FOR ROSE BOWL  </P> <P> Michigan free safety Vada Murray, who was briefly knocked out in the  Wolverines' 28-18 victory over Ohio State, said he'll take it easy before  preparing for the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> Murray was knocked out in the final minutes of Saturday's game in Ann Arbor. He  was released Sunday from University of Michigan Hospital.  </P> <P> "I was only out for a minute," the senior from Cincinnati said. "But it was a  minute too long for me. You play a sport all your life, and in a second it can  be gone."  </P> <P> Murray said he planned to take a few days off from practice before Rose Bowl  conditioning begins this weekend.  </P> <P> The No. 3 Wolverines (10-1) will face 12th-ranked Southern California (8-2-1)  on New Year's Day in Pasadena.  </P></p>

			<p>920915 FT  15 SEP 92 / Recession takes toll on air travel THE RECESSION is continuing to depress domestic air travel, although international traffic is showing further signs of recovery. The latest traffic figures released yesterday by BAA, the airports operator, showed a disappointing increase last month of just under 2 per cent in domestic traffic at its UK airports, compared with August 1991. A BAA official said: 'Although we are now starting to see the end of the Gulf war effect on our business, we are now seeing the full effect of the recession on our domestic business.' A recovery in international traffic turned last month into the busiest on record for BAA, whose airports handled a total of 8.2m passengers. That was a 9 per cent increase on August last year.</p>

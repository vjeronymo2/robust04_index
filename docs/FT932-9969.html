			<p>930511 FT  11 MAY 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises close to DM1.61 THE DOLLAR rebounded sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, peaking at DM1.6095 in European trading, as dealers switched their attention on to the continuing recession in Germany and away from the slow upswing in the US, writes James Blitz. Yesterday's strong performance by the dollar appears to have had its roots in the market's reaction to last Friday's worse than expected US non-farm payroll figure for April. Although the dollar lost ground in the immediate aftermath of those figures, it bounced back late on Friday. By yesterday morning, the market appeared to be taking the view that the dollar's upside must be strong if it refused to weaken on a poor payroll figure. Adding to the D-Mark's intrinsic weakness were new indications at the weekend that the state of Germany's finances is in a poor shape. At the weekend, Mr Theo Waigel, Germany's finance minister, underlined that the forecast for Germany's budget deficit will have to be revised upwards over the next few years. At the same time, IG Metall, Germany's powerful engineering union, was also confident on Sunday that it would receive fresh support for strike action in eastern Germany this week. The perceived weakness of the D-Mark helped the dollar to a close of DM1.6045, up more than 2 pfennigs on the day. The US currency finished New York trading at DM1.6077. However, sterling slipped sharply against the D-Mark as dealers grew concerned that the new problems facing Mr John Major's government could trigger another cut in UK base rates. The government's savage defeat in the Newbury by-election last week has already put Mr Major under pressure to sack Mr Norman Lamont, his chancellor. For the first time yesterday, UK money markets were starting to bet on another easing in UK monetary policy before the autumn. The pound ended 3 pfennigs down on the day at DM2.4625 and 4 cents weaker at Dollars 1.5350. Sterling was a full percentage point down on the day when measured against its exchange rate index, closing at 79.9. Mr Steve Hannah, director of IBJ International in London, believes there is unlikely to be a resumption of the very negative psychology towards sterling seen in early February. He considers that new evidence that the UK economy is recovering and Germany's difficulties should provide a floor for the pound at DM2.45. Inside the European exchange rate mechanism, the main focus of the day was on the Danish krone, which continued to slip against the D-Mark in the run-up to next Tuesday's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty. Pushing the krone down was a poll showing support for the treaty slipping to 46 per cent, with 34 per cent opposed. The krone weakened to around DKr3.8640 per D-Mark from a previous DKr3.8525.</p>

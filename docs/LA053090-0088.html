			<p><P> May 30, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Pic 'N' Save Sues Girard Partners: Pic 'N' Save filed a federal suit accusing  the Girard Partners investment group of violating securities laws in its fight  to seize control of the company.  </P> <P> Pic 'N' Save said, without elaborating, that Girard "has made false and  misleading statements" in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  La Jolla financier David Batchelder, who heads Girard, called the suit an  effort to slow his group's efforts to win a majority on Pic 'N' Save's board  and said he expects to prevail in court. Dominguez-based Pic 'N' Save is a  chain of 190 stores specializing in close-out and other discount merchandise.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the NPRM, the agency decided not to propose the detailed test procedure discussed in the ANPRM because agency research indicated that the procedure would not provide an adequate means of identifying improper fit on the wide variety of sizes and shapes of vehicle occupants. In addition, commenters on the ANPRM raised a number of questions concerning the test procedure that the agency has been unable to resolve. Since no commenter submitted any information to remedy the inadequacies that the agency's research disclosed in the ANPRM test procedure, NHTSA still lacks a detailed test procedure whose adequacy has been sufficiently supported through agency testing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> NHTSA appreciates the information submitted by Transport Canada regarding the BTD. However, the NPRM did not provide adequate notice to permit the agency to adopt a rule based on the BTD. Further, NHTSA does not have sufficient experience with the device to consider even proposing such a rule at this time. However, the agency will continue its coordination with Transport Canada on this issue to attempt to harmonize regulatory requirements where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vehicle manufacturers stated that the proposed adjustability requirement was a design-based standard, and therefore, design restrictive. The agency disagrees. The language does not specify the use of any particular designs to meet the adjustability requirement. Instead, the requirement affords manufacturers broad flexibility in designing means of compliance. Manufacturers may comply by providing for the adjustability of the anchorage and have a broad choice regarding the means for doing so. In addition, the requirement allows them to choose other means of compliance. In lieu of anchorage adjustability, manufacturers may either integrate the belts with the seat or provide a means of automatically moving the webbing in relation to the anchorage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Accordingly, the agency has decided to adopt the adjustability requirement, as proposed, for those seats that are required by this final rule to have adjustable belts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Vehicle manufacturers also asked the agency to clarify whether certain devices would be allowed under the requirement, and, if not, to expand the requirement to allow these devices. In response, the agency has listed below the various devices mentioned in the comments and indicated whether each of those devices is permissible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustable Upper Anchorage: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  An AUA is a device which provides a means of adjusting the upper anchorage of the shoulder belt and which has at least two distinct positions. This device would comply with the adjustability requirement if switching from one adjustment position to the other moves the device or webbing at least 5 centimeters, measured linearly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Floor-mounted Inboard Adjustable Anchorage: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This is a device similar to an AUA, except that it is mounted on the floor on the inboard side of the seat. This device would comply if it has at least two distinct adjustment positions, and if switching from one adjustment position to the other moves the device or webbing at least 5 centimeters, measured linearly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Integrated Safety Belt Assembly: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This is a safety belt system anchored completely to the seat structure. For a movable seat, the anchorages must be located on a part of the seat above the seat adjuster. This system would comply with the adjustability requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ``Semi-integrated'' Safety Belt Assembly: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As described by Ford, this is a safety belt system which has the upper anchorage and the retractor for the upper torso portion of the Type 2 belt mounted to the moving portion of the seat structure. Other commenters mentioned similar ``semi-integrated'' designs, including: lower anchorages for the upper torso belt mounted on the movable portion of the seat; shoulder belt guides; and through-the-seat routing of the safety belt webbing. These devices would be allowed if (1) the device is considered part of the anchorage and meets the requirements of Standard No. 210,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Seat Belt Anchorages <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , and (2) if the movement of the device, measured linearly, is at least 5 centimeters. The agency believes that all ``semi-integrated'' safety belt assemblies which meet the first criterion would comply because the movement of the seat would move the anchorage component sufficiently to meet the second criterion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sling-Mounted D-Rings: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This is a sling-mounted upper shoulder belt anchorage D-ring, used to relocate the D-ring closer to the occupant. The sling usually rotates freely around the anchorage bolt to permit D-ring movement. Sling-mounted D-rings designed in this manner do not have two distinct adjustment positions and would not comply with the adjustability requirement. NHTSA does not believe that a sling-mounted D-ring which does not have distinct adjustment positions should be allowed as the position of such a device could change due to vehicle vibration or occupant movement, resulting in reduced comfort for the occupant.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Ford's comment indicated that some sling-mounted D-rings are ``fixed and rigid'' and can ``be adjusted to a variety of different positions that provide at least 5 centimeters of adjustment.'' Such a device would comply with the adjustability requirement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Intentional Set Retractor: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  As described by General Motors, this is a safety belt retractor that would permit the introduction of slack in the upper torso portion of the safety belt. Such a device could not be used to comply with the requirement because the anchorage does not have a movable component which has at least two adjustment positions (S7.1.2), nor does the design move the webbing in relation to the anchorage (S7.1.2.1). Spooling of webbing off the retractor increases the amount of webbing in the belt system, but does not move the webbing in relation to the anchorage as specified in S7.1.2.1. An example of the type of design that would meet the requirements of S7.1.2.1 is the Volvo design in which the shoulder belt webbing is fed through a slot in the pillar at different angles and in different locations as increasing amounts of webbing are spooled off the conical spool of the retractor.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Adjustable Seat Height: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Porsche described a system which adjusts the seat height relative to a fixed D-ring to be used to comply with the adjustability requirement. NHTSA is not amending the language to allow the use of this system as a means of compliance. The agency does not believe that, in practice, a seat with adjustable height would be functionally equivalent to an anchorage with two or more adjustment positions. NHTSA believes that occupants use seat adjustability primarily as a means of reaching controls and increasing visibility out of the vehicle. NHTSA has no evidence, nor did Porsche provide any evidence that such a system alone would also be used by motorists to provide a better safety belt fit. Moveover, even if motorists did use it this way, the optimum seat adjustment for seat belt comfort could conflict with optimum seat height for control access and visibility.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Rear Seats  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

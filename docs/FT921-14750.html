			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Groupe Bull completes Dollars 1.1bn debt refinancing GROUPE BULL, the lossmaking French computermaker, yesterday completed a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 613m) refinancing, representing most of the group's debts. The state-controlled group's problems, the deteriorating market conditions for information technology companies generally, and the tightening of conditions in the international loans market have all helped to push the margin on the public, syndicated part of the refinancing to 70 basis points (0.7 per cent) over the London inter-bank offered rate. This is considered high for a three-year facility. The company said this margin was lower than those paid on the two largest facilities it was refinancing, accounting for a total of Dollars 835m lent to two US subsidiaries. However, given that the new loans are to the group parent, and so considered more secure, the overall bankers' terms were actually worse than before. The refinancing, which is thought to cover all loans falling due in 1992, is planned to help the group complete a restructuring programme announced last year. Yesterday, Mr Francis Lorentz, chairman, said 1991 operating losses were likely to be about half the total for the previous year. Groupe Bull's total pre-tax loss for 1990 reached more than FFr6bn (Pounds 619m), after it had narrowly failed to break even in the previous year. About Dollars 850m of the finance announced yesterday is being provided by a syndicate of 26 international banks, arranged by Banque Nationale de Paris, JP Morgan, Societe Generale and National Westminster. Most of these are believed to be banks already owed money by the group, reflecting the reluctance of new lenders to extend credit to the troubled computer maker. The remainder is being provided by one-to-one deals with large lenders. Bull said these were Commerzbank, Manufacturers Hanover, Tokai Bank and Barclays. The syndicated portion of the deal, which has taken about four weeks to complete, was scaled up from Dollars 700m, although the troubled nature of the group is believed to have made the financing difficult to complete. The new syndicated loan, made to the group parent, replaces a range of facilities extended previously to subsidiaries around the world. The refinancing accounts for most of Bull's FFr11bn debts at the end of 1991.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, April 9 (AFP)--France on Saturday called  for an explanation from China after the arrest of another  Chinese dissident and French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur  slammed the crackdown as "unacceptable."    Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told journalists that the  explanation had been sought after the arrest Friday evening of  dissident Wang Fucheng, secretary-general of the Shanghai-based  Chinese Human Rights Association.    "This is now rather a lot, and we are starting not to  appreciate it," Juppe said. "We have asked for an explanation,  and we are awaiting a reply."    France has requested an explanation for 3:00 p.m. (0700  GMT),  he said.    Only hours after Wang's arrest, another leading dissident,  Bao Ge, was picked up by police in Shanghai, a dissident source  said. Bao was the fifth pro-democracy campaigner to be detained  in China in eight days. The latest incidents happened as  Balladur arrived in Shanghai, continuing a four-day trip aimed  at mending fences with China.    Balladur told the Chinese minister for electricity, Shi  Dazhen, of his displeasure at the wave of arrests, Juppe told  journalists in the plane from Beijing to Shanghai.    "This is unacceptable," Balladur was quoted as saying.</p>

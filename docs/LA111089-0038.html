			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TRAIN TRAVEL  </P> <P> In response to Robert A. Jones' column "The Rewards of Slow-Motion Locomotion,"  Part A, Oct. 31:  </P> <P> Millions of people hate flying. They're the ones who love trains. Life is  short. To hell with rushing from city to city in gigantic airplanes with all  the built-in fear and stress, plus the dreadful purchase of air disaster  insurance. It's unbelieveable that we can't get more trains.  </P> <P> One train per day from Los Angeles to San Francisco, and one from there to  here! And they're always sold out. It's a joke.  </P> <P> Why not try two trains a day? Isn't that the way to serve the public and make  money? It wouldn't surprise millions of train lovers to discover gold in them  thar rails by running three or four trains a day between two of the greatest  cities in the world.  </P> <P> DUKE RUSSELL  </P> <P> Hollywood  </P></p>

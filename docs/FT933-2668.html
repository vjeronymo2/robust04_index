			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Personal View: EMS - time for some strong medicine Reluctantly, Europe has entered the brave new world of the permissive European Monetary System. If the pundits are to be believed, two principles should now guide its monetary policies. Interest rates should be cut quickly and radically to counter the recession. And under no circumstances should governments tamper with the markets by imposing deposit requirements on foreign exchange transactions. These two quite different points have one thing in common: both of them are wrong. The concern with high unemployment that prompts calls for interest rate cuts is entirely appropriate. But central banks control discount rates, not market rates. Market rates are determined by investors. Investors will accept a lower interest rate on French than German bonds only if they expect the franc to appreciate. To reduce market rates, a government must make investors believe that its currency is going to strengthen. They must push it way down now so it can recover later, allowing lower interest rates to boost growth. Suppose that radical discount rate cuts push the franc to the bottom of its 15 per cent band, half of which has been used already. Why should investors believe that it will recover? If they expect the opposite, French interest rates will rise rather than fall. The desire for lower market rates will be frustrated. Rightly or wrongly, this is very much on the market's mind. Indeed, long-term real interest rates - on which investment most depends - have actually been higher in the UK and Italy , the two countries that depreciated their currencies last year, than elsewhere in Europe. To convince the markets that any depreciation is temporary, policymakers must first commit themselves to restoring an EMS with teeth. Only then will the markets know that depreciation today does not augur depreciation tomorrow. Only then will looser monetary policy be certain to succeed in cutting market interest rates and stimulating recovery. If the single market is to be defended, there must be a move back to narrow bands. However justified the debate over monetary union, there is broad agreement over the benefits of completing the internal market. Exchange rate fluctuations of as much as 30 per cent menace this achievement by imposing on workers and companies in the affected sectors greater and greater pain. The single market will be put at risk. The complaints of competitive depreciation following sterling and the lira's departure from the EMS last year underscore the threat. If Europe fails to restore exchange rate stability, it will fail to complete the single market. This is too high a price to pay. But to restore 2.5 per cent bands, or even 5 per cent bands as proposed by the monetary committee in July, would be 'deja vu all over again'. If the last year has taught us one thing, it is that the EMS was flawed. Open capital markets are incompatible with pegged exchange rates, pure and simple. This is why deposit requirements for institutions with open foreign exchange positions, like those used in Italy in 1987-88 and in Spain in 1992, are needed temporarily until the goal of monetary union is reached. The cost of non-interest-bearing deposits with central banks would be passed on to those borrowing a currency in order to sell it short. This is not a capital control; investors could still engage in any transaction they wished. But it would attach a cost to one-way bets against exchange rates and provide central banks the speculation they need to defend currency pegs. Foreign exchange traders for too many years were denigrated as a lower form of life. But neither are they a higher form of life. No practitioner would deny that financial markets are driven by hard instinct as much as careful analysis; this is why they are regulated with margin requirements and circuit breakers. Since when do currency markets have a god-given right to be free of the sort of regulation to which other financial markets are subject? What robs attacks on this proposal of their force is their failure to offer workable alternatives. The FT has recommended a faster move to monetary union or international monetary reform on a global scale ('Speculators as the scapegoats', August 17). Yet Germany has made abundantly clear its unwillingness to accelerate the Maastricht timetable. Hoping to solve the problem this way is whistling in the dark. The same holds for proposals to reform the international monetary system over a wider area. It is time for serious medicine, not wishful thinking.

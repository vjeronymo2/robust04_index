			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Personal View: Models for Maastricht The British prime minister's dismissal of worries about bureaucratic rule from Brussels as childish fantasy really will not do. Two symptoms of the rapidly growing power of Brussels spring to mind. The main departments of state are spending increasing amounts of their time in dealing with Brussels regulations, either real or anticipated. Second, leading companies are spending increasing amounts of money to maintain a presence in Brussels, both of observers and legal representatives. The reason is clear: they perceive that in ever wider areas of public policy Brussels is prevailing. What is disturbing for many people who are basically pro-European is that, since the Danish referendum, a British government allegedly concerned about 'subsidiarity' has seemed to be playing the game of Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, and the French government, out of a spurious need to convince itself that our partners, especially the French and Germans, are convinced of Britain's commitment to Europe. In light of that, fears have been expressed about Mr John Major's stubbornness, about the danger of inflexible commitment to the Maastricht treaty simply because he helped to negotiate it. But the real danger lies elsewhere. What is taking place in Europe at the moment is a competition - one between three different models of the state to become the model for the European Community as a whole. These models are the French, the German and the British. The French model is essentially a bureaucratic one, despite moves towards decentralisation in France in the last decade. The power of the French presidency has no real counterpart in other European countries, so that it has often been said under the Fifth Republic that the Elysee governs through the upper echelons of the civil service, sometimes virtually ignoring the prime minister and cabinet. In such a system there is inevitably a large arbitrary element in decision-making, an element that encourages a scramble to shape decisions at the top by interests and groups that are well-placed. The crucial thing about the French model of the state is that it can easily be exported - for it amounts to little more than a formalisation of a centralised decision-making process, with a minimum of constraints. Power is the name of the game. The German model of the state is at the other pole from the French. Partly inspired by American federalism as well as by the diversity of Germany before its unification under Prussia in 1870, the German constitution takes enormous trouble to create different spheres of authority and to protect each from the others - minimising the risk of encroachments from the central or federal government, not least by means of a powerful constitutional court. For the Germans, therefore, talk of a 'federal' future means a future with strict constraints on the growth of central power and adherence to the goal of a Rechstaat, the rule of law. Authority is the name of the game. The British model of the state differs from both of these. Apart from not being federal, and vesting sovereignty in 'the monarch in parliament', its hallmark is its informality, its reliance on precedent and customs - its common law character, so to speak. In effect, the British model relies upon the existence of a distinct political class which agrees about the methods, if not the goals, of government. Until recent decades, it was also associated with considerable decentralisation of political power - although that was always de facto rather than de jure, and proved vulnerable to extreme centralising pressures during the Thatcher years. But what has survived even the dangerous centralisation of recent years, the virtual demise of local autonomy, is a model of government which is essentially consensual - putting a premium on mutual agreement governed not so much by formal principles (as in the Rechstaat) but by 'common sense' - that term so used and abused in British political discourse. In spite of its absurdities, that appeal to common sense does reveal something about the consensual character of this idiosyncratic political system, a form of the state in which custom is the name of the game. However, today the idiosyncratic form of the British state is the rub. For it is a form of the state that cannot be exported. It is too embedded in a particular social context to make export possible. It relies on instincts, intimations and even social pressures which cannot be created ex nihilo. Yet the British government and the political class have not really faced up to this problem. They go on relying on that British model as if it could be exported - and in doing so they are creating a danger that the least morally acceptable form of the state is the form that will prevail in the European Community. The model that the British government has been holding up to Europe suffers from a serious lack of clarity. But that is a key to the fact that it is a model inspired by the British state in its traditional form, a form which does not inspire clear constitutional ideas. The appeal to 'subsidiarity' resembles nothing so much as the de facto decentralisation which long accompanied parliamentary sovereignty - an alliance of central authority and local autonomy which was in a sense devoid of principle and dependent on manners or habits for the allocation of responsibilities between the centre and the periphery. But 'consent' in that traditional British form cannot now provide any adequate guidance for the construction of the EC. All that can be said about it is that as a model it requires more than mere economic association but less than federalism. Apart from that, it remains guesswork. But to offer guesswork at this stage is extremely dangerous, for it is accompanied by strong attacks on the goal of a federal Europe - the goal which has long inspired democrats in Germany and smaller countries such as the Netherlands. In that sense, the reliance on the radically unclear British model of the state has been joined to rejection of the German model of the state for European construction. What, then, remains? It is the French model, with its inbuilt predilection for power rather than authority. And that, of course, is precisely what lies behind the Maastricht agreement and pressures to move ahead rapidly along its lines. It amounts to an attempt to impose the French state on the rest of Europe. The author is a fellow of Keble College, Oxford.</p>

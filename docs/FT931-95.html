			<p>930331 FT  31 MAR 93 / International Company News: BP, Enichem say styrene venture on track BP CHEMICALS of the UK and EniChem, the Italian state chemicals group, yesterday said negotiations to set up a joint venture in styrenes, announced last August, had reached a 'final stage' and the new company should become operational by the second half of this year. The new venture, as yet unnamed, will probably be based in Brussels. With annual output of around 700,000 tonnes of styrene monomers and a similar amount of styrene polymers - equivalent to 22 per cent of European capacity  -the company will rank equally with BASF as Europe's biggest producer and will be one of the world's top five manufacturers. Mr Demetrio Corradi, chairman of Enichem polymers, will be the venture's chief executive. He will be supported by two general managers, one from BP, the other from Enichem. The operation will have five production sites in the UK, Italy, France, Belgium and Hungary. At two sites, where EniChem has existing joint ventures with other chemicals groups, the Italian company will pool its share of the plant with BP. BP said it had not yet been decided whether there would be a rationalisation of products. However, nothing was sacrosanct and nothing was targeted, it added. The new venture excludes an existing EniChem plant in Hong Kong, and a planned facility in Tunisia, though these may be brought in later. The new company will have annual sales of around L1,000bn (Dollars 622m).</p>

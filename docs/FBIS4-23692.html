			<p>BFN     [Text] Pretoria June 13 SAPA -- Monday's meeting to discuss  the Afrikaner volkstaat [homeland] issue had "digressed  completely" from the spirit and agreement reached two weeks ago  with President Nelson Mandela, Conservative Party [CP] leader Dr  Ferdi Hartzenberg said in a statement.    Dr Hartzenberg and Freedom Front [FF] leader Gen Constand  Viljoen met Deputy President Thabo Mbeki at Pretoria's Union  Buildings on Monday to discuss the formation of a volkstaat.    A joint statement issued afterwards said the CP was to make  direct representation to the Constitutional Assembly regarding  the formation of a volkstaat. The CP would also pursue the  matter with the various parties represented in the government of  national unity.    It said the CP's request to negotiate directly with the  government -- originally communicated to President Mandela --  would be conveyed to the cabinet for its consideration. "The  meeting recognised the fact that the constitution provided for a  mechanism and a process to address the question of a volkstaat,"  the joint statement said.    But in a separate statement issued later, Dr Hartzenberg  said  the discussions had "digressed completely" from the spirit and  agreement reached two weeks ago with Mr Mandela.    During those discussions direct negotiation between the  CP/Afrikaner Volksfront [National Front -- AVF] and the  government had been agreed on. Other interested parties would  be able to take part and a forum would be established for this  purpose, Dr Hartzenberg said. "Today the standpoint was taken  that all negotiations must be done through the volkstaat council  [VC]. This is unacceptable to the CP and the AVF because the VC  has been appointed only by the Freedom Front and because it is  inherently limited by the... constitution as well as the  agreement between Gen Viljoen and the ANC."    Dr Hartzenberg said these limitations precluded full  political independence for Afrikaners and a further interview  would have to be held with President Mandela.    In order to ensure a permanent solution and lasting peace it  was essential the agreement already reached with President  Mandela be honoured and executed, he said.</p>

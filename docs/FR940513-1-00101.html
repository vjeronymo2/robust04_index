			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Some employers are covered by all of FLSA's provisions,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while others are covered by the FLSA but may be exempt from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its minimum wage and overtime provisions though not its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child labor provisions. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  Other employers that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the FLSA are subject to varying State child labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. The practice of providing sport-attendant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> experiences to America's youth is a longstanding tradition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As a consequence, many professional and semi-professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sports teams, i.e., baseball, basketball, etc., have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> violated Federal child labor regulations by employing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underage youth, particularly 14- and 15-year-olds, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sports-attendants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For example, section 13(a)(3) of the FLSA exempts any employee employed by an amusement or recreational establishment from the minimum wage (section 6) and overtime (section 7) provisions of the Act, but not from the child labor provisions (section 12), if the establishment does not operate for more than seven months in any calendar year, or if during the preceding calendar year the establishment's average receipts for any six months were not more than 331/2 percent of its average receipts for the other six months. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes that a change in the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal hours and times standards to allow employment of 14-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and 15-year-olds as batboys/girls, ballboys/girls, or in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other sports-attendant capacities would not be inconsistent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with FLSA's oppressive child labor provisions and,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore, proposes a narrow exception from the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of Child Labor Reg. 3 for such work. Specifically, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed exception is limited to employment by professional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sports organizations and would apply only if the duties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> performed are traditional in nature and the work is outside  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regular school hours. Thus, the current restrictions when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> school is in session, i.e, 3-hour daily limit, 18-hour  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weekly limit, and 7 p.m. end-of-day time restriction, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the current 9 p.m. end-of-day time restriction when school  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in not in session would not apply to 14- and 15-year-old  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sports-attendants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department recognizes that a delicate balance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exists between the value of jobs that provide positive,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> formative experiences, and the possible negative effects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that excessive employment of youth can have on their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> academic performance and their health and well-being. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Department believes that the proposed change for 14- and 15-year-olds in sports attending activities will not have an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adverse effect on their health, well-being, or educational  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> development. Further, the Department believes that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employment opportunities for 14- and 15-year-olds as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provided herein is consistent with the purpose of the FLSA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to permit safe and healthy employment opportunities under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conditions which protect the health, well-being, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> schooling of such young workers. See 29 U.S.C. 203(l).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, the Department proposes to delete the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations at 29 CFR part 570, subpart D (Child Labor Reg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5). These regulations provide a procedure for the Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to promulgate or amend hazardous occupation orders (HOs),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which identify occupations in which employment of minors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under 18 years of age is prohibited because the Secretary,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pursuant to section 3(l) of the Act, has determined that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> occupations are particularly hazardous for such workers or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detrimental to their health or well-being. The Department  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes to repeal Child Labor Reg. 5, because its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedural requirements are no longer necessary, and because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the continued existence of the regulation poses the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential for confusion regarding the process to be utilized  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by the Secretary in the review, amendment, and promulgation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of HOs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Child Labor Reg. 5 was promulgated in 1938, immediately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after the enactment of the FLSA (3 FR 2640 (1938)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although neither the FLSA nor other laws required such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures, the Children's Bureau, which at that time was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charged with administration of the FLSA child labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions, prescribed the process so that the public would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be informed of the Department's intentions regarding the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> creation or amendment of restrictions on the employment of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minors in hazardous occupations. The original Child Labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reg. 5 identified certain mandatory steps, including public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearings, to be taken in HO promulgation. The Congress,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, imposed a standardized procedure in 1946 for all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal agencies to follow when issuing or amending  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulations. The procedures in this law, the Administrative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Procedure Act (APA), 60 Stat. 237, provide greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> administrative flexibility than the process in Child Labor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reg. 5, in that, for example, the APA does not mandate a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public hearing in every case prior to promulgation of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. There have been no changes to Child Labor Reg.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5 except for a technical amendment in 1961 (26 FR 5005  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1961)) to more align the HO process with APA requirements,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> i.e., hearings were identified among various optional steps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which the Department could utilize. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / Explosions black out Chilean capital BOMB attacks on Chile's electricity grid blacked out half the country on Wednesday night, with much of Santiago, the capital, remaining without electricity yesterday. Police said the bombs had blown up three high-voltage pylons in southern Chile. Explosive devices were also hurled against a police station and army buildings in Santiago during the black-out. No one was injured. A similar attack last week briefly cut power to the capital. Police yesterday blamed the attacks on the Manuel Rodrguez Patriotic Front, a small Marxist guerrilla group that refused to lay down its arms after Chile's return to democracy in March 1990. The group has been weakened by desertions and internal divisions, and has seemed largely inactive for most of this year. Police suspect the attacks were meant to draw attention to some 40 political prisoners in Chile. Six guerrillas have been on hunger strike for a month in protest at their prolonged captivity. Chile's political prisoners are one of the unsolved legacies of General Augusto Pinochet's 16-year dictatorship. Many have been in jail for years awaiting trial, while others were convicted in military courts on the basis of confessions extracted under torture. President Patricio Aylwin has pardoned some 300 political prisoners since he took office, but says he cannot free the remainder as they were involved in crimes of violence.</p>

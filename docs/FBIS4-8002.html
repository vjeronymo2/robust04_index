			<p>BFN     [Text] Sarajevo, 7 Apr (TANJUG) -- Lieutenant Colonel  General Ratko Mladic, chief of general staff of the Srpska  republic army, said that he held two separate and very useful  talks with General Michael Rose, UNPROFOR [UN Protection Forces]  commander for former Bosnia-Herzegovina, this evening.    In a statement for the Serb Sarajevo Radio, Gen. Mladic did  not give any details of the talks, but said that "on the whole  everything boils down to the fact that the Muslims do not want  to sign an agreement to end of hostilities."    Mladic did not wish to comment on the present situation in  the areas in which Muslim units launched an offensive. He said  that the Muslims had smuggled units from central Bosnia into the  area toward Gorazde and that it is obvious they are backing the  war option.</p>

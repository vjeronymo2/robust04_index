			<p>930204 FT  04 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clash over council tax cuts fears MR MICHAEL HOWARD, the environment secretary, last night sought to allay fears that the council tax to be introduced in April would prove to be more burdensome and unpopular than its predecessor, the community charge. He told the Commons that the support provided by the Treasury should ensure that the burden on local taxpayers could be held down to 'fair and reasonable levels'. Strongly disputing this view, Mr Jack Straw, Labour's chief spokesman on local government, forecast that the financial constraints imposed on councils would result in a serious decline in public services and thousands of job losses. Mr Howard insisted that overall, after allowing for inflation, there should be no need for councils to raise more money in 1993-94 than in the current year. He stressed that, if necessary, the government would use its 'capping' powers to restrain excessive spending and hold down council tax levels. Mr Howard said Pounds 340m would be available to provide transitional relief for individual householders facing an 'excessive increase' in the payments they were required to make to local councils. His assurances won over at least one waverer on the Tory backbenches. Sir Rhodes Boyson (C Brent north), who would have preferred retention of the poll tax, said that after 'wrestling with his conscience' he had decided to vote for the government. Sir Rhodes called for an undertaking that the transitional relief scheme would operate for more than one year. Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, said the provision made by the government for 1993-94 - approved by a majority of 57 (308-251)  - meant there was no need for compulsory redunancies in any well-run authorities.</p>

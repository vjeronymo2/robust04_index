			<p>921104 FT  04 NOV 92 / International Company News: Job-cut costs keep Dofasco in the red DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, blamed lower shipments and high staff severance costs for a third-quarter loss of CDollars 14.7m (USDollars 11.8m), or 27 cents a share. This compares with a loss of CDollars 10.1m, or 24 cents, a year earlier. Steel price pressures and a four-week shutdown at the company's iron ore mines in Quebec added to the loss. Overseas shipments were off sharply in the quarter, and revenues dipped 6 per cent to CDollars 468m. The nine-month loss was CDollars 98.2m, compared with CDollars 23.5m a year earlier. Dofasco expects the fourth quarter to be slow, although flat-rolled products are showing some improvements.</p>

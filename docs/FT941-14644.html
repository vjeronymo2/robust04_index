			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / International Company News: Grumman to cut 500 jobs in move to reduce costs Grumman, the smallest US military aircraft maker, yesterday announced plans to cut its 15m sq ft of factory, office and warehouse space by nearly a third over the next two years in the latest of a series of cost-cutting moves. The plans involve closing all five of its factories on Long Island, New York, resulting in the loss of 500 jobs from the workforce of 17,900 this year. They will also bring a pre-tax charge of Dollars 84m against 1993 profits, but should cut operating costs by an estimated Dollars 600m over the next three years. Grumman said 1993 earnings, excluding the Dollars 84m charge, were expected to be at least in line with the previous year's Dollars 3.49 a share for continuing operations. The figures are due out next week. Like other US defence contractors, Grumman is faced with a declining market because of shrinking US defence spending. It once made military aircraft such as the F-14 Tomcat and A-6 Intruder, but the only aircraft it builds today is the E-2C Hawkeye early warning system. The company has been trying to counter the loss of defence contract work by exploiting its systems integration know-how with projects such as the Joint Stars airborne early warning system, which uses converted Boeing 707s. It has also been trying hard to cut costs, reducing its workforce from a peak of nearly 34,000 in 1987. The biggest component of the latest cost-cutting plan will be the closure of the historic Calverton aircraft plant on Long Island that makes the E-2C. Production will move to Grumman's St Augustine plant in Florida by the end of next year. Mr Renso Caporali, chairman, said the cuts would leave Grumman better placed to succeed in a 'shrinking but still substantial' defence market. 'This restructuring will contribute to long-term earnings and revenue growth,' he said.</p>

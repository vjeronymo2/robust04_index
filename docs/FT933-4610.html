			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Fisons Having repaired relations with the US authorities and restored the balance sheet to health, Fisons' new management must somehow deliver earnings growth. Much depends on the recent US launch of Tilade, its new asthma drug. A joint marketing agreement with Rhone-Poulenc Rorer might avoid the kind of disappointing launches seen elsewhere. But with Intal, the old faithful, losing patent protection next year and a pipeline short on promise, nothing less than an unqualified success will do. In the meantime, scientific equipment, which accounts for half of sales, is suffering. The low-margin business supplying laboratory equipment continues to plod along. But manufacturing high-value scientific instruments has turned out to be highly cyclical. Despite the competitive gain from devaluation, that division is trading at a loss. Margins will remain depressed until customers feel confident about ordering expensive capital equipment. Buying VG Instruments on a multiple of around 20 times near-peak earnings in 1989 - funded with a rights issue at 211p - must be counted a serious error. Robbed of rising cash flow from instruments, and facing heavy capital expenditure commitments, Fisons is being squeezed. Disposals have helped relieve the pressure on cash flow. But with only the UK and European horticultural businesses still to go - and no sign of a buyer  - cash from that direction can not be relied upon. All the more reason to hope that the US launch of Tilade is a success.</p>

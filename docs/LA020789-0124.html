			<p><P> February 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAN AM, GOVERNMENT ACTIONS FAULTED;  </P> <P> KIN OF VICTIMS ON BOMBED JET DEMAND NEW INQUIRY  </P> <P> An enraged, tearful group of families of Pan Am Flight 103 crash victims  demanded Monday that President Bush create an independent commission to  investigate the actions of the airline and the U.S. government in the aftermath  of the bombing of the jumbo jet that killed 270 people just before Christmas.  </P> <P> About 30 family members -- some with a color picture of a dead relative pinned  to their clothing -- accused Pan American World Airways of callousness and the  State Department of ignoring their pleas for information.  </P> <P> They also charged that the airline did not take adequate security precautions  despite a previous warning of a potential bombing, that it ignored the report  of an El Al Israel Airlines consultant of potentially serious security  weaknesses and that it left families to fend for themselves in the days after  the crash.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Allegations Denied  </P> <P> The State Department and Pan Am, although acknowledging the next of kin's  grief, denied the allegations. The White House had no immediate response to the  group's demand for an investigation.  </P> <P> Paul Hudson, whose 16-year-old daughter, Melinda, was killed on the flight,  called on President Bush "to break your silence on this tragedy and exercise  your leadership to identify and punish persons responsible. We want Pan Am to  be held accountable for what happened. Pan Am is said to have received  recommendations from El Al, the airline that has the best security in the world  for preventing bomb incidents, two years ago and did not act on them."  </P> <P> Hudson demanded an accounting of why the government had not made public a  terrorist threat that such a flight would be bombed. He said only 22 such  threats to airplanes were considered high-level last year and "to cancel 22  flights would hardly result in closing down air travel altogether."  </P> <P> Bonnie O'Connor accused Pan Am of showing no interest when the body of her  brother, John Ahern, 26, was brought home. "There wasn't even a person from Pan  Am to shake our hand," she said.  </P> <P> Daniel Cohen, who lost his 20-year-old daughter, Theo, a student at Syracuse  University, told how several days after the crash a Pan Am representative  called his home, offering "some kind of counseling."  </P> <P> Cohen said at that moment his wife was distraught in the kitchen, shouting: "My  life is over." He said he held the phone out so the airline employee could hear  his wife's pain.  </P> <P> "I can't help you," Cohen said the employee told him, and then hung up.  </P> <P> Other relatives said that aside from initial death notifications from the State  Department, the only communication they received was how to arrange to receive  personal effects from those killed on the plane.  </P> <P> "We understand the anger and the frustration of the families as expressed today  in their meeting with the press," a Pan Am spokesman said. "We have attempted  to do everything possible, without being intrusive, to be supportive and  responsive to the needs of the relatives and friends of the victims during this  very difficult time. Since the incident, we have tried to communicate  continually with the families on a personal basis with one employee assigned to  being liaison with one of the families."  </P> <P> Jeff Kriendler, the airline's vice president for public relations, said that in  1986 two Israelis were hired to survey Pan Am's security practices in Europe.  "They came in with recommendations. Some were acted upon. Some were not. They  were hoping that their recommendations would lead to full-time employment with  Pan Am. The company declined their offer. The relationship ended at that time."  </P> <P> Kriendler said Pan Am representatives were present at the airport each time  bodies arrived.  </P> <P> Pan Am and the State Department have said the threat to harm American flights  in December was too general to lead to public warnings about specific flights.  </P> <P> Philip Covington, a State Department spokesman, said that immediately after the  crash, a special 30- or 40-person working group was established to act as  liaison with family members.  </P> <P> "We have done everything we could in this case," he said. " . . . We have  continued to work closely with the families. There is not a single letter we  have received from a family member we have not answered. We think we have done  a very good and thorough job in this terrible tragedy."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Meeting With FBI Official  </P> <P> After the news conference, Hudson and Bert Ammerman, another family member,  conferred in Washington with Oliver B. (Buck) Revell, the FBI's executive  assistant director for investigations.  </P> <P> Revell said that during the meeting he gave them his "assurance and commitment  and resolve to follow this through to the logical end and find those  responsible for the criminal act."  </P> <P> Officials have determined that the jumbo jet was destroyed by a sophisticated  bomb and have no conclusive evidence who planted the device. But the FBI and  other investigators remain optimistic that they eventually will be able to  identify those who are responsible, sources familiar with the massive inquiry  said.  </P></p>

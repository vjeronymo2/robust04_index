			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andranik Migranyan, political scientist and </F> adviser to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, by Laszlo Vida in  Moscow; date not given: "The Period of Euphoria Has Also Come  to an End in Foreign Policy"]    [Text] The region of the post-Soviet states is the sphere  of Russia's vital interests and, therefore, it is impossible to  examine Moscow's relations with the "close foreign countries"  according to general standards. This is how Andranik Migranyan  described the Russian "Monroe Doctrine" that is increasingly  penetrating even the official Russian foreign policy in his  recently published essay. According to his own words, the  well-known political scientist expressed his views as an  "independent expert" in the NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA. However, given  the fact that he is also a member of Yeltsin's group of  advisers, his publications merit particular attention. First,  we asked Professor Migranyan about the official reception of his  essay.    [Migranyan] This writing met with an unfavorable reaction in  the Foreign Ministry, but not because they do not agree with the  essence of my thoughts, but because I criticized the Ministry  and Andrey Kozyrev for not working out the government's foreign  policy concept in time. Besides, the reaction to the subject  matter of my writing also shows that the position of the Foreign  Ministry leadership has gone through a firm evolution.  Kozyrev's latest declarations in defense of the Russian  minorities show that he wants to go even further in this  direction and is trying to prove that he is a "hawk," a believer  in tough solutions.    [Vida] Do you think that Kozyrev is capable of representing  the emerging new Russian foreign policy? Not so long ago, he  was still singing a different song altogether.    [Migranyan] Indeed, I also see a rather firm change in  Kozyrev's attitude. To be honest, I could hardly tell whether  he is capable of heading a foreign policy commensurate with the  changed circumstances. My feeling is that, even if he tries to  do it, the relevant domestic political circles will hardly take  it seriously, because it looks as if he was simply clinging to  his chair. All this also makes him less predictable for the  West, which, naturally, would like to continue to negotiate with  the previous Kozyrev whose position was clear and free of  opportunism.    [Vida] If Kozyrev's constant claim that the president  determines the country's foreign policy is true, everything you  just said about him applies even more to Yeltsin.    [Migranyan] I think the president has the right to modify  his  course. However, in order to carry this out and to give a clear  sign of this, he also has to carry out a personnel change at the  leadership of the ministry.    [Vida] Judging from Western reactions to Gaydar and  Fedorov's  departure, Kozyrev's dismissal would cause a big stir, all the  more so because the West, and particularly the United States,  regards his presence as some kind of guarantee: As long as he  is in place, there cannot be a too big problem.    [Migranyan] If the West made a case out of Kozyrev's  replacement, this would only show its shortsightedness, because  this would justify the anti-Western rhetoric of Yeltsin's  opposition and, thus, it would only hit back at the West itself  and, of course, at those who want to continue the reforms. The  Ministry practically received a monopoly on shaping the Russian  foreign policy from Yeltsin in the past two years, something not  suprising if we consider the internal explosion danger he had to  face and the fact that he has never dealt with foreign policy  before. The Cold War is over, and friendly relations with the  West must be built now with the end of confrontation and,  obviously, Yeltsin had nothing against this. It is another  matter what means can be employed to achieve all this. The  president put Kozyrev in charge of the problem of the technical  aspect and technology problems, and he supported him because the  Western partners were satisfied with him. However, the times of  euphoria have also come to an end in foreign policy, especially  in the matter of illusions regarding the West. Central and  Eastern Europe have slowly become sober, when Moscow was still  speaking about an alliance with the West. It would have been  quite strange to see this general enthusiasm justified, because  politics is a "hard game" in which everyone follows his own aim,  without any philanthropy.    [Vida] Do you think that the mentioning of the Russian  sphere  of interest raises certain apprehension in Western, Central, and  Eastern European countries? This provides arguments to  political forces who find it quite welcome that one can again  speak of Russian expansion, for example, when talking about the  need to expand NATO.    [Migranyan] Quite contrary. A failure to clearly determine  Russia's interests would lead to misunderstandings. Every major  power should clearly determine its zone of influence. A  possible impression that Russia does not have individual  interests at all would not be a good thing.    [Vida] In other words, Russia should be recognized as a  major  power.    [Migranyan] The Soviet Union had very clearly declared  interests, complete with the means needed for the assertion of  these interests. As the legal successor of the Soviet Union,  Russia must again find its place in international politics.  Uncertainty in this respect will only increase the camp of  supporters of Zhirinovskiy and the like, and of communists,  because their main complaint is that no one in the world counts  on Russia any longer. Therefore, despite all their sympathy  toward the West, the realists, and I am one of them, admit that  we must clarify the things deriving from Russia's major power  status. This is why I categorically oppose the demagogic  practice of using the "Russian threat" to justify the need to  expand NATO. Our former allies in Central and Eastern Europe  are not led primarily by a real fear from Russia or the desire  to join NATO; they are playing this card to join the Council of  Europe as soon as possible and, in the meantime, to receive as  many trade benefits and monetary injections as possible. We  will not allow ourselves to be taken in by this demagogy. We  can also mention Zhirinovskiy, because a few more such  initiatives and power will fall into the arms of Zhirinovskiy.    I was one of those who publicly urged discarding the  Brezhnev-doctrine, but one of our main arguments at that time  was that no one wants to fill the vacuum left by the Soviet  Union in Central and Eastern Europe. Such agreements emerged  later. The German reunification did not take place in order to  allow NATO to expand. The fact that Soviet Union collapsed does  not exempt the West and the United States from the obligations  they took upon themselves at the end of the eighties. One  should not forget that, in the meantime, Russia got even farther  from the region, and it has become weaker in every respect that  the former Soviet Union. It is ridiculous to come up with the  "Russian threat" today.    [Vida] One of the conclusions of your studies is that the  post-Soviet region is the first test of the partnership  relations between Russia and the West, where the West has to  recognize Russia's special role. Has Clinton's visit given any  hopes in this respect?    [Migranyan] The United States is exercising pressure on  Ukraine in the nuclear arms affair. In Clinton's presence,  Yeltsin made a tough statement about the situation of the  Russian population in the Baltic states. They probably reached  a certain agreement on the use of Russian troops as  peace-keeping troops in the crisis points of the former Soviet  Union: over the Caucasus, in Tadjikistan. It seems that the  idea that Russia plays a particular role in guaranteeing  stability in Euro-Asia is met with increasing support and  understanding in the leading Western power.    [Vida] In your study, you repeatedly emphasized that the  borders between the successor states, including Russia's  borders, were determined artificially and they are far from  being final. What do you suggest by this?    [Migranyan] Nothing more than the fact that, for the time  being, we do not even know where Russia's borders lie: The  situation of Chechnya, Tuva, Tatarstan, and Baskyria is  flexible. The same way, Georgia's borders or Ukraine's borders  are also unclear, because it has not been decided whether they  will remain as independent states at all. The border issue  first of all depends on this and, therefore, it would be too  early to close the issue definitely. Because of the unsettled  state of the successor states, the borders between them do not  yet have the same function as the borders between other  countries with many centuries of history.    [Vida] How do you envisage the future of the CIS?    [Migranyan] I am optimistic, because the latest  reintegration process does not derive from subjective causes or  the moods of a certain politician, but from objective factors.  The former Soviet republics faced the fact that they are not  expected anywhere and they have no place to join. Otherwise,  they would not turn again toward Russia and toward one another.  At the same time, Russia is not interested in forcing the  reintegration process, because, with this, it would  automatically take extra economic burdens upon itself. In my  opinion, Moscow is absolutely aware of this.</p>

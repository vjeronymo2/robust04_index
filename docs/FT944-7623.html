			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / French economy falters French industrial output in September fell 0.4 per cent below its level in July and August, Insee, the government statistics agency, reported yesterday. The impression that after robust recovery in the first half of the year, the French economy has undergone a slight autumn chill is likely to be reinforced later today when Insee publishes its estimate of gross domestic product in the third quarter. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, warned this week that the economy never moved in a linear direction and that the growth performance could 'not be expected to be as high as in the first half', when GDP rose 0.7 per cent in January-March and by 1 per cent in April-June. However, he said the government was not lowering its forecast that the economy would grow by more than 2 per cent this year and by more than 3 per cent in 1995. Insee economists said that some autumn slowdown was inevitable given the fact that part of the first half's strong rebound was due to companies restocking their inventories, which had been more or less completed. The Balladur government yesterday approved a year-end correction to its 1994 budget, which lopped a fractional FFr162m (Pounds 19.3m) off the deficit following bigger tax receipts.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Antonio Ortega] </F>   [Excerpt] San Cristobal de Las Casas, Mexico, 9 Jan (AFP)  -- The Mexican Army today resumed its attacks on guerrillas in  the conflict areas surrounding Ocosingo and Tenejapa. There was  artillery fire at approximately 1300 local (1930 GMT) near the  garrison of the 31st Military Zone, which, according to reports  that have been neither confirmed nor denied by the Army, has  been attacked by rebels.    A caravan of the "All Rights For All" Organizations Network  tried to advance toward Tenejapa, and when the military  prevented their advance in the place known as La Garita,  explosions were heard in the bush.    In the morning, another caravan of the Network tried to go  to  Ocosingo, Altamirano, and Oxchuc, where there have been clashes  between guerrilla and regular forces, but the soldiers  prohibited the trip.    In both cases, personnel in charge of the road blocks said  traffic was not allowed through because rebel groups are in the  area and the Army wants to be able to guarantee safety and  tranquillity before opening the roads.    Human rights groups and the media have protested the fact  that for four days there have been road blocks on the access  routes to the conflict area, on the road to Comitan, on the road  from Palenque to Ocosingo, and on other roads where there is  supposedly a rebel presence.    Some reporters believe the authorities have "cordoned off  the  media" while they carry out a "clean-up operation at the combat  sites," because so far the effects of the bombing and shelling  by the military over the last four days is still unknown.    Saturday was apparently a calm day as no shelling or rocket  explosions were heard, nor were there reports of clashes between  the Armed Forces and the Zapatista National Liberation Army  (EZLN), which declared war on the Army on 1 January.

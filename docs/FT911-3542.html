			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Private sector managers shun passport offer BRITAIN'S offer of up to 50,000 passports to key Hong Kong people has been poorly received by managers and administrators, the individuals the package was designed to attract, Angus Foster writes from Hong Kong. Just fewer than 15,000 passports have been allocated for public sector managers and administrators, the largest job category in the package. The quota has been under-subscribed by about 10 per cent, according to Mr Donald Tsang, director of administration. The package was introduced last year under the British Nationality Act. It was one of a series of measures designed to restore confidence in Hong Kong, severely shocked by the crackdown against pro-democracy demonstrators in Peking in June 1989. All the other job categories have been over-subscribed, some heavily. The government received 1,000 applications from legal professionals by the time the offer closed at the end of February against a quota for this category of only 185. Mr Tsang said the response by private sector managers and administrators was not surprising because they were the only people who had to disclose details about income.</p>

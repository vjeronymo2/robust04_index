			<p>930612 FT  12 JUN 93 / International Company News: NY Times buys stronger voice in US north-east - The Boston Globe's disposal ends 100 years of family control and further concentrates newspaper ownership THE owners of the The Boston Globe have succumbed to the New York Times Company and agreed to sell out for Dollars 1.1bn. The sale ends more than 100 years of family control of the newspaper. The takeover turns the New York Times Company into the fifth largest newspaper chain in the US, with combined daily circulation of its titles climbing to 2.5m. It becomes the dominant voice in the north-east of the US, with dozens of papers stretching from Maine to Washington. It also makes it the owner of the two largest newspapers in New York and New England. The purchase also adds to the growing concentration of the US newspaper industry, as independents pass into the hands of the large chains. The US's five largest newspaper companies - Gannet, Knight-Ridder, Newhouse, Times Mirror and now the New York Times - have combined daily sales of over 18m copies. While the Times heralded the purchase as an 'outstanding strategic fit', it further exposes the company to stagnant print journalism, and the struggling north-eastern economy. Analysts expressed surprise at how much the Times is paying, with the Dollars 1.1bn price tag valuing the Globe at more than 36 times last year's profits, and 2.4 times revenues. 'I'm not sure investing this amount of money in an industry as mature as the newspapers is the best use of cash,' says Mr Lanny Baker, a media analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York. 'They are paying at the top end of the range. But it depends on what they make of the paper after they have bought it.' Mr Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of the New York Times, defended the merger against critics of the deal, telling his own newspaper: 'I think it's going to be a very, very long time before newspapers disappear.' He said he was not just buying a newspaper, but an organisation that gathered news, and that would be ready for the electronic age. The Times will likely offer joint advertising sales with the Globe. The merger, said Mr Sulzberger, 'provides the opportunity for a new and exciting way of selling national and retail advertising to clients targeting the entire north-east market - an opportunity that could not be duplicated by any combination of newspapers or other media'. In Boston, many expressed sadness that the Globe, which has been controlled by the Taylor and Jordan families since 1873, was being swallowed by a chain, albeit the sober New York Times. The Globe, a self-styled 'serious' newspaper, follows an independent, liberal editorial line, and for some readers is almost as part of Boston identity as the Red Sox baseball team. The Globe sold out in the end because, of all the suitors, the Times appeared most likely to preserve its independence. 'If there is going to be a partnership, the Times is sure a classy act to hop into bed with,' said Mr Thomas Winship, former editor of the Boston Globe. 'It bodes well for the future of New England, that desperately needs a feisty, caring newspaper.' In 1996, family trusts owned by Jordans and Taylors expire, making the Globe's parent company, Affiliated Publications, vulnerable to a hostile takeover. With some 100 heirs apparently eager to cash in on the family inheritance, the Taylors dared not wait. The Times has agreed to pay an equivalent of Dollars 15 a share for Affiliated, a 21 per cent premium over Affiliated's stock price on May 28, when rumours of the merger circulated. The Times will offer its own stock, but owners of Affiliated 'A' shares can take up to 15 per cent of their shares in cash. The Globe has a week-day circulation of 504,869, making it the US's 13th largest newspaper, and far larger than its nearest local rival, the Boston Herald, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News America Publishing Company. The New York Times has a daily circulation of 1.2m, while its parent company owns 31 regional newspapers, 20 magazines and 5 television companies. The takeover gives the New York Times Company 60 per cent of the seats on The Boston Globe board. However, The Globe is being promised full management and editorial autonomy, partly allaying fears in a city notoriously sensitive to being in New York's shadow that the takeover will lead to too much outside interference.</p>

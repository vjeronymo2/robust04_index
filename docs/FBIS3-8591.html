Even if the talks took place and were true, there is an  unwritten rule that they are never talked about, claimed Meciar.    Meciar said that former Foreign Minister Milan Knazko had to  travel to Croatia on Meciar's order to withdraw Kovac's promise  of cooperation in arms production.    Kovac allegedly sent a letter to Taiwan promising to  recognize it if Slovakia received $500 million. "This would  cause an immediate political conflict with China. We were  essentially opposed to it," Meciar said.    After the first talks with Czech President Vaclav Havel,  Kovac requested that the Slovak government pay 18.2 billion  Slovak crowns [Sk] ($550 million) for the National Property Fund  (FNM) and Sk24 billion ($800 million) for the Czech deficit. "I  disagreed with the request, and the shares worth Sk178.2 billion  ($5,400 million) eventually arrived in Slovakia gratis," Meciar  added.    The meeting between the Slovak delegation and American  President Bill Clinton, which was preceded by careful  preparations, was a wasted opportunity, Meciar said. The talks  with Clinton were a historic chance for Slovakia to resolve its  security and economic interests.    Meciar said he had not had a chance to speak because Kovac  delivered a 34-minute speech. The American party reacted  negatively, as well. "I felt ashamed," Meciar commented on the  meeting.</p>

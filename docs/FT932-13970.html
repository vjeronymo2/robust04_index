			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / While Bosnia burns: While Bosnia burns - The slowness of the world's responses to the war is part of its tragedy Perhaps the worst thing about the Bosnian tragedy, for those who are not its direct victims, is its agonising slowness. If only it were over. Of course one would still feel bad when thinking about it, but that probably would not be all that often, just as one no longer thinks all that often about Biafra or East Timor. The slowness of events is painful because it prolongs the moral and political dilemmas. But actually that is a luxury. It means there are still opportunities to act. Something might yet be saved, by a right decision now, from the consequences of all those earlier wrong decisions. The trouble is, the processes by which the so-called 'international community' decides on any course of action are even slower than the war 'on the ground'. Take the 'no-fly zone' for example. This was proposed in a Turkish peace plan as early as last August. Other governments gradually came round to it. After much discussion and hesitation it was adopted by the United Nations Security Council in October. Then it turned out another resolution was required before any action could be taken to enforce it. The whole process had to be repeated with all the same hesitations. Only this week have aircraft with a mandate to enforce the no-fly zone at last been deployed. A similar process has now begun for other measures: air strikes against Serb artillery or other targets; lifting the embargo on arms supplies to the Bosnian army. Last week, when Lady Thatcher came out with her clarion call for the latter measure, British ministers dismissed it as 'emotional nonsense'. Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said much the same. By Monday, however, it was on a list of options being considered, or at least 'not ruled out', by both governments. Of course there are good arguments against this course of action, as there are against every course of action in this abominable situation. It would escalate, intensify and perhaps even prolong the fighting, without guaranteeing a different end result. It would, as Zoran Pajic, professor of international law at Sarajevo University, has pointed out, 'almost certainly enforce rather than heal the ethnic division of Bosnian territory, since better equipped Bosnian forces could improve their share of the Vance-Owen map but little more'. Some of the weapons would almost certainly fall into the wrong hands; while even in the 'right' hands some of them might well be used for vengeance killings or other atrocities. By lifting the embargo on supplies to one side only the UN would abandon neutrality, thereby exposing UN forces and other personnel now on the ground to retaliation and so forcing them to abandon their current humanitarian mission. That last argument seems the weakest. The UN is already not neutral, as its sanctions policy shows. Humanitarian relief work already requires military protection - why else are UN forces in Bosnia? And the UN relief effort could be kept clearly distinct from military intervention so long as all the fighting on the ground is still being done by local forces. The alternative urged by many idealists - notably Jane Sharp of the Institute of Public Policy Research* - is a full-scale military intervention to establish a 'UN protectorate' or another form of international administration for the whole of Bosnia. The pros and cons are argued out in the latest issue of the admirable War Report** - formerly Yugofax. The strongest argument in favour of a protectorate is that such an arrangement offers the only hope of putting Bosnia together again under a regime which would allow all the survivors to return to their original towns and villages and rebuild their homes in confidence and safety. That is very attractive, but the arguments against seem to me overwhelming. It is very unlikely that enough countries would be prepared to provide enough troops, police and administrators for such a long and open-ended task. The force, even if welcomed initially, would almost inevitably encounter resistance from Serb and Croat forces in some areas, and would thus find itself dragged into a guerrilla war. The states carrying out the intervention would not necessarily be as idealistic or enlightened as those now calling for it. There would almost certainly be confusion about the objectives. If troops do go in, it will most likely be to enforce, not a UN trusteeship, but a version of the Vance-Owen plan. In this case external forces will be responsible for keeping people away from their original homes, or for delivering them to the tender mercies of their ethnic rivals - policing a mosaic of internal borders without being in a position to guarantee human rights, or even human life, within the different provinces. Lifting the embargo would be a better bet, if only it were not done grudgingly and passively but as part of an active strategy to help the Bosnian army, supplying it with the weapons it needs and using Nato air power to assist its operations. (The more Nato is involved in planning and carrying out the operations, the better the chance of controlling them, averting fresh atrocities and a mass exodus of Bosnian Serbs.) Fat chance. On past form it will be at least six months before any actual weapons are delivered, by which time there may be no Bosnian army left to deliver them to. *Bankrupt in the Balkans: British Policy in Bosnia (IPPR, Pounds 2.95) **Available by subscription only from 1 Auckland Street, London SE11 5HU</p>

			<p><P> March 29, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DONOR DECRIES MAPPLETHORPE, BUT . . .  </P> <P> A major donor to an arts fund denied a report Wednesday that he threatened to  withhold contributions if the fund does not sever ties to a museum exhibiting  sexually explicit photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.  </P> <P> The Cincinnati Post reported that George L. Ballou II had confirmed his  participation in a campaign to get the Contemporary Arts Center to cancel the  exhibition including the sexually graphic pictures.  </P> <P> Ballou owns West Shell Inc., the city's largest real estate agency.  </P> <P> The museum withdrew Sunday from the Fine Arts Fund's $5-million annual  fund-raising drive, saying it wanted to protect other arts groups from a  boycott by donors.  </P> <P> Ballou said he opposes the exhibit as pornographic, but said he never  threatened to withhold corporate or personal donations from the fund. He said  he is the 17th-largest donor, but declined to give a specific figure.  </P> <P> "For my personal donation, I think the exhibit is inappropriate and  pornographic," Ballou said. "We have told our people, 'This is where we stand,  and let your conscience be your guide.' I guess what I resent is the  implication that we are applying pressure."  </P> <P> Officials of the Fine Arts Fund declined to comment. Lee A. Carter, chairman of  the Institute of Fine Arts, which administers the fund, has said the group has  received complaints but no explicit threats to withhold donations over the  exhibition.  </P> <P> Nine of the 175 photographs in the exhibition depict homoerotic and  sadomasochistic sex acts.  </P> <P> Additional story, Page F6  </P></p>

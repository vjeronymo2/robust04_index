			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / International Capital Markets: La Generale prices offering SOCIETE Generale de Belgique, the Belgian holding company, has priced its offering of 2.99m units in Union Miniere, its metals subsidiary, writes Tracy Corrigan. Each unit consists of one share and one warrant. The shares are priced at BFr2,350. Each warrant entitles the holder to buy one share at a strike price of BFr2,450 from November 26, 1993 to December 15 1994. The sale will bring Societe Generale's stake down to 50.1 per cent. The parent company has said it intends to remain a majority shareholder, and under the terms of the offering is not allowed to sell more shares in the next year. The offering is seen as a play on zinc prices and on the dollar/Belgian franc rate, according to lead underwriter SG Warburg.</p>

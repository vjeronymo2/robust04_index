			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 19 KYODO -- The Farm Ministry plans to  review its "gentan" policy of curtailing rice fields, which  forces farmers to cut their rice acreage every year in line with  the government's annual plan for rice supplies, government  sources said Sunday [19 June].    Under the current system introduced in 1971 to cope with a  glut of domestic rice supplies, every rice grower is forced to  reduce rice paddies by the same percentage to curb the total  volume of domestically produced rice.    The policy, however, has been criticized for discouraging  rice farmers who want to enhance production efficiency by  expanding their rice fields to compete with less expensive  foreign rice.    Moreover, due to an unusually cool summer last year, the  country suffered its worst rice shortage in the postwar period,  prompting the government to urgently import foreign rice and  setting off a panic among consumers searching for domestic  grains.    Under the new policy being considered by the Ministry of  Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, the government would set a  target of reducing total rice acreage in each prefecture, with  flexible consideration of each farmer's desire to produce rice,  the sources said.    The government would also provide subsidies to rice growers  meeting the annual government-set target for curtailing rice  paddies.    The ministry will work out the details of the new system  after the Agricultural Administration Council, an advisory body  to the prime minister, submits an interim report on the future  of Japanese agriculture in July, according to the sources.</p>

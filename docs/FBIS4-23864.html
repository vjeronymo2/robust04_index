			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban June 16 SAPA -- The African National Congress  was determined to rule every part of the country and would use  its national majority to break the Inkatha Freedom Party [IFP],  ANC MP Peter Mokaba warned on Thursday [16 June]. Addressing  hundreds of supporters at a June 16 commemoration rally outside  Durban City Hall, Mr Mokaba issued the warning in response to a  dispute about the siting of KwaZulu/Natal's capital.    The ANC would use its national majority to "break" the  Inkatha Freedom Party if the IFP tried to do the same to the ANC  in the province, he said. It should co-operate with the ANC if  it did not want to see its leader, minister of home affairs Mr  Mangosuthu Buthelezi, "packing his bags for home".    "We were determined to march to Ulundi...but not as the  capital."    The problems of KwaZulu/Natal were of national importance  and  the ANC was "determined to rule every part of the country".    ANC MEC [member of the executive committee] for roads,  transport and traffic control Mr S'bu Ndebele told the crowd  Ulundi was impractical as a capital because it was far from  major urban areas.    The ANC favours Pietermaritzburg.    Local South African Communist Party leader Dennis Nkosi told  the crowd: "Every student, every worker, every man and woman,  young and old, must become part of the fight to make sure  Pietermaritzburg becomes the capital."    Three ANC MECs boycotted an Executive Council meeting at  Ulundi this week and the party has vowed to boycott a month-end  meeting of the provincial legislature.    Durban Management Committee chairman Mr Peter Mansfield  suggested his city as a temporary capital until the dispute was  resolved, SABC [South African Broadcasting Corporation] radio  news reported.</p>

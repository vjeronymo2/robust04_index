			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Business community happy to see Sinn Fein at negotiating table Ninety-five per cent of Ulster's business community would be content to see Sinn Fein at the negotiating table as part of the search for peace if the IRA were to abandon violence for a substantial period, according to a Financial Times poll, write Tim Coone and Jimmy Burns. Only a handful of companies share the view of the Rev Ian Paisley of the Democratic Unionist party, who argues Sinn Fein should indefinitely be excluded from the political process. Ulster executives also back the politically controversial proposal which has been at the heart of Dublin's peace plan to test any political settlement through separate referendums in both parts of Ireland. The survey - the first of its kind - will hearten the London and Dublin governments as it shows that senior executives firmly back their efforts to achieve peace. But the executives do not believe that either the IRA or Loyalist paramilitaries can be defeated militarily. Financial Times reporters sought the views of 80 chief executives of Northern Ireland's leading businesses last week. Fifty-six responded and they were divided about the prospects of a settlement, with optimists roughly matching pessimists. More than 60 per cent were prepared for the British government to concede enhanced north-south structures for economic co-operation to achieve a settlement. Details, Page 10</p>

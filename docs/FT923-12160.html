			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / UK Company News: Electron reaps restructuring benefits with rise to Pounds 1.42m RESTRUCTURING at Electron House, begun two years ago, is working through in results with the electronic components, computer systems and services distributor benefiting from reduced costs and lower working capital. A proposed sale of the wholesale computing business operations of Bytech Computers for some Pounds 5m will effectively reduce borrowings by Pounds 9m, and cut the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds from 110 per cent to 25 per cent. The business was being acquired by its senior management team led by 3i, the investment capital group. Sales within the group will be almost halved but it will be able to concentrate resources on higher margin business. Pre-tax profit rose 47 per cent to Pounds 1.42m in the year to May 31, against Pounds 968,000. Turnover slipped to Pounds 125.4m (Pounds 126.9m), to which the operations being sold contributed Pounds 61m. Mr Robert Leigh, chairman, said the Australian and New Zealand businesses recovered to produce a 'more acceptable' performance. The UK component companies, excluding the car aerial business from which the group withdrew last year, increased sales and profits marginally. Computer companies generally produced a good result although CEM lost sales through the temporary moratorium on government spending in Northern Ireland. Earnings were 2.62p (1.65p); the sale and subsequent reorganisation should have little effect on earnings, Mr Leigh said. The final dividend is 1.35p for a 2.35p (2.25p) total. As to prospects, he told shareholders that business continued to improve slowly through increased market share and productivity rather than the market showing any signs of uplift.</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: Tokyo to restrict finance companies JAPAN'S 37,000 finance companies, which have been widely blamed for fuelling the recent surge in land prices, face new controls on their activities. If a bill recently presented to the Diet (parliament) is passed, finance companies with assets of more than Y50bn will be required to file detailed reports of their lending books each year to the Ministry of Finance. In addition, they will be subject to spot checks by ministry officials. The need for tighter controls was highlighted this week when Shizushin Lease, a leasing company, with debts of Y255.5bn, filed for court protection from creditors. If the company went under, it would be the first financial group to go bankrupt during the present squeeze on credit. The new bill covers leasing companies, housing and consumer credit operations, which are collectively known in Japan as non-banks, to distinguish them from banks. Non-banks have not been subject to the same tight control as banks in the past because they were relatively small. But in the past five years they have taken advantage of the expansion in demand for credit to increase their loan portfolios to around Y70,000bn - or around one sixth of Japan's total banking assets. The bill comes in response to fierce criticism of finance companies from politicians, newspaper commentators and others, who blamed them for supplying too much credit to the property market. The shortcomings of the regulatory system emerged after the Finance Ministry introduced strict limits on bank lending to real estate companies but was unable to do the same for finance companies. The ministry's moves to regulate finance companies prompted strong opposition from some credit organisations which said they were being unfairly blamed for the crisis in land. They argued it was wrong to lump together companies which lent little to property developers - such as some credit card companies - with others which had extensive dealings in real estate. Also, they said the distinction between banks and 'non-banks' was unfair since some 'non-banks' were closely affiliated to banks. These concerns are recognised in an annex to the bill which, says the Finance Ministry, will only use its new powers in relation to land loans.</p>

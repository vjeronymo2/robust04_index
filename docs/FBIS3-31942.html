If the yes vote wins, the Constitution will be changed and  the legislative elections will be moved up, the Supreme Court of  Justice will be changed, and the term for holders of public  office will be reduced, among other measures.    Approximately 20 international observers, delegates from  human rights organizations, and police and Army forces are  watching so that the referendum will be held normally. The  referendum has been preceded by a wave of bomb attacks in recent  days. No one has claimed credit for these attacks.    President Ramiro de Leon and the Congress deputies have  agreed on a referendum to end the confrontation the executive  branch and Congress had last year, when congressmen refused to  resign as the chief of state had asked to "purge" institutional  corruption.    De Leon and the country's most important political parties  have called for a "yes" vote to the reforms, but the left and  the guerrillas--the only ones left in Central America and that  have been armed since 1960--have urged the people to abstain  from voting and to boycott the referendum, because they do not  believe it will resolve the country's political and economic  problems.</p>

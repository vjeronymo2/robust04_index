			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Tragi-comedy of errors 'I have heard all the arguments before; only the countries using them change from time to time' - Professor Posthuma of the Netherland Bank, quoted in De Vries, The Non-reform of the International Monetary System, 1976. Nobody who had to report on the international crises of the 1960s and 1970s can watch the present argument within the European Monetary System without an agonising sense of deja vu. There is one huge change: the Americans are now on the sidelines. Floating has its own problems, but does confer a degree of freedom. A system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates allows little room for conflicting interests, and so political horns may be truly locked, and negotiation turn into a multilateral monologue - the term a frustrated Jeremy Morse coined to describe the futile wrangling in the Committee of Twenty (charged with designing a new world monetary system, and known for the past 18 years as the Interim Committee, thus confirming his pessimism). The rules of a fixed-rate wrangle require first a pivot currency, which is also the core store of value in the system. Within Europe the D-Mark has taken over this role, and with it, the charges that used to be brought again the Americans, and the defences they used to put up. German domestic policy has its main impact outside Germany; or as the French once said of the Americans, when they sneeze, the rest of the system catches pneumonia. But the Germans now argue, as the Americans did in the early 1970s, that this is a problem for their partners, not for them; they are free to adjust their policies, or their exchange rates, if that would make them more comfortable. The standard response, now as then, is to attack the domestic policies of the core country. The received wisdom of the rest of Europe is that German fiscal policy is too lax and its monetary policy too tight. A decade ago, exactly the same charges were made against President Ronald Reagan - though in a floating system, they were made with less heat. These charges are rejected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its new German report, although this does question the German stress on the growth of M3 as a policy target. But there is no such thing as a new mistake; Lady Thatcher (or more likely, Lord Lawson) could prove from British experience that when interest rates are pushed up, broad money grows faster, not slower. If the Germans continue to repeat UK history, the European currencies may be dragged up to almost any level against the dollar, with results for the whole continent as damaging as they were for Britain then. UK policy was reversed thanks to Sir Alan Walters, who had the ear of Mrs Thatcher. But Sir Alan is now marginalised as one of the Liverpool Six; even if one man had similar influence in Europe, it is not clear whose ear he would have to win. Meanwhile, the German reply has been rehearsed many times before: their partners should agree to a D-Mark revaluation, which would check German inflation and stimulate demand in the rest of the system. The French have taken up their traditional blocking position, and have now been joined by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, who is clearly another number-fetishist. History unfortunately suggests that the economic situation will have to get alarmingly worse before they can be frightened out of their fixed poses. However, history does contain partial solutions, as well as endlessly recurring problems. Three might be applicable here. First, countries with strong currencies can do something to keep their troubles and restraints at home, even if they allow free capital movements. From 1960 to 1978, the Germans or the Swiss repeatedly used withholding taxes, or special bardepot reserve requirement on their banks, to discourage foreign inflows. These measures were never fully effective - notably, they leave business in the strong-currency country free to borrow cheaply abroad; but they were partly effective, and would allow some interest-rate freedom for partners. A second possibility would be for the Germans to bang heads together, as the Americans repeatedly did - once by marooning the whole Group of Five on the circling presidential yacht Sequoia, on a broiling Washington day, until they reached agreement. Under such pressures the French did agree to a rising D-Mark, the Japanese did revalue, and gold was demonetised. Or simplest (and unfortunately least probable), Germany could imitate another form of American floating, and leave the ERM for a time (an interim?) while reunification is sorted out, and float Reagan-like above their troubles and ours.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require that certain landing gear brakes be inspected for wear and replaced if the wear limits prescribed in this proposal are not met, and that the specified wear limits be incorporated into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There are approximately 100 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 and &hyph;400 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 10 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 2 U.S. operators would be affected by this proposed AD. For these airplanes and operators, although the proposed rule would require the incorporation of maximum brake wear limits into the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program, no other specific additional action, inspection, or part replacement costs relative to that requirement would be involved; such actions are currently a part of the current maintenance program. However, it is estimated that it would take approximately 1 work hour, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the requirement into its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed requirement to revise the FAA-approved maintenance inspection program on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;200 series airplanes is estimated to be $110, or $55 per operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FAA estimates that 20 Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes of U.S. registry and 19 U.S. operators would be affected by this proposed AD. It is estimated that it would take approximately 1 work hour, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour, for each operator to incorporate the proposed revision of its FAA-approved maintenance inspection program. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of that proposed requirement on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes is estimated to be $1,045, or $55 per operator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally, the FAA estimates that for operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes, it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to shorten the wear pins for replacement brakes, and 8 work hours per airplane to change the brakes, at an average labor rate of $55 per work hour. The cost of required parts to accomplish the change in wear limits for these airplanes (that is, the cost resulting from the requirement to change the brakes before they are worn to their previously approved limits for a one-time change) would be approximately $912 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of these proposed requirements on U.S. operators of Model BAC 1&hyph;11&hyph;400 series airplanes is estimated to be $29,240, or $1,462 per airplane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These total cost figures are based on the assumption that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

			<p><P> August 18, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: ENERGY CONSERVATION PRAISED  </P> <P> Inglewood this week received kudos from a state commission for saving energy by  installing a cost-cutting new cooling system at City Hall.  </P> <P> "Others need to pay attention to Inglewood," said Stephen M. Rhoads, executive  director of the California Energy Commission. He told city officials that  Inglewood is a leader among California cities in energy conservation.  </P> <P> The city's Thermal Energy Storage Cooling System, which cost $453,000, was  dedicated Tuesday, though it began operating in early June. Expected to save  the city more than $100,000 a year, it was bought with a $400,000 loan from the  California Energy Commission and an $85,000 grant from Southern California  Edison Co., city officials said.  </P> <P> The computerized cooling system consists of a 144-ton low-temperature  refrigeration plant, a pumping plant and a 1600-ton-per-hour ice bank. During  off-peak hours, it manufactures ice that is used later to chill water to  air-condition the building. It will save money by shifting 428 kilowatts of  daily electricity use to the night, when demand and utility rates are lower,  officials said.  </P></p>

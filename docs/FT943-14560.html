			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / BBC may buy more shows from external producers The BBC is considering buying more television programmes from ITV, Channel 4 and independent producers, Mr Bob Phillis, deputy director-general said at a London media conference yesterday. The corporation, which already has programme deals with Granada and Central, two of the largest ITV companies, is seeking flexibility in programme supply in the wake of last week's white paper, which promised it more commercial freedom. Mr Phillis also told the conference, organised by the Labour party, that he would not rule out wider co-operation with ITV companies in particular regions or on launching new satellite channels. The BBC has already announced a strategic alliance with Pearson, the media group that owns the Financial Times, with the intention of launching two satellite channels for Europe this year. These will feature news and entertainment but the corporation is also looking at specialist channels in areas such as education and documentaries. Mr Phillis said some ITV companies had great expertise in areas the BBC was interested in developing. He also told the conference that the corporation had set up a further study of digital terrestrial television which would be completed by March. The government last week linked the possible privatisation of BBC transmission services with the launch of new digital channels. Mr Phillis said yesterday: 'Our concerns are to ensure the most reliable and cost-effective service for our audiences and we will judge any possible changes on that basis.'</p>

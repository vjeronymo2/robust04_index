			<p>BFN     [Text] Mikhail Poltoranin, chairman of the State Duma  Committee for Information Policy, told a RIA correspondent today  that the single information area was in danger of  disintegrating. He said that a dangerous policy--characterized  by a trend toward replacing the state media with commercial  structures interested in having their programs broadcast to  central Russia only--could be discerned in the country.    The possibility that the Ostankino company might cut its  output from 19 to five and a half hours in every 24 hours gave  rise to particular anxiety in this context, Poltoranin noted.  He emphasized that the activities of foreign news agencies in  Russia also did tremendous damage to the country's sovereignty  in the area of information. He said that having received the  right to gather information, these agencies immediately  disseminated it in the form they found convenient. This trend  also posed dangers to the Russian information area, said the  chairman of the information policy committee.</p>

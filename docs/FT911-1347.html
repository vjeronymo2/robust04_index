			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Observer: Relaxation The Bank of England is as famous for boasting its forecasts are superior to the Treasury's, as it is for refusing to publish them. But what are we to make of the Old Lady's sudden interest in cold-calling top economists and inviting them in for a chat? After years of turgid meetings of gilt-edged market makers at the Bank, some teenage scribblers hesitated before accepting the invitation from Andrew Brooks, head of forecasting in the Bank's economics division. In the past, the information flow has been all one way and the central bankers kept annoyingly silent. Not so in the current round of informal meetings with the City, I hear. The Bank has opened a 'two-way dialogue' with analysts, which has been going on since the Budget and continues today. The privileged few are understandably chuffed. They think they're in a position to gain valuable insights into the Bank's latest thinking on monetary policy. If so, it would be surprising. But the relaxation of the tight-lipped policy is welcome, especially if it eventually leads the Bank to publish its own economic forecasts, independently of those of its Treasury paymasters. What better way for the Bank to show it is not just another nationalised industry?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Ships from the Indian Navy and the Republic of  Singapore Navy (RSN) have begun a week-long naval exercise in  the Indian Ocean. Two RSN missile corvettes and an Indian Navy  submarine will take part in the exercise involving  anti-submarine warfare manoeuvres. The exercise will continue  until Sunday.    A Mindef [Ministry of Defense] statement issued on Tuesday  said the exercise was designed to "promote professional  interaction and to enhance bilateral ties between the two  navies". About 350 officers and men from the two navies will  take part in this second joint naval exercise. The first one  was also held in the Indian Ocean in February last year. The two  RSN missile corvettes, the RSS Victory and RSS Valour, left for  the exercise on Friday. The commander of the RSN task group is  Lt-Colonel Gary Lee, who is also commander of the RSN's 188  Squadron.    The two vessels arrived at Port Blair in the South Andaman  Islands on Sunday and participants spent Sunday and Monday in  familiarisation and shore training before sailing for the waters  around the Andaman and Nicobar islands for the exercise.    The Mindef statement said the joint exercise between the RSN  and the Indian Navy reflected the warm relationship between the  two countries.</p>

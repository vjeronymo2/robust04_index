			<p>920529 FT  29 MAY 92 / PowerGen staff back radical pay package EMPLOYEES at PowerGen, the electricity generator, have voted in favour of a radical shake-up of pay and collective bargaining arrangements that will lead to significant salary rises, Michael Smith writes. PowerGen is the first of the generators to win workforce approval for a local pay and conditions deal. It will lead to harmonised terms and conditions for all 6,500 employees, single-table bargaining and increasingly flexible working. Nalgo, the public-service union, said clerical assistants on Pounds 9,631 last year would receive Pounds 2,220 more this year. That was partly because of the last national pay deal of 5.5 per cent, but mainly because of the restructuring. Not all of the money will be consolidated into salaries - Pounds 400 plus 2 per cent of salary was in the form of a one-off payment. Most PowerGen employees will receive less substantial rises than the clerical assistants.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kiev, 6 April (AFP) -- Ukrainian special forces and  senior military officers have arrived unexpectedly in Crimea  while its separatist leader Yuryy Meshkov is abroad, officials  in his office said on Wednesday.    About 3O men of the interior ministry special forces took up  station on a warship after arriving here on Tuesday, ITAR-TASS  news agency said. It said top generals from army intelligence,  the air force, counter-espionage and the national guard had also  come.    The return of Meshkov from a visit to Cyprus had been  delayed  for eight hours because Turkey had closed its airspace, the  agency said, quoting a member of the crew on Meshkov's plane.    The Crimean chief's press attache Igor Azarov told AFP that  a  link between the delay of the flight home and the appearance of  the Ukrainian special forces "cannot be ruled out."    Meshkov held a referendum last month at the same time as  Ukraine's general election and won overwhelming backing for  closer ties with Russia. Russians comprise 67 percent of the  population in Crimea, which the then Soviet leadership  transferred to Ukraine in 1954.</p>

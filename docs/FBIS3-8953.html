			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bratislava, March 15 (CTK) -- All personnel  questions concerning the composition of a new Slovak government  are still open, Pavol Kanis, deputy chairman of the Democratic  Left Party (SDL), said at a press conference today. He thus  indirectly dismissed the claim by leaders of some right-wing  parties that the new cabinet has already been completed to 80  percent.    Asked whether he himself was to take over a government seat,  Kanis said that the negotiating parties -- originally the  opposition which brought about the fall of the preceding cabinet  -- had agreed not to propose their top leaders to the new  government. "I consider myself a top party leader," he added.  However, he admitted that he had not attended the last  negotiations on the issue, and therefore he had no exact  information.    Speculations emerged during the talks between the SDL and  the  Meciar-led Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), even  before the fall of the government of Vladimir Meciar on March 11  that Kanis could be appointed the foreign minister in a possible  HZDS-SDL coalition. According to some sources, all parties  involved in the current talks on the composition of the new  cabinet, are striving to fill the post of the foreign minister  with their people.    Kanis stressed that the SDL viewed the envisaged cabinet as  "temporary." Its main task should be the preparation of the  early elections, he added. He indicated that the SDL would  insist on calling the early elections. [passage omitted]    Kanis dismissed speculation of a rift within the SDL, as  claimed recently by Meciar. The SDL has enough experienced  members who "have mastered political practice" and know that  only an appropriate compromise can guarantee the success in this  field.</p>

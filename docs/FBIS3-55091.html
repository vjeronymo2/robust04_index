An ITAR-TASS correspondent learned today from the Chechen  president's press service that Zviad Gamsakhurdia's wife Manana  had noted that the place where Zviad Gamsakhurdia spent that  night had been surrounded by unknown persons. According to her  version, "the Georgian authorities had information about  Gamsakhurdia's death but carefully concealed it and are still  concealing it to this moment."    A statement issued in Groznyy today by Zviad Gamsakhurdia's  press service notes that a few minutes before his death he said  that "he is committing this act in full awareness as a sign of  protest against the existing regime in Georgia and of his  inability, as president, to improve the situation and to restore  legality and law and order."</p>

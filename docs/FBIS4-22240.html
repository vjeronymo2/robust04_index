Shunevich, first deputy  commander of border forces of Turkmenistan, was on the line.    "Remember how during our meeting last year I showed you a  file of officers' applications requesting either transfer to a  new assignment in Russia or discharge? Well, in the last two or  three weeks it has `slimmed down' noticeably. Many officers have  pulled their applications...."    I can well understand the emotion and feelings of Vladislav  Aleksandrovich. "Last year's" discussion was held about two  months ago, and there has been a diametrical change in the mood  of the chief of staff, who can finally dispense with the daily  persuasion of each officer who had submitted an application that  he stay on.    The situation has been changed abruptly for the better by  the  agreements on dual citizenship and the status of servicemen of  Russia's border troops on the territory of Turkmenistan which  have been concluded between the two countries. Turkmenia's  Russians have acquired dependable guarantees of protection of  their rights, social primarily.    It should be specified immediately that the situation of  Russians, and of the so-called Russian-speaking population in  the republic also, had been and remains the most favorable,  perhaps, among the several tens of millions of their kinsmen who  by the will of fate found themselves overnight citizens abroad.  It would be fitting here to pay tribute to the political  intuition and purely human sensitivity of President Saparmurad  Niyazov. Whereas in other regions of the former state  politicians have succumbed to the nationalist narcotic, from  which their "withdrawal" continues, the Turkmen leader adopted  as one of the first enactments of his presidential activity an  edict according to which infringement of people's rights on the  basis of affiliation to another nation or religion was deemed to  be a heinous crime. Somewhat later this was emphasized in the  constitution and reflected in criminal legislation.    The problem of citizenship, which is painful for some former  Soviet republics, has been resolved here in such a way that a  substantial portion of the population did not even know there  was one. All those resident in the country at the time of  adoption of the Citizenship Act were deemed to be citizens of  Turkmenistan, if the individual so desired, of course. The  introduction of the Roman alphabet as the official Turkmen  language has not been forced. True, the requirement of the  compulsory knowledge by leaders of the top tier of the language  of the indigenous people has brought about quite a significant  reduction in the number of Russians, Ukrainians, and  Belorussians in various echelons of power. But this feature has  not caused serious complications: Many of those formerly sent by  Moscow "to reinforce the personnel" have happily returned to  their native hearths. Local former authorities have, on the  other hand, no less successfully adapted to the changed  conditions, having moved into entrepreneurial structures. The  benevolent relations between representatives of all  nationalities, which had taken shape over decades, have been  preserved at the social level. And even today in even the most  savage store skirmish for scarce commodities you will not hear  offensive comments of the "Go to Russia and buy it there..."  type.    "Ours is an international work force," K. Khomutov,  technician of the Ashgabat Akhal Airline, shares his thoughts.  "Initially, after the republic had gained independence, there  were those who wished to argue about who owed whom more and  attempts to drive a wedge between us and the Turkmen. But Ilyas  Berdyyev, chief of the Turkmenavia Administration, reacted  promptly. He declared strictly that professional and  businesslike qualities would, as before, come first for him, and  he must be given credit for having kept his word in practice. We  are working calmly and have no intention of leaving."    "The situation in the country is, in fact, calm, society is  not split, and tranquillity and benevolence reign," V. Cherepov,  ambassador of Russia in Turkmenistan, agrees. "Nonetheless...  there is an exodus of the Russian-speaking population. I  consider it an entirely natural process. It began a while back,  at the start of the 1970's, and the increase in migration  following the disintegration of the Union is perfectly  explicable: People have a certain feeling of estrangement from  their historical homeland, relatives, and friends. And there  are, in addition, transport and currency barriers and  difficulties over children's tuition in Russian higher  educational institutions. The children are taking in their old  folk. Having completed their service, servicemen are leaving.  And despite the very warm, friendly relations between our two  countries, it was important to put the resettlement process on a  legal, controlled basis. We have managed to do this as a result  of the signing of the agreements on dual citizenship and the  status of Russian servicemen."    "Vadim Georgiyevich, we shall be revealing no big secret if  we speak of the difficult path toward the signing of the  document on dual citizenship and migration...."    "No, certain `hidden reefs' emerged. Fortunately, President  Niyazov is a politician who knows how to move toward a  compromise, and arrogance is alien to him. At the most decisive  hour, when it seemed that the Turkmen side would not agree with  a most important point of the agreement, Saparmurad Atayevich  went for the jugular, so to speak, of the two edicts he had  issued previously. They concerned questions of the sale of  privatized housing and the transfer of financial resources.    "So the almost 400,000 Russians of Turkmenistan have  acquired  the opportunity to hold dual citizenship and resolve the problem  of a move to Russia in civilized fashion. The parties have  undertaken to put migration under state control--to facilitate  the emigrant's privatization of his residence, the  transportation of his personal effects, and the conversion of  money earned by honest labor--and to help him fend for himself  in his new location. Important also is the legal aspect in the  day-to-day life of the Russians of Turkmenia who are acquiring  citizenship of Russia. Although they are required to comply  fully with the laws of the country of residence, they are  entitled, in the event of a disagreement with a decision by the  local law enforcement authorities, say, to appeal to a court of  the second state.    "Yes, the Turkmen leadership once again demonstrated the  balanced nature of its approaches in domestic and foreign policy  and an aspiration to act in the channel of international law. As  we know, this step has evoked ambivalent evaluations among its  CIS neighbors. Whereas Askar Akayev, president of Kyrgyzstan,  decided to propose that parliament make an amendment to the  constitution allowing of the possibility of the adoption of dual  citizenship, his Uzbek colleague, Islam Karimov, has once again  publicly repeated his proposition to the effect that a person  with dual citizenship is a person without a homeland, in whom  the feeling of patriotism has atrophied. I would very much like  in response to quote artless lines from a letter of the  economist Galina Mamedova from the oblast center of Tashauz  addressed to the newspaper TURKMENSKAYA ISKRA: `15 years ago I  married a Turkmen boy and came to live in Turkmenistan. This was  not the near abroad at that time, and both I and my parents  living in Yaroslavl Oblast and numerous relations scattered  throughout Russia remained within one country. We could meet  several times a year. But then this happened--the big country  fell apart. And people such as I automatically found themselves  estranged from the motherland and their near ones and dear ones.  On the other hand, I have become attached to Turkmenistan and I  consider myself a citizen of this state, my family is here, and  my children were born here, yet I shall continue to be a  daughter of Russia. A restless heart was being torn in two....    "`It is impossible to convey in words my feelings following  the signing by Niyazov and Yeltsin of the agreement on dual  citizenship! Now, a citizen of Turkmenistan with all the rights  of this country and Russia on my side also here, it has not  rejected me, I can live with redoubled energy and rejoice in  each new day....'    "And the new day in Russian-Turkmen relations is being  prepared today even. Work on draft agreements on the avoidance  of dual taxation, interbank relations, and mutual legal  assistance is under way.    "The times demand the restoration of all the severed ties in  new soil--equal cooperation. We cannot live without one  another--these words from a once-popular song are highly  pertinent," V. Cherepov says.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 6.6.1. Alignment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Clean all optical surfaces. Even a small amount of dirt can significantly degrade the image.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Rough focus the objective on a sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Close down the field iris so that it is visible in the field of view. Focus the image of the iris with the condenser focus. Center the image of the iris in the field of view.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Install the phase telescope and focus on the phase rings. Critically center the rings. Misalignment of the rings results in astigmatism which will degrade the image.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Place the phase-shift test slide on the microscope stage and focus on the lines. The analyst must see line set 3 and should see at least parts of 4 and 5 but, not see line set 6 or 6. A microscope/microscopist combination which does not pass this test may not be used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> 6.6.2. Counting Fibers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Place the prepared sample slide on the mechanical stage of the microscope. Position the center of the wedge under the objective lens and focus upon the sample.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Start counting from one end of the wedge and progress along a radial line to the other end (count in either direction from perimeter to wedge tip). Select fields randomly, without looking into the eyepieces, by slightly advancing the slide in one direction with the mechanical stage control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Continually scan over a range of focal planes (generally the upper 10 to 15 &mu;m of the filter surface) with the fine focus control during each field count. Spend at least 5 to 15 seconds per field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Most samples will contain asbestos fibers with fiber diameters less than 1 &mu;m. Look carefully for faint fiber images. The small diameter fibers will be very hard to see. However, they are an important contribution to the total count.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Count only fibers equal to or longer than 5 &mu;m. Measure the length of curved fibers along the curve.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Count fibers which have a length to width ratio of 3:1 or greater.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Count all the fibers in at least 20 fields. Continue counting until either 100 fibers are counted or 100 fields have been viewed; whichever occurs first. Count all the fibers in the final field.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Fibers lying entirely within the boundary of the Walton-Beckett graticule field shall receive a count of 1. Fibers crossing the boundary once, having one end within the circle shall receive a count of 1/2. Do not count any fiber that crosses the graticule boundary more than once. Reject and do not count any other fibers even though they may be visible outside the graticule area. If a fiber touches the circle, it is considered to cross the line.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / N Cyprus may end protection of Nadir NORTHERN CYPRUS has given its strongest indication to date that it may be prepared to abandon its uncompromising protection of Mr Asil Nadir, the fugitive former Polly Peck chairman. The authorities, with the apparent blessing of the Turkish government, have invited senior officers of the Serious Fraud Office to the island without any apparent diplomatic strings. The fraud office had argued that it was unable to pursue its investigation on the island because the local authorities and Ankara were insisting on a formal diplomatic exchange. This would have implied British recognition of Turkish sovereignty over northern Cyprus, which the UK refuses to give. The Serious Fraud Office confirmed last night that one of its investigating teams travelled to northern Cyprus yesterday at the 'invitation' of the Turkish Cypriot authorities. 'We have been invited to explore the possibility of future investigation and co-operation,' the fraud office said last night. It is believed that a two-person team, led by Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO lawyer handling the Nadir case, is representing the Serious Fraud Office on the island. The Foreign Office said last night that there was no diplomatic coercion behind the decision and that the invitation had come from the Turkish Cypriots. The initiative follows a visit to Turkey last month by Ms Harris at which she is understood to have discussed how Mr Nadir might be persuaded to return to the UK to attend his trial in September. The visit was the first apparent break in the deadlock over attempts to bring Mr Nadir to justice since he jumped his Pounds 3.5m bail on May 5th. and flew to northern Cyprus. Mr Nadir has indicated his intention to fly to Turkey to regain the remnants of his former business empire which he would be legally able to own and run in Turkey although he is a bankrupt in the UK. There was no immediate reaction yesterday from the northern Cypriot authorities or from Mr Nadir to the development. However SFO officials indicated they hoped the invitation signified the prospect of significant progress on the Nadir case in the coming days.</p>

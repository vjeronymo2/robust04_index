			<p><P> October 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD BRINGS HOME TO U.S. SOLDIERS;  </P> <P> MILITARY: CANDY AND KOOL-AID HELP FIGHT BOREDOM IN THE DESERT.  </P> <P> M &amp; Ms and Charms may seem like unlikely army rations, but they are being  served in the Saudi desert. For the 145,000 soldiers of Operation Desert  Shield, the candy represents home.  </P> <P> It is hot in the desert -- 110 to 120 degrees at midday. Sand is constantly  blowing through the air and getting in soldiers' teeth. The days are long and  boring. "When you have no access to anything to entertain you," says Maj. Frank  Takacs, chief of proponency division of the Army Center of Excellence  Subsistence, U.S. Army Quartermaster Center and School, Fort Lee, Va., "food  becomes a very big morale factor. It's the one thing the troops look forward  to."  </P> <P> Takacs says that it is the army's goal to feed everyone a cafeteria-type meal.  "But," he says, "we don't have the facilities or the refrigeration to do so.  T-rations and MREs fill that void."  </P> <P> Tray or T-rations are meals put together from precooked, preproportioned food  that is simply heated in boiling water, opened with a can opener and scooped  onto plates. They are part of a new field kitchen system that eliminates the  need for kitchen personnel and cooking from scratch. T-rations enable the  military to feed about 200 soldiers with just a two-person crew. They are  useful in the extreme heat of the desert where sanitation is a big concern and  meals must be consumed very quickly.  </P> <P> Tray rations come in packages that feed 18 people. Containers are heated in  huge vats of boiling water and emptied fast. The contents are served  immediately to avoid bacteria development. Then the soldiers file past a heat  table in the Army's Mobile Kitchen Trailer and pick up the other components of  the meal: pound cake, bread, milk, lemon beverage powder, coffee and peanut  butter and jelly.  </P> <P> (A breakfast tray ration is a Western omelet, potatoes with bacon pieces,  peaches, apple-cinnamon oatmeal, bread, milk, orange juice, coffee and cocoa.)  </P> <P> Meals Ready-To-Eat (MREs) are another matter. Like T-rations, MREs are  precooked and prepackaged. But these sealed, flexible bundles of aluminum and  plastic are individual servings that replace the canned C-rations that were  once served to this country's rank and file. They contain entrees ranging from  beef stew to tuna and noodles.  </P> <P> MREs are lightweight, fit into a soldier's pack and are easy to use when on  patrol. The food doesn't even need to be heated. The soldiers simply tear off  the sealed edge and dig in with a plastic spoon (part of the kit). These  shelf-stable meals -- each lasts up to 36 months -- are the result of years of  research and evaluation. They make up at least one-third of the meals being  consumed by American troops in Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> "A lot of testing has gone into the current MREs," Takacs said. "Sensory  evaluations were conducted by the soldiers so they could tell us what they  like. (Their likes include name-brand candy, hot sauce and Kool-Aid. The Army  also discovered that the soldiers prefer Tasters' Choice to regular dehydrated  coffee and precooked meats to freeze-dried.)  </P> <P> But MREs aren't just a better tasting luxury. They are a necessity for  survival, explains Harvey Keene, of the U.S. Army Natick Research and  Development Center, the branch that developed them.  </P> <P> "We're always looking for ways to make subsistence items lighter because a  soldier can only carry so much weight. He's hauling ammunition and food, and on  extended patrol, every ounce or pound that you take off a subsistence load or  equipment load translates into a greater combat load. He can carry another  grenade, another clip of ammunition -- something that allows him to survive in  a firefight."  </P> <P> However, the soldiers are not always off in the field eating food from pouches.  When they are not on patrol they eat in mess halls that have been set up  throughout the Arabian desert. And in the best of times they are eating a  "cafeteria-type meal" of fresh food supplied by independent Saudi food service  providers. Even when the mess hall is forced to serve T-rations or MREs, the  meals are supplemented with fresh fruit, vegetables and milk.  </P> <P> "We're sort of in a business like any other company," says Takacs. "We're  trying to make sure that the customer is satisfied. It's a continuous process."  </P></p>

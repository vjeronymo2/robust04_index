			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Rivers watchdog warns on pits Pumping water out of abandoned mines in the Durham coalfield, which costs British Coal Pounds 1m a year, must continue in order to avoid a serious pollution threat to the River Wear, the National Rivers Authority warned yesterday. The river pollution watchdog said new information and results from observation boreholes had led consultants to revise upwards their estimates of the volume of polluted mine water which would enter the Wear should pumping cease. British Coal maintained pumping at nine places in central County Durham, where deep mining ended long ago to protect coastal pits, which were the Durham coalfield's last collieries. But with the pits' recent closure, it now has no operational need to maintain the pumping network. The NRA statement, based on research by consultant Wardell Armstrong, has implications for the coal privatisation programme. Prospective purchasers have warned the government that the historical liabilities of mining are hampering sale prospects. The authority yesterday joined a growing number of organisations expressing concern that the coal bill does not spell out the new Coal Authority's responsibility for the legacy of past mining including mine water pollution. The government has said that the authority will take on these responsibilities 'to the extent that they are not taken over by the private sector'. Wardell Armstrong estimates that if the central Durham pumping stops, 7.26m gallons of mine water a day will eventually pour into the River Wear. Its earlier estimate was 4.5m gallons.</p>

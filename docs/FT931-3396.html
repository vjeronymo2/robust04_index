			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / Survey of Contract Electronics Manufacture (7): A world built on silicon - Paul Taylor keeps abreast of the bewildering changes in technology OVER the past decade the electronics revolution has reached almost all industries enabling the development of a wide range of new consumer and business products and services. The personal computer, fax machines, satellite television, mobile telephony, medical scanners, compact-disc players, anti-lock brakes and engine management systems for cars are among the many products which have been made possible by recent advances in semiconductor technology. Even more sophisticated applications will soon emerge, including personal communicators, video-telephones, crash avoidance systems and car navigation aids. The pace of change is accelerating and silicon technology will continue to be the engine of change and innovation. Higher-speed devices will be integrated and packed closer, in smaller, more complex and reliable packages which cost less. But to turn these basic building blocks into useful products requires very expensive specialist machinery, expert knowledge and the application of the latest computerised techniques. Many large companies whose core business is not primarily electronics will lack state-of-the-art equipment and expertise to take advantage of these changes. Others will focus on design and marketing rather than manufacture. In either case the opportunities for the specialist contract electronics manufacturer are substantial. Perhaps more than any other single factor the growth of contract electronics manufacturing has been fuelled by advances in technology - and by the switch to SMT (surface mount technology) in particular. From the late 1950s, when transistors and printed circuit boards (PCBs) replaced valves, until the mid-1980s almost all PCBs were assembled using conventional PIH/PTH (pin-in-hole or plated-through-hole) technology. Individual components are inserted either by hand or automatically into plated holes in the circuit board and molten solder is then forced up through the hole using a 'wave' solder machine. When the solder dries it attaches each component to the circuitry on the board. However, since the mid 1980s, SMT has become increasingly popular. In SMT solder paste - a putty-like mixture of minute solder balls mixed with flux - is screen printed on to circuit terminals or pads on the circuit board. The ICs (integrated circuits) and other miniature components are placed, or 'onsetted', on to the solder paste using highly accurate automatic placement equipment. The solder paste is then melted or 'reflowed' which creates the joint between the component and the circuit board. SMT has some significant advantages over the traditional method. These include smaller size, increased automation, lower production costs, better performance and higher reliability. However there are also some disadvantages. In particular, SMT 'pick and place' equipment must be very accurate, requires skilled programming and is costly. A typical automated high volume SMT line costs around Pounds 1m, a significant barrier to entry in the contract manufacturing business and an incentive for OEMs to subcontract their electronics manufacturing. Mr Derek Duffett, director of the Association of Contract electronics Manufacturers (ACeM), recently noted that the advent of SMT had raised the investment level needed to enter the business and was one of the major reasons for the trend towards contract electronics manufacturing. According to figures from Motorola, the US electronics group, two years ago 70 per cent of the world consumption of integrated circuits was for PTH components. About 20 per cent was of SMT components with the remaining 10 per cent shared by other emerging technologies. Reflecting the fact that contract electronics manufacturers tend to be at the leading edge of technology, many in the UK already report that SMT output has overtaken traditional PTH, although a lot of boards are hybrids - combining both technologies. The switch to SMT has often been overstated, but most industry participants believe that by 1995 about half of all components sold will be of the SMT variety, and that by the end of the decade SMT will have emerged as the clearly dominant technology. Nevertheless by then other new technologies which have been in the development stage for many years will have also reached the market. They are needed because the performance and density requirements of electronics systems will begin to exceed the capabilities of discrete chip packaging, like SMT. To overcome this will require new 'interconnection techniques'. The latest new technique, which is already being used in the electronics industry in Japan, the US and occasionally in the UK, is called TAB (tape automated bonding). In this method a lead frame is attached to 'bumps' on the edge of the silicon chip in a process known as 'inner lead bonding'. The chip and its leads are then sealed or encapsulated in a glue-like substance called 'glob-top' and mounted on a reel, similar to a 35mm camera film. These tiny devices can also be placed on to little trays called 'slide carriers'. The components are then attached to a circuit board using thermo-sonic means or conventional reflow soldering. Another packaging method called COB (chip on board) is very similar to TAB but no lead frame is used. Instead the tiny silicon chip is placed directly on to the circuit board or 'substrate' and then attached using a special 'die attach' glue. Individual wires are then bonded to terminals on the chip and connected to the pads on the substrate. The whole assembly is then encapsulated in glob-top. Both TAB and COB provide greatly improved electrical performance than earlier technologies and allow increased component packing densities on the board - leading either to smaller boards or greater functionality. By the end of the decade they are expected to account for up to one fifth of all component sales. The latest packaging technology is called MCM (multi chip module). An MCM is made up of several bare silicon chips mounted on the substrate. Then, using COB techniques, the chips or 'die' are connected to circuitry much smaller and more carefully routed than those on PCBs. These MCMs provide much higher performance than the same chips mounted conventionally on a circuit board. In addition to these changing methods of assembly, the printed circuit board itself is also changing. Already TFT (thick-film technology), flexible circuits and three-dimensional substrates have emerged as means to further increase component density. Using these new technologies requires even more complex factory infrastructure and sophisticated handling techniques. Optical recognition and correction systems on the machines which place the components become more necessary as the space between leads (the pitch) becomes narrower. At the same time this places even more stringent demands on manufacturers' processes and quality improvement programmes such as zero defect and statistical process control (SPC), both advanced quality manufacturing techniques increasingly required by customers. This in turn means most manufacturers invest very heavily in sophisticated automatic testing equipment. In order to achieve the greatest efficiency and flexibility with their equipment many contract manufacturers have installed electronic data exchange (EDI) and computer management systems which often tie into those of their customers and suppliers. Meanwhile, in order to keep up with the advances in silicon technology manufacturers must update and replace their equipment frequently. This means there is often little time to recover capital costs and considerable pressure to keep the machinery working 24 hours a day. But although speed is an important factor in choosing equipment, manufacturers also stress the need for reliability, capability and flexibility. Finally, although electronics generally has a good environmental record, electronics manufacturers, including those in the contract industry, are having to focus on environmental issues. For example the use of chloro-fluorocarbons (CFCs) in the cleaning stage of SMT board assembly is being phased out.

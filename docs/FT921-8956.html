			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / World Stock Markets: European volume reflects Wall St's climb - German turnover doubled last month as investors buried their fears European equity markets were active last month after the holiday shutdown, carried along generally by a buoyant Wall Street. With the exception of Spain, volume trends were positive throughout the Continent. Germany, still nervous about mounting wage demands, threatened industrial disputes and high interest rates, buried its fears and looked ahead. Volume doubled, and the DAX index gained 7 per cent as it began to look as if wage settlements might be restrained. By the middle of the month, says Mr James Cornish, a strategist at County NatWest, rumours that German interest rates would soon be cut also helped to stimulate demand. 'Germany was really the market that pulled the others along,' he says. However, escalation of the dispute in the steel industry depressed the market at the end of the month. On the surface Milan performed well but, according to Mr Enrico Ponzone, a director at Kleinwort Benson, the rise in volumes was mainly attributable to one-off factors: the introduction of continuous trading, now taking place in ten stocks, and the recording of orders. Previously much of the volume was taking place off-market. The beginning of the year saw Italy's long awaited deregulation as the Societa di Intermediazione Mobiliare (SIM) - a new type of stockbroker, fund manager and corporate finance institution - was introduced. This followed a debilitating year for the Milan bourse, with investor sentiment buffeted by a string of stockbroker bankruptcies and dismal performances from Fiat, Olivetti and Pirelli. The last mentioned was unsuccessful in its takeover bid for German rival Continental and this has left it with a huge loss, and a commensurate equity funding requirement. The market is on the upward trend, says Mr Ponzone, although it has come back a little in February. Turnover is likely to show an increase in the months ahead as more companies come on to the continuous trading system. France, which needs to reduce interest rates, held up well, says Mr Cornish, and the market remains cheap. Volume was seen to decline during the month but rose again respectably at the end. Similarly, the Netherlands peaked at the end of January. Belgium's turnover remained strong, largely due to high volume in the banking and retailing sectors. A stronger bond market also helped to make equities more attractive and last year's rally in cyclicals was seen to be continuing. Spain's was the only turnover figure to slip back in January, in spite of a 5 per cent rise on the general index. The previous month's figures, however, had been boosted by year-end window dressing as fund managers came into the market to buy blue chips. Observers said most of last month's dealing was done in a narrow range, with little trading in industrials. Investors appear to be waiting for a real stimulus to the economy, and definite news of a reduction in interest rates. 'For there to be an upturn in investor confidence, there needs to be a cut of between one and two points,' an analyst said. Mr Cornish has also calculated the January volumes compared with a three-month average between September/November. This calculation excludes December because of that month's exceptional year-end factors. On this basis Germany's turnover rose 55 per cent, Belgium's 56 per cent and the Netherlands' 46 per cent. The laggards were Spain and the UK, with 26 per cent and 17 per cent respectively.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- EUROPEAN EQUITIES TURNOVER  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Monthly total in local currencies (bn) Bourse             Oct      Nov      Dec      Jan        US                    1991     1991     1991     1992    Dollars bn  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium           37.16    39.40    32.30    55.85     1.69 France           110.92   102.02   111.08   141.18    25.79 Germany           88.43    91.47    66.00   134.30    83.57 Italy          7,530.80 7,105.40 6,342.00 9,665.20     8.01 Netherlands       11.24    11.97     9.81    16.10     8.91 Spain            516.08   529.26   671.36   637.26     6.31 Switzerland        9.30    10.50     7.70    13.20     9.24 UK                32.19    29.36    26.44    36.40    65.09  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Volumes represent purchases and sales.

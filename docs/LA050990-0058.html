			<p><P> May 9, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SHOW LOSES TO PIRATES; EXPECTS TO BE TRADED  </P> <P> Padre pitcher Eric Show sees it in their faces. He senses it in their actions.  He listens to the insinuations.  </P> <P> The man who has won more games than any pitcher in Padre history, the man who  has been with this organization longer than anyone in the front office or on  the playing field, and the man who was racked once again in the Padres' 10-2  defeat to the Pittsburgh Pirates, Show is convinced he's going to be traded.  </P> <P> "I think my name's always been in trade talks, but especially now," Show said.  "That's all right, they're not going to hurt my feelings. I don't expect  loyalty. There's no loyalty in baseball, anyway. They traded Babe Ruth, didn't  they?  </P> <P> "I never deluded myself that I was wanted because of who I am. I was wanted  because I produced. We're only commodities to be dispersed of, and anyone with  any brains at all should know that.  </P> <P> "There's really not a whole lot to say. I don't need to bury myself."  </P> <P> No one in the Padre organization is willing to say anything publicly right now,  and the subject carefully is being avoided by Padre Manager Jack McKeon, but  the word on the street already is out.  </P> <P> The scouts that were littered among the 10,694 fans at Three Rivers Stadium,  watching the Pittsburgh Pirates beat up on the Padres (12-14) for the fifth  consecutive time certainly weren't there to watch Shawn Abner perform as a  pinch-hitter.  </P> <P> They came to see Show, but the notebooks and speed guns were quickly put away.  Show lasted just 1 1/3 innings, yielding five hits and four earned runs to the  11 batters he faced. He has pitched just 21 2/3 innings in five starts this  season for a 6.23 ERA.  </P> <P> For the first time in his nine-year career, he is 0-4.  </P> <P> "We all know he's on the trading block," said a Cleveland Indians scout, who  spoke only on the condition of anonymity. "We need another starter, and we know  they're looking for some insurance at shortstop. I think they're going to deal  a starter, but it's just a question of which one."  </P> <P> The Padres have not talked specifics with any club, but they have invited  everyone to come take a good look. Show is the pitcher most available, but  clubs also are scouting starter Dennis Rasmussen and reliever Calvin Schiraldi,  who also is capable of starting.  </P> <P> The Padres are willing to deal one of their starters for the simple reason that  they want to make room for Mike Dunne, who's on rehabilitation assignment at  their triple-A Las Vegas club. Dunne, who underwent arthroscopic shoulder  surgery in November, pitched a no-hitter in his last outing, is expected to  make three more starts for Las Vegas before being called up May 22.  </P> <P> If no trade is made, Dunne likely will replace outfielder Jerald Clark on the  roster, leaving McKeon the decision of who will be yanked out of the rotation.  But the Padres certainly don't need an 11-man pitching staff, simply because  after Tuesday's defeat, they won't have to face the Pirates again until July.  </P> <P> The Padres have been humbled by the Pirates in every game they've played this  season, outscored 37-11 in the five games, while becoming the first Padre team  in history to lose each of its first five games to the Pirates.  </P> <P> It's been painful. Take a look, if you've got a strong stomach.  </P> <P>  -- The Padres have never led at the end of the 43 innings played against the  Pirates.  </P> <P>  -- The Pirates have smacked the Padre pitching staff around for a .341 batting  average and a monstrous .604 slugging percentage, collecting 10 homers, 12  doubles and three triples.  </P> <P>  -- Pirate center fielder Barry Bonds is batting .600 (12 for 20) against the  Padres, with three homers, nine RBIs and nine runs scored. Yes, Bonds has  produced more runs in his 20 at-bats than the Padres have scored as a team in  their 166 at-bats against the Pirates.  </P> <P> What's a team to do?  </P> <P> "The way they were hitting," Padre center fielder Fred Lynn said, "we needed  about five outfielders out there."  </P> <P> Actually, the Padres could have used a couple more infielders, particularly  during Show's stint. The Pirates obtained only three singles out of the infield  off Show, but a mental lapse by him cost him two runs in the first, and he  never had a chance to get untracked in the second.  </P> <P> The Padres scored two runs in the top of the first inning off Walt Terrell, who  was traded by the Padres last year, but failed to retain the lead for even an  inning.  </P> <P> Wally Backman, who's hitting .625 (10 for 16) against the Padres this season,  opened the inning with an infield single to shortstop. Backman took second on  Jay Bell's groundout, and Show then induced another ground ball to Andy Van  Slyke down the first-base line. Joe Carter, playing deep behind the first-base  bag, grabbed the ball cleanly and looked to feed the ball to Show. He wasn't  there. Show had forgotten to cover first. Van Slyke kept running and beat  Carter to the bag.  </P> <P> Still, Show appeared to regain his composure, striking out cleanup hitter Bobby  Bonilla while Van Slyke stole second. With first base open, Show elected to  pitch to Bonds. He threw two pitches past Bonds, but on a 2-2 pitch, Bonds  slapped a fastball up the middle, scoring two runs.  </P> <P> It was two runs that never should have scored if it wasn't for Show's blunder,  and although four Padre pitchers failed to shut down the Pirates, it was Show's  play that most upset McKeon.  </P> <P> "If you're pitching 10, 12 years, but if you can't cover first base and help  yourself," McKeon said, "you're not going to be around long.  </P> <P> "You can't be a spectator. You've got to be in the game. Pitchers have to bunt,  they have to use the bat, they have to field the position.  </P> <P> "If you don't do that, you'll be a loser."  </P> <P> It was a performance that Show didn't even bother discussing with McKeon and  pitching Coach Pat Dobson. When Dobson came to the mound to get him, Show was  already on his way to the dugout, flipping the ball to him without the two  exchanging a word.  </P> <P> Show and Dobson have been irritated with one another because of an incident  last week when Show criticized Dobson for not telling him that he would be  passed over for a start in the rotation because of two off-days. Dobson  insisted that he did inform Show earlier in the week, saying that Show even  consented because of his reluctance to pitch at Wrigley Field since the July,  1987 beaning of Cub outfielder Andre Dawson.  </P> <P> Show's 11-day wait resulted in a 34-pitch performance, spending 1 1/3 innings  on the field, and the remainder of the game in the clubhouse, wondering what  has gone wrong.  </P> <P> "I'm shocked at what's happened, absolutely shocked," Show said. "I can't say  I'm not trying, but then again, I'm not producing either. I'm just not pitching  like I should.  </P> <P> "I might have pitched good enough to win three games if I was with the Oakland  A's or something," Show said. "But I'm not. And I'm the one to blame. Who else  is there?  </P> <P> "The only thing I can do is regroup. At least I haven't lost my confidence. And  I feel perfectly healthy. I just have to be patient."  </P> <P> But, of course, it's the Padres' prerogative if they want to reciprocate.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre reliever Mark Grant and pitching Coach Pat Dobson each telephoned former  Padre Mark Davis of Kansas City, trying to bolster his confidence. Davis, who  signed a four-year, $13 million free agent contract with the Royals, already  has blown three saves this year and owns a 7.11 ERA. "He'll be all right,"  Grant said. "Actually, he was helping me out as much as I was helping him. He  told me to forget the past, and be the aggressive pitcher I've always been." .  . . Although the Padres have had to make two position changes to adjust for  first baseman Jack Clark's absence, center fielder Fred Lynn and first baseman  Joe Carter said they feel right at home. Lynn, who had been a center fielder  for most of his 15-year career until last year, said he actually feels more  comfortable in center, despite being 38 years old. "This is great for me," Lynn  said. "I feel like a fish in water in center." Although Carter started just 11  games at first base last year, he was the Indians' everyday first baseman in  1987. "Either way is fine by me," Carter said. "I feel just as comfortable at  first base as the outfield." . . . Center fielder Alex Cole of the Padres'  triple-A club in Las Vegas has been moved to right field to make room for  Charlie Hillemann. Hillemann replaced outfielder Thomas Howard on the roster.  Howard underwent arthroscopic knee surgery last week and is not expected to  return until mid-June.  </P></p>

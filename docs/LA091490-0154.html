			<p><P> September 14, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> REVELATIONS FROM A LIFE OF TRAVEL  </P> <P> Sensuous and vibrant, "Etchings in an Hourglass" is an intensive course in  lifemanship written by a woman with a remarkable capacity for love, work and  friendship. The third and last volume of Kate Simon's autobiography, this book  concludes the saga begun in "Bronx Primitive" and continued in "A Wider World":  the story of a child brought to America as a tot, her sensibility shaped first  by the stark realities of tenement life, then honed by the intellectual rigor  of Hunter College, enlarged by the cultural opportunities of New York,  broadened and deepened still further by travel.  </P> <P> Simon became a multilingual citizen of the world, at home in France, Italy,  England and Mexico.  </P> <P> She's best known for her books on the places where she happened to alight and  settle. During her long sojourns, she invariably succeeded in immersing herself  so thoroughly in the life of her chosen country that the revelations astonished  natives and visitors alike. There are 10 such books, each filled with the  thoughts, perceptions and appreciations of a woman who could never have gone to  sleep at night without having learned something new that day.  </P> <P> This book is considerably more personal than the ones upon which her reputation  has rested; more poignant and candid even than the earlier autobiographical  volumes. Here Simon concentrates upon family, friends and lovers, the profound  connections and casual encounters that punctuated her peripatetic career.  </P> <P> We learn of a tragic early marriage to a young scientist whose deafness was  caused by a genetic brain tumor, a flaw inherited by Simon's only child, a  daughter who died at 22. As a second marriage promising tranquillity and  consolation disintegrates and fails, the author finds relief and challenge in  extensive travels, the journeys culminating in the superb European and Mexican  books, then doubling back to the delights of New York.  </P> <P> Once returned, she applied the same rigorous techniques used abroad, exploring  her own city with the eagerness and enthusiasm of a total stranger and the  specialized knowledge of a resident connoisseur. Along the way, there are  lovers embraced with passion and occasional liaisons evolving from a simple  zest for adventure.  </P> <P> Simon had an uncommon willingness to gamble on a safe and happy ending, a trait  rare among women of her generation and background. More often than not, her  risks were rewarded, contributing to her understanding of an entire culture and  enlarging her knowledge of her own selfhood. She not only acknowledges these  escapades wittily and frankly, but writes about them with the same grace,  elegance and gusto she applies to the Renaissance masterpieces of Florence or  the bridges across the Seine. Though she never apologizes, she does explain,  earning the reader's admiration. Written as her health was deteriorating in her  last years, "Etchings in an Hourglass" has little artificially imposed  structure. Instead, incidents are recalled as the author thinks of them, in  order of importance. Because her images are so arresting, her depth of field  impressive and her style so fluid, a clear pattern emerges to give the memoir  cohesion and power. Early widowhood, the subsequent marriage for intellectual  rather than emotional reasons, the almost simultaneous deaths of her daughter  and a beloved sister are in retrospect the pivotal events that gave Simon's  life purpose. Who wouldn't yearn to flee the scene of such tragedies? But few  could transform escape into a splendid, disciplined and enduring body of work.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ETCHINGS IN AN HOURGLASS: by Kate Simon: Harper &amp; Row: $19.95, 240 pages  </P> <P> Next: Carolyn See reviews "Meteors in August" by Melanie Rae Thon (Random  House).  </P> <P> </P></p>

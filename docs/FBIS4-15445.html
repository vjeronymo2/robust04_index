			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Guoda Salciute report from the Seimas] </F>   [Text] Right-wing opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis,  speaking at today's news conference, gave a positive assessment  to the fact that the president has blocked the law on  agriculture recently passed by the Seimas. According to him,  such a law would legalize a second land nationalization. But  this law was not the main topic at the news conference of the  right-wing opposition leader.    Vytautas Landsbergis focused his principal attention on a  statement adopted by the Homeland Union, the Christian  Democratic, Nationalist and Freedom factions in the Seimas on  tension in the national defense structure. One of the examples  of such tension are searches in the apartments of servicemen,  which violate the Constitution and provoke people. One of the  main sources of such tension is the activity of the leading  group of the present National Security Committee, its chosen  unlawful way of exceeding the authorizations of parliamentary  control and carrying out functions of the executive power,  striving to take over the whole national defense system. He  also says that lack of confidence in the chairman of the  National Security Committee is rife and that the composition of  this committee should be changed. Since the Democratic Labor  Party leadership is capitulating to these extremists,  stabilizing actions must be taken by the republic's president,  he said.    To a question on how the composition of the Seimas National  Security Committee could be changed, Vytautas Landsbergis  replied: In the usual way, like everything else. And if the  ruling party does not take such actions, it will bear full  responsibility for the consequences.    Speaking of the collection of signatures by the Social  Democratic faction under an interpellation to the government,  the leader of the right-wing opposition said that material  collected by the Social Democrats is essential for the analysis  of the government's work, but stressed that the Homeland Union  favors an interpellation questioning the ruling of the  Democratic Labor Party and not of the Slezevicius government.  There are no reserves to form a better Democratic Labor Party  government, therefore we speak of new elections and not of a  change of the government, he said. The Homeland Union intends  to take further steps in solving Lithuania's problems, and these  steps should be known next week, Landsbergis said.    Landsbergis also spoke about the technical errors in the  documents signed by the Russian president, stressing that this  was an old tactic of Russian foreign policy: To reflect [as  heard] and then deny, leaving this reflection in [word  indistinct]</p>

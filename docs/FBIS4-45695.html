			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 17, RIA -- Japan will give financial aid  to Russia for constructing a floating plant to utilise  radioactive waste in the Russian Far East, the JAPAN TIMES  reports today with references to governmental sources. In  exchange for aid, Russia has promised to refrain from dumping  waste in the Sea of Japan. The agreement was reached earlier  this month. The project is worth several million dollars.  Funds for this purpose are to be allocated from the amount of  U.S. 100 million, which Japan promised to Russia and other  republics of the former USSR for the elimination of nuclear  weapons. It is planned that the project, where liquid waste is  to be condensed into solid matter and then sent to land-based  storages, will be completed early in 1995.</p>

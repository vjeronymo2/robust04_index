			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / Tips from an old boy: A Treasury economist turned industrialist With the UK government keen to step up discussions on policy issues with industrialists, it is likely that before long a senior Treasury mandarin will descend on a nondescript factory in rural Hampshire for a meeting with an unusual Whitehall old boy. Mr Tim Parker is chief executive of Kenwood, a maker of kitchen appliances with a Pounds 120m-a-year turnover. A curly-haired and outgoing 38-year-old, he is one of the few Treasury economists in the past 30 years to have gone on to run a big manufacturing group. In charge of Kenwood for the past seven years, Mr Parker has, during the recession, kept his UK workforce stable at about 1,200, opened a factory in China, revamped the product range and increased the company's pre-tax profits to Pounds 9.6m in the year to March 31, up 4 per cent on the previous year. His career suggests he would have useful tips for Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Treasury officials as they elicit more ideas from manufacturers about economic policy. The department has launched Treasury 'away days' to factories and has set up a committee of industrialists to discuss the economic outlook. The Treasury has also brought in Ms Wendy Pritchard, a consultant who specialises in developing the management cultures of big companies, to make senior officials more responsive to outside views. Frustration at the Treasury's inward-looking style was partly behind Mr Parker's decision to leave Whitehall in 1979, after two years as a junior economist. He sought a job in industry 'leading from the front' - a move that has paid off financially. As well as owning some Pounds 2.5m worth of Kenwood shares, Mr Parker's Pounds 160,000 salary is roughly 50 per cent more than that of Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary. After studying for an MSc at the London Business School - where he was taught both by Sir Terry and the Treasury's current chief economic adviser Mr Alan Budd, both former LBS academics - Mr Parker joined the electricals group Thorn EMI as a trainee manager. In 1986 he took over the top job at Kenwood, then a Thorn subsidiary. Three years later Mr Parker was among nine managers who bought the company from Thorn for Pounds 57m in a management buyout largely financed by banks. Last year the company was floated on the stock market, valued at Pounds 97m. Based on his experience in the real economy, Mr Parker thinks the government should concentrate on boosting manufacturing, if necessary by letting sterling's exchange rate continue the downward path it has followed since Britain left the European exchange rate mechanism a year ago. With manufacturers benefiting from a large boost to competitiveness resulting from the lower pound, he reckons the sector has a 'golden opportunity' to expand. Also helping manufacturers, he says, are low labour costs and a 'battle-hardened' cadre of executives who have fought their way through the recession. Mr Parker says this view does not amount to special pleading from a manufacturer. 'We have to play this game with deadly seriousness,' he says. 'If we don't expand manufacturing industry we won't be doing enough to help create wealth in the future and cut the government deficit.' He also downplays inflation as a problem for the UK. Policymakers should not ignore inflationary pressures, he says, but underlying price pressures are much lower than in the 1980s because of changes in labour markets linked to lower union membership and decentralised pay bargaining. Labour costs are under control at Kenwood, Mr Parker says; the last pay agreement, for the year starting in April, imposed a wage rise for all employees of 2.5 per cent, well under the 5 per cent average rise in manufacturing earnings across the UK in the year to July. In spite of his practical knowledge, Mr Parker has had few contacts with his old department since he left. But one Treasury official says that with its more outgoing approach it might fix a meeting soon. As a long shot, Mr Parker could even be appointed industrial adviser to Mr Clarke - a post the Treasury has been trying to fill for several months. Though Mr Parker says he has his hands full at Kenwood and the Treasury job has a salary only about a quarter of his current pay, he says the job would be 'attractive'. One way around the earnings problem, he says, would be for the department to increase the salary, finding the money by sacking other employees: 'It's the kind of approach the private sector would take, and possibly an example of how the Treasury has something to learn from the outside world.'</p>

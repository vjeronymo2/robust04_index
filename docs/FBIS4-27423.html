Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa replied,  "The DPRK appears to be intending to settle the issue of the  replacement of fuel rods at the experimental nuclear reactor in  North Korea through talks with the United States." The foreign  minister also stated, "I consider what Mr. Mino just indicated  to be our view."</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By correspondent Yoshihisa Furumori] </F>   [Text] Washington, 18 Apr -- It was learned on 18 April  that both U.S. President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore  separately expressed their concerns to top Japanese leaders that  there were people in the center of Japan's ruling coalition who  maintained strong ties with North Korea. They asked whether or  not these people could be a stumbling block to sanctions against  the DPRK, which might be imposed as a result of the nation's  suspected nuclear program. The delivery of this strong concern  and the questioning by top U.S. leaders indicates the Clinton  administration has a strong sense of distrust in a group of  people within the ruling coalition.    On 18 April a source well versed in Japan-U.S. relations  said  this concern was first revealed by President Clinton during the  summit meeting with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa on 21  February. According to the source, Clinton said that if economic  sanctions were imposed against the DPRK due to suspicions that  Pyongyang was trying to arm itself with nuclear weapons, Japan's  participation in the sanctions would be decisive. He then noted  there was a person "in the center of the Hosokawa government"  who maintains a close relationship with North Korea, and asked  Hosokawa whether Japan could participate in sanctions in  defiance of that person.    Clinton did not specify the person, but merely said he was  "in the center of the government." However, Japanese officials  involved in the summit said they felt President Clinton was  alluding to Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura.  Takemura served as secretary general of the delegation which  visited the DPRK in September 1990 led by Shin Kanemaru. He was  also actively engaged as a senior member of the Dietmen's League  for the Promotion of Friendship Between Japan and North Korea  [name as published].    On 14 April, Vice President Gore met with Japan's Deputy  Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata in Marrakesh,  Morocco, to attend a ministerial meeting of the GATT Uruguay  Round trade negotiations. According to the same source, Gore  expressed concern to Hata over the fact that the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which maintains relations with  North Korea, is in both the Hosokawa government and the ruling  coalition. He then asked Hata whether or not Tokyo could move  toward sanctions despite the existence of the party. The source  said Gore clearly mentioned the SDPJ at the meeting.    It is unusual that both the President and Vice President of  the United States have separately expressed to the prime  minister and the deputy prime minister of Japan their concern  about a political force within the governing coalition. This  could be a reflection of the U.S. perception that Japan's role  in the DPRK nuclear issue is very important, and of its serious  concern that a "connection with North Korea" in Japan might  hinder Tokyo from imposing sanctions against the DPRK.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Sofia Wu] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 20 (CNA) -- Taiwan may lose about 20  percent of its export markets to Mainland China in the next five  years, according to a study by the Ministry of Economic Affairs.    The report, to be presented in a mainland affairs meeting to  be held early next month, says competition between Taiwan and  the mainland will become increasingly fierce, with Mainland  China likely to take over U.S.$17 billion worth of Taiwan's  export markets, or 20.56 percent of Taiwan's total export value  registered in 1993.    Competition in wooden, bamboo, nonmetal furniture and  miscellaneous industries will be strongest, the report says,  adding that as high as 70.1 percent of Taiwan's markets in these  fields may be lost to the mainland.    Mainland China may also snatch 40 percent of Taiwan's  garment  and costume accessories markets in the next few years, the  report warns.    It points out that because Mainland China has cheap labor  and  rich natural resources, its export competitiveness has grown  rapidly in recent years, particularly in some labor-intensive  industries.    The mainland will become even more competitive in some  technology-intensive industries after 1997 when Hong Kong will  revert to its rule, the report says.    Taiwan's electronics, machinery, automobile and motorcycle  makers will face ever stronger competition in the years ahead,  the report adds.</p>

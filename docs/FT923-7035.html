			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina and Brazil sign gas field agreement ARGENTINA AND Brazil yesterday signed a letter of intent opening the way for the joint development of a potentially huge gas field in north-western Argentina in a project that could involve investment totalling USDollars 8bn, writes John Barham in Buenos Aires. The presidents of Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales SA, Argentina's state-owned oil company, and Petrobras, its Brazilian counterpart, signed an agreement that would give Petrobras a 15 per cent share in its underdeveloped Northwest Basin. YPF plans to sell 55 per cent of the basin to private investors in October. It will retain 30 per cent, with the remaining equity held by Petrobras, which is expected to receive a discount to the privatisation auction price. A YPF official explained that Brazilian involvement was vital to attract private investment to the Northwest Basin. 'This basin is only interesting if the gas has a market,' he said, 'and the only market is in Brazil.' Three southern states of Brazil plus the state of Sao Paulo, the country's most heavily industrialised region, could consume about 30m cubic metres of gas a day exported from the Northwest Basin along a 2,400 km (1,500 mile) gas pipeline. The entire project would cost Dollars 8bn and take eight years to complete, the official said.</p>

			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: FILLMORE;  </P> <P> 3 ACCUSED IN THEFT OF PICKUP TRUCK  </P> <P> Three Los Angeles residents were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of stealing a  pickup truck after police noticed a burglary tool during a routine traffic  stop, authorities said.  </P> <P> Felix Flores, 24, and Patricia Ruiz, 18, were being held in the Ventura County  Jail in lieu of $5,000 bail each, a jail spokeswoman said.  </P> <P> The 17-year-old male arrested with them was cited to appear in Juvenile Court  and released to the custody of his parents, she said.  </P> <P> Deputy Rick Barrios of the Ventura County Sheriff's Department was on patrol at  2:50 a.m. when he noticed two pickup trucks traveling south on California 126,  said Lt. Kathy Kemp of the Sheriff's Department.  </P> <P> Barrios stopped the rear truck and cited it for a traffic violation, Kemp said.  Barrios then noticed a slam hammer -- an instrument often used to punch out a  vehicle's ignition so it can be started with a screwdriver -- in the cab, Kemp  said.  </P> <P> Barrios became suspicious and broadcast a description of both trucks to fellow  deputies, Kemp said.  </P> <P> The front truck sped into a nearby field and two male occupants ran from it,  Kemp said. He said one of the men is still at large. The front truck was found  with its ignition punched out, he said.  </P> <P> The truck's registered owner was sleeping when his truck disappeared early  Wednesday from the front of his residence on Clay Street in Fillmore, Kemp  said.

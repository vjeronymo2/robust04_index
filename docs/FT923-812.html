			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / Books: Modernity hits treasure island - FT Childrens' Book of the Month THE INVADERS by John Rowe Townsend Oxford Pounds 8.95, 221 pages THE ISLANDERS by John Rowe Townsend Oxford Pounds 8.95, 190 pages 'I've always loved boats and islands. Any boat trip to an island is an adventure. Every island is magical in its way - some, of course, more magical than others. And an island is a lovely setting for a story: you can concentrate so much action, so much emotion, in a small space.' The veteran children's novelist John Rowe Townsend is of course claiming imaginative kinship with Robert Louis Stevenson, Jonathan Swift, Daniel Defoe and other authors of island stories. Townsend's particular island is an imaginary one, but its geographical location and its physical features - bleak, treeless, volcanic - help us to locate it somewhere in the south Atlantic, somewhere, in fact, like Tristan da Cunha. His first attempt to present the island's history came with The Islanders, first published in 1981 and reissued as a companion volume this month. That book described the life of a small, hard-bitten community that followed its own peculiar customs and traditions, one of which was never to help a stranger. It ended with the islanders being obliged to reject this age-old tradition, - and thus learning new truths about themselves. Now John Rowe Townsend has returned to that same pitiless spot in a sequel entitled The Invaders, and the task he has now set himself is to describe what would happen if that same small community, generations on, were to find itself face to face with some of the problems and challenges of life in the 20th century. It begins once again with the arrival of a stranger from the Mother Colony, an orphaned boy who claims kinship with one of the island's families. The boy's grandfather had described the place to him as a paradise of sorts, but Cyril finds it a windswept, desolate spot and the inhabitants with whom he claims kinship unwelcoming. He is obliged to share his first night's sleeping accommodation with a goat, and to eat fish and potatoes, the islanders' staple diet, day after wearisome day. But soon all begins to change - and at a fearful pace. The boy introduces the islanders to some of the marvels of the present age - including the wireless set that he has brought with him. And it is thanks to this wireless that the islanders learn that their time-honoured way of life is soon to be destroyed forever by invading forces from the nearby Republic of Santa Cruz. At this point parallels with the Falklands conflict begin to come at us thick and fast; the dictator of Santa Cruz, Gomez, lays claim to the island and threatens occupation, a bravura gesture that is intended as much to impress his enemies at home. The Mother Country sends a garrison, led by the vociferous Brigadier Culpepper whose head is stuffed with the manners and vocabulary of the Great War. But the colonial regime is short-lived. The Mother Country's garrison withdraws, and the island is soon occupied by a contingent from Santa Cruz. The island is renamed Gomez, and the Mother Country, surprisingly, seems quite indifferent to its fate. And throughout all these fearful, tension-racked months modernity continues to creep up on the inhabitants: the young people learn rebellion; the old discover what it is to deal with benign enemies and seeming friends. In short, they learn lessons in politics and duplicity. The climax comes with the hair's breadth escape of the Brigadier, his daughter and the remaining islanders as the island's volcano, long dormant, erupts into destructive life.</p>

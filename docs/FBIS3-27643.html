Among the 28 countries and regions that have invested in  this  inland province, the officials said, Taiwan now ranks second  after Hong Kong in the number of cooperation projects and the  volume of investment.    Taiwan businesses signed 132 cooperation projects with the  province in 1993, promising to invest as much as 356 million  U.S. dollars, the officials said.    That made the province's Taiwan-funded projects jump to 248,  and the volume of contracted Taiwan investment to 391 million  U.S. dollars, the officials noted.    Since the province's first Taiwan-funded project started in  1989, Taiwan businesses have been set up in ten of its major  cities.    The officials believe that Shanxi's rich resources of coal  and iron, its cheap labor and large market are just what Taiwan  investors are looking for.    They said Shanxi's investment environment is improving  rapidly. The airport in this provincial capital is under  expansion, regular flights have started between Taiyuan and Hong  Kong, and the telecommunication networks of many cities have  been updated.    What is more, the officials said, the interests of Taiwan  investors are guaranteed by preferential investment policies and  all-round investment services.    So far, 70 percent of the Taiwan-funded businesses are in  the  field of manufacturing, including coal processing, textiles,  metallurgy, machinery, electronics and foodstuffs.    While Taiwan investors tended to choose small and  medium-sized enterprises as their partners in the beginning, the  officials said, more and more of them are now turning to large  state enterprises.    Besides the manufacturing sector, Taiwan investors  established new businesses in Shanxi in 1993 -- in a hot springs  resort, a luxury hotel and real estate.    Last year trade between Taiwan and Shanxi was valued at  29.861 million U.S. dollars. The inland province exported coal,  pig iron, cast iron, toys and agricultural products and imported  raw chemicals, steel and machinery.    However, the officials said they believed that the biggest  breakthrough in the relations between the two sides in 1993 was  in personnel exchanges. For the first time in several decades,  altogether 155 persons from Shanxi visited the island province.    Among the 155 was an official delegation headed by  provincial  Director of the Coal Industry Wu Sansong and a folk dance troupe.    On the other hand, visitors from Taiwan continue to come in  ever-increasing numbers. Among the nearly 2,000 Taiwan visitors  in 1993 was a delegation from the Association for the Promotion  of Mining and a 48-member group from the Chinese Drama Society.    Cooperation between the two sides has also been expanded to  publishing, the cinema, sports and many other fields, the  officials added.</p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Eurotunnel wins ruling on TML payment EUROTUNNEL yesterday won an important victory over contractors building the Channel tunnel when independent arbitrators ruled that it did not have to continue paying an extra Pounds 50m a month to the construction companies. Contractors, however, will not have to repay the Pounds 200m of additional progress payments already made by Eurotunnel, which stopped making payments in August and will not resume payments. Eurotunnel also confirmed that its bankers had granted a waiver allowing it to continue to draw down funds for another two months even though it is in technical breach of its loan covenants. The rulings will ease the pressure on Eurotunnel, which is involved in a dispute with construction companies over who should pay the extra cost of the tunnel, which has risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to more than Pounds 8bn. Negotiations to solve the dispute foundered over the summer. Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel's co-chairman, was said last night to be delighted with the arbitrators' decision. He was attempting to restart talks with Transmanche Link (TML), the consortium of 10 contractors, on settling the overall cost dispute. A banker to Eurotunnel said he thought the decision would 'speed up resolution of the dispute . . . It will galvanise people into action.' The banker said it would increase pressure on TML to drop its remaining objections to a settlement. The arbitration tribunal consists of three lawyers appointed under rules of the International Chambers of Commerce. Eurotunnel had asked the ICC to set aside a previous ruling by an independent disputes panel requiring it to raise monthly progress payments to TML by Pounds 50m. The original ruling in March by the disputes panel was made after companies threatened to stop work on installing a cooling system in the tunnel unless they received money to cover the cost. TML said yesterday that it would 'continue to safeguard the interests of its member companies by reserving its position on works outside its contractual commitment'. Contractors, although disappointed by the Brussels ruling, said the Pounds 200m payments already received meant they could continue working until next year. Lex, Page 28</p>

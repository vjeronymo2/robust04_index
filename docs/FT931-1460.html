			<p>930325 FT  25 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wehmiller expands to Pounds 3.21m REFLECTING improved operating margins, pre-tax profits moved ahead 42 per cent at Barry Wehmiller International, the packaging equipment manufacturer, in the half year to January 31. Profits rose to Pounds 3.21m, compared to Pounds 2.25m, although turnover increased by a more modest 8 per cent, rising from Pounds 35.7m to Pounds 38.6m. Mr Stewart Brown, chief executive, said the vision division, which makes bottle and package control scanners and the general packaging division had produced some growth, particularly in North and South America. However, he said that overall there was little sign of sustained upturn in any of BWI's traditional markets In the UK, continued slack demand for bottling and filling equipment from the dairy industry, which has been undergoing restructuring, resulted in reduced returns from the food division. Earnings per share were up from 3.9p to 5p while the interim dividend is unchanged at 2.4p.</p>

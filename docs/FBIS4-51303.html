			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- China is to hold  large-scale investment and trade symposiums early next month  respectively in Melbourne and Sydney in Australia.    During the symposiums, a group of over 100 government  officials and entrepreneurs from China's 20 provinces and  municipalities will hold talks with their Australian partners on  519 investment projects they brought with.    An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic  Cooperation (MOFTEC) said that the projects, totalling seven  billion U.S. dollars, include those of agriculture,  communications, electronics, building materials, petrochemistry  and service sectors.    The talks will be the largest of its kind China has yet held  in Australia.    The delegation, to be headed by MOFTEC's Vice-Minister Gu  Yongjiang, will also give Australian entrepreneurs and  businessmen a systematic introduction on China's current  economic reform, investment climate, Chinese laws and rules  concerning the protection of foreign investment, the MOFTEC  official said.    Since 1972 when diplomatic ties were established between  China and Australia, bilateral trade has seen a constant  development, the official said.    Statistics show that trade volume between China and  Australia  in 1993 hit a record high of three billion U.S. dollars, among  which China's import was 1.94 billion U.S. dollars and its  export was 1.06 billion U.S. dollars.    According to the official, for the sake of its construction,  China needs to import various raw materials and advanced  technologies in production, processing, storage and  transportation of grain, in telecommunications, mining,  metallurgy as well as in port construction.    China spent 485 million U.S. dollars last year importing  17.06 million tons of iron ore, 440 million U.S. dollars  importing 130,000 tons of wool and over 100 million U.S. dollars  importing 1.09 million tons of grain.    During the same time, China exported 335 million U.S.  dollars  of clothing and 135 million U.S. dollars of textile products to  Australia, and its export volume of machinery and electronic  products to Australia reached 243 million U.S. dollars last year.    Meanwhile, economic cooperation between the two countries  has  also seen marked progress, the official said.    By the end of last year, China had set up 134 trade  institutions and enterprises in Australia with a contractual  investment totalling 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, among which some  one-fourth was to be funded by the Chinese side. And Australia  has become one of the countries China has so far invested most.    On the other hand, among all the countries and regions in  the  world, Australia is the 9th largest investor in China. By the  end of 1993, australia had set up 1,310 projects in China with a  contractual investment of 1.245 billion U.S. dollars, among  which 338 million U.S. dollars had been actually put into use.    Therefore, the MOFTEC official said, Chinese and Australian  economies are much mutually complementary and the prospect for  their cooperation is broad.    The upcoming symposiums and talks will provide more  opportunities for further cooperation in industrial and  commercial circles between the two countries, the official said.</p>

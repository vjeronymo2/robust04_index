			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. SEEKING FACTS ON REFINERY SITUATION;  </P> <P> LITHUANIA: THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO DETERMINE IF THE SOVIETS SHUT  OFF THE OIL FLOW TO THE FACILITY.  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials anxiously sought to determine Wednesday whether  Soviet authorities have cut off oil supplies to Lithuania's only refinery, as  asserted by officials of the Baltic republic.  </P> <P> "We have conflicting reports, and we're looking into the situation," a White  House official said, declining to go beyond President Bush's warning Tuesday  that such a step would be met with "appropriate responses" by the United  States.  </P> <P> The development, if confirmed, appears to move the United States closer to  taking punitive action toward the Soviet Union -- a step fraught with potential  diplomatic repercussions -- for the first time since relations between  Washington and Moscow began to warm a year ago.  </P> <P> It also demonstrated the dilemma that Bush faces as he seeks to apply some  pressure on the Soviet Union over its handling of the Lithuanian crisis without  painting Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev into a political corner.  </P> <P> The President's go-slow approach to Lithuania's efforts to secede from the  Soviet Union fit the pattern he has established for Administration responses to  foreign policy developments, particularly those that threaten to unravel  long-established relationships.  </P> <P> But the declaration of independence issued by the Lithuanian Parliament on  March 11 has forced Bush to deal with a long-held U.S. policy under which the  Soviet Union's annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia in 1940 has never  been officially accepted.  </P> <P> Seeking to explain the President's approach, a White House official said the  Administration favors eventual Lithuanian independence but also supports  Gorbachev's efforts to reform Soviet political and economic life. The White  House believes those reforms could be threatened if Gorbachev is politically  weakened by a successful Lithuanian secession.  </P> <P> "The goal is clear: We would like to see Lithuania free and clear," a senior  White House official said. "We think if any explosion is avoided, it's going to  happen. It may take a while."  </P> <P> The official continued: "You can state your goals and your principles. But  going beyond that almost inevitably can be grist for somebody's mill for  ratcheting up the situation. Then you become part of the problem. You're  backing Gorbachev into a corner, making him look bad. The feeling here is any  influence we have is best wielded completely behind the scenes. But from a  public standpoint, it's a loser."  </P> <P> In the wake of a National Security Council meeting held late Tuesday before  news reports indicated that the oil flow had been curtailed, the Administration  had reiterated its warning that the United States would mount "appropriate  responses" if the Soviet Union carried out its threat to impose an economic  squeeze on Lithuania.  </P> <P> In testimony Wednesday before the House Ways and Means Committee, Secretary of  State James A. Baker III warned that "Soviet actions -- even short of force --  in Lithuania" are putting "commercial contacts" between the two countries "to  risk."  </P> <P> But Baker declined to spell out what action the Administration might take.  </P> <P> "Essentially," White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, "it's a matter of  watching and waiting to see what happens. The problem is that we've been going  through this process for a month or two -- and there's all kinds of maneuvering  going on back and forth between the Soviet Union and Lithuania. And therefore,  we don't try to spend a whole lot of time by reading the tea leaves about what  might happen or what they think's going to happen or so forth."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Art Pine contributed to this report.  </P></p>

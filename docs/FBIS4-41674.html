			<p>BFN     [Text] Those members of the State Duma who on June 22 said  in parliament that Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for Peace  betrays national interests are traitors themselves, the Russian  Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev said today. He was speaking  before his meeting in Moscow with the Commander-in-Chief of  NATO's allied forces in Europe George Joulwan.    "They are political red-brown bastards who want to plunge  Russia into isolation again. They need an enemy", Kozyrev said.    He said that Russia would in any case take a decent place in  the world and would most probably hold a joint military exercise  with the United States. "We've got nothing to be afraid of. On  the contrary, a refusal would be tantamount to sticking one's  head in the sand", he said    About the conflict in the Balkans Kozyrev said that uneasy  calm had been established there and that it was still fraught  with a slide into World War III.    He said that the "parties of war" in the Balkans were trying  to win support from the great powers and as a matter of fact  provoking a collision between them.    Kozyrev said that Russia was for addressing both sides with  a  firm demand to observe peace without giving preferences to  either of them.    "Those traitors in the Duma who demand supporting one of the  parties thereby push us into a war with the United States.  "Apparently they would like to fish in troubled waters, just as  was the case in 1917, and Mr Ziuganov seeks to outdo his  predecessor".</p>

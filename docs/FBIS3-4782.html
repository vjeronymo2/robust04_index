			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Hurry Up and Make a Political Decision on </F> Daring Market Liberalization"]    [Text] How deeply is Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  aware of the fact that the international community is now  watching what Japan does next -- after he said "no" to U.S.  demands at the Japan-U.S. summit meeting?    To our regret, judging by remarks he made at the House of  Representatives' Budget Committee session on 18 February, it is  difficult to see how he plans to use his leadership to ease the  economic dispute with the United States.    To find a way out, it is urgent that Japan, having said  "no,"  now says "yes" and declares that "without delay, it will do what  it can." It should then move into action voluntarily.    The government will hold a meeting of concerned ministers  early next week to discuss how to correct the trade imbalance.  It is important that the prime minister not rely solely on  scenarios written by bureaucrats.    In the current times of great change, ideas from  bureaucrats,  who tend to cling to the same old framework of thinking, often  have limitations. It can be said that the government's slowness  to act, which was caused by bureaucrats, is also to blame for  the breakdown of the summit talks and the prolonged economic  recession.    The major points in the plan to correct the trade imbalance  are expected to be the promotion of deregulation, the expansion  of import and investment, the development of positive policies  to promote competition, and the improvement of government  procurement procedures.    We have no objection to any of this. However, the most  serious question is whether or not the prime minister can quell  resistance from the bureaucracy and industry, and take a step  toward further drastic market liberalization. Japan ought also  to think about the possibility of setting endeavor goals  voluntarily to reduce its current-account surplus.    There are risks involved in making such political decisions.  To bear the responsibility for such risks should be a problem  for the prime minister who has touted the start of "a mature  Japan-U.S. relationship."    Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who fears the failure of  the Japan-U.S. summit could intensify trade friction between the  two countries, contributed an article to the U.S. newspaper NEW  YORK TIMES with the suggestion that a wisemen's meeting of  intellectuals from both nations be held. This is worth  considering.    Might we suggest the prime minister also call on people such  as former prime ministers, who themselves experienced tough  times dealing with the United States over trade frictions, and  business executives, to canvass other than bureaucratic views.  A meeting of businessmen from the two countries was held in  Washington immediately after the summit talks. We would like to  suggest the prime minister pay heed to and make the most of the  views expressed at that time formulating future policies.    President Bill Clinton barely managed to restore the  Democratic Party to power after a 12-year Republican reign by  Ronald Reagan and George Bush. With a bye-election coming in  November, Clinton is no doubt fighting against the trade deficit  with Japan, using retaliation as a threat, to solidify his  political base at home.    Meanwhile, in Japan, the rule of the Liberal Democratic  Party  ended with the start of the coalition administration. But the  coalition has not been able to free itself of the old framework  of bureaucracy, which means the strategy has not changed from  that used in 12 years of contact with Republican governments,  and it appears to be perplexed by the new negotiating style of  the U.S. Democrat administration.    Japan and the United States must soon establish relations of  mutual trust appropriate to this era of change. It will only  harm and not help bilateral relations if the United States  increases pressure on Japan by reviving the Super 301 provision  of the Trade Act.    It would be regrettable if President Clinton really meant  what he said at the summit about past Japan-U.S. trade accords  having been almost useless in opening up the Japanese market.  Japan bears a grave responsibility for letting him believe that.    Japan's failure to spell out its market-opening efforts to  other countries is just as harmful as its awkward negotiation  strategy.</p>

			<p>940701 FT  01 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: Over-stated case against herbicide-resistant oilseed rape Sir, While it is prudent to exercise great caution before introducing any novel organisms into the environment, Dr Alan Wrelton (Letters, June 23) over-states the case against the introduction of herbicide resistant oilseed rape. Dr Wrelton writes that 'it is obvious to anyone that oilseed rape is colonising set-aside land and marginal habitats such as motorway verges'. Precious little in ecology is obvious] Oilseed rape is not colonising set-aside land. The plants you see growing there have come from a bank of seeds in the soil, left over from previous cultivation. As to motorway verges, oilseed rape is rare on older, undisturbed sections. Detailed study shows that most of the populations of oilseed rape are ephemeral: here one year and gone the next. The fact that many more rape plants are seen on the side of the M25 motorway heading towards the seed processing plant compared with the opposite verge suggests strongly that the source of the plants we see each spring is seed spilled from lorries en route to the crushing plant, rather than recruitment from an established population. Detailed experimental work comparing invasiveness of conventional oilseed rape and genetically-modified, herbicide tolerant rape showed no evidence at all that genetic engineering led to increased invasiveness (1993, Nature 363, 620). It is important to remember that genetic modification which creates tolerance to one herbicide does not confer tolerance to other, different kinds of herbicide. If ecological risk assessment is to be taken seriously, then it needs to be based on firm evidence rather than idle speculation.

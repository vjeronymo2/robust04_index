Estonian authorities in Paldiski registered 4,576 people by  March 26. Civilians, with the exclusion of minors, numbered  3,684; the remaining 892 were servicemen. Tikk claimed the  majority of the town's residents turned up for registration.    Population Minister Peeter Olesk voiced the opinion that the  greater part of the people who failed to register themselves  were those who were absent from the town during the registration.    Tikk said Estonian authorities received on Tuesday the data  about the Russian military who live in Paldiski but serve at the  Tallinn base of the Baltic Fleet. The list comprised 69 names,  he said. "We still haven't got a list of Russian servicemen who  serve in the Tallinn-based 144th motorized rifle division but  live in Paldiski," the government representative noted.    The registration of Paldiski's residents passed without any  particular incidents, Tikk said. It will be followed up by  analysis of the forms the residents filled in. The authorities  also intend to find out the origin of forged documents that the  registration brought to light. [passage omitted]</p>

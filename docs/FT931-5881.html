			<p>930304 FT  04 MAR 93 / Mexico party finance offer causes furore MEXICO'S ruling Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) celebrates its 64th consecutive year in power today, embroiled in a growing furore over its financing. The controversy has arisen over claims, first reported in El Economista newspaper, that about 30 of the country's richest businessmen had each promised to give the PRI some Dollars 25m (Pounds 17.6m) to strengthen the party's finances before the presidential election next year. The pledges are reported to have been made at a dinner party last week in the house of Mr Antonio Ortiz Mena, former finance minister, which was attended by President Carlos Salinas. Mr Ortiz Mena this week said of the meeting: 'There were people who said their group could give more, and others who said they could give less.' He stressed that the money pledged would go to a trust fund that would enable the PRI to stay independent of the government. The businessmen pledged to give on a large scale because the PRI offered the best guarantee of their investments, he said. Other groups, including labour unions, would also be contributing to the trust fund. President Salinas last year promised to make the party's finances more transparent, and to put caps on campaign spending. The party finance reform, still to be debated by Congress, is meant to address the huge financial advantages the PRI has enjoyed over Mexico's impoverished opposition parties, and thus prepare the way for more open, competitive elections. Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a leader of the opposition Party of Democratic Revolution, said of the donations: 'This does nothing but lay bare the obvious - the oligarchic nature of the party and its collusion with the country's great fortunes.' The list of guests at the dinner party reads like a who's who of Mexican business. Among those present were Mr Emilio Azcarraga, the president of Televisa, Mexico's near-monopoly television station; Mr Carlos Slim, president of Telefonos de Mexico, the recently privatised telephone monopoly; Mr Roberto Hernandez, president of Banamex, Mexico's largest, and recently privatised, bank; Mr Lorenzo Zambrano, head of Cemex, the huge cement company; Mr Bernardo Garza Sada from Alfa, the conglomerate; and Mr Adrian Sada from Vitro, the monopoly glass company. Don Fidel Velazquez, Mexico's nonagenarian labour leader, showed irritation with suggestions that the PRI was abandoning the labour sector by soliciting money from the business sector. He said Dollars 25m did not appear to be a very large sum, and that he was willing to give the party even more.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia may pay as much as $115 million annually to  Kazakhstan for using the Baykonur space launching center under a  draft treaty which Kazakh officials submitted to Russian  negotiators.    Kazakh National Space Agency Director Aisultan Kalybayev  told  INTERFAX that the draft complied with the agreement that had  been signed by Presidents Boris Yeltsin and Nursultan Nazarbayev  on 28 March.    In particular, the launching pads and the buildings in the  town of Leninsk will be rented by Russia for a term of 20 years,  which may be extended for 10 more years.    Kazakhstan had earlier intended to have the rent increased.    Kalybayev also said that the electricity and water supply  bills would be paid separately as would be those for temporary  seizure of land area where parts of booster rockets might fall.  The energy rates, he said, will not be higher than those paid  by Kazakh consumers.    Kalybayev said the draft, which he had submitted to his  Russian counterpart Yuri Koptev, will be finalized in Almaty.  Koptev is also deputy chairman of the bilateral commission on  Baykonur.    Kalybayev expressed the hope that officials from the two  countries would meet no later than in mid-June.</p>

			<p>930115 FT  15 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rank disappoints with fall to Pounds 230m - Chief again seeks to counter rumours over sale of film and television interests RANK Organisation, the leisure and entertainments group, yesterday disappointed the City with slightly lower than expected profits of Pounds 230.1m, against Pounds 250.5m last time. The group also warned that, so far, there had been no sign of an upturn in UK trading, although there were encouraging signs in the US. Turnover for the 12 months to October 31 slipped from Pounds 2.11bn to Pounds 2.1bn. Marketmakers, who had been expecting profits of between Pounds 233m and Pounds 245m, marked the shares down 17p to 687p following the announcement. They recovered, however, to close just 9p down at 695p. Mr Michael Gifford, chief executive, for the second time this week sought to counter rumours over the sale of the group's film and television interests. Responding to persistent questions over a possible sale, he replied: 'We are not in the business of selling our film and television interests and there the matter rests.' Analysts continued to speculate, however, that if an offer in excess of Pounds 400m was made by a reliable bidder from within the industry, Rank would have to consider it. Debt was reported higher at Pounds 999.3m (Pounds 960.8m) although, excluding currency fluctuations, Rank said it had generated a positive cash flow of Pounds 59m. This was partly due to a series of disposals, such as motorway services, Rank Screen Advertising and three hotels, which raised Pounds 150.9m. Pre-tax profits were hit by a downturn in Rank Xerox and an Pounds 8.1m (Pounds 1.3m) exceptional debit due to provisions against property values and redundancy and reorganisation costs. The return was also depressed by the effects on Rank's holidays and hotels division of a price war in the travel industry. Price competition depressed the contribution from Rank Xerox, which fell by Pounds 21.4m to Pounds 137.3m. Trading had been particularly difficult in Europe and the Far East. Overall revenue for Rank Xerox, 49 per cent held by the Rank Organisation, rose by 4 per cent on an underlying basis. In the holidays and hotels division, trading profits were down 22 per cent to Pounds 59.6m. This was largely the result of overcapacity in the overseas holidays market, which led to people taking 'fewer UK holidays or none', said Mr Gifford. The hotels division, a large part of which is up for sale, reported record profits out of London. A Pounds 5m reduction in losses at Rank's video distribution operation in the US helped the film division report profits some Pounds 8m higher at Pounds 27.4m. Leisure was 74 per cent higher at Pounds 41.1m, while the recreation division suffered a 2.6 per cent fall to Pounds 57.8m. The final dividend is maintained at 20.75p for an unchanged total of 31p while earnings fell slightly to 37.8p (38.4p). A Kershaw and Sons, Rank's separately-quoted subsidiary which owns about 10 per cent of the group's share of Rank Xerox, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 9.9m, against Pounds 9.93m last time. The dividend is maintained at 18p for a 27p (same) total. See Lex</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Concerning the second comment, the FAA does not agree that the proposed requirement will result in stiff, heavy firewalls. The requirement can be met by a firewall of a low stiffness, ductile design that can withstand the maximum vertical, lateral, and horizontal crushing displacements that are estimated to occur in a survivable impact. A low stiffness, ductile design can efficiently accommodate crash-induced deformations without shearing fuel or electrical lines and without rupturing or otherwise losing its gross sealing ability (i.e., creating a major ignition source or fire path). A displacement based firewall certification test should be conducted that shows that it is capable of performing its intended gross sealing function in a survivable impact. As stated previously, in order to simplify the final rule by deleting the compliance methodology, new &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e) are adopted as revised, and proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(6) and 29.952(e)(6) are removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(e)(1)(iv) and 29.952(e)(1)(iv) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggests that &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(1)(iv) and 29.952(e)(1)(iv) be modified to add the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* if it can be considered an ignition source,'' to the end of the last sentence. The commenter correctly states that not all hot surfaces should be considered as ignition sources. The FAA agrees. As stated previously, &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(1)(iv) and 29.952(e)(1)(iv) have been removed; new &sect;&sect;27.952(e) and 29.952(e) adequately incorporate the substance of this comment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(e)(1)(v) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter notes that the word ``not'' was omitted between ``must'' and ``be'' in the second sentence of &sect;&sect;27.952(e)(1)(v). The FAA agrees. The error was discovered after publication of the proposed rule, and a correction was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 11, 1990 (55 FR 50931). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(f) and 29.952(f) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter recommends placing the detailed design criteria proposed by &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f) in an advisory circular retaining only a shortened lead-in version of &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f). Another commenter believes that &sect;&sect;27.952(f) and 29.952(f), while acceptable in principle, duplicate many current FAR requirements and several other sections of 27.952 and 29.952. The commenter cited several examples of perceived duplication. The FAA agrees with the first commenter's proposal to place detailed design criteria in the advisory circular material. Therefore, proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(f)(1) through 27.952(f)(9) and 29.952(f)(1) through 29.952(f)(9) are removed. Sections 27.952(f) and 29.952(f) are revised to replace the proposed, detailed design criteria specified after the phrase ``as follows:'' with a less detailed design criteria indicated by the phrase,'' *&blank;*&blank;* to be crash resistant *&blank;*&blank;*.'' Therefore, these amendments are adopted as revised. Additionally, this revision answers the second commenter's perceived duplicity concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter notes that the word `long' used in line 4 of &sect;29.952(f)(5) should be `along'. The FAA agrees but no correction is necessary since this proposed paragraph was removed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(g) and 29.952(g) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggests that requirements for impact and tear resistance be included in the amendments. The commenter correctly notes that the GASP report recommends specific impact and tear resistance values for civil rotorcraft based on MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B requirements. The FAA agrees with the comment in general but notes that proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(g) and 29.952(g) objectively requires that crash-resistant fuel cells be tear and impact resistant. Further, it is intended that paragraphs 4.6.5.1 through 4.6.5.5 of MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B (modified for the civil environment) may be used to provide one acceptable method of properly assessing impact and tear resistance. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(h) and 29.952(h) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two commenters state that &sect;&sect;27.952(h) and 29.952 (h) and (b) are redundant.

Therefore, proposed &sect;&sect;27.952(h) and 29.952(h) are deleted. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.975(b) and 29.975(a)(7) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter states full support for &sect;&sect;27.975(b) and 29.975(a)(7), which propose that the venting system be designed to minimize spillage of fuel through the vents to an ignition source in the event of a rollover. However, the comment suggests deletion of the phrase ``*&blank;*&blank;* is shown to be extremely improbable *&blank;*&blank;*'' because, in his view, in practical terms, it would be impossible for an applicant to demonstrate such a low probability. The FAA agrees. The current term ``extremely remote'' rather than ``extremely improbable'' was intended. The FAA has determined that ``extremely remote'' is the correct term. The amendments are adopted as proposed except for replacing the word ``improbable'' with the word ``remote.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Evaluation Summary <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Order 12866 dated September 30, 1993, directs Federal agencies to promulgate new regulations and maintain current regulations only if they are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by a ``compelling public need.''

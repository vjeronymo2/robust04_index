			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (10): 'We think for our clients' - Profile of S G Warburg IT IS fair to say that while S G Warburg is universally respected, it is not necessarily liked. The widespread image of the firm as grey and faceless is partly a function of its preferred approach to publicity, which is to avoid personalising it. Professionalism, team spirit and a rejection of the star system characterise Warburgs, combined with continuity, consistency, consensus and discretion about clients' business. The firm has come a long way since it was founded in 1946, and is arguably Britain's only truly successful wholly integrated international investment bank house. The group employs more than 5,000 people worldwide and derives only 40 per cent of its revenues from domestic UK business. The international bias owes much to the founder's status as a parvenu to the City and the need to look for business elsewhere, particularly to North America. Broadly speaking, Warburgs takes a holistic approach to servicing clients. In 1991, it announced it had combined its corporate advisory and financing activities in order to market and provide corporate services more effectively to clients worldwide. Corporate advisory and financing teams are based throughout Europe, in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland and Portugal. There is a significant presence in both North America and south-east Asia. One of the more public results of the firm's integrated approach has been its involvement in privatisation transactions around the world in leading corporate advisory and distribution roles. It has acted for companies or government agencies in more than 20 countries. This breadth of experience has helped in cross-border transactions, but has also enabled the firm to grow local roots to the point where it is now involved in a large number of purely domestic transactions overseas. For example, last year it advised on the merger between Spain's two largest private sector electricity utilities, Iberduero and Hidroelectrica Espanola, and on Nationale Nederlanden's merger with NMB Postbank. More recent important transactions include the privatisation of Sidermex, the Mexican government-controlled steel and mining group sold to a consortium of Mexican and other investors, and the sale of a 60 per cent interest in SyStemix of the US to Switzerland's Sandoz, one of the largest transactions in the biotechnology industry to date. Warburgs is enjoying a good year in M&amp;A so far. Its role in advising Midland Bank on the merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank helped it to a near-clean sweep of the FT Mergers + Acquisitions International league tables at the half-year stage. Currently it is sole adviser to UK publisher Reed International, a client of more than 20 years' standing, in one of the biggest deals of 1992 so far, the proposed Pounds 5bn-plus merger with Dutch publisher Elsevier. For director Rodney Ward, a financing specialist, the involvement in this very 1990s agreed strategy-driven deal illustrates several of the firm's strengths. Client relationships, flexibility, country and industry knowledge all came to bear as well as the quality of the advisory team in coming up with a creative structure. At Warburgs, industry knowledge comes from having a large research capability. The particular areas where it feels expansion or consolidation are likely include financial services, telecommunications, publishing, property, retailing, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, motors, oil and gas and engineering. Mr Ward says: 'Networking through the analysts you can get a view not only of what's happening in any one industry in the UK but right across the world and it gives you a sense, a view and a vision that not many people can match. More and more, companies are looking to their advisers to provide them with more than just pure boiler plate advice but to be actively thinking on their behalf. We aim to be in the forefront of the provision of those ideas.' Warburgs is not immune to its recession, as its recent exit from market making for a number of smaller companies illustrated. 'We are bound up with the fate of our clients and the nature and volume of the work changes,' says Mr Mark Nicholls, director with day-to-day responsibility for corporate advice in the UK. Mr Ward argues that the firm's spread does give some insulation, with Latin America proving more buoyant than elsewhere, but there have been deferrals in the UK and Europe. The privatisation of Procordia, in which Warburgs is advising the Swedish government, now looks unlikely to take place before 1993, thanks to market uncertainty. Meanwhile, work is being sought in other areas; a lot of people do need financial restructuring advice.</p>

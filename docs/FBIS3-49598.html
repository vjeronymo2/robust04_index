			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prague, Jan 10 (CTK) -- Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus  said on radio tonight that he was most satisfied with the 1993  rate of inflation which reached 18.2 percent, according to the  Czech Statistics Office (CSU). Food prices went up by 13  percent, services by about 20 percent, and public catering  prices by 20 percent as well, Klaus said. He stressed that the  overall figure was greatly influenced by the 8 percent price  growth in January 1993 when a new taxation system was  introduced. The aggregate price increase for the next 11 months  was only 10 percent, Klaus pointed out. This means that the  internal rate of inflation is about 10 percent, the lowest of  all Eastern European countries and close to the level common in  Western Europe, Klaus said. The rate of inflation in December  was 0.8 percent.</p>

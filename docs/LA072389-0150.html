			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GARRISON, SHRIVER WIN TO REACH HALL OF FAME TOURNAMENT FINAL  </P> <P> Zina Garrison and Pam Shriver, gold-medal winners in the doubles at last year's  Olympic Games, will face each other in today's final of the Hall of Fame  Championships at Newport, R.I.  </P> <P> Shriver, seeded second, needed a third-set tiebreaker to defeat Ros Fairbank,  3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), Saturday. The top-seeded Garrison defeated No. 8 Gigi  Fernandez, 6-4, 6-3, in the other semifinal.  </P> <P> Shriver, ranked 10th in the world, hit two backhand volleys for winners in the  tiebreaker and then played the winning point exactly as she had planned.  </P> <P> "I had one play in mind," she said. "I wanted to have a nice chip backhand and  follow it, make her hit a volley. It worked to perfection."  </P> <P> Fairbank netted Shriver's chip shot to lose her fourth semifinal singles match  at Newport.  </P> <P> The South African native, ranked 30th, had three match points in the second  set. Fairbank netted two returns, and Shriver made a passing shot to stave off  defeat.  </P> <P> "She came up with the shots when she needed them," Fairbank said. "I played  well, I was selecting the right shots, but I was not executing them."  </P> <P> Scott Davis upset No. 1-seeded Dan Goldie, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, in the semifinals of  the $200,000 OTB International tennis tournament at Schenectady, N.Y.  </P> <P> Davis, seeded fourth, will face Simon Youl of Tasmania in today's final. Youl  defeated Glenn Michibata of Canada, 3-6, 7-6, 7-6.  </P> <P> Goldie dominated the first set against Davis, using his serve-and-volley game  to keep him off balance. But Davis rallied in the next two sets.  </P></p>

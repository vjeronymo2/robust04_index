			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Claimants limited to DM300,000 CLAIMANTS seeking compensation for property confiscated in the former East Germany will be limited to a maximum DM300,000 (Pounds 123,456) per claimant, Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, said yesterday. Pay-outs will not be made immediately, however, because the government has no funds to meet the tens of thousands of compensation claims. The decision, which is likely to upset many former owners because the maximum compensation will be far less than the current value of property, follows two and a half years of debate in the government commission set up to examine compensation costs and other issues. A finance ministry official said that the draft proposal, which must be discussed by the Lander, or states, is likely to be accepted.</p>

			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TENNIS;  </P> <P> HE WANTS NICE DAVIS CUP WIN  </P> <P> If Leo Durocher were to spend some time with Tom Gorman, he would quickly  conclude that, in most things Gorman does, he would finish last. Gorman, you  see, is the consummate nice guy.  </P> <P> Being nice, and being the captain of the U.S. Davis Cup tennis team, can be  seen as contradictory. Should this country's tennis fortunes be in the hands of  the Mr. Rogers of racket sports, or would we be better served with someone in  the image of Woody Hayes, or at least, Ion Tiriac?  </P> <P> Can a gee-whiz, golly-yes Tom Sawyer approach get the most out of the likes of  John McEnroe, Andre Agassi, Robert Seguso and Ken Flach, each of whom has  established at various times that he can be, to quote McEnroe himself, "The  pits of the world"?  </P> <P> Can you motivate cobras with saccharine?  </P> <P> Gorman would answer yes, but he would object immediately to the cobra imagery,  even though he has suffered more than his share of bites in his five years of  directing the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s Davis Cup program.  </P> <P> "I just don't take any of the things personally," Gorman says.  </P> <P> That is a sound approach at the moment, since any grudge Gorman might carry  into this weekend's Davis Cup semifinal against Austria in Vienna could easily  be directed at his star singles player, Agassi.  </P> <P> Agassi, a finalist in the U.S. Open, has been on and off Davis Cup teams during  Gorman's tenure. In fact, last March, during the Grand Champions tournament in  nearby Indian Wells, Agassi was on and off the team in one day. He agreed to  play in the quarterfinals against Czechoslovakia, then quickly backed off when  a question arose about how much of Agassi's entourage of  advisers/agents/coaches/brothers would be allowed close access to him and the  proceedings during the Davis Cup practices and matches.  </P> <P> When Agassi changed his mind, Gorman was quoted as wondering about Agassi's  "commitment." Agassi quickly responded with verbal venom.  </P> <P> Some samples:  </P> <P>  -- "Gorman makes me look like an idiot by saying he wondered about my  commitment."  </P> <P>  -- "He's a chameleon . . . you've got a follower in a leader's position."  </P> <P>  -- "I feel like Tom, in my opinion, doesn't have what it takes to get a team  directed."  </P> <P> Now, six months later, Agassi will be directed by Gorman into a match starting  Friday that could put the United States into its first final since 1984, and  the first under Gorman. Also on the team will be Michael Chang in the other  singles slot, and Rick Leach and Jim Pugh in the doubles. The Austrian team  will include Thomas Muster and Horst Skoff in singles and Muster and Alex  Antonitsch in doubles.  </P> <P> The match will be played in a soccer stadium, on slow red clay, in front of a  specially configured seating area that is expected to hold between 10,000 and  15,000 spectators.  </P> <P> Gorman, interviewed here Friday, said that he and Agassi have no problems.  </P> <P> "That situation was the most difficult I've ever had," Gorman said, "but like  so many things, it got blown out of proportion. Things were said at emotional  moments that shouldn't have been said. And my statement about commitment was  somewhat misunderstood by Andre. I was talking more about him changing his mind  so quickly, and he took what I said to challenge his long-term commitment. It  was almost like he thought I was questioning his guts."  </P> <P> To do something like that would be uncharacteristic of Gorman. He is a  diplomat. He is sensitive to others, forgiving, quick to praise and slow to  anger.  </P> <P> His longtime friend and best man at his wedding, Stan Smith, was once asked  about Gorman's temperment.  </P> <P> "He doesn't get mad, ever," Smith said.  </P> <P> At the recent U.S. Open, Aaron Krickstein was angry at Gorman for being passed  over for the semifinals with Austria. Krickstein was the one who agreed  immediately to substitute for Agassi in that match against Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Then, during one of Krickstein's matches at the Open, Gorman left the stands,  and it was widely reported that Krickstein had asked that Gorman leave.  </P> <P> "It wasn't exactly like that," Gorman said. "I was sitting with Aaron's agent,  Dick Dell, who also happens to be my agent. Somewhere in the match, something  happened, like some eye contact or something with the three of us. Nothing  loud, no big scene. And I asked Dell if he thought my being there might be  bothering Krickstein. Dell said yes, and so I left."  </P> <P> But Gorman, ever the peacemaker, said he sought out Krickstein later, talked to  him, listened to him, told him he understood his anger and liked his  competitive fire at wanting to be on the team.  </P> <P> "I told him I had two spots, that's all," Gorman said. "Then I asked him if  he'd be ready to step in if one of the other guys went down, and he said yes.  Later, I went back and watched his other matches."  </P> <P> Clearly, Gorman does it his way, which is the upbeat, positive way. And  clearly, short of a Davis Cup championship as captain, his way has worked well.  In his playing days, he defeated the likes of Borg and Laver and helped the  United States win the Davis Cup in 1972. He has clothing and racket contracts  and does corporate appearances, and, at 44, holds the prestigious position as  director of tennis at the Ritz Carlton Hotel here.  </P> <P> And through it all, he has been a master at smoothing out the ruffles.  </P> <P> "After the Agassi thing happened -- and that one was tough because it was right  here in my hometown and I'm just not used to being in the middle of controversy  like that -- I went to McEnroe," Gorman said. "I wanted to talk to him about it  and kind of see what he thought, because he's been through so much of it.  </P> <P> "McEnroe just laughed. That made me feel a lot better."  </P> <P> So all that remains to be seen is if the U.S. Davis Cup team can win it all  under Gorman. For Gorman, that would be swell.  </P></p>

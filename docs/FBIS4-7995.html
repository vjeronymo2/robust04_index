			<p>BFN     [Text] The Croatian Democratic Union's [Hrvatska  Demokratska Zajednica -- HDZ] deputies from the Chamber of  Deputies and the Chamber of Counties have held a joint session  in parliament.    The deputies were addressed by Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian  president and the president of the HDZ. The session was  attended by members of the ruling party's presidency. Here is  the full text of the statement:    In his speech, President Tudjman briefly restated the  guidelines of Croatia's foreign policy, in particular in  relation to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He stressed that Croatia  achieved its present standing in the world -- which has never  been higher -- because the world could see for itself the  stability of Croatia's democratic system, to which the HDZ has  made the largest contribution, and could also see that Croatia's  leadership knew how to coordinate its national and state  interests with international interests, and that such a Croatia  could be an important and active factor in the creation of the  international order in this part of Europe.    As regards the policy relating to Bosnia-Herzegovina and the  Washington agreement, the president stressed that there had been  no U-turns in Croatia's policy, but the policy had consistently  taken into consideration interests of the Croat people as a  whole and strategic interests of the Croatian state. It is  precisely because of this consistent position that the world has  accepted Croatia's policy.    The president also said that the reputation and the position  that Croatia has acquired in today's world ought to be used for  the speedier development of our country in political, economic  and cultural spheres.    The case of Josip Manolic was also discussed at the session.  Unanimous support was expressed for the policy pursued hitherto  by the HDZ under the leadership of President Franjo Tudjman.    In the light of the conclusions adopted at the second HDZ  general convention, it was emphasized that the HDZ is a  democratic party of the people, which bases its program on the  principles of Christian democracy.</p>

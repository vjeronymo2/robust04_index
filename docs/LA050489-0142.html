			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN FINANCE REPORTS FILED IN COMPTON;  </P> <P> BUILDER GAVE THOUSANDS TO INCUMBENTS  </P> <P> One of the city's most successful developers raised and donated thousands of  dollars to the campaigns of incumbent councilmen and the mayor, according to  campaign finance reports filed this week.  </P> <P> "One of the things that I'm about is motivating black people to give to black  candidates," said the developer, Danny Bakewell. Too often, he said, black  candidates must depend on contributions from white supporters who live outside  the community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Honored to Give'  </P> <P> "I feel honored to give," Bakewell said. "I feel a responsibility to support  people who are supporting good government in the city."  </P> <P> Campaign contribution and spending reports show that Councilman Robert L. Adams  collected $13,000 by April 1, all of it in $1,000 contributions from 13  different people. Under state law, single contributors may not give more than  $1,000 to a candidate.  </P> <P> Among the 13 are at least six people close to Bakewell. They include his wife,  Aline; his business partner Lonnie R. Bunkley and Bunkley's wife, Charlene, and  Bakewell's sister, Pamela Bakewell Brooks, who is on leave as executive  director of the Brotherhood Crusade.  </P> <P> Bakewell is president of the Brotherhood Crusade, an agency similar to United  Way based in the black community.  </P> <P> Also contributing $1,000, according to the state-required campaign report, were  Brenda Marsh, who is Bakewell's special assistant at the Crusade, and Yussuf J.  Simmonds, who acts as a representative for Bakewell's firm, Compton Community  Development Corp.  </P> <P> The same six people also gave $1,000 each to Councilmen Floyd A. James, whose  report shows that he collected a total of $12,701 between March 5 and April 1,  the time period covered in the campaign reports.  </P> <P> "With the campaign contribution law of a $1,000 limit," Bakewell said, "that's  what you have to do, is try to reach out to people who will give, who will  support good government."  </P> <P> James lost his reelection bid in the April 18 balloting to Patricia A. Moore.  Adams was forced into a June 6 runoff election against Compton school board  Trustee Bernice Woods.  </P> <P> Bakewell said he supported the incumbent councilmen because under their  leadership the city has made substantial progress in its effort to economically  revitalize the community.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Need to Look at Good Done  </P> <P> "I think you really have to look at what good has been done for the city,"  Bakewell said, pointing to his success in developing the downtown's only  shopping center. With help from the city's Redevelopment Agency, he is  developing a second shopping center.  </P> <P> Bakewell's name does not appear as a contributor on either James' or Adams'  reports, although it did show up on Mayor Walter R. Tucker's report. The mayor,  who was also forced into a runoff, got $1,000 from Bakewell. The mayor also  received $1,000 from Bunkley and $1,000 from Bakewell's development firm.  </P> <P> Another $1,000 contributor to both James and Adams, according to their reports,  was Yoshiko A. Morris. Both reports list a Los Angeles address for Morris that  is the same address listed for Lonnie and Charlene Bunkley.  </P> <P> James M. Woods, chairman of Hub City Developers Inc., also gave $1,000 each to  Adams and James. Woods said the contributions were not connected to a recent  vote by the City Council to settle a long-standing debt the nonprofit housing  firm owed the city.  </P> <P> Hub City was the subject of a recent critical federal audit that urged Compton  to foreclose on the firm in order to recoup a $2-million federal grant that the  city funneled to the company. Hub City was to use the grant, as well as about  $3 million it got in direct city loans, to build low-income housing. The  housing, however, was never built, and Hub City did not repay the money.  </P> <P> Instead of foreclosing on Hub City, the City Council on a 3-2 vote agreed to  accept as payment a parcel of land Hub City had near the Artesia Freeway.  Critics of the agreement claimed that the city had given Hub City the land in  the first place. Woods pointed out that he gave contributions to both Adams and  James, although Adams voted against the settlement.  </P> <P> Among the other $1,000 contributors to Adams were Shirley Mims, John Mims,  Rosie Johnson, Jack Bortnick and Sonia Bresnelian. Among James' contributors  were Shirley and John Mims, $1,000 each, and William A. Johnson, $1,000.  </P> <P> James could not be reached for comment, and Adams said he does not know any of  the $1,000 contributors listed above.  </P> <P> "That's a different area of the campaign," Adams said, saying that he has a  finance committee that raises money for him. "You can't get your message out to  the people if you don't have money for printing and postage," he said. "It's  costly, very costly to campaign today and the people who contributed to me want  the continuation of good government in Compton."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Late Reports  </P> <P> Adams and James, as well as several other candidates, face fines of at least  $10 a day because they did not file their campaign reports by the April 6  deadline. James filed his report last Friday. Adams filed his Monday.  </P> <P> Moore, who will take her council seat July 1, did not file her report until  last Thursday. But City Clerk Charles Davis said she will probably not be fined  because a letter accompanied the report saying it was late because her campaign  treasurer was ill and had to be hospitalized.  </P> <P> Moore reported collecting $8,200 between March 5 and April 1, much of it in  $500 contributions from family members -- her mother, stepfather, sister,  cousins and an uncle. Other contributors were: Tom Stemnock of Sherman Oaks, an  engineer, $1,000; Rep. Mervyn Dymally (D-Compton), $500; Duke and Jo's Garage  in Compton, $100, and Kofi Boateng, a gas station owner in Paramount, $100.  </P> <P> Moore also reported having raised $3,500 at a $25-per-ticket fund-raiser.  Individual contributions of less than $100 do not have to be reported.  </P></p>

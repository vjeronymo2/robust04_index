			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Yang Liu (2799 2692): "As the Unified </F> Exchange Rate Increases the Cost of Foreign Debts, the Central  Government Adopts Measures To Help Localities Make Repayments"]    [Text] The unification of the two exchange rates has  devalued the renminbi by 33 percent. This has increased the  cost of local governments in paying foreign debts and created a  new burden. It is disclosed that according to a State Council  decision, the State Planning Commission and the Ministry of  Finance will coordinate with the planning commissions of various  provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under  the central government in jointly solving this issue. The  Ministry of Finance will also undertake some of the local  governments' foreign debts to help them repay part of their  debts.    In an interview with this reporter yesterday, Tao Liming,  deputy director of the International Monetary and Financial  Institute of the Bank of China, said: The central government  has noticed that, in the years between the Seventh Five-Year  Plan (1986-1990) and the Eighth Five-Year Plan (1991-1995), some  of the foreign debts contracted by the local governments were  calculated at the official rate of less than 4 yuan or 5.9 yuan  [figures as published] to the U.S. dollar. Now that the  renminbi has been devalued following the unification of the two  exchange rates, which means foreign debts should be calculated  at the new rate of 8.7 yuan to the dollar, the cost and burden  of the local governments will suddenly increase if they exchange  renminbi for the dollar at a designated bank for the repayment  of foreign debts.    Some time ago, a considerable proportion of the foreign  debts  incurred by the local governments was invested in electricity,  communications, and water conservation projects for agricultural  use. When these projects are completed and go into operation,  the country as a whole will benefit.    Officials from Chengdu as well as Guizhou, Yunnan, and other  provinces told this reporter: In the past dozen years or so,  the localities have joined in many large construction projects,  such as railways, power stations, and water conservation  projects, and have borrowed money to finance these projects.  Now that the exchange rates are unified, they are anxious to  find ways to deal with the substantial increase in the cost of  foreign debts.    Tao said that by a decision of the State Council, the State  Planning Commission and the Ministry of Finance will coordinate  with the planning commissions of various provinces, autonomous  regions, and municipalities directly under the central  government in helping the local government solve this new issue.    By the end of 1992, China's foreign debts came to $69.3  billion. At the National People's Congress meeting last March,  Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said China would borrow 26.9  billion yuan in new foreign debts (amounting to $4.56 billion at  5.9 yuan to the dollar). The servicing of foreign debts will  hit a peak this year and the next. But a relevant department  said that China has a good reputation in repaying foreign debts.  He said: In a bid to stabilize the exchange rate of renminbi  and further boost monetary reform, Chinese monetary authorities  plan to open a renminbi futures business. Tao did not elaborate  specific measures, such as when this will open.    Tao also said yesterday that, following the unification of  the exchange rates, the exchange rate of renminbi in mainland  cities have been basically stable in the past few days. He  added: The Chinese monetary and financial departments have made  ample preparations for the unification of renminbi exchange  rates on 1 January 1994.    For example, starting in early 1993, the authorities  intentionally liberalized business by calculating the settlement  of foreign trade exchange according to the swap price. By the  end of last year, some 80 percent of imports and exports by  mainland enterprises, labor export, and exchange transactions  between enterprises was calculated according to the swap price.  When the basic conditions for monetary reform were ripe, China  announced the unification of exchange rates on 1 January and the  rate has been basically stable since then.    According to Tao, foreign debts contracted by the central  and  local governments in the future will still be controlled by the  State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control.</p>

			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Technology: A super PC from H-P While many companies are talking about creating vast new markets with pocket-sized computerised gadgets that are variously called 'personal digital assistants' or 'information appliances', Hewlett-Packard has this week introduced a 'super-portable' personal computer that addresses the needs of a broad range of 'mobile professional' computer users. The H-P Omnibook 300 is a lightweight and compact PC with a full-size keyboard and screen and long battery life. It is bigger than a 'palmtop' computer, but lighter than a 'notebook' PC. It is a 386-powered PC that comes fully loaded with Microsoft Windows, Word and Excel software, as well as some personal productivity and communications software. Weighing in at 2.9lb and measuring roughly 11in by 6.5in and 1.5in thick, the Omnibook runs for five to nine hours on four standard AA batteries. H-P is offering two models; one with a built-in 40MB hard drive with a list price of Dollars 1,950 (Pounds 1,290) in the US and the other with solid state data storage that will sell for Dollars 2,375. Extras include an internal modem and a power adapter. Neither of the Omnibooks includes a floppy disk drive, but software or data can be downloaded from a desktop PC via a serial port or an innovative infra-red link that is expected to become standard in desktop computers of the future. Special features of the Omnibook include a 'pop up mouse', that springs out of the side of the computer. It behaves like a desktop computer rodent, but because it does not require a flat surface it can be used, for example, in the limited confines of an aircraft 'tray table'. H-P has made some compromises to minimise power consumption. The screen is monochrome and the data storage capacity is lower than that of most notebook computers. This is a briefcase-sized PC that overcomes the limitations of existing PCs.</p>

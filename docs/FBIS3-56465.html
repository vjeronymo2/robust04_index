			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed roundup: "Dollar Has Increased in Price by 46 </F> Rubles"]    [Text] D.N. Sukhinenko, chairman of the board of the  RINAKO investment company: One can only express sincere regret  at Yegor Gaydar's decision to leave the government.    "Gaydar could and should have fought to the end despite the  setback at the elections and the complexity of mutual relations  in the government." In the opinion of Sukhinenko, who together  with a number of other representatives of private business calls  himself a critic of Gaydar's team, in Russia's interests Gaydar  should have continued working. Now we shall get a traditional  government.    The reformers' setback shows that economic problems cannot  be  resolved from above.    A.V. Zakharov, general director of the Moscow currency  exchange: It can be said unequivocally that Yegor Gaydar's  resignation is destabilizing the currency market even more. In  general this market has already reacted to the political  instability in Russia: The lack of clarity as to what kind of  government their will be and, most importantly, what its actions  will be, has largely affected the rise in the dollar exchange  rate since the beginning of the year. And on Monday immediately  after Gaydar's resignation announcement, the rate changed again  by nearly 50 rubles and was 1,402 rubles for one U.S. dollar.    Of course it is perhaps very hard to speak in detail right  now of any economic program. At any rate until the budget for  the current quarter and for the year have been examined, at  least preliminarily, in parliament. And in this situation the  participants in the currency market link their hopes with  specific individuals embodying a particular course. And we know  what course Yegor Gaydar embodied and what hopes businessmen  linked with him.    M.B. Khodorkovskiy, chairman of the "Menatepa" council of  directors: I think that right now we should not dramatize the  situation in connection with Gaydar's voluntary resignation.  The point is that we are faced with the objective need for a  small change of economic course caused by the aggravation of the  nonpayments problem and the need to implement the structural  restructuring of industry. Of course this could cause the  intensification of inflation processes and the further decline  of the ruble exchange rate but at the same time structural  restructuring will become the basis for subsequent financial  stabilization, for the removal of social tension in the country.    As regards fears that the government is now drastically  altering its course, then I can say one thing on this subject:  If investments are made sensibly, if money goes on specific,  carefully worked through and well controlled programs, then it  is absurd to speak of a change of course. If the funds invested  are spent on "propping up" all weak and inefficient enterprises,  then it will indeed be necessary to sound the alarm. And  whoever is appointed to the post of minister of the economy will  shed a lot of light on this question.</p>

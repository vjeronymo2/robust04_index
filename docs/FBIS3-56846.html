			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Maksim Yusin: "Kozyrev Did Not Demand That </F> Troops Be Left in Latvia and Estonia"]    [Text] On Tuesday evening ITAR-TASS produced a sensation  by transmitting Andrey Kozyrev's words about the need to keep a  Russian military presence in the Baltic countries since Moscow  has vitally important interests in that region.    The Baltic leaders responded instantly. The point of their  statement cam down to the fact that Russia's viewpoint is  unacceptable to Latvia and Estonia, which continue to insist on  the speediest withdrawal of troops and do not want to come  within the sphere of anyone's interests. The U.S. State  Department has stated that it intends to appeal to the Russian  Government for explanations and that Kozyrev's words radically  contradict the position voiced by Boris Yeltsin during recent  talks with Bill Clinton.    A few hours after the TASS report Foreign Ministry  officials,  answering telephone calls from Russian and foreign journalists,  began to issue denials. According to a employee of the  information and press department, ITAR-TASS took Kozyrev's words  out of context and distorted their meaning: "Addressing a  meeting with Russian ambassadors to the countries of `nearby  foreign parts,' the minister spoke of the need to strengthen  ties with all republics of the former USSR, including the Baltic  states. He then turned to military issues and here there was  talk only of CIS members. That is, his words about retaining a  Russian military presence in the zone of vitally important  interests in no way apply to the Baltics. That cannot be  understood from the ITAR-TASS report: You formed the impression  that Kozyrev had in mind all former Soviet republics."    The incident would seem to be exhausted. Nonetheless, many  questions remain. Why, having learned of the annoying blunder  which caused such a barrage of responses, did neither Kozyrev  himself nor his press service immediately issue a resolute  denial? The Foreign Ministry's official statement on this score  will to all appearances be made public only at 1400 on Thursday,  at a briefing by Grigoriy Karasin, chief of the information and  press department.    By noon on 19 January the embassies of the Baltic states in  Moscow had not yet been informed that the words ascribed to  Kozyrev do not accord with reality. The denial was remarkably  limp. As a result half a day was lost -- during this time  foreign newspapers and agencies and radio and television  broadcast many commentaries far from favorable to Russia and its  foreign policy department and its chief.</p>

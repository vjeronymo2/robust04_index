			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FAA notes that the drop test criteria proposed in Notice 90&hyph;24 are the same as those proposed in part 23 Notice 85&hyph;7A and the same as those used to comply with MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B. There are standard, acceptable methods of configuring (i.e., properly removing the air from) a soft flexible fuel cell, and there are standard, acceptable methods of configuring (i.e., properly removing the air from) the vents on a rigid fuel cell. The air removal methods intended by these proposals are the same as those used to comply with MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B and are accepted, industry practice. It is impracticable to remove a significant amount of air from many rigid fuel cell designs by pulling a vacuum without either inducing unacceptable stresses or causing structural failure. Extreme vacuum conditions inside fuel tanks do not exist in practice. However, natural venting (involving partial vacuums) exists for rigid tanks in a pre-crash, falling condition. A natural partial vacuum condition is intended to be duplicated for rigid tanks by allowing normal vent function during the drop test. Flexible fuel cells will have the air removed by hand (i.e., by pushing out the air and resealing the bag) prior to the drop as is currently practiced by the industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The method chosen to compensate for the density of water versus that of fuel (i.e., 80 percent full of water) is a standard method. It is used successfully by the civil rotorcraft industry. The commenter's alternate method of reducing the drop height has some merit but is not supported by current, known data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, these amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(a)(4) and 29.952(a)(4) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter notes that the amendments differ from MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B, in that the amendments require that the tank be dropped in its surrounding structure, unless it is clearly shown that the structure is free from projections and other such hazards. The commenter suggests that the FAA not adopt the requirement to drop the tank in the surrounding structure. The FAA disagrees. The FAA concluded that in the interests of safety the tank should be dropped in its surrounding structure. Only when all projections and other puncture hazards have been minimized by design will dropping a bare fuel cell suffice to show compliance. The FAA's approach improves on the MIL&hyph;T&hyph;27422B criteria in that an FAA-approved, documented certification design review will be required to minimize the surrounding airframe projections and other puncture hazards prior to a bare tank drop test. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(b) and 29.952(b) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter states that the load factors proposed in these sections are redundant to those contained in structural &sect;&sect;27.561 and 29.561(d), that no procedures to conduct these tests have been defined, and that the cost of this type of testing is not addressed. Two other commenters question the need for specification of separate load factors by rotorcraft zone (i.e., location) for fuel cells that exceed the standard airframe load factors. The FAA disagrees that the proposed load factors are redundant. They are for fuel cells and major mass items in the fuel system only. The load factors are to be used in standard structural analysis to structurally design the fuel cells, other major fuel system mass items, and their attachments. No special tests, other than the required structural substantiation tests are intended. No costs have been added since the required structural analysis and test programs are already conducted during certification for these components to the current load factors. The separate load factor specification by zone is necessary to provide proper crash resistance for occupant safety and PCF prevention for fuel system components located in three selected zones of the rotorcraft. They also provide the designer with specific criteria (i.e., load factors) for proper static analysis of fuel system components in these specific zones. The load factors proposed by &sect;&sect;27.952(b) and 29.952(b) are for fuel system components only; whereas, the load factors of current &sect;29.561(d) are for the airframe only. However, load factors for fuel system components and airframe components are compatible. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Sections 27.952(b)(2) and 29.952(b)(2) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A commenter suggests that the words ``*&blank;*&blank;* that if loosened could injure an occupant in an emergency landing *&blank;*&blank;*.'' be removed from &sect;&sect;27.952(b)(2) and 29.952(b)(2). The commenter believes removal to be necessary because this phrase is intended to minimize a ``mechanical'' ballistic hazard from fuel system components and not a PCF hazard. The amendments, in the commenter's view, are only intended to minimize a PCF. The commenter's presumption is incorrect. The amendments are intended to provide a CRFS. This includes preventing impact-induced, ballistic hazards to fuel system components as well as PCF hazards. Therefore, the amendments are adopted as proposed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

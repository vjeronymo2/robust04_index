			<p>BFN     [Text] Iran has completely severed its financial aid to the  Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine. The movement has  traditionally had good relations with Iran. Its secretary  general, Dr. Fathi al-Shiqaqi, was given a head-of-state welcome  when he visited Tehran two months ago to participate in  celebrations marking the international Jerusalem day. He was  also given the honor of delivering his speech right after the  Iranian leader 'Ali Khamene'i gave his. Al-Shiqaqi left Tehran  with many promises of support for his movement but none of these  promises came true. On the contrary, all assistance was cut  off, a Palestinian source told AL-SHIRA'.    According to the same source, the Iranian move can be  explained either by there being differences among various  factions within the Iranian authority or by a change in Iranian  policy. The latter is more likely, the source said, because  Iran is giving more priority to the Arab Gulf region, the  (formerly Soviet) Islamic republics, and Afghanistan.    The source added that Iran wishes to allay western pressure  on Iran by declining to play a direct role in the Middle East.  The United States had advised Iran not to oppose the  Gaza-Jericho agreement, or to obstruct the agreement signed in  Oslo and the peace process.    According to the same source, Iran made a number of promises  to the alliance of Palestinian forces but it failed to deliver.  This indicates that Iran is not serious in what it says. The  source said Iran determines its policy in light of its own  interests, not the interests and designs of those vying for its  help. The source predicted that Iran will eventually  discontinue its already reduced aid to Hizballah.    Iran used to pay pensions to the families of those killed in  the course of the intifadah through the Islamic Jihad Movement  in Palestine, in appreciation of the latter's role in the  intifadah and the impressive operations it mounted against  Israeli forces and settlers. Two years ago, however, this  assistance was discontinued. The reason was that Iran supported  a split within the movement's ranks in which Shaykh Sayyid  Barakah, a former leader of the movement, announced the  establishment of Hizballah (Palestine). Barakah failed to win  over al-Jihad members, however, and al-Shiqaqi refused to give  in to his breakaway group.    Consequently, Iran shifted its support away from al-Shiqaqi,  giving Barakah command of al-Shahid [martyr] institution in  Lebanon. Meanwhile, it gave the Popular Front for the  Liberation of Palestine-General Command [PFLP-GC] the  responsibility of distributing the pensions to the martyrs of  the intifadah.    According to press reports, PFLP-GC Central Committee Member  Mustafa Khamis, who lives in Jordan, recently broke away from  the PFLP-GC, and formed an Islamic General Command [qiyadah  'amah islamiyah]. No reason was given for the split. Khamis  spent 15 years in Israeli jails, and was released in 1979 in an  exchange of prisoners between Israel and the PFLP-GC. Khamis'  motives for the split are said to be linked with PFLP-GC  suspicions surrounding his role in forging documents and  embezzling funds allocated to the martyrs families in the  occupied land. Iran has no remaining allies in Palestine and  Lebanon who are not so employed.</p>

			<p><P> March 24, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> REVIEWS  </P> <P> *** "Stand-Up Reagan"  </P> <P> J2. $19.95.  </P> <P> Ah, the good ole days. That's what this 40-minute video is all about -- the  President playfully snaring balloons on the convention stage, "Ron for King"  pickets waving in the audience, "Ronnie" telling jokes about farmers and  Russian peasants and how old he is: He quotes George Washington, but "I didn't  actually hear him say it"; "When I go in for my physical, they don't ask my  age; they just carbon date me." This is a collection of the nicer moments of  his stand-up career. Whatever your politics, this guy scored with a joke.  </P> <P>  Videos are rated on a scale of one star (a loser) to five stars (a classic).  </P> <P> IRV LETOFSKY  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Zagreb HTV Television in Serbo-Croatian  at 2200 GMT on 16 April carries what is identified as a  rebroadcast of a recorded report from the Bosnian Serb Pale  Television in Serbo-Croatian on Bosnian Serb Commander General  Ratko Mladic visiting the Gorazde front. The time and date of  the original report is not given.    Mladic is seen showing a corpse of a Bosnian government  soldier and scattered uniforms. He says that "a number of  Alija's soldiers have been killed in this area. They are all  dressed in American uniforms. We invited them to collect their  dead but they did not come. Let us go on."    Mladic is shown chatting with his soldiers, and the camera  shows more close-ups of U.S. uniforms. Mladic passes by a  crater, and pointing to it says, "That is U.S. democracy and  they want to impose it on the entire world."    An unidentified correspondent says, "what you said on many  occasions before was confirmed today. Traces of U.S. supplies  to the Muslim army have been found in this area."    Mladic answers: "That is nothing new, as you can see all of  the equipment from parachutes to soldiers' boots is American or  belonging to the states of the NATO alliance. This confirms that  NATO has been waging war against us for two and a half years, I  would say a bit more, because NATO has trained in its countries  those who attacked Yugoslavia and the Serb nation."    The correspondent says that according to some reports, the  bodies of British Special Air Service, SAS, members who fought  together with the Muslims are in this area.    Mladic says, "Well, I think that we will pass down by the  village of Jabuka; I can already see our soldiers there.  Yesterday our soldiers observed a clash there between members  of that special SAS unit [pauses], their group was probably  encircled by the Muslims who wanted to take them hostage. As  far as we know two of them were wounded and two were killed  there."    The correspondent then says that the reports about the  downing of the French plane are conflicting. Mladic responds,  saying, "It is a pity you were not here yesterday with your  cameras to record it. I think we recorded it with our cameras.  In their despair, trying to provoke an international reaction  and to get NATO to protect them, the Muslims fired Stinger  missiles, which were dropped to them earlier with these  parachutes, targeting NATO aircraft. NATO has had more losses  than it has admitted."</p>

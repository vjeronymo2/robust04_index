			<p><P> March 31, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> FOLKS WHO PRESERVE FOLK  </P> <P> When lease problems prompted Bill Goldsmith and his wife, Pearl Wolfe, to close  the Old Time Cafe in January, 1988, the San Diego folk music community suffered  a big loss.  </P> <P> For more than eight years, the Leucadia coffeehouse had been the only county  venue to regularly showcase touring folk acts from all over the world. It was  Goldsmith's and Wolfe's desire to lessen the blow that led them, in the final  days of the cafe, to establish San Diego Folk Heritage. The nonprofit,  all-volunteer organization has since kept alive the Old Time Cafe's legacy by  presenting a series of local folk concerts, including Saturday night's  appearance by Odetta at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium.  </P> <P> "Bill and Pearl knew that, after the Old Time Cafe shut down, there wouldn't  really be any other place in San Diego for touring folk musicians to play,"  said Bruce Reid, chairman of San Diego Folk Heritage's 10-member board of  directors.  </P> <P> "So, before they closed the cafe, they invited a number of us Old Time Cafe  regulars to a meeting to see if there was some way for the music to continue.  Actually, most of us who went to that meeting didn't realize what we were  getting into. The prevalent feeling of the original board members was that Bill  and Pearl wanted to continue presenting concerts under a nonprofit structure,  and they needed a rubber-stamp board of directors to make it fly.  </P> <P> "But what we found out was that their idea was to start a very active volunteer  organization, and we were all going to do a lot of work. They served in an  advisory capacity for six months; then they left town, and it was up to us to  basically carry on."  </P> <P> San Diego Folk Heritage has, in fact, carried on -- with increasing success,  Reid said.  </P> <P> "Initially, we did concerts all over town, and that was pretty difficult," he  said. "It's gotten a lot easier since we moved to one stable venue."  </P> <P> That venue is the Del Mar Shores Auditorium on the Winston School campus, where  San Diego Folk Heritage is now presenting two concerts a month by touring folk  acts.  </P> <P> Past shows have featured topical singer-songwriters Tom Paxton and Peter Alsop,  Irish harpist Patrick Ball, English concertina-player Alistair Anderson, and  mandolinist-guitarist Peter Ostroushko, a former regular on public radio's  "Prairie Home Companion."  </P> <P> Coming up are Celtic music group Black Thorn, with Paraguayan harpist Ed Lang,  on May 12; Ronnie Gilbert, an original member of pioneering American folk  revivalists the Weavers, on May 19, and the Iron Mountain String Band, which  plays old-time hillbilly music, on June 2.  </P> <P> "We're booking only traditional folk musicians, even those who aren't that well  known," Reid said. "Tracy Schwarz, who recently played for us, is a good  example. He's one of the foremost traditional interpreters in America -- he  used to be with the New Lost City Ramblers, one of the bands that started the  whole traditional music revival back in the 1950s -- and there's just nobody  else in town who would have presented somebody like him."  </P> <P> San Diego Folk Heritage also publishes a bimonthly newsletter filled with  concert updates, artist profiles and record reviews that is sent out to the  more than 4,000 local folk fans on the groups mailing list, which it inherited  from the Old Time Cafe, Reid said.  </P> <P> In addition, the organization sponsors New England "contra" dances the first  and third Friday of every month at the Trinity United Methodist Church in North  Park.  </P> <P> "And just recently," Reid said, "we began doing monthly concerts by local  musicians at the Del Mar Shores Auditorium, on top of our two other shows per  month."  </P> <P> The next home-grown talent night is April 21, with folk singers Pam and Maggie  sharing the bill with North County bluegrass band the Unstrung Heroes.

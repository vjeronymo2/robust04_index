			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / Markets: Rentokil on the warpath - The Bottom Line FROM Rentokil to Rent-a-mob? The environmental and property services company, best known for its pest control business, yesterday looked set to win its first hostile takeover when it upped its bid for Securiguard, the security and cleaning company. But Clive Thompson, chief executive of Rentokil since 1983 and chief architect of its heady growth, has yet to win the wider argument - whether a low quality, low margin business like guarding can sparkle under the Rentokil treatment. Rentokil began business early this century as a maker of rat poison. It later acquired a Danish parent, Sophus Berendsen with 56 per cent, and a stock market listing in 1969. But it was in the 1980s that the company's fortunes, and its share price, took off. Under Thompson, it targeted business services such as cleaning and tropical plants supply and realised correctly that companies were willing to pay more for good service. The tropical plants business, for example, was built up by acquisitions and expansion overseas into one of the largest such companies in the world. Previously a low value service, Rentokil lifted its margins from single figures close to 20 per cent through raising prices and quality levels. Thompson is convinced he can do the same with manned security, even though Securiguard's margins are only about 5 per cent. 'It's the same trick. It's running a service business, and we happen to believe we're very good at running service businesses,' he says. If it wins Securiguard, the Rentokil 'trick' would involve looking at the security company's training, marketing and technology. A 'raft' of incremental improvements will lead to higher margins, Thompson says. 'People are prepared to pay a price premium so long as service levels are higher. And prices don't have to be all that much higher to improve margins.' Despite Rentokil's record, some analysts are not convinced Thompson is right. They will be watching closely to see if companies really are prepared to pay more money for what is still seen as a straightforward service. 'Companies may think about security during bomb scares, but usually it is price not service driven,' according to one analyst. Whether it is Thompson or his detractors who are correct will largely decide the direction of Rentokil's share price. As the graph shows, the shares have performed very strongly since 1987 and have outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by almost three times since Thompson took control. Rentokil's record since the mid-1980s of lifting profits 20 per cent a year earned it one of the highest ratings on the stock market, making the shares very expensive to buy. But they fell sharply after the company's results announcement in March. This was because the market started wondering whether the company's record of 20 per cent profits growth was sustainable. According to the detractors - who are easily outnumbered by supporters  - Rentokil's 'trick' was no longer working. They pointed to a slowdown in the UK especially, and said Rentokil needed a large acquisition to maintain earnings growth. Two months later, the bid for Securiguard was launched. Thompson has insisted that Rentokil wanted Securiguard for the business rather than short term earnings. It spotted that manned security was suitable for some Rentokil trickery, he said. There is probably truth in both camps. Rentokil is now a very large, maturing business which last year made profits of Pounds 122.4m. Further rapid growth can only come through acquisition and moving into other new market areas. And acquisitions can only get bigger. Analysts agree that after waiting ten years to make his first hostile bid, Thompson will not wait as long again. 'They wanted Securiguard for the business, but also as a learning experience for a really big bid,' according to one analyst.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Green group calls for limits on world trade PROPOSALS for a new and powerful world trade body in place of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade should be taken out of the Uruguay Round of global trade talks and 'greened', the World Wide Fund for Nature says today. The Swiss-based environmental group has timed its latest shot across Gatt's bows for the opening of the OECD ministerial meeting in Paris tomorrow, when trade issues and completion of the Uruguay Round will top the agenda. WWF says the current proposal for a multilateral trade organisation is not compatible with the goal of sustainable development set out at the Earth Summit last year. It says the MTO should recognise 'the need to set limits on trade in order to adequately protect the environment'. Arguing that the creation of the MTO has been 'unacceptably secretive', WWF also wants the MTO draft opened for public consultation rather than decided by trade negotiators behind closed doors. Environmental groups, especially in the US, have been campaigning vigorously against the MTO, which would subsume Gatt and proposed sister bodies on intellectual property, such as patents and copyright, and trade in services. They argue that the MTO would institutionalise the primacy of free trade over environmental protection and make it easier to challenge high national standards on environmental protection as unfair trade barriers. These charges are denied by governments taking part in the round but the campaign has reinforced fears that the MTO proposal could threaten US Congressional approval of the Uruguay Round package of trade liberalising measures. The environmentalists' hand has also been strengthened by the more explicit environmental protection language in the North American Free Trade Agreement by the US, Mexico and Canada. WWF proposals for reforming the MTO include making environmental protection and eradication of poverty explicit objectives, giving non-governmental organisations rights of consultation and enabling them to make submissions to trade disputes investigations, aa well as establishment of a trade and sustainable development council within the MTO.</p>

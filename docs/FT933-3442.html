			<p>930914 FT  14 SEP 93 / Arts: Figuring out Freud - William Packer hails a great British artist in his 71st year Lucian Freud is without question a great artist, as remarkable as any that this or any country has produced in a hundred years or more, as great a painter of the figure as any since Courbet. Among his contemporaries he stands all but alone. Whom could we put alongside him, now that Bacon is dead? Balthus perhaps, but him only. It is a large claim to make but, in the face of the work, inescapeable: yet even now one senses that there are many who would deny the obvious. It would seem two forces are at work in this respect, contradictory yet oddly pulling in the same direction. On the one hand there is the reluctance to overstate a case made cheap by promiscuous indulgence elsewhere: on the other, a myopic critical disregard, born of the artist's own singularity; an instinctive outsider, his work is awkward, difficult, entirely independent of market fashion and modernist orthodoxy. Certainly his current reputation has been won with little help from the international art establishment. The Arts Council gave him his first full retrospective at the Hayward in 1974, but I remember it as being given somewhat against the grain - almost apologetic a special case. A second Hayward retrospective in 1987 was more confidently given - and received - at home, but the British Council had considerable difficulty in placing the subsequent tour abroad, which was refused outright by New York and received with marked indifference in Paris. And here was an artist by now in his 60s and working with more power and authority than ever. The Tate has yet to give him a show. In short, what consistent support he has had has come not from the public but from the private sector. Has this all now changed, now that Freud is 70 and a Grand Old Man? The point is only that such critical acceptance as he now enjoys has been forced and won by the work itself, just as it is. Like it or not, take it or leave it, there it is - and it is not going to go away. For its showing in New York and Madrid this exhibition will have a retrospective element, a quick skim though from the 1940s to the early 1980s. But in London it begins in 1982, with a portrait of the artist's mother, and so continues with portraits, figure and life-paintings large and small, most especially the life-paintings, up to the large, full-length, full-frontal nude self-portrait that is still in progress. It is the record of a decade of phenomenal personal achievement, although for an artist to continue in full creative flow well into old age is not unusual. Indeed, with such artists as Titian or Rembrandt or Monet, it is possible to argue that the best comes last. With Freud, however, such has been the creative drive since the late 1970s it is as though he has waited until then almost to begin. At that point it seems he came to his proper subject, the human presence in a particular space, usually nude, which he had treated often enough before but now fixed upon all but exclusively. And with it came, for him, its proper treatment - an unremiting scrutiny - and its proper scale - moving up to life-size. It is strong stuff and even shocking if taken superficially, but then we forget that great painting in the post-Renaissance humane tradition always had the power to shock, and used this power quite deliberately. And it is to this greater tradition that Freud belongs, which is perhaps where the critical difficulty lies. He is a modern painter, working in modern times, fully aware of all that modernism, and expressionism in particular, has made available to the artist in our secular age. But while Freud would never deny the modern movement, he is not, has never been, its creature. In another time who is to say what martyrdoms and mysteries he might have painted. We think of Titian, Caravaggio, Ribera, Goya - Marsyas flayed, St Lawrence twisting on his grill, St Anthony tormented in the wilderness. Autres temps, autres moeurs: and what we have from Freud instead of saints personified is the image direct of the human condition and, at the closest remove, of our own mortality. Such a subject is only as shocking as we wish it to be. Which leaves the paintings as paintings - for it is all too easy to become so fixed on the imagery, especially such strong meat as this, as to see nothing else. There is always more to the understanding of painting than the mere literary reading of metaphor or symbol. Here are these nudes, legs splayed, arms akimbo, the portrait heads staring fixedly before them, the figures set in the bleak physical space of the artist's studio, and all subject to that same searching, apparently unsentimental gaze. And yet the most physical thing about them is not the imagery at all but the paint itself, rich and dense. What we find as we look into these surfaces is that Freud is become ever freer in his handling, and taking more and more risks with drawing and proportion - a huge foot, a strange passage of modelling, a squashed face. For here is no close, tortured preoccupation with verisimilitude but a practical ebullience and, yes, enjoyment, that is not quite what we might have expected. Freud is now clearly working at high speed, and yet all is carried through with such command and technical aplomb that no whit nor jot of it is anything less than utterly convincing. We accept what Freud shows us as being true enough, but the truth is what Freud has made it to be, no pale copy or simulacrum of reality but a true equivalent, born of the creative imagination. And it is also very beautiful. What ugliness there is lies in ourselves.

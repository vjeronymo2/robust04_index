			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In connection with the NATO summit session held in  Brussels, Mr. Petre Roman, president of the Democratic Party,  president of the Commission for Defense, Public Order, and  National Security in the Chamber of Deputies, and special  rapporteur of the NATO Assembly for the new European security  order, made a statement to our radio network in which he  mentioned that the proceedings have concluded without any  surprise.    The U.S. plan of partnership for peace was adopted. For the  countries that belonged to the former Warsaw Pact, among them  Romania, this can be considered as a disappointing result.  Romania can consider itself a country that deserves to have a  more reassuring status for its own national security.    Mr. Roman also said that the plan for partnership for peace  represents a compromise between the direct request of the former  socialist countries to be accepted in NATO and Russia's  insistent demand not to have such an expansion of that  organization.</p>

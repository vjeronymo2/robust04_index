			<p>920528 FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Investors raise only two cheers OF ALL the interest groups participating in the corporate governance debate, perhaps no one has more to lose than institutional shareholders. It is they who suffer when bad management leads to corporate collapse. Unlike bank creditors, they are on the sidelines when receivers are called in to divide the remaining assets of a defunct company. Shareholders give the Cadbury report two cheers. While applauding the proposed code of practice and its frequent references to the role of shareholders as owners of companies, they expressed disappointment that, on several key issues, the report did not go further. Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the National Association of Pension Funds, whose members manage more than Pounds 300bn in assets, said it clearly reflected the need to reach a consensus among its members' conflicting interests. 'However, it's better to have a lower common denominator that everyone can agree on than to have a higher standard that is ignored,' he said. Mr Rogers welcomed the proposal for a new Stock Exchange listing requirement tied to disclosure, saying that some companies might have perfectly valid reasons for not complying with certain aspects of the code and there was no reason to compel them to do so. Eventually, though, companies would find failing to comply with best practice was simply too cumbersome an exercise. Other shareholders were less optimistic about the effectiveness of the recommendations. The report's suggestion that shareholders would be able to require companies in which they invest to comply with the code was dismissed as improbable. 'If a shareholder sees value in a company, he's unlikely to sell the shares, no matter what kind of corporate governance it has,' said one institutional shareholder. 'And you only sell the shares when you think the company is on the way down, anyway, and you've approached management with your concerns and they tell you to sod off,' he added. Some fund managers expressed disappointment that they are not to be given a greater role in approving what are seen as some of the most contentious aspects of board policy. Those include directors' remuneration and selection of external auditors. Shareholders also expressed disappointment that the committee had not recommended legislation to make clear that auditors have a duty of care to shareholders, thus overturning the Caparo decision. In it, the House of Lords ruled that auditors had a duty of care only to managements and to shareholders generally - a view that effectively prevents individual shareholders from seeking restitution from an auditor over a faulty report. Shareholders noted that the desire for consensus had clearly forced the committee to water down some proposals that they had wanted most.</p>

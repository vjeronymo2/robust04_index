			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brunei still sits cosily in its Shell - A longstanding relationship that suits both parties EARLY THIS century two intrepid British geologists were cycling along a path near the coast in Brunei, on the west of the island of Borneo. They paused for a rest. Then one uttered the magic words: 'I smell oil'. Brunei has never looked back. The economy of the tiny sultanate is a relatively simple affair. At present it produces 182,000 barrels of oil a day. Exports of crude in 1990, the last year for which official figures are available, were worth Brunei Dollars 2.02bn (Dollars 1.27bn). Liquefied natural gas exports were worth a similar amount. Vast savings have accumulated over the years. The secretive Brunei Investment Agency is believed to control a Dollars 35bn portfolio of international investments, the income from which is now estimated to contribute more to the government's coffers than revenues from oil and gas combined. Brunei's 270,000 people have one of the highest per capita incomes in the world. Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, now celebrating 25 years of absolute rule, is generally regarded as the world's richest individual, with a personal fortune estimated at Dollars 37bn. The Sultan and the Royal Dutch/Shell group, in Brunei since early this century, are the two main focuses of attention in Brunei. Shell has a monopoly on Brunei's oil and gas exports. There is very little other industry in the country. The Shell group is by far the country's biggest employer - apart from the government, which employs about 50 per cent of the labour force. Shell is reluctant to discuss amounts of revenue from its local operations. But Singapore-based oil industry analysts estimate that Brunei contributes about 10 per cent of the Shell group's overall world-wide profits. The company now has seven offshore oil fields in Brunei and two onshore. It  -and Brunei - have been fortunate that oil discoveries have tended to coincide with the oil price rise shocks of the last 20 years. Oil analysts say that exploration technology now being used in Brunei is among the most advanced in the world: using three dimensional seismic exploration techniques finds have been made under existing oil fields. In recent years the Brunei government has been stressing the need to conserve resources. 'This year Shell has successfully pressed the Brunei government for an increase in oil production so as to recoup the recent investments it has made in high technology exploration,' says an industry analyst. 'Next year production will probably fall back to 150,000-160,000 b/d and at that rate Brunei has about 25 years' reserves of oil and about 40 years' reserves of gas.' Gas has been Brunei's big success story. Twenty years ago, Shell built in Brunei what was then the world's biggest LNG processing plant. Gas is piped from fields more than 30 km (18 miles) offshore and cooled at the plant until it liquefies. It is then loaded on to LNG carriers and transported to Japan. The Brunei plant has produced more than 90m tonnes of LNG over the past 20 years. Apart from domestic consumption, all LNG is purchased by three Japanese companies: Tokyo Electric (the world's biggest private electricity utility), Tokyo Gas and Osaka Gas. LNG exports to Japan have been made under a 20-year contract that runs out at the end of March next year. Another 20-year contract is being negotiated, but there have been considerable problems. The seven LNG ships that transport the gas to Japan are owned jointly by Shell and the Brunei government. At one stage the Japanese wanted a whole fleet of new tankers - no small request with each ship costing around Dollars 300m. The prices of LNG exports to Japan are determined by a complex formula based on average prices of Japanese imported crude and referred to in the trade as 'The Japan Crude Cocktail'. There continues to be arguments over price. Shell says talks are at a crucial stage with no clear sign of when agreement can be reached. Industry analysts say Brunei has the upper hand: the country has established itself as a reliable, long-term supplier and about 14 per cent of Japan's total LNG imports come from the sultanate. Japan wants to import more - if the Japanese do not buy then Korea is a ready market. All Shell's operations in Brunei have a 50 per cent government shareholding. Mitsubishi, the Japanese conglomerate, has 25 per cent stakes in LNG processing and transport operations. Most industry analysts see the Brunei/Shell relationship continuing. But others are eager to enter. Elf Aquitaine has formed a partnership with a local company believed to be controlled by Prince Jufri, the Sultan's younger brother and minister of finance. Elf has found oil but it is believed to be in fields that either stretch into Malaysian waters or into adjacent Shell areas. The present sultan and his advisers have pressed for a greater share of profits from the Shell operations. Analysts feel the government has been clever in its handling of the oil giant: it has not threatened to nationalise but by taking a 50 per cent stake in all operations, it has been able to exert a large degree of control. For its part Shell is very careful to obey various government edicts. Official requirements on employing large numbers of Brunei Malay people rather than Chinese or others have led to serious staff shortage difficulties. For all its economic clout, Shell makes sure it is not seen to be interfering in any of Brunei's internal affairs. 'No one outside really knows the exact terms of the contract between Brunei and Shell,' says an industry analyst. 'But one thing is certain - it's very good for Shell and good for Brunei as well.'</p>

			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Tupe 'applies to one-person task' The contracting-out of services performed by just one employee is covered by the European Union's transfer of undertakings rules, according to a preliminary opinion of the European Court of Justice. The opinion of Advocate General Walter Van Gerven in the Schmidt case - that the European Acquired Rights Directive can apply to the contracting-out of cleaning services performed by one cleaner - has significant implications for the UK government's flagship policy on the contracting-out of public-sector services. The directive, which was translated into UK law by the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 1981, known by the acronym Tupe, protects the jobs and conditions of employees when the undertaking they work for changes hands. New employers must take over all existing contracts of employment, consult with unions and honour collective agreements. Confusion over whether Tupe applied to contracting-out has thrown the government's compulsory competitive tendering and market-testing programmes into confusion. The advocate general's opinion follows the approach taken by the European Court in an earlier case involving the contracting-out by Philips, the Dutch electronics company, of a staff canteen. But the court said whether the transfer rules applied to a particular service was a question for national courts. Mr Van Gerven said cleaning services were an economic activity to which the directive applied and the fact that an activity was carried out by only one person did not prevent the rules applying. He reiterated that for there to be a transfer the service had to form an indentifiable 'economic entity' which existed either independently or as part of a greater organisation. Although the advocate general's opinion is not binding on the court it is likely to be followed by the European judges when they come to deliver their judgment in the summer. Contractors said yesterday they were becoming resigned to the idea that Tupe was capable of broad application to contracting-out. In August last year the English Employment Appeal Tribunal caused fresh confusion by upholding an industrial tribunal ruling that there was no transfer when the contract for cleaning Orsett Hospital in Essex came to an end and a new contract was awarded to a different contractor. This decision, which contradicts the approach taken by the European Court, will be heard by the Court of Appeal in June.</p>

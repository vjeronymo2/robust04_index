			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S PLAN FOR VOYAGE TO MARS  </P> <P> Has that man in The White House lost his marbles? Is he totally out of control?  With the drug situation, and the uncounted homeless in this country without  shelter, George Bush is talking about spending billions of dollars on a space  program to plant the American flag on Mars on July 20, 2019 (Part A, May 12).  </P> <P> I don't believe what I'm hearing! The students at his commencement address at  the Texas A&amp;I University in Kingsville, Texas, must have been more aware of  the deplorable conditions of the world than a President who can so blithely  ignore reality and discuss the spending of those billions of dollars on the  improbable. President Bush is too much out in space and needs to come back to  Earth and to reality.  </P> <P> JACK P. GABRIEL  </P> <P> Carson  </P></p>

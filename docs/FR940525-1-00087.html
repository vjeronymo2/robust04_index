			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (iii) The claim may indicate that it is consistent with ``Nutrition and Your Health: Dietary Guidelines for Americans.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) The claim may include information on the number of people in the United States who have cancer. The source of this information must be identified, and it must be current information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Model health claims. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The following model health claims may be used in food labeling to characterize the relationship between substances in diets low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables and cancer: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Low fat diets rich in fruits and vegetables (foods that are low in fat and may contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C) may reduce the risk of some types of cancer, a disease associated with many factors. Broccoli is high in vitamins A and C, and it is a good source of dietary fiber. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Development of cancer depends on many factors. Eating a diet low in fat and high in fruits and vegetables, foods that are low in fat and may contain vitamin A, vitamin C and dietary fiber, may reduce your risk of some cancers. Oranges, a food low in fat, are a good source of fiber and vitamin C. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Folate and neural tube defects <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> _(1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Relationship between folate and neural tube defects. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) Neural tube defects are serious birth defects of the brain or spinal cord that can result in infant mortality or serious disability. The birth defects anencephaly and spina bifida are the most common forms of neural tube defects and account for about 90 percent of these defects. These defects result from failure of closure of the covering of the brain or spinal cord during early embryonic development. Because the neural tube forms and closes during early pregnancy, the defect may occur before a woman realizes that she is pregnant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The available data show that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. The strongest evidence for this relationship comes from an intervention study by the Medical Research Council of the United Kingdom that showed that women at risk of recurrence of a neural tube defect pregnancy who consumed a supplement containing 4 mg (4,000 micrograms (mcg)) folic acid daily had a reduced risk of having a child with a neural tube defect. (Products that contain this level of folic acid are drugs.) In addition, based on its review of a Hungarian intervention trial that used a multivitamin and multimineral preparation containing 800 mcg (0.8 mg) of folic acid, and its review of the observational studies that reported use of multivitamins containing 0 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid, FDA concluded that most of these studies had results consistent with the conclusion that folate, at levels attainable in usual diets, may reduce the risk of neural tube defects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Significance of folate. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) Neural tube defects occur in approximately 0.6 of 1,000 live births in the United States (i.e., about 2,500 cases among 4 million live births annually). Neural tube defects are believed to be caused by many factors. The single greatest risk factor for a neural tube defect-affected pregnancy is a personal or family history of a pregnancy affected with such a defect. However, about 90 percent of infants with a neural tube defect are born to women who do not have a family history of these defects. The available evidence shows that diets adequate in folate may reduce the risk of neural tube defects but not of other birth defects. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Prevalence rates for neural tube defects have been reported to vary with a wide range of factors, including genetics, geography, socioeconomic status, maternal birth cohort, month of conception, race, nutrition, and maternal age and reproductive history. Women with a close relative (i.e., sibling, niece, nephew) with a neural tube defect, those with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and women with seizure disorders who are being treated with valproic acid or carbamazepine are at significantly increased risk compared with women without these characteristics. Rates for neural tube defects vary within the United States, with lower rates observed on the west coast than on the east coast. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Based on a synthesis of the results of several observational studies, the Public Health Service has estimated that about 50 percent of neural tube defect-affected pregnancies in the United States (e.g., about 1,250) may be averted annually if all women consume adequate amounts of folate daily (i.e., 0.4 mg) throughout their childbearing years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (i) All requirements set forth in &sect;381.414 shall be met. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Specific requirements. (A)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Nature of the claim. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A health claim associating folate with reduced risk of neural tube defects may be made on the label or labeling of a poultry product described in paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section;  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Provided, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  That: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) In specifying the nutrient, the claim shall use the terms ``folate,'' ``folic acid,'' ``folacin,'' ``folate, a B vitamin,'' ``folic acid, a B vitamin,'' or ``folacin, a B vitamin''; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) In specifying the health-related condition, the claim shall identify the birth defects as ``neural tube defects,'' ``birth defects, spina bifida, or anencephaly,'' ``birth defects of the brain or spinal cord anencephaly or spina bifida,'' or ``spina bifida or anencephaly, birth defects of the brain or spinal cord''; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The claim shall state that neural tube defects have many causes and shall not imply that folate intake is the only recognized risk factor for neural tube defects; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) In specifying the prevalence of neural tube defects among women in the general population, the claim shall state that such birth defects ``which, while not widespread, are extremely significant'' or ``*&blank;*&blank;*&blank;birth defects *&blank;*&blank;* that, while not widespread, are extremely significant.''; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) The claim shall not attribute any specific degree of reduction in risk of neural tube defects, including mention of the Public Health Service estimate that 50 percent of neural tube defects may be averted annually, to maintaining an adequate folate intake throughout the childbearing years. The claim shall state that some women may reduce their risk of a neural tube defect pregnancy by maintaining adequate intakes of folic acid during their childbearing years; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

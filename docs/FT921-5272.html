			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / World Trade News: US group wins Kuwait refinery repair deal KUWAIT has awarded Foster Wheeler of the US a contract worth an estimated Dollars 47m (Pounds 26.7m) to manage refurbishment of its three war-damaged oil refineries. The contract is the first formally awarded to repair the Mina Abdullah, Mina al Ahmadi and Shuaiba refineries, where early ad hoc repairs have so far been undertaken under the auspices of Bechtel of California. Foster Wheeler, which beat strong competition from Fluor Daniel and Brown &amp; Root to win the deal, will undertake detailed damage assessment and offer consultancy services for overall repair of the three plants, an exercise expected to cost Dollars 2bn overall, in the next two years. Mr Homoud al Rqobah, Kuwait oil minister, said recently the repair work would include an element of upgrading all three refineries. The three at present produce a total 270,000 b/d (170,000 b/d from Mina Al Ahmadi and 100,000 b/d from Mina Abdulla) of a pre-war capacity of over 700,000 b/d. It is hoped capacity will reach 650,000 b/d by next year.</p>

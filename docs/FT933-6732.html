			<p>930826 FT  26 AUG 93 / Beach owner sues over pollution by sewage THE OWNER of a north Devon beach is seeking damages of Pounds 1m from South West Water for allegedly dumping raw sewage into the sea. Mr Mike Saltmarsh, owner of Croyde Bay, says he is losing business because when the wind blows from the west sewage is deposited on the beach from an outfall. Mr John Major, the prime minister, met a delegation of west country MPs earlier this summer following concern about the high level of charges levied by South West Water. In a letter to the MPs he suggested that the way to solve the problem of higher bills was for the postponement of some expensive schemes to improve the sewage outfalls to the sea. South West Water has argued that it has to raise charges because it has inherited an old sewerage system which needs substantial investment. Lengthening and modernising the outfall at Croyde Bay is not due to go ahead until the next century. Solicitors for Mr Saltmarsh yesterday issued proceedings in the High Court for his claim for damages and an application for injunctions against the water company. Last year Mr Saltmarsh, who has a holiday development business at the beach, was refused a 'blue flag' environment rating for the beach, specifically because of the pollution, his solicitors said. He had been left with 'no alternative' but to claim damages, estimated to exceed Pounds 1m, against the company. The move was supported by the Cornwall-based Surfers Against Sewage pressure group. Mr Chris Hines said: 'At present the sewage is discharged within a few hundred yards of the beach, from where it drifts back on to the beach.' South West Water said it had received a letter from Mr Saltmarsh's solicitors and would respond. A screening plant to stop debris such as condoms entering bathing waters had recently been installed on the outfall. The National Rivers Authority said that bathing waters at Croyde had consistently passed mandatory European Community standards.</p>

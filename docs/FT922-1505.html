			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Union split with TUC averted A THREATENED split between the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union and the Trades Union Congress has been averted after the union's electrical wing called off a proposed merger with a union representing airline cabin crew. The TUC had told the union that the merger would be against its rules because the airline union, Cabin Crew 89, was a breakaway from a union affiliated to the TUC. The issue had clouded already complicated negotiations over the future affiliation of the AEEU to the TUC. The AEEU was formed last month through the merger of the AEU engineering union, which is affiliated to the TUC, and the EETPU electricians' union, which was expelled in 1988. The electricians had hoped to press ahead with the merger in spite of objections from the TUC. Mr Gavin Laird, AEEU general secretary, has now written to the TUC saying the merger will not go ahead. However, the negotiations are not yet assured of a successful outcome. Mr Laird has said that the AEEU will not agree to demands from unions affiliated to the TUC that the EETPU give up members it signed from other unions before it merged with the AEU. Among unions with grievances is Ucatt, the construction workers' union. The EETPU claims to have recruited more than 10,000 of Ucatt's members during the last year. However, Ucatt says the actual figure is much less than that.</p>

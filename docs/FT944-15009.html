			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Leading Article: East needs west The collapse of the Soviet system was a victory for those who argue that market forces create a more efficient, dynamic and creative economy than centralised commands. But the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) observes in its first Transition Report that, despite some successes, much remains to be done if that victory - now irreversible - is to be fully exploited. The central European countries that took harsh measures to restore macro-economic stability and backed them up with privatisation, legal, banking and other institutional reforms are already emerging from recession with much more efficient and productive economies. In others, notably Russia, performance remains mixed. There privatisation has moved ahead, but the reforms needed to stabilise the economy remain seriously incomplete. Ukraine is on the starting block, while in the war-torn Caucasus the economic base has been largely destroyed and energies have yet to be focused on reform. Much has been achieved by the governments and the 450m people who live and work in the 25 countries surveyed by the EBRD. But the review is also right to call on wealthy states, which already have functioning market economies, to help the reinte-gration of the transitional economies into the network of global trade and investment. As the report makes clear, the record of the European Union in this respect leaves much to be desired. Mired in recession for the past three years and still digesting the Maastricht treaty, the EU has approached trade negotiations with nit-picking narrowness. It has also been far too ready to impose anti-dumping and other restraints on trade in 'sensitive' products, such as steel, textiles and processed foods, which make up the bulk of exports from central Europe. The countries in transition desperately need easier access to EU markets, and the higher foreign investment this would attract, to offset the unemployment caused by the restructuring of their obsolete Soviet-style economic systems. Without freer access for their exports and more investment, it may prove impossible for countries in the region to achieve the east Asian levels of growth needed to narrow the gap between living standards on both sides of Europe. Five years after the collapse of communism, the EBRD's review underlines how slow western Europe has been in rethinking the future shape of a wider Europe. Such changes to western thinking and institutions are essential if western Europe is to seize the opportunities offered by the large potential markets and cost-effective labour on its doorstep.</p>

			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / London Stock Exchange: BOC wanted Chemicals group BOC was marked up in early trading ahead of half-year results next week. The firmness was maintained as several securities houses reiterated buy recommendations. The shares recorded a net rise of 17 to 693p following recent underperformance. However, the turnover of 1.3m shares was unremarkable and most of the rise was attributed to marketmakers covering short positions following buy orders on Thursday. That squeeze on the stock was consolidated as SG Warburg changed its stance to hold from 'long term reduce', arguing that profits could be as much as Pounds 185m after Pounds 162.7m last time, and NatWest reiterated its buy stance.</p>

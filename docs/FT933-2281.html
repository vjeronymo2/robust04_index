			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Publicans take row over leases to European stage PUBLICANS involved in a long-running campaign against the terms of their leases from Inntrepreneur Estates, the joint venture between Grand Metropolitan and Courage, are taking the dispute to the European Commission. The publicans, backed by the National Association of Inntrepreneur Lessees (Nail), say they are trying to block an attempt by Inntrepreneur to win an exemption from EC regulations on anti-competitive practices. This would allow Inntrepreneur to keep the tie which obliges 4,350 of its 6,830 pubs to buy their beer from Courage. Inntrepreneur said yesterday it hoped to win the exemption by the end of this year. Mrs Tricia Boyes, Nail's chairwoman, said yesterday that publicans buying their beer from Courage were paying Pounds 70 extra for each 36-gallon barrel of beer. Mrs Boyes said about 400 publicans had written individually to the Commission, and Nail had also sent a report on the issue to Brussels. It is meeting a senior official at the DTI on Thursday. Inntrepreneur said leaseholders' rent was discounted to reflect the fact that publicans had to buy their beer from Courage. It also noted that all pubs in the group would be freed of the tie in 1998. Nail's appeal to the Commission is the latest salvo in its campaign against the pub-leasing scheme. In March executives from Inntrepreneur were cross-examined by the Commons agriculture committee. Three months later the Department of Trade and Industry said it was investigating the scheme.</p>

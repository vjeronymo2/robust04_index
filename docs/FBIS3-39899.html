			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Paris, Feb 24 (AFP) -- French Defence Minister  Francois Leotard Thursday [24 February] called on the United  Nations to act "as fast as possible" to reopen the northern  Bosnian airport of Tuzla.    Tuzla airport, closed since May 1992, is surrounded by Serb  forces who have refused to allow UN humanitarian flights into  the Muslem-held city from where aid could be dispatched to other  people in the northeast of the country.    Reopening of Tuzla airport "had to follow immediately in the  steps of the Sarajevo operation," Leotard told France Inter  radio station, speaking of this month's North Atlantic Treaty  Organisation (NATO) ultimatum to force Bosnian Serbs to withdraw  heavy weapons from around the besieged Bosnian capital.    "Everything has to follow up immediately on the Sarajevo  ultimatum" even if force has to be used, the minister also said.    NATO has also called for the reopening of Tuzla airport, but  so far has refrained from issuing an ultimatum to the Serbs in  this respect.    The UN has indicated it hoped the airport might be opened to  humanitarian flights in March.</p>

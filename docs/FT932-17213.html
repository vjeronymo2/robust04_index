			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE SUCCESSFUL auction of UK government gilts enlivened Footsie futures, sending the June contract sharply forward to trade above the 2,900 level for the first time in recent sessions, writes Joel Kibazo. A strong advance seemed likely when the June contract on the FT-SE 100 opened at 2,885, up 6 points from the previous day's close. But for a momentary decline as a leading house came in with a big sell order, June moved ahead and reached the day's peak of 2,913 in late morning, following the successful outcome of the gilts auction. The sharp move was also said to have pulled the cash market higher. Trading continued at the higher levels for the next few hours before a combination of profit-taking, the suspension of trading in Queens Moat Houses and the tentative opening on Wall Street led it to come off the top. It finished at 2,900, a rise of 21 from the previous close, and 11 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 11 points. Turnover improved from recent days, reaching 8,961 lots. Volume in traded options also increased, closing at 25,248, of which 10,532 was in the FT-SE 100 option and 1,207 in the Euro FT-SE. Among stock options, British Airways traded 1,593 contracts and Barclays followed at 1,286. A trade by Kleinwort Benson in Land Securities just before the market close saw it end with a total of 1,144 lots dealt.</p>

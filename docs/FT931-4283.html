			<p>930311 FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (2): Every project tells a story - By failing to plan, many managers are planning to fail / A look at the importance of project management EVERY PROJECT, like a story, has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Geoff Reiss, in his entertaining book, Project Management Demystified, gives a simple definition: 'A project is a human activity that achieves a clear objective against a time scale.' According to Jim Mackay, the large projects adviser at CMG, there are three common ingredients to every project: its transient nature, the need to build and motivate a team, and the fact that at the end of the day, that team will be disbanded. 'Project management is by definition concerned with the management of change,' he says. 'Any project needs to balance three elements: time-scales, cost and quality: these could apply to anything from building the channel tunnel to mounting a play.' The Project Managers' Association, set up 25 years ago, grew from the construction industry, which now only accounts for 40 per cent of its members: another 40 per cent are in information technology (IT). The group is working on a certification process for project managers. The publication, Project Management Today, which regularly reviews software packages in depth, suggests a broader scope, with readers in IT, finance, pharmaceuticals, food, and aerospace, as well as civil engineering. The scope of project management (PM) packages is widening in tune with this development. According to the US Software Publishing Association, there was a 63 per cent growth in PM software sales 1991-92. At a time when computer shows are failing, 'Project Management 93,' (March 23-24), has increased its floorspace at the Novotel, Hammersmith. As the following selection of stories shows, there is a wide variety of applications, and at the lower PC and Mac end of the marketplace, user friendliness is more important than some traditional PM features. Tony Brady, program manager for Microsoft's Project (see Oxford Training story, page 10) had the job of 'localising' Project for worldwide use. Project is thought to have about half the PC PM marketplace, and 70 per cent of Windows-based market. Tony Brady sees the typical Project user as a mid-range professional with 100-200 tasks to manage - 'Some people do use it daily, but the tremendous growth potential is in helping people who need something occasionally to help plan their work.' For that reason Brady concentrated on integrating Project with other applications, such as electronic mail, and on making it user friendly. It is surprising how few companies interviewed used electronic mail or 'groupware' as an integral part of their communications. Clive Holtham, professor of Information Management at the City University Business School and author of a report on workgroups, sees this area as a threat to traditional vendors. 'The emerging generation of groupware applications could threaten them, because it's a better overall fit to the complex business of project management.' 'Attack the risks before they attack you,' sums up the motivation for most people using PM packages. But consultant Noel Eden has developed a non-computerised project management, called Risk Analysis Methodology. Packages, he says, are not always the answer because they do not adapt to experience. Geoff Reiss, who is directing a series of seminars at the PM 93 exhibition, hopes to convince senior managers of the need to use scheduling techniques - 'by failing to plan, so many of them are planning to fail,' he says.

The following is a list of project management buzzwords: Project management (PM) software is used to schedule resources to achieve an objective within set time-scales, quality, and cost. Graphics are an important element in showing members of the team their responsibilities and how they interact with others. Gantt charts: originated by Henri Gantt in France at the start of the century, the Gantt chart provides a pictorial representation of the start and finish of various activities on a project and how they overlap. 'Gantts,' as they are called, do not show specific dependencies, but they provide a framework for timescale. Network diagram, on the other hand is a generic term encompassing critical path analysis, Pert, (project evaluation and review technique), and critical path method logic. A network diagram shows main activities and dependencies, although not necessarily on a timescale. There are two main methods: activity on arrow, (connecting nodes which denote events) and precedence, using boxes to denote activities and arrows to denote dependencies. The resource profile estimates resources plotted to a timescale. Critical path analysis - cpa - defines those activities which if delayed, cause a knock-on effect, delaying the entire project. Others not on the critical path carry some 'float' or 'slack' meaning that they can be started later without impacting the overall timescale. For example, the critical path for office block is design and installation of lifts; in aircraft design it's the undercarriage. Auto-scheduling allows the software-users to take all activities and resources and automatically plot them on a timescale to produce a Gantt chart, defining start and end dates. (A dangerous facility in which to place too much faith, say some). Time collection: a process of collecting and analysing time-sheets for accurate project control (monitoring of progress) and cost-control. The process can be speeded by networking and 'forms' facilities, either on paper or via electronic mail. It is often integrated with accounting to bill for the work, translating effort into cost. Risk management - there are qualitative and quantitive methods for analysis and management of risks in projects, such as the use of unfamiliar technology. This is usually part of an integrated quality plan.</p>

			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil market consolidates its gains THE OIL market consolidated its gains yesterday after Wednesday's rally with the price of North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery up 15 cents at Dollars 18.45 a barrel. Some traders believe the market could have reached a bottom after its recent weakness, but there is unlikely to be a strong recovery in price until the market sees evidence of actual production cuts made by members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 'It's too premature to say the market has bottomed, but I think it has stopped going down for a while,' said Mr Andrew LeBow, market analyst at ED &amp; F. Man, the international trading house in New York. Strength returned to the crude market on Wednesday after Nigeria announced it would make a 10 per cent cut in its oil output. Lagos has found difficulty in selling its crude recently and had sold several cargoes on a cut-price basis. Nigeria said yesterday its cut in oil output would be effective from the beginning of next year and not immediately as some traders had thought on Wednesday night. This had a slight dampening effect on the market, but price still managed to push upwards. The market was further strengthened by the American Petroleum Institute's weekly report on Tuesday night which showed that US oil refineries had cut their production runs by 500,000 barrels of oil a day. Refineries had been producing a lot of oil products that had built up as stocks while demand remained low. These stocks had, in turn, depressed crude prices.</p>

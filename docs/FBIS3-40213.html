			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [English abstract of article by Pu Jian and Ye Zong-hai of </F> the Center for Space Science and Applied Research, CAS, Beijing  100080; MS received 18 Feb 93]    [Text] The energy deposits in critical volumes of  integrated chips produced by some radiated particles in Feng  Yun-1 (B) satellite environment are analyzed. This is called  linear energy translation (LET). We have obtained the LET of  Galactic Cosmic-Ray components 1  Z  28, Galactic  Cosmic-Ray  anomaly components (C, N, O, Ne, Ar, Fe), and inner  radiation-belt protons. And single-event upset (SEU) ratios  produced by these particles are calculated, respectively.</p>

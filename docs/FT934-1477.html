			<p>931218 FT  18 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Unilever identifies new joint chairman Mr Niall FitzGerald, the Irish-born head of Unilever's detergents operations, emerged yesterday as the heir-apparent to Mr Michael Perry as joint chairman of the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products group. Mr FitzGerald, 48, will become a vice chairman of Unilever in May. A year later he will join the 'special committee', Unilever's most senior management body, whose other members are the group's joint chairmen. Appointment to the special committee has long been viewed as preparation for the top job. Mr Perry is due to retire after four years as chairman in May 1996, when he will be 62. If Mr FitzGerald succeeds him, he will be one of youngest chairmen in Unilever's 63-year history and will also be the first not to be born British or Dutch. The group also confirmed yesterday that Mr Morris Tabaksblat, currently third member of the special committee, will succeed Mr Floris Maljers, who retires in May after 10 years as the group's Dutch chairman. Mr Tabaksblat, aged 56, has played a leading role in reorganising Unilever's food businesses in the past few years and was closely involved in the late 1980s in acquiring US cosmetics companies, including Chesebrough-Ponds, Elizabeth Arden and Faberge. Mr FitzGerald, who joined Unilever in 1967, is an accountant by training who has spent much of his career in financial posts. In 1990, he was made responsible for all Unilever's food activities in northern Europe, and the following year was put in charge of the worldwide detergents side, which has annual sales of about Pounds 6bn.</p>

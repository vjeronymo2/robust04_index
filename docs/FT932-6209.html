			<p>930529 FT  29 MAY 93 / Claims ruling satisfies Names and Lloyd's LLOYD'S of London and 113 Names - individuals whose assets support the insurance market - both claimed victory following a Court of Appeal ruling yesterday. The case, heard by Sir Thomas Bingham, Master of the Rolls, involved the rights of Names to recover directly claims on personal stop-loss insurance policies - personal reinsurance which covers heavy losses. Lloyd's appealed against an original judgment by Mr Justice Tuckey, made in March. He ruled that claims under the stop-loss policies should be paid directly to Names rather than to the premium trust funds, which contain premium income earned by Lloyd's underwriters from insurance business. The appeal court upheld part of Mr Justice Tuckey's original judgment but said claims under stop-loss policies could not be paid directly to Names where these policies had been irrevocably assigned by letter or policy wording to the trust funds. It also ruled that monies paid into premium trust funds for the purposes of establishing solvency for the 1991 year could not be returned to Names. Mr Michael Freeman, the solicitor who represented the 113 Names in the case, said the decision was of 'very great importance' to many Names who 'will now be able to pay the recoveries to the banks and insurance companies who gave guarantees to Lloyd's and are now threatening the homes and farms of Names'. Mr Freeman said the ruling would help another group of Names who are seeking direct access to tax rebates paid earlier this year by the US tax authorities. Lloyd's said that the ruling would bring 'a substantial benefit to its solvency'. It said policies which assign any claims irrevocably to the premium trust funds were increasingly common.

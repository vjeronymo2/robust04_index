			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: France makes war on Hollywood FRANCE yesterday stepped up the campaign to prevent what it sees as an American attempt to use the Gatt world trade negotiations to swamp Europe with Hollywood films. Announcing yesterday an extra FFr50m (Pounds 5.7m) in aid to encourage film-making in France, Mr Jacques Toubon, France's culture minister, also warned in an interview with Le Figaro that if a Gatt agreement were to cover the cinema, the French government 'will not sign it'. France is not threatening to veto Gatt over the cinema, as it is over agriculture, and would probably allow itself to be outvoted on any audiovisual deal. But Mr Toubon's statements inject a sharper note of cultural animosity into its relationship with the US, already strained over agriculture. Complaining that US films like Jurassic Park were already taking too large a slice of the French cinema market, the minister said Gatt's principle of non-discrimination would make it impossible for France to keep its regular FFr1.3bn a year subsidy for the making of French films and its requirement that French broadcasters air 60 per cent EC-made films. Paris argues that Europe must keep audiovisual trade outside Gatt by claiming a total 'exception' for it. But the European Commission says that by including audiovisual products, while insisting on the 'specificity' of this sensitive cultural area, the EC would be better placed to defend broadcasting legislation, as well as tougher national provisions, from unilateral US attack in the future. Lisa Bransten adds from Washington: Sir Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in charge of trade, said yesterday Europe and the US would lose all credibility with other Gatt members if they could not reach agreement and conclude the Uruguay Round by the December 15 deadline.</p>

			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / Financial Reporting Council willing to adopt audit board THE FINANCIAL Reporting Council would be willing to consider taking responsibility for auditing as well as accounting standards, its chairman said yesterday. Sir Ron Dearing said he would consider bringing the Auditing Practices Board under the council's umbrella if the accountancy profession so wished. Pressure has been growing for removal of the board from ownership of the Consultative Committee of Accountancy Bodies, the consortium of the six leading accountancy professional bodies. The council already controls the Accounting Standards Board and urgent issues task force, which set new standards, and the Financial Reporting Review Panel, which polices them. The council was established to replace and enhance work on improving financial reporting led by the Accounting Standards Committee, which was controlled by the accountancy profession. Sir Ron emphasised that the council was a new body that could not sustain many new responsibilities over the next year. But he said: 'I am not making a pitch, but in the longer term, if it was the wish of others, we would provide a constructive response.' Mr Bill Morrison, APB chairman, said recently he was willing to consider the board becoming independent of the profession, but stressed that it had many non-professional members and was not impeded by its existing ownership. Mr John Roques, senior partner of Touche Ross, recently said that public confidence in accounting could be restored only by removing audit standard-setting and regulation and the development of ethical codes from the profession. Ernst &amp; Young has also called for a change in the regulatory regime.</p>

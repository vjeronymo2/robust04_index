The  agency is a government body that is in charge of restructuring  the state-owned companies and certain public corporations.    In an interview granted to one of our correspondents, Mr.  Mircea Cosea, chairman of Romania's Council for Economic  Coordination, Strategy, and Reform, emphasized that one has to  do away with the conception that economic restructuring merely  means the closing down of companies and the growth of  unemployment, as that process may also have positive effects by  reviving certain large companies that are very important for the  economy to adapt to the new market economy structures.    By a decision of the Prime Minister [Nicolae Vacaroiu],  University Professor Dr. Dumitru Dan Popescu was appointed head  of the new Agency for Restructuring. Until now, Popescu was  holding the office of counselor of the minister of finance.    Cosea also mentioned the fact that work has already begun to  transform the property vouchers into shares and, thus, establish  a stock exchange that will act as a source of capital, as well  as moral support for both the respective companies and the  shareholders. The first privatization actions to be implemented  in the first month of the year will refer to branches that have  not been targeted until now, such as social work, scientific  research, and local administration, Cosea added.</p>

			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Proton beats forecast as profits rise to MDollars 408m PERUSAHAAN Otomobil Nasional (Proton), Malaysia's national carmaker, hoisted after-tax profits by 39 per cent to MDollars 259.38m (USDollars 103.75m) for the year to March 31 from MDollars 187.02m a year earlier, agencies report. The company said it expected an increase in after-tax profit for the current year. Pre-tax profit jumped 56 per cent to MDollars 407.88m from MDollars 261.47m, while turnover advanced 23 per cent to MDollars 2.19bn from MDollars 1.79bn, following plant improvement and support from its local and overseas dealers. Proton, which was listed last March, plans to produce 107,000 units this year, up from 102,000 in 1991. The pre-tax profit exceeded the MDollars 406.6m forecast in its share offer prospectus. Much of the surge in pre-tax profit resulted from the company's relief from deferred foreign-exchange losses, which had been fully amortised in the last financial year. In that year, Proton spent MDollars 130m to pay off the exchange losses. An improvement in the output of its car plant and strong demand from its distributors also helped boost profit, Proton said. Proton, which is 17 per cent owned by companies in Japan's Mitsubishi group, builds variants of a passenger car model based on the Mitsubishi Lancer.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Survey of Japan (10): Nintendo versus Sega - A world war rages over electronic games sales A VISIT to Nintendo's head office in Kyoto belies its position as the world's leading supplier of youth entertainment. The modest premises could belong to any family-run Japanese company, the atmosphere is formal and restrained. Despite generating multi-million dollar sales, the impression is of a company that has not lost touch with its roots as a manufacturer of playing cards. The public face of Sega - its arch-rival in the battle for the hearts, minds and leisure time of a generation - is rather different. At its modern office complex in suburban Tokyo, visitors are not plied with green tea from china cups but with Coke from a vending machine. The fast cars and motor bikes parked outside reflect a corporate culture in line with its reputation as the Young Turk of the video entertainment business. The difference between the two companies also runs to industrial strategy. Nintendo has made a conscious decision to keep its overheads low, so most manufacturing is contracted to outside suppliers. Despite being Japan's third largest company measured by profits, Nintendo has fewer than 900 employees. It resembles a management company, co-ordinating its empire through a network of licensed subcontractors. That reflects the low-cost philosophy of Mr Hiroshi Yamauchi, the company's president. In a new, volatile market such as video entertainment he believes Nintendo should be able to respond quickly. It would thus be unwise for the company to follow motor manufacturers, for example, by building expensive production facilities. Sega has taken a more conventional approach. It employs 800 in research and development alone, out of a total workforce in Japan of 3,500. Most of the games played on Sega machines have been designed by the company itself, rather than outside companies working under licence. The unanswered question is which company will be able to capture the new technologies - such as more CD-based entertainment systems which can handle much more information than conventional software cartridges - which look certain to transform the market. Nintendo is taking a relaxed, self-confident approach to new technology. It argues that the full potential of cartridge-based systems, running on the latest 16-bit games computers, has yet to be exploited by games designers. Until that happens, it sees no need to rush into other formats. 'Other areas of art and entertainment prove that the drive for technological change always comes from the makers of software - the artists. That has been true of areas such as cinema. I believe it is also true of this business,' commented Mr Masayuki Uemura, general manager of Nintendo's research and development. He argues that the new technologies will not necessarily allow games designers and software engineers, the artists of the video entertainment business, to produce better games. The companies now investing vast sums in development may thus be disappointed. It is certainly true that Nintendo's 8-bit Family Computer, on which its dominance of the market rests, was hardly state of the art when it was launched 10 years ago. But the machine was sufficiently powerful to test the software engineers and chea priced low enough to sell. NEITHER Nintendo nor Sega expects to make large profits from selling the hardware itself. The games consoles are simply the medium by which a continuing market for new games is created. Having bought a Nintendo system the consumer is locked into buying games from the same source. Unless new technology is priced low enough to sell in volume, there is no hope of creating a lucrative mass market for software. The argument is logical. But outside investors have their doubts. Nintendo's shares peaked against the Japanese stock market in 1990, while Sega has continued to rise. Sega was first to launch a more powerful 16-bit games computer - its Megadrive system - which allowed the company to win market share from Nintendo. Sega now has 40 per cent of the market in the US and Europe. Sega has adopted a typically aggressive policy towards new technology, forming joint ventures with companies ranging from IBM and Pioneer to Time Warner and W Industries - a small British company which specialises in virtual reality products. Sega's ambitions run well beyond video games. 'We will expand the market with these alliances. By collaborating in CD-ROM technology, for example, we will be able to introduce elements of publishing or education into our products,' said Mr Hideki Sato, director of R&amp;D at Sega. By pursuing its ambitions in so many areas, Sega is running risks of its own. Other areas of consumer electronics have been blighted by the inability of manufacturers to agree on common standards. There must be a danger of the same thing happening again. The giants of consumer electronics are pouring resources into CD-ROM technology and not all will be successful. Mr Sato admits it may take 10 years before an industry standard CD-ROM is established. But he believes Sega's best chance of being among the winners lies in getting its products to market first. For the time being Nintendo seems content to let Sega make the running. The risk facing Nintendo is that a competitor using proprietory technology - possibly Sega, but perhaps 3DO of the US - will develop a system which is a quantum leap not just in technological prowess but also in entertainment value. Should that happen Nintendo believes it will be able to get access to new technology, in the best Japanese tradition of picking up ideas from rivals and making them better. The history of Nintendo in the 1980s demonstrates that successful home entertainment products are not the most advanced, but the most cleverly manufactured and marketed. Having taken a back seat in the drive for technology itself, though, Nintendo will have to repeat the trick.</p>

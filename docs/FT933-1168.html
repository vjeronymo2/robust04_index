			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Branson bets on flutter-as-you-fly MR Richard Branson is taking a gamble by introducing a new form of entertainment on long-distance flights. His Virgin Atlantic Airways plans to launch the first casinos in the sky when it starts daily services from London Heathrow to Hong Kong next February with new Airbus A340 airliners. Not only will passengers in all three classes of the aircraft be able to play roulette, blackjack, poker and other games of chance on videos from their seats, but on some flights there will also be live gambling with a croupier in the lounge area of the cabin. Mr Branson said there was nothing to stop him from introducing gaming on board once an aircraft is 20 miles out of the airport. 'You can do anything you want: you'll get the brothel in the sky next,' he said. Virgin Atlantic is planning to introduce airborne electronic shopping facilities at the same time as gambling. Both will be available on channels on a new, advanced video system fitted to the back of the seat in front of each passenger. The system, in which Virgin has invested about Dollars 20m (Pounds 12.9m), is being developed by Hughes Avicom of Los Angeles. Using a credit card, passengers will be able to use the gaming channel or order goods from the shopping channel and collect their goods either on board or on arrival. 'We are still working on the software but we expect it to be ready to introduce on the Hong Kong flights next year,' Virgin said. It said there would be a credit card swipe in the seat video system to credit or debit passengers. Mr Branson sees these facilities as the economics of air travel in the future. 'If we make Pounds 10 more per passenger it will add Pounds 20m more to our bottom line,' he said. 'But we will clearly make certain not to take away too much money from passengers because we want them to come back.' Upper and lower limits will be built into the system to control how much passengers can bet, win or lose. Virgin said the idea was not so much to create a 'gaming palace' in the air but to extend the range of in-flight entertainment. However, the airline is clearly targeting the strong gambling penchant of the Hong Kong Chinese by starting the facility on its new Hong Kong flights, for which it this week gained slots at both airports. The airline is also recruiting an additional 500 employees to prepare for the expansion of its long distance services with a new fleet of A340s and Boeing 747-400 airliners.

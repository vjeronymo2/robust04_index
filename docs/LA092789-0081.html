			<p><P> September 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: TRANSIENT STABS LIFEGUARD, FLEES  </P> <P> A barefoot, unshaven assailant who demanded money attacked a veteran county  lifeguard at Santa Monica Beach with a corkscrew on Tuesday, inflicting a  four-inch cut before fleeing across the beach and up the stairs into Palisades  Park, authorities said.  </P> <P> Terry Hearst, 34, was treated at a hospital for a slashed abdomen and released.  The 15-year lifeguard also strained his back when he tumbled seven feet to the  sand from a watchtower when the attacker lunged at him.  </P> <P> It was the third time in three weeks that transients have accosted lifeguards  on the beach, officials said. The guards in two previous incidents were not  injured.  </P> <P> Hearst was confronted about 8:30 a.m. when he opened his guard station about  three-quarters of a mile north of Santa Monica Pier. The long-haired assailant,  described as between 25 and 30, twice asked Hearst for money and then lunged  when the lifeguard asked him to leave the tower.  </P> <P> "It's a wonderful situation," said lifeguard Lt. Dick Heineman, with more than  a hint of sarcasm. "We're trying to protect them and they're stealing from us."  </P> <P> Santa Monica police and lifeguards said transients have grown more militant as  their numbers have steadily increased on beaches in the past two years.  </P></p>

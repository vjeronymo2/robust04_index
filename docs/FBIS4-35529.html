			<p>BFN     [Text] The head of the Palestinian police, General Nasr  Yusuf, says his forces will refuse to hand over to Israel  Palestinians who committed crimes against Israelis and sought  refuge in the self-rule areas. Yusuf, speaking to reporters in  Gaza, says the Palestinian police will arrest and charge the  killers of two Arabs suspected of cooperating with Israel in  Gaza over the weekend. The police sent representatives to their  funerals and have launched an investigation into the killings.  Hamas [Islamic Resistance Movement] claimed responsibility for  the deaths despite its agreement last month to suspend attacks  on so called collaborators.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0400 GMT on 29 May  reports that "General Yusuf said that the Palestinian police  would issue gun permits to residents of the autonomy, but  ascertain that the gun would only use their weapons to protect  their homes and not carry them in the street."]</p>

			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / Industrial production in France falls 0.4% FRENCH industrial production fell by 0.4 per cent in June, according to official figures, underlining the sluggish state of the economy. The main reason was the poor performance of the energy and construction sectors, where output fell by 1.37 per cent and 4.76 per cent respectively. By contrast, output in the manufacturing sector fell only 0.08 per cent. The June fall followed one of 1.6 per cent in May. Many of the largest French industrial companies - including the Suez industrial group, Thomson-CSF in electronics, Publicis in advertising, Pernod-Ricard in drink and Lafarge Coppee in building materials - have recently announced reductions in interim turnover. The decline in production is also reflected in rising unemployment and a fragile stock market. The CAC 40 Index fell again yesterday, for the second successive day, having fallen for most of last week, to close 0.14 per cent lower at 1,734. France's current account deficit fell to FFr1.92bn (Pounds 200m) in the first half of this year, its lowest level for six years, according to the finance ministry. This is compared with a deficit of FFr31.11bn in the equivalent period of 1991. The June deficit shrank to a seasonally adjusted FFr4.39bn, against a revised figure of FFr9.1bn for May.</p>

			<p><P> October 23, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> QINTEX IN DEEP DIVE, SUSPENDED  </P> <P> Troubles continued for Australia's Qintex Australia Ltd. as its stock lost half  its value and the Australian Stock Exchange suspended trading in the shares  today following the bankruptcy filing of its U.S. affiliate Friday.  </P> <P> The unwillingness of television tycoon Christopher Skase, head of Qintex, to  reveal his company's exposure to the U.S. unit, Qintex Entertainment, led the  Australian Stock Exchange to suspend trading in Qintex's Australian stock.  </P> <P> Qintex Australian shares plunged to 16 cents, valuing the company at only $21  million, after closing Friday at 33 cents. The suspension came after the close  of business.  </P> <P> "Share prices normally tell you something," said one longtime Qintex Australia  supporter at a brokerage firm who did not wish to be identified. "I'm not as  happy about the company now as I was before."  </P></p>

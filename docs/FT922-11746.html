			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Moslems fight back as Serbs bombard Sarajevo STREET-BY-STREET fighting in Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, yesterday was concentrated on the Ilidza district where Moslems attacked Serbs controlling the area. Radio Sarajevo said an unknown number of people had been killed and wounded in the counter-attack against Serb fighters who had infiltrated the district without any resistance. The hotel in Ilidza housing 60 European Community ceasefire monitors was riddled with bullet holes. No injuries were reported but Mr Colm Doyle, an EC official, said: 'This is mindless violence. Using a hotel with the EC and journalists in it and a hospital with patients as targets is not encouraging.' The United Nations peacekeeping force based in Sarajevo cancelled a press conference owing to heavy mortar fire in the city. Witnesses said the Moslem-dominated old town was still under bombardment by Serb forces, but in some districts a few people ventured out after more than a day in shelters. Most workers remained at home and schools were closed. There were conflicting accounts of which side was prevailing. One witness said: 'By using street battles, Moslem forces appeared to gain the upper hand on Serbs, who rely on heavy artillery on the hillside above Sarajevo.' Another witness said: 'It is chaos; it is not clear who is controlling the situation.' The Serbian-dominated federal army, however, appeared to be staying outside the fray in the city of 525,000 inhabitants, 49 per cent of whom are Moslem. A mission by Lord Carrington, the chairman of the EC's peace conference on Yugoslavia, is due to go ahead despite the fighting. Mr Doyle said EC observers had been assured that the political leaders of the three factions  -Serb, Croat and Moslem - could meet Lord Carrington's party at Sarajevo airport today. Several EC countries voiced concern about the escalating violence in Bosnia, with France calling for swift UN intervention to keep the conflict from spinning out of control. Germany vowed that the 'greatest possible international pressure' would be applied against Serbia to end the bloodshed. A spokesman for Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the foreign minister, said that the EC had approved an April 29 deadline for Serbia to stop the fighting or face international penalties. If the deadline passed with no change in Bosnia, the EC and the US would confer on what steps to take, he said. Bosnia's Serbs, who make up 31 per cent of the 4.35m population, are opposed to independence from Yugoslavia. Moslems and Croats, who represent nearly two thirds of the population, support independence. Elsewhere, Sarajevo radio said Serb artillery attacked Bosanska Krupa, in the north-western Moslem heartland and reported artillery exchanges in the north-western towns of Derventa and in the mainly Moslem Bihac.</p>

			<p><P> January 8, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SANTA ANITA;  </P> <P> INVITED GUEST, 24-1 SHOT, WINS  </P> <P> On a day when dartboards and Tarot cards were the handicapping tools of choice,  it should not have surprised that R.D. Hubbard's Invited Guest, a 24-1 shot,  won Sunday's featured San Gorgonio Handicap at Santa Anita.  </P> <P> Nor should it have been a shock that White Mischief, at 35-1, finished second  in the 1 1/8-mile turf event, especially after her trainer, Richard Cross,  noted before the race that his mare had a "snowball's chance in hell" of  upsetting the likes of Colorado Dancer, Nikishka and Stylish Star.  </P> <P> "Well, not all snowballs melt," said Cross, grinning after watching White  Mischief come within a half-length of an even bigger upset.  </P> <P> There must have been something in the air. For eight baffling races, favorites  wore their dubious honor like a millstone. Invited Guest simply followed the  lead of Hawaya Sunny in the second race (paying $83.60), His Legacy in the  fifth ($20.60) and Lady B. Strong in the seventh ($46.60).  </P> <P> The only choice to win all day was Pricey Mac in the finale, and he had to  withstand a 10-minute stewards' inquiry before shell-shocked bettors could  collect.  </P> <P> Although she was overlooked by fans, Invited Guest always has been a favorite  around the Richard Mandella stable.  </P> <P> The Irish-bred daughter of Be My Guest arrived in California late in 1987, on  the heels of a promising European career, and promptly won a division of the  Dahlia Handicap at Hollywood Park.  </P> <P> But that was her high point. In more than two frustrating seasons since,  Invited Guest had won a few minor stakes around the country and had finished  close to some good horses. But she never cashed in on that early promise until  she won the San Gorgonio at age 6.  </P> <P> Mandella took part of the blame.  </P> <P> "It took me this long to figure out how she should be ridden," said Mandella,  who lost a heartbreaker on Saturday when Survive barely fell short in the Las  Flores Handicap.  </P> <P> No matter what the pace, said Mandella, Invited Guest needs to be taken back  and kept behind horses for as long as possible. Reserved in this manner, she  will consistently produce a whirlwind finish.  </P> <P> "That's hard for me to tell a jockey," Mandella said. "Usually I want to give  them the latitude to ride the race as it comes up. But with this mare, you've  got to break her neck right out of the gate."  </P> <P> Russell Baze, who won the Golden Poppy Handicap on Invited Guest last March at  Golden Gate, confirmed Mandella's instructions.  </P> <P> "Bury her -- that's just what he told me," said Baze. "She's not easy to rate,  but when you ask her, she'll give that one good punch."  </P> <P> As the field ran past the stands the first time, Saros Brig was on a daylight  lead and going easily. Stylish Star, Silver Lane and Nikishka were keeping her  in sight.  </P> <P> The field did a little juggling down the backstretch, as Eddie Delahoussaye  launched a mini-move with Nikishka on the outside, and Robbie Davis angled  Darby's Daughter to the inside, behind Stylish Star.  </P> <P> "It looked like Chris (McCarron on Stylish Star) had a lot of horse," said  Davis, who had ridden Invited Guest in a Dec. 21 allowance win at Hollywood  Park. "I figured I'd follow him and be able to get through later."  </P> <P> It wasn't meant to be. Stylish Star could not sustain her run, and Darby's  Daughter was forced to take up at a crucial point.  </P> <P> "You thought you were in the garden spot and it ended up being full of weeds,"  said Corey Black, who rode Saros Brig.  </P> <P> With a furlong to run, Black was still in control of the race. Then they all  came flying. As Darby's Daughter tried to get through along the inside, a  three-horse battle was materializing out in the middle of the course.  </P> <P> Charging between horses, the French mare Oeilladine looked like a winner, but  only for a moment. Closing fast on the outside, Invited Guest took command  inside the final 70 yards, and then had to hold off the headlong finish of  White Mischief and Fernando Toro.  </P> <P> White Mischief, who won the Hillsborough Handicap at Bay Meadows in November at  odds of 18-1, was pinched back abruptly at the start of the San Gorgonio. Toro,  however, discounted its effect.  </P> <P> "They did me a favor," he said. "I've got to get her back behind horses right  away anyway, and sometimes it takes a sixteenth of a mile. Today, because of  the break, it only took a couple of jumps."  </P> <P> Oeilladine was beaten by a head for second money. Stevens said she was a bit  flat compared to her dazzling American debut 12 days earlier, when she won  going a mile.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it was the added distance or coming right back," Stevens said  of his mare. "The other day, though, she kept close on her own and then fired  when I asked her. Today I kind of had to nudge her along early."  </P> <P> Mandella noted after the race that Invited Guest is scheduled to be bred to top  stallion Blushing Groom this spring.  </P> <P> "They wanted to get her back to Kentucky early," Mandella said. "But ever since  the decision was made to breed her, she (has) been coming on strong. I'll talk  it over with the owner and see how much longer she can run."  </P> <P> The Invited Guest-White Mischief exacta returned $2,287. Combined with  sixth-race winner Flying Reb ($31.20) and Lady B. Strong in the seventh,  Invited Guest triggered an $18,952.80 triple that ranks second among Santa  Anita's all-time payoffs.  </P> <P> Horse Racing Notes  </P> <P> Pricey Mac, who was claimed for $32,000, gave trainer Brian Mayberry his sixth  victory of the meeting, extending his lead to two over four pursuers . . .  Eddie Delahoussaye and Alex Solis each won a race to remain in a tie atop the  jockey standings going into the third week . . . Derby fever gets turned up a  notch on Wednesday when Hollywood Futurity runner-up Farma Way meets Land Rush,  English stakes winner Balla Cove and Laurel Futurity winner Robyn Dancer in the  Los Feliz Stakes.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;After finalizing the classification of secondary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diagnoses, we evaluated which collapsed DRGs should be split  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the basis of the presence of a major CC, other CCs, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both. We developed criteria for this evaluation that allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a DRG to split only if the volume and difference in resource  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use is significantly different from the remainder of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases in the DRG and there is a significant reduction in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variance. The collapsed DRGs can be split into three  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> variations:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _DRG With CC or Major CC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _DRG Without CC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _DRG With Major CC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _DRG Without Major CC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _DRG With Major CC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _DRG With CC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _DRG Without CC  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> There are 120 DRGs that do not split at all. This final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> step resulted in the creation of 652 DRGs compared to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 491 DRGs we currently use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The paper we have prepared includes a listing of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> revised DRGs as well as the relative weights that would have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been assigned to the DRGs using the FY 1992 MedPAR data and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a list of every diagnosis code in effect in FY 1993 with its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current and proposed CC assignment (non-CC, CC, or major  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CC). In order to begin consultation with the hospital  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> industry and other interested organizations before formally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposing our revised system, we will be distributing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> paper to many hospital-related associations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations for their comment. In addition, requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DRG severity refinement paper may be made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> following address: Division of Hospital Payment Policy, 1&hyph;H&hyph;1 East Low Rise, 6325 Security Boulevard, Baltimore,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Maryland 21207, Attn: Nancy Edwards; or by calling (410)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 966&hyph;4532. Comments are due to HCFA by September 30, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similar to our usual practice for proposed DRG changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the prospective payment system, we are making available  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the public an FY 1992 Expanded Modified MedPAR File for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Severity that contains the discharge records we used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calculate the severity DRG relative weights. Requests for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this file can be made by following the instructions set  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forth in section VIII.B of this preamble (Requests for Data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the Public). Also available are Severity versions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the HCFA Medicare Case-Mix Index File, Table 5 DRG, and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AOR/BOR File.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our plan is to incorporate comments and suggestions we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> receive and to consider proposing the complete revised DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system as part of the FY 1996 prospective payment system  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, which will be published in the spring of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1995. However, as the final rule published on September 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1992 (57 FR 39761) indicates, we would not propose to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant changes to the DRG classification system unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we are able either to improve our ability to predict coding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> changes by validating in advance the impact that potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DRG changes may have on coding behavior, or to make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methodological changes to prevent building the inflationary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> effects of the coding changes into future program payments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Besides the mandate of section 1886(d)(4)(C)(iii) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Act, which provides that aggregate payments may not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> affected by DRG reclassification and recalibration changes,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we do not believe it is prudent policy to make changes for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which we cannot predict the effect on the case-mix index  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and, thus, payments. Our goal is to refine our methodology  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> so that we can fulfill, in the most appropriate manner, both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statutory requirement to make appropriate DRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> classification changes and to recalibrate DRG relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weights (as mandated by section 1886(d)(4)(C) of the Act) as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as to make DRG changes in a budget neutral manner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One approach to this problem would be to maintain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average case weight at 1.0 after recalibration, thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> eliminating the process of normalization. In other words,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after recalibration, we would not scale the new relative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weights upward to carry forward the cumulative effects of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> past case-mix increases. We would, instead, make an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment or include in the annual update factor a specific  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allowance for any real case-mix change that occurred during  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the previous year. This is a relatively simple and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> straightforward system for preventing the effects of year-to-year increase in the case-mix index from accumulating in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the DRG weights.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the severity changes, we also intend to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improve the classification and relative weights of the DRGs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that apply to newborns, children, and maternity patients.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Medicare population does not include many of these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals. The original DRG classification system was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> developed from analysis of claims data representative of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> total inpatient population. When we calculated the original  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare weights for the DRGs to which newborn, children and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maternity patients are classified, we used non-MedPAR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discharge records from Maryland and Michigan hospitals  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because there were either no MedPAR cases or too few cases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assigned to these DRGs to provide a reasonably precise  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimate of the average cost of care. (See the September 1,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1983 prospective payment final rule with comment period  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (48 FR 39768).) Since that time, because of the lack of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MedPAR data, these low-volume DRGs have not been analyzed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and refined, and the relative weights assigned to them may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no longer be entirely reflective of the resources needed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treat the patients. We again intend to rely on data bases  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outside the MedPAR file to supplement our data.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Recalibration of DRG Weights  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We are proposing to use the same basic methodology for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the FY 1995 recalibration as we did for FY 1994. (See the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> September 1, 1993 final rule (58 FR 46290).) That is, we  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would recalibrate the weights based on charge data for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Medicare discharges. However, we would use the most current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> charge information available, the FY 1993 MedPAR file,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rather than the FY 1992 MedPAR file. The MedPAR file is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on fully-coded diagnostic and surgical procedure data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for all Medicare inpatient hospital bills.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> September 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CANCELING EGYPT'S $7-BILLION DEFENSE DEBT  </P> <P> The world should have the determination to tighten the encirclement of Hussein  by these or similar efforts:  </P> <P>  -- Somewhere in Egypt, now the beneficiary of $7-billion forgiveness of debt,  there should be saboteurs capable of stopping the convoys moving vital suplies  from Aqaba to Baghdad.  </P> <P>  -- Somewhere in Saudi Arabia, including the absentee government of Kuwait,  there must be Kuwaitis who, with minimal instruction, should be capable of  returning to their homeland and sabotaging the Iraqi occupying forces.  </P> <P>  -- Somewhere, in the rest of the world, Iraq's commercial planes should be  seized in partial payment of their massive foreign debt, rather than allowing  them to be used for blatant propaganda purposes as the only egress for European  and American hostages.  </P> <P> Man cannot live by negotiation alone.  </P> <P> NORMAN EASTWOOD  </P> <P> Mission Viejo  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] We have just received a special report from the town  of Plesetsk on a command and staff military exercise. As we  have already reported, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev monitored [kontrolirovali] the  exercise.    [Correspondent Mikhail Zotov] During the command and staff  exercise of strategic missile troops in the area of test range  No. 53 in Plesetsk today, a training launch of the Topol  strategic intercontinental solid fuel missile was carried out.  Its projected target area was Kamchatka. Adjacent countries  were informed about the planned launch, and the flight of the  missile was tracked by nine ground radars, which transmitted the  data to a computer center in Plesetsk. The Russian defense  minister and the commander in chief monitored the exercise.    In the opinion of military observers, the 100-tonne, RS-12M  Topol launcher has shown once again the reliability and high  quality of operation of all the systems and of the missile  launch crew. Despite the fact that the strategic missile troops  are experiencing many of the problems that are characteristic of  the Army, the strategic missile troops still remain a reliable  guarantor of Russia's security and independence.    The number of training launches, however, is dwindling with  each passing year. The families of the servicemen who have  decided to give up the difficult job of officer in the Russian  Army are leaving the garrisons. For the time being, a few 35-  or 40-year-old officers, who have not given up the protection of  Russian borders in a difficult moment, ensure the combat  training of missile troops.</p>

			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / Central Bankers' Verdict On Europe's Economy: Lack of competition stoking inflation THE squeeze on inflation has still to penetrate much of Europe's economy which is protected from international competition, the central bankers said. Many services, in particular, are shielded from the price-reducing pressures of international trade. This could create a further hurdle for economic and monetary union, which many economists believe should be conditional upon low inflation in both production and service industries. Inflation in the non-traded goods sector of the EC economy - being services and products mainly for domestic sale - registered a year-on-year rate of 6.6 per cent last year. This was significantly higher than the 3.2 per cent recorded for merchandise sold across national boundaries. The difference of 3.4 percentage points between the two figures was 'around the highest level for 10 years'. In 1991 the difference was 3.2 percentage points and in 1990 3.1 points. The high levels of inflation in the non-traded part of many countries' economies was partly responsible for the 'relative resilience' of consumer-price inflation last year across the EC. The governors express disappointment that the consumer price index for the EC as a whole was a year-on-year 4.3 per cent last year, even though this was down on the 5.1 per cent recorded in 1991 and 5.7 per cent in 1990. The large differences in many countries between inflation for traded goods as opposed to that for non-traded items 'suggests the presence of structural problems which are hampering the reduction of inflation'. 'Policy measures to strengthen competition and raise productivity in the more sheltered (economic) sector' are required to tackle the problem, the governors believe.  -------------------------------------------------------------------      YEAR-ON-YEAR CONSUMER PRICE INFLATION IN EC COUNTRIES, 1992  -------------------------------------------------------------------                           Non-traded    Traded    Difference                             goods        goods    (percentage                           &amp; services   (percent)    points)                           (per cent)  ------------------------------------------------------------------- Belgium                      4.2          2.4         1.8 Denmark                      3.5          0.2         3.3 Germany (western)            5.5          2.7         2.8 Greece                      19.2         14.7         4.5 Spain                        8.8          4.5         4.3 France                       4.5          1.6         2.9 Ireland                      3.9          2.5         1.4 Italy                        7.5          2.8         4.7 Netherlands                  4.1          2.6         1.5 Portugal                    11.2          7.4         3.8 UK                           7.3          3.8         3.5  -------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

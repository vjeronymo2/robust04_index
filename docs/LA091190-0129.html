			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MAN ARRESTED IN DEATH OF COUPLE;  </P> <P> SUSPECT: A 24-YEAR-OLD FROM BELLFLOWER WILL BE ARRAIGNED TODAY ON CHARGES THAT  HE RAN OVER TWO YOUNG CAMPERS SLEEPING IN THEIR TENT AT SAN ONOFRE STATE PARK.  </P> <P> A 24-year-old Bellflower man arrested in connection with the weekend deaths of  two teen-age campers at San Onofre State Park will be arraigned today on  suspicion of felony drunk driving, felony hit and run and two counts of  vehicular manslaughter, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol said  Monday.  </P> <P> After police tracked down the license-plate number on the 1967 Ford Mustang  left at the scene, Douglas John Freels was arrested at his home about seven  hours after the incident, which investigators believe occurred at 2:30 a.m.  Sunday, Oceanside CHP Officer Jerry Bohrer said.  </P> <P> Officers immediately took Freels to a hospital near his home for a  blood-alcohol test, Bohrer said. Results will not be available for several  days.  </P> <P> A Department of Motor Vehicles spokeswoman said Freels has no record of other  traffic violations.  </P> <P> Freels was being held in the Vista Detention Facility on $10,000 bail.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, park officials said Graham Jacob Grubb, 18, of Laguna Niguel and his  girlfriend, Amanda Jocon Ciskowski, 19, of San Diego, who apparently were run  over as they slept, had pitched their tent in a parking lot next to their car,  in an area not designated as a campsite.  </P> <P> Steve Long, lifeguard supervisor for the Pendleton Coast District, which  oversees San Onofre State Park, said the couple evidently entered the park  sometime after the day-use lot closed at 10 p.m. and, finding the campsites  full, pitched their pup tent in the parking lot at the southern end of the  park, which was otherwise deserted.  </P> <P> He said that ranger vehicles patrol all the parks at night and that rangers,  had they seen the couple camped in the parking lot, would have asked them to  leave. The last patrol passed the area where they were camped, about a quarter  of a mile past the designated campsites, shortly after midnight, he said.  </P> <P> Long, who was called to the accident scene on Sunday morning, has worked at the  park for 12 years. He recalled at least one other fatal accident involving  overnight campers in the parking lot struck by motorists.  </P> <P> "It's a tragedy," he said of Sunday's accident.  </P> <P> Investigators also said a passenger in the Mustang, identified as John Herrera  of Downey, was questioned and released.  </P> <P> Bohrer said the suspect and his passenger were traveling north at about 30  m.p.h. through the 500-space, day-use parking lot that is bisected by old  Highway 101 before it ends in a cul-de-sac about six miles south of Basilone  Road.  </P> <P> Long said the Mustang apparently veered off the narrow two-lane road into the  ocean side of the parking lot and struck the tent where Grubb and Ciskowski  were sleeping.  </P> <P> The driver ran over the couple, struck the rear of Grubb's vehicle and dragged  the victims' bodies under the rear wheels for about 35 feet before coming to a  stop, Bohrer said.  </P> <P> The driver and his passenger then fled to a pay telephone and called a cab to  take them home, officers said. Police said Freels told them that he and Herrera  had earlier been to Capistrano Beach and San Clemente and were "just going for  a drive" through the state park.  </P> <P> "(The bodies) were still there when we arrived," Bohrer said, adding that  Freels told officers that "he felt like he hit something but didn't know what  it was. He said he walked to the front of the vehicle . . . but he doesn't  remember much."  </P> <P> Freels, one of five children, lives at home with his family, investigators and  neighbors said. A man who answered the telephone at the family's Bellflower  home said, "We don't really want to talk about it right now."  </P> <P> Martha Casillas, who has lived next door to the Freels family for eight years,  described Douglas Freels as a "very good person."  </P> <P> "He never caused trouble or made any noise," Casillas said. She added that his  parents apparently did not know of the fatalities when their son was picked up  by police.  </P> <P> "My son went over there and asked (Freels') mother what happened when the  police came," Casillas said. "His mother said (Freels) didn't explain anything  to her. She just knew that he came back from San Diego and was in an accident."  </P> <P> Dennis Hanks, who has lived across the street from the family for 14 years,  said Freels is a quiet person who spends much of his time at home and stays out  of trouble. Hanks said the beige-colored Mustang Freels drove on Sunday is one  of two that Freels' father had refurbished.  </P> <P> The victims' families said they have not yet decided when to hold planned  memorial services for the two.  </P> <P> Ciskowski's father, John Ciskowski of San Diego, said about Freels' arrest: "He  should be made to pay, but he is already in trouble. I'm sure he's hurting  badly already."  </P> <P> Earlier accounts of the accident said Grubb's Toyota land cruiser was hurled  180 feet, but Bohrer said the impact merely spun the vehicle around 180  degrees.  </P></p>

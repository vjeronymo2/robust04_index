			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / Yeltsin at last plays his hand: The gamble taken by the Russian president in his decision to impose special rule Mr Boris Yeltsin, the embattled president of Russia, has broken out, a move which now seems to have been inevitable. Penned in by decisions of the last Congress of People's Deputies - which gave parliamentarians the right to cancel his decrees instantly and even to suspend the office of the presidency, Mr Yeltsin has taken his tail from between his legs and stung his opponents into decreed oblivion. He told the country on Saturday night that he had 'signed a decree on special rule until the power crisis is overcome'. On April 25, a 'vote of confidence' in the president and General Alexander Rutskoi, his vice-president will be held throughout Russia. At the same time, another popular vote will be held on a draft constitution and draft electoral legislation. If these are passed, elections for a new parliament will be held under the provisions of the new constitution and the revised law. Mr Yeltsin also said that the structure of the new parliament would be wholly different from the present Congress of People's Deputies and its smaller permanent Supreme Soviet, but he was not specific about any changes. In the past, he has expressed a preference for a bicameral assembly. Until the deputies are replaced, the president added, they may continue to work - but 'no decisions . . . which aim to change or suspend commands or instructions of the president or resolutions of the government have any legal force'. At the same time Mr Yeltsin has directed Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, to draw up a law on the private ownership of land. In the main, Mr Yeltsin's directives are unlawful, violating numerous articles of the Russian constitution. Article 121, for example, explicitly states that the president cannot disband or suspend the parliament. Other provisions repeatedly declare that the Congress is the supreme power in the country and that it has the right to do anything it wishes. Mr Yeltsin's actions were described as a 'coup' by Mr Valery Zorkin, head of the Constitutional Court, who cut short a visit to the US at the end of last week because of the crisis. Yesterday he convened an immediate sitting of the court. Though compromised by his failure to guarantee the December agreement between Mr Yeltsin and the parliament to hold a referendum, Mr Zorkin remains the country's senior law officer, and he gives the judgments against Mr Yeltsin the imprimatur of his office. However, the Russian president did not claim that his actions were constitutional. Instead Mr Yeltsin has justified them on three grounds: his election by all of the people; the threat of a reactionary movement organised by the Congress; and his support for urgent constitutional and economic reforms. Together with his commitment to continue to respect human rights, this reasoning - while not quelling every qualm - was enough to produce declarations of firm support from leading foreign governments for his continued leadership of the Russian reform process. Meanwhile, Mr Yeltsin told the army to stay out of the conflict between himself and the Congress. The military leadership will probably be grateful that he did not ask for their direct support. Interior troops and the security services are also unlikely to intervene, at least not overtly, for the moment. Mr Chernomyrdin, who addressed parliament yesterday afternoon, was also supportive. 'In these conditions, it is not at all easy to pull ourselves out of an economic crisis,' he said. Nonetheless, the government was solidly behind the president because of the need to break out of the chaos and to 'defend the constitutional order as a whole'. Yet the opposition in parliament believes that it commands the moral high ground. The president is acting unconstitutionally, it contends, and he is rushing the nation towards civil war. Indeed, one of Mr Yeltsin's longtime supporters, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader and former Soviet foreign minister, commented that the possibility of internal conflict in Russia appeared so real 'that I can almost smell it'. 'The worst has happened,' Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, told legislators yesterday. He repeated that his belief was that the president was 'in breach of the constitutional laws'. He said that even though Mr Yeltsin had asked for a vote of confidence in both president and vice-president, he could not co-sign such a decree. He has thus put himself (not for the first time) in the opposite camp. But how have the Russian people reacted? A few thousand supporters of each side - separated by lines of police - yesterday rallied round the White House, the Russian parliament building. Hardliners supporting the Congress tried to beat up an American TV crew, and a Reuters correspondent quoted an elderly lady - carrying a portrait of Stalin - saying she was fighting against dictatorship. Yet recent polls have suggested that public apathy is growing. Some show that as many as 70 per cent see recent political events as having no relevance whatsoever to their lives. The Russian people, as Mr Yeltsin has himself observed, are infamous for their spells of passivity broken by sudden explosions. If this pattern holds true, the polls are alarming. Mr Yeltsin's domestic and foreign supporters - who are split on the advisability of his tactics but broadly behind him in doing something to break out of the stalemate with parliament - have two principal concerns: first, that his gamble of going to the people will be technically possible; and second, that the people should vote in large numbers. Neither can be assured. It is still unknown precisely what Mr Yeltsin means by a 'vote' on April 25. It is presumably not to be a referendum or Mr Yeltsin would have said as much. Referendums, moreover, are absolutely ruled out by the constitution - something Mr Yeltsin has appeared to accept. If the vote is to be an informal plebiscite, about which he has spoken often, a great deal of organisation is necessary: people need to be able to vote at polling stations; supervision is required; votes must be counted; and it must be seen to be fair. A plebiscite will also take millions of roubles, and there is as yet no word on where the funds will be found. A full-fledged referendum needs at least 50 per cent of the electorate voting before it is valid. A plebiscite would need no such thing, but the turn-out would have to be more than, say, 25 per cent if it is to be taken seriously. Even such a modest level may be too much to expect in present conditions. However, supporters of this strategy say that, with a four-week campaign, and a populace roused by rhetoric and struggle, the issue may be dramatised enough to stir heavy participation. A final question is whether Mr Yeltsin can keep on the peaceful path he clearly wishes to tread. Can he hold out to the leading industrial companies a reasonable prospect of being a stable partner in their increasingly frenzied efforts to find some way of assisting him? He has showed his cleverness by allowing the Congress to continue to meet and work. He is under no obligation to arrest them; he can ignore (under the terms of his own decree) any resolutions which may cancel his orders; and if the Congress impeaches him, or attempts to strip him of powers, it must then act - which, in the end, means it must secure the allegiance of at least part of the armed forces. Even though this puts the ball in his opponents' court, it also represents a great danger. Each side in the confrontation, in seeking to make its power paramount, must command loyalty of one or other of the armed forces. It is not impossible - indeed, it is relatively easy  - to envisage a split between forces loyal to the parliament and those loyal to the president, rather like a replay of the English civil war three centuries on. Mr Yeltsin, it was reported yesterday, has already renamed the elite Kremlin guard as the presidential guard, and put it under his direct control. 'He must have gone mad,' said Mr Mikhail Gorbachev in an interview with Italy's La Stampa yesterday, schadenfreude getting the better of him again. Mr Yeltsin clearly has not gone mad. But he is equally weary, perhaps fearful - perhaps even losing heart. He will need every ounce of it for the struggle to come.</p>

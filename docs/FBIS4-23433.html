			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Themba Khumalo] </F>   [Text] Scores of MK [Umkhonto we Sizwe -- Spear of the  Nation; ANC military wing] soldiers at the Wallmansthal assembly  point near Pretoria are reported to have left camp last Friday  as tension grew between the ANC military wing and the newly  formed South African National Defence Force [SANDF]. The former  guerillas went to MK headquarters in Johannesburg and told their  seniors that they would not go back until their grievances were  addressed.    There are also claims that tension is simmering between MK  and the predominately white senior officers of the SANDF over  the non-appointment of black generals into the army as part of  the integration process. A colonel in the SANDF told  journalists in Pretoria that although it was expected that MK  commander Siphiwe Nyanda would be made a general, "he is simply  not qualified to be one".    MK is believed to have submitted about 17 names of its  veteran soldiers who, in their view, qualified for the most  senior army ranks. The names are said to have been rejected by  the largely white SANDF officers who asked MK to reduce the list  to seven.    According to MK sources trouble started when they complained  about the predominantly white command structures which they said  violated the evaluation rules that were agreed upon at the Joint  Monitoring Coordinating Committee, set up to evaluate those  suitable to serve in the new force.    The last straw was when the MK cadres mysteriously  contracted  diarrhoea after eating food which was prepared by the catering  army staff at the camp.    The allegations were denied by the army spokesman Major Nick  Sendall, who referred to a press conference held on Thursday by  the Chief of SANDF, General Georg Meiring, in which he said the  current ranks held by white officers would be treated as  temporary until the integration process had been completed.  Sendall said only Parliament had the prerogative to appoint  generals.</p>

In the course  of establishing and developing market economy operating forces,  the tax system will need constant improvement, to turn it into  a policy means for helping to bring the impact of market forces  into full play, and to act with market forces in achieving the  optimum disposition of resources.  <H3>  I. The Principles for Improving Our Tax System Under a  Socialist Market Economy </H3>   1. The Revenue Principle    Organizing revenues is the basic function of taxation.  Economic operations based on a market economy require  taxation, premised on not obstructing economic operations in the  private sector, to raise the maximum revenues, which is the  financial guarantee for a socialist country to realize its  social and economic functions.    But China's reality is that a decade-plus of economic reform  has been accompanied by a similar period of fiscal deficits,  which totalled 259.876 billion yuan for the 12 years from 1979  through 1990, or 2.91 percent of national income for the period.  Even excluding treasury bond income, the shortfall from revenues  raised mainly through taxation was still about 88 billion yuan,  to average 7.33 billion yuan a year. Such a severe revenue  shortage had to be a key factor hampering economic reform.    2. The Fairness Principle    As to tax burdens, the fairness principle means that when  taxpayer payment capability is the same, the same amount of  taxes are collected; and when payment capability differs, taxes  are collected based on taxpayer capability. Legally, the tax  fairness principle means that tax collectors and taxpayers have  an equal standing as to tax law, with various taxpayers also all  being equal in the face of the tax laws. As to enterprise  taxpayers, it is only when taxes are collected fairly that  enterprises will have relatively rational tax burdens to allow  for free competition; and as to individual taxpayers, collecting  taxes based on payment capability helps to redistribute social  wealth, shrink the polarization between the rich and poor, and  create the greatest public welfare.    3. The Regulation Principle    As the government's means of economic regulation, taxation  has both a microeconomic and a macroeconomic regulation  function. In the process of distributing and redistributing  national income, taxation employs steps such as collecting or  not collecting taxes on certain economic activities, collecting  more or less taxes, and limiting tax bonuses, to affect and  regulate (balance) the supply and demand of certain products, to  realize the optimum disposition of resources and industrial  structure goals. While this is the microeconomic-regulation  function of taxation, taxation is also a means of regulating  macroeconomic operations. The basic state of China's current  market economy is an out-of-equilibrium economy, the conspicuous  manifestation of which is the imbalance between overall supply  and demand. The government can raise or lower taxes to curb or  increase overall demand, to bring it into line with overall  supply. We can go on to say that the regulation principle means  that taxation needs the function of promoting production  operation efficiency in microeconomic activities, as well as  that of stabilizing macroeconomic operations.  <H5>  II. Tax-Reform Mistakes </H5>   China's economic reforms have a gap in revenue-taxation  reform. While a decade-plus of tax reform has added many tax  categories, to improve our tax structure, the guiding ideology  of "streamlining administration and devolving authority" and  "tax reduction and profit concession" has led all along to the  taking of various tax-reduction steps for the key tax-revenue  source--enterprise income taxes, even to the point of "tax  reduction" remaining the major tax-reform-offensive direction  today when the new economic operating forces of a market economy  are being established. Data show that from 1981 to 1990, state  support for enterprises through the tax-reduction and  profit-concession policy amounted to net financial resources  worth 310 billion yuan, including 244.8 billion yuan during the  Seventh Five-Year Plan, or 19.13 percent of revenues for the  period. While the grounds for tax reduction are that it  invigorates enterprises, I hold that under today's conditions,  when our socialist market economy is just developing, and we  have no sound economic and legal institutions suited to the  operating laws of a market economy, continuing with the same old  tax-reform guiding ideology of "tax reduction" would be bound to  lead China's tax reform astray. Enterprises have not truely been  invigorated because they are retaining more profits, while  inadequate revenues leave the government powerless to control  the overall economic situation.    First take a look from the enterprise perspective. 1) When  market forces are not very strong and enterprise actions are  irrational, tax reduction cannot genuinely help enterprises  become more efficient through competition. As our socialist  market economy is just taking off, with China's society and  economy still lacking a complete and mutually-restraining market  system, being particularly short of market forces centered on a  rational pricing structure, enterprises are actually in an  unfair market-opportunity state. In addition, enterprises have  not yet completely established internal mechanisms for self  restraint and self development, or been subjected to full  competitive pressures. In this state, tax reduction to increase  the real budgetable income of enterprises allows them to acquire  more liberal external terms not through their own efforts. They  need only to strive for advantageous policies (an example being  1993's wave of phoney joint ventures) to achieve their own  profit objectives, without having to spend more energy on  raising efficiency. The pertinent data on the ratio of material  consumption to gross output value in China's industrial sector  show it to have been 68.1 percent in 1986, but up to 72.4  percent by 1990. So the tax-reduction policy had to have been a  contributing factor to enterprise inertia. 2) When the state  economy's property rights have not been genuinely put in order,  so that enterprises lack long-range investment motivation, tax  reduction does not fully play the role of stimulating  investment. In our decade-plus of economic reform, the state  economy's property rights relations have remained unclear all  along, keeping commodity-producer behavior out of line with  market rules. Meanwhile, as enterprises have no inherent drive  for long-range development plus steadily increasing budgetable  income, their real assets have not clearly accumulated and  grown, with income being slanted more toward consumption. The  data for 1985 to 1990 show that China's GVIO grew at an average  rate of 13.1 percent a year, while employee payrolls in the  industrial sector rose an average of 17.8 percent a year. In  this state of affairs, the income realized through tax reduction  moved limited resources from the investment arena to the  consumption stage, turning production capital into consumer  funds, stimulating an excessive increase in public consumption  funds, and sharpening the overall imbalance between supply and  demand.    Then take a look from the government's side. 1) When the  government's status and functions in economic activities have  not yet been clearly delimited, and spending demand is rigid and  strong, tax reduction can only add to the fiscal burden, by  increasing fiscal deficits, and threatening the stable growth of  the national economy. While the tax-reduction campaign in the  U.S. in the 1980s had theoretical grounds, holding that the  government must cut spending while reducing taxes, our reality  is that our government's economic functions have certainly not  been clearly cut back, with it still being responsible for  priority-construction investment necessary to economic growth  but long neglected, and no lightening of the fiscal-subsidy  burden in sight. So increased government spending puts  enormous pressure on revenue sources. When spending is  increasing steadily and tax revenues are in a relative decline,  funds to finance reform can come only through overdrawing, which  then leaves the door open for inflation. 2) When economic  growth and living standards are rising steadily, the demand for  public facilities grows, meaning that the government has to come  up with the funding for infrastructure improvements. And the  tax-reduction reform thinking certainly ignores the revenue  demand in this area. 3) A socialist market economy requires the  free flow of production essentials, with the workforce-mobility  essential in particular requiring the government to provide  social guarantees in areas, such as unemployment and pensions,  which is a new fund demand. 4) In our current government bond  system, government bonds are unattractive financial assets,  leaving the government with very limited revenues from the  fundraising means of government bonds. Under such conditions,  most government funds needed for either economic or social  functions must be raised through taxes.    It is thus obvious that in the initial stage of the  establishment of a socialist market economy, when many economic  relations cannot be completely rationalized and market forces  cannot be made sound all at once, lowering taxes cannot solve  problems, such as the strong demands on government revenues and  the irrationality of enterprise actions. So I hold that in  coming tax reforms, we can no longer reform our tax system with  the tax-reduction thinking, but that our tax reform should be  based on stabilizing tax burdens and revenues, by improving our  tax structure, to build a tax system that is fair and can  provide ample revenues and regulate the economy.  <H5>  III. Tax-Reform Ideas Under a Market-Economy System </H5>   1. Enterprise Income-Tax Reform    In light of market-economy demands and in consideration of  China's objective conditions for some time to come, I hold that  accelerated enterprise income-tax reform should be our  tax-reform priority for the next few years.  <H5>  A. Enterprise Income-Tax Laws Need To Be Consolidated. </H5>   In the interests of fair tax burdens, we first need to break  up the income-tax system that is set up on the basis of economic  nature, with all types of domestic-invested enterprises, such as  state, collective, private, jointly operated, and shareholding  enterprises, being made subject to a uniform enterprise  income-tax law and, when the time is right, merging of the  income tax laws for domestic- and foreign-invested enterprises,  and implementation of a completely consolidated enterprise  income-tax law for industrial and commercial enterprises. As  this is a prerequisite for fair taxation, as well as the  consensus at all levels throughout China, there is no need to go  into unnecessary details.  <H3>  B. Income Taxes Need To Be Different for Large and Small  Enterprises. </H3>   As our socialist market economy develops, the goal model for  the conversion of enterprise operating forces is the  shareholding system. Once we go to a full shareholding system,  enterprise income taxes for small, midsize, and large  enterprises will need somewhat varying tax treatment. From the  experience of overseas practice, due to various reasons, such as  1) small enterprises having little profitmaking capability and  prestige that is not yet established or not high, 2) the  shareholding system requiring large financing and transaction  costs on primary and secondary markets, and 3) the shareholding  system requiring high costs for enterprise-manager supervision  and control and information linkup between managers and  shareholders, only 2 percent of small enterprises with less than  500 employees sell shares at the time of their initial financing  decisions, with still less than 20 percent doing so by the time  of their second financing decisions. In other words, about 90  percent of small enterprises take loans from financial  institutions as their primary financing policy. So in support  of vital small-enterprise growth, we should adopt preferential  tax policies for small enterprises, such as making the legal tax  rate applicable to small enterprises lower than that for large-  and medium-sized ones, and offering broader investment-tax  preferences.  <H5>  C. Interest Needs To Be Included in Tax Bases. </H5>   Interest having long been tax free has created the bad  phenomenon of the enterprise sector overrelying on bank loans  for investment, while using most of its own funds for welfare  facilities. If interest expenditures were included in tax  bases, the enterprise income-tax system would actually be  neutral toward all capital sources, while playing the following  roles: 1) it would spur enterprises to raise the use efficiency  of their borrowed capital; 2) on the capital demand side, it  would help to control credit scope; 3) it would also have a  certain restrictive impact on investment scale.  <H5>  D. Tax Rates Need To Be Flexible. </H5>   The current focus of discussion in enterprise income-tax  reform is tax-rate design. Many favor a 33-percent single-ratio  tax rate. I hold that such a tax rate is a particular reflection  of the tax-reduction guiding ideology, being too low, adverse to  the organization of revenues, and detrimental to government use  of tax leverage to regulate national economic operations. I  favor the enterprise income-tax collection method of first  adopting the soft-degree progressive tax-rate system, and then  making a transition to the proportional (flat) tax-rate system.  As our market economy is just being established: 1) Government  revenue demands are strong, while enterprise income taxes are  the major source of revenue, so that employing the progressive  tax rate system can bring rich revenue flexibility; 2) in  contrast to the individual income tax, it is only the enterprise  income tax that plays a key role in regulating macroeconomic  operations. So as the revenues so raised make up a very large  percentage of overall tax revenue, if we continued to use the  progressive tax rate, making it flexible, its regulatory impact  would grow; 3) using the progressive tax-rate system would not  affect enterprise investment initiative. In the current state  of bank credit-mechanism restraints being soft, enterprise  property-rights limits being unclear, and enterprise actions  being severely short term, even more enterprise retained profits  would be hard to use for long-term investment, as was explained  above. In light of these factors, we should set enterprise  income taxes for the short-term at a three-level progressive tax  rate for excess income of 35-40 percent. Then, based on China's  market-economy development and progress in converting enterprise  operating forces, enterprise income taxes could make a gradual  transition to the flat tax-rate system. In fact, before the  1980s, corporate income taxes in developed countries, such as  the United States and Japan, all employed a three- to four-grade  progressive tax-rate system for excess income.    In addition, enterprise income-tax flexibility should also  be  expressed in the following two areas: 1) In order to encourage  competition and raise production efficiency, I recommend that  once the enterprise profit rate passes 20 percent, each  one-point rise should lower the tax rate 1 point. The profit  rate is calculated as profits plus all loan interest excluding  utilized gross capital (including all loans). My reason for  delimiting the profit rate at 20 percent is that according to  economic-theory assumptions, in order for each industry to keep  its output at a growth rate of 8-10 percent, its profit rate  must be above 20 percent. This step would be a great  encouragement to enterprises with profit rates above 20 percent,  as well as playing a promotional role for all enterprises in  achieving this profit rate and improving their economic  efficiency. 2. In order to stimulate exports and import  substitutes, I recommend that each one-point rise in the  enterprise net-export rate should lower the tax rate 1 point.  The net-export rate is present export value minus the present  value of raw material and parts imports excluding the present  replacement value of imported machinery and equipment. This  could stimulate the growth of import industries and  export-subsitute industries, while raising the use efficiency of  imported machinery and equipment.    2. Individual Income-Tax Reform    The individual income-tax system functions to bring fairness  to individual income levels and regulate overall demand, being a  key component part of a flexible tax system. Individual  income-tax system-reform includes three parts: 1) The  individual income-tax system needs consolidated. In other  words, the current individual income tax, individual income  adjustment tax, and individual industrial and commercial  household operations income tax need to be merged into a  consolidated individual income tax. Meanwhile, both Chinese and  foreigners should be made subject to a uniform individual income  tax law, with nonresident taxpayers being provided with certain  special deductions to solve the problem of high tax burdens  created by income differences. 2) We need to abolish our  individual income adjustment tax's excess-multiple progressive  tax-rate system, and replace it with the progressive tax-rate  system for excess income, which would be in line with  international practice, as well as increasing our taxation  flexibility. 3) Individual business income should be made a  part of the individual income-tax tax-base in order to prevent  tax-revenue losses.    3. Flow-Tax System Reform    China's flow taxes have always used the tax-inclusive-price  model, with tax rates designed on the principle of high taxes  for high profits, and vice versa. It is obvious that under the  planned pricing system, flow taxes regulated profits, not the  consumption that they should have. But in market-economy  conditions, market-formed prices dominate, so that tax rates  should no longer be designed on a planned-pricing basis. In  addition, as to tax categories, everything from production to  circulation and wholesale to retail should be subject to the  value-added tax, with product taxes collected on some products,  for a two-tax overlap. That is, the neutral value-added tax  would be used for general regulation, with product taxes for  special regulation.    4. Expanded Tax-Base, Additional Tax Categories    In order to adapt to market-economy needs, China should as  quickly as possible begin to collect social insurance,  inheritance and gift, capital gains, and securities transaction  taxes. 1) The collection of social insurance taxes will help to  lighten enterprise burdens and promote rational labor mobility.  The pertinent data show that in many of China's older  enterprises, retirees and pensioners make up one-third of all  employees, with this ratio even as high as 1:1 in a few  enterprises. Paying wages to retired employees has always been  a heavy burden on enterprises, as well as obstructing rational  labor mobility. Collecting social insurance taxes will shift  pension and unemployment insurance payments from enterprises to  the government, to equalize the burdens of old and new  enterprises, while opening the way for labor mobility. 2)  Collecting inheritance and gift taxes will help to equalize  public wealth and tax revenue. As China's living standards rise  steadily, personal assets accumulate and grow constantly, and  dealings with the outside world continue to expand, the transfer  and inheritance of personal assets occurs often. According to  international practice, China should also collect taxes on the  inheritance or transfer of personal assets above a set amount.  3) The collection of capital-gains taxes, for separate taxation  of corporate enterprise capital gains and operating income, is  aimed at practicing a light-tax policy for the sale of capital  assets, to encourage capital flow, invigorate capital markets,  and encourage venture investments.    5. Stronger Tax-Control Legislation    As a market economy is one that is ruled by laws, this means  that tax-collection control must have tax laws as a yardstick.  1) Tax laws need consolidated, taxing authority must be  concentrated, and the legal liability for the illegal actions of  deciding without authorization to impose taxes, stop  collections, or make exemptions has to be investigated and  affixed; 2) illegal actions, such as tax evasion or  resistance, need to be cracked down on severely; 3) we need to  strengthen our tax-collection oversight, by investigating and  affixing the legal liability of tax collectors who abuse their  authority for private purposes and are derelict in their duties;  4) and we need to use all means to disseminate tax-law  knowledge, by raising taxpayer awareness among all, in order to  push legal tax-control to new heights.    6. A Tax-Separation System as Quickly as Possible    In our traditional tax-management system, the departmental  selfishness and policy of "storing wealth among the people" of  local governments brought a sharp erosion of central-government  tax revenue. 1) China's Central Government controls very few  tax categories, with most taxes being collected on  local-government responsibility, which shifts much tax revenue  to extrabudgetary control, making our tax system severely  regressive. 2) While the authority to draw up tax laws and tax  rates is nominally the center's, it is actually all under local  control. As this gives local governments the opportunity to  loudly exploit tax reductions and exemptions, our tax-reform  remedy will be to thoroughly practice a tax-separation system.</p>

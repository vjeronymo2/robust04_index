			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / International Company News: IBM sees record sales of PS/1 INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, which is expected to report the largest corporate losses in history for 1992, sounded a happier note at the consumer electronics show in Las Vegas yesterday. It revealed it had attained record sales of its PS/1 consumer personal computers 'We have just completed our best quarter ever, selling more than six times the number of PS/1s than we did in the fourth quarter of 1991,' said Mr Jim Keenan, director of consumer brands and retail channels, at IBM Personal Computer, the new business unit. Mr Jack Kuehler, IBM president, demonstrated prototype products and services that apply computer power to consumer entertainment. In a joint venture with Blockbuster Entertainment, IBM has developed a digital video and audio delivery system for record stores. The system provides consumers with a virtually unlimited selection of music and video titles which can be electronically downloaded to the store where a compact disk or cassette recording can be produced. Cray Research, the leading manufacturer of supercomputers, said it would report a loss for 1992 because the acceptance of one of its large systems had been delayed.</p>

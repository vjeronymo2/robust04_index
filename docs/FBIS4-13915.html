			<p>BFN     [Text] Beirut, 23 Apr (MENA)--Lebanese judicial sources  today stated that during the preliminary interrogation  yesterday, Iraqi diplomat Deputy Consul 'Ali Sultan Darwish and  chief of embassy guards Hadi Hasan confessed fully to the  assassination of Iraqi opposition member Talib Suhayl al-Tamimi  in his home in Beirut.    The sources said that during the 12-hour interrogation  yesterday, Hadi Hasan gave a full confession on how the crime  was planned in coordination with Muhammad Faris Kadhim, chief of  intelligence at the Iraqi embassy, and defendants Khalid Khalaf,  'Ali Sultan Darwish, and George Tarjian.    According to Hasan, Kadhim had asked him to assassinate  al-Tamimi at the orders of the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad,  after furnishing him with the crime weapon.    The sources note that defendant 'Ali Sultan Darwish  confessed  to planning and preparing to carry out the crime with his  colleagues and to hiding weapons, particularly the murder weapon.    Darwish said that the Iraqi intelligence in Baghdad had  issued orders to assassinate al-Tamimi at once as an opponent of  Saddam Husayn's regime. He confessed to committing the crime  with his colleagues.    The investigating judge has ordered the extension of the  defendants' remand in solitary confinement, and prevented  visitors. The number of persons implicated in the case has thus  risen to five, including three diplomats.</p>

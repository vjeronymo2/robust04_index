			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pierre Langereux: "Arianespace Plans 10 Launches </F> in 1994"; Subhead: "Exceptional Accomplishment. 10 Ariane  Launches Scheduled for This Year (and Same Number for Next Two  Years) to Launch 15 Large Telecommunications Satellites, Half of  Them Hughes (U.S.) Satellites."]    [Text] The European operator is accelerating the tempos for  production and launching of Ariane 4 beginning this year, and  for the next two years also, in order to realize 10 launches per  year and 30 flights in 36 months. This is something never before  witnessed in Europe and not even among international commercial  launchers, including the U.S. What is more, among the 15  commercial satellites being loaded onto the European rocket this  year are half of the 15 satellites that Hughes (U.S.), the  world's leading manufacturer of telecommunications satellites,  is supposed to deliver to its customers in 1994!    But in late January at Kourou, Aerospatiale is going to kick  things off with a double Ariane 4 launch carrying two "Made in  France" geostationary telecommunications satellites. They are  the Eutelsat 2/F5 belonging to the European organization  Eutelsat and, preeminently, the first Turkish satellite, Turksat  1A, that the French manufacturer is also supposed to deliver in  orbit to Turkey. As a result, as a direct customer of  Arianespace, Aerospatiale will therefore, for the first time,  enjoy the privilege of having its name painted on the European  rocket for which it is also the principal manufacturer in its  capacity of industrial architect and project manager.    In fact, the contract signed three years ago with Turkey by  Aerospatiale provides for "turnkey" delivery of two satellites  launched by Ariane as well as two ground control stations  (equipped and personnel trained). Therefore, Aerospatiale is  supposed to deliver the first operationally ready Turksat to the  Turkish Post and Telecommunications [P&amp;T] towards the end of  February 1994.  <H5>  34 Tons of Satellites </H5>   The launch was scheduled for 20 January but was pushed back  "a few days" by Arianespace on 17 January in order to check out  a couple of irregularities in the cryogenic third stage orders  sequencer that occurred during the previous flight (V62) in  mid-December 1993.       -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ariane 1994 Flight Manifest                                                |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |FLIGHT            |DATE              |LAUNCHER          |PAYLOAD           |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V63               |Late January      |AR44LP            |Eutelsat 2/F5 (Eu-|  |                  |                  |                  |rope) + Turksat 1-|  |                  |                  |                  |A (Turkey)        |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V64               |Late February     |AR44LP            |Intelsat 7/F2 (In-|  |                  |                  |                  |ternational)      |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V65               |Late March        |AR44L             |Solidaridad 2 (Me-|  |                  |                  |                  |xico) + BS-3N (Ja-|  |                  |                  |                  |pan)              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V66               |Late April        |AR42L             |Telstar 4/F2 (ATT/|  |                  |                  |                  |USA)              |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V67               |Mid-June          |AR42P             |PAS 2 (PanAmSat/U-|  |                  |                  |                  |SA)               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V68               |Late July         |AR44LP            |Brasilsat (Brazil)|  |                  |                  |                  | + Turksat 1B (Tu-|  |                  |                  |                  |rkey)             |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V69               |Late August       |AR44L             |DirecTV 2 (Hughes/|  |                  |                  |                  |USA) + Thaicom 2 (|  |                  |                  |                  |Malaysia)         |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V70               |Late September    |AR42P             |Astra 1D (SES/Lux-|  |                  |                  |                  |embourg)          |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V71               |Late November     |AR44LP            |Brasilsat B2 (Bra-|  |                  |                  |                  |zil) + Eutelsat 2/|  |                  |                  |                  |F6 (Europe)       |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |V72               |Late December     |AR42P             |PAS 3 (PanAmSat/U-|  |                  |                  |                  |SA)               |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Editor's note: Four types of Ariane 4 are used with two solid propellant b-|  |oosters (42P), two or four liquid propellant boosters (42L or 44L) or four |  |mixed boosters (44LP).                                                     |  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------      This 63rd Ariane flight (in 14 years) will also be the 35th  AR4 launch (in 5.5 years) since it was put into service in June  1988. Thirty-three of those 34 launches were successful (97  percent).    V63 will be the 10th launch in the AR44L version. The 419 t  rocket is supposed to carry a 4179 kg payload (including  adapter) for launching the 1880 kg Eutelsat 2/F5 and the 1783 kg  Turksat 1A. The satellites stacked under the shroud will be  launched (in that order) into orbit at 200-35,934 km/7 degrees  and then propelled by their own motor into geostationary orbit  at 36 degrees E and 42 degrees E.  <H5>  [Boxed item] </H5> <H5>  Hughes Shows Confidence in Ariane </H5>   In 1994, Hughes Aircraft will entrust more than half of its  telecommunications satellites (eight out of 15) to Ariane 4 (see  table). This is the first time that the American firm, a world  leader in the sector, will place so many satellites on the  European rocket. As a result, Ariane will become the world's  leading launcher of telecommunications satellites with 15 of the  21-23 "satcoms" (65-71 percent) scheduled for this year. The  others will be launched by the new Japanese H2 (one), the U.S.  Delta 2 (one), and the U.S. Atlas (two or three).       ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hughes Satellites To Be Launched in 1994                                  |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |DATE          |SATELLITE     |TYPE          |CUSTOMER      |LAUNCHER      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |February      |Galaxy 1R     |HS-376        |HCI           |Delta 2       |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |March         |Solidaridad 2 |HS-601        |Mexico        |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |April         |UHF/UFO-3     |HS-601        |US Navy       |Atlas 1       |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |May           |ApStar 1      |HS-376 APT    |Sat           |LM 3          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |June          |PAS 2         |HS-601        |PanAmSat      |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |July          |Brasilsat B1  |HS-376W       |Brazil        |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |August        |Thaicom 2     |HS-376L       |Thailand      |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |August        |DirecTV 2     |HS-601        |HCI           |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |September     |Astra 1D      |HS-601        |SES           |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |October       |MSAT 2        |HS-601        |AMSC          |Atlas 2A      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |November      |Brasilsat B2  |HS-376W       |Brazil        |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |November      |UHF/UFO-4     |HS-601        |US Navy       |Atlas 2       |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |December      |PAS 3         |HS-601        |PanAmSat      |Ariane 4      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |December      |ApStar 2      |HS-601        |APTSat        |LM 3          |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |?             |Optus B3      |HS-601        |Optus         |??            |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Editor's note: Ariane 4 launch dates are intercalated on the basis of the |  |Arianespace schedule                                                      |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------      Both of the costly satellites and their launcher will be  insured through French broker Faugere &amp; Jutheau for a record  value of $360 million.    The next flight (V64), also with an AR44LP, is scheduled for  23 February, to launch the large 3.7 t Intelsat 7/F2. That will  be the heaviest one launched this year by Ariane. The least  heavy will be the Shinawatra (Thailand) Thaicom 2 weighing 1080  kg. This year the Hughes spun HS-376 will occupy half the Ariane  flights with eight of its 15 satellites on the European rocket  that will also launch two satellites manufactured by Martin  Marietta Astro Space (Telstar 4/F2 and BS-3N) and one by Space  Systems/Loral (Intelsat 7/F2) for a total of 11 satellites "Made  in USA" out of 15 (73 percent). The other four satellites will  be Aerospatiale's own. Total weight of those 15 "satcoms" is  33.9 t.    The ERS-2 also enjoys priority launching this year. But the  European radar-observation satellite is supposed to be launched  only in January 1995. Other satellites have also been postponed  until next year, especially the Measat 1, Amos-1, Italsat 2,  Telecom-2C, two Intelsat 7A and ISO.    By the end of 1994, therefore, Arianespace should have  launched 72 of the scheduled 99 Arianes, including 44 Ariane 4's  out of 71 (including 50 from lot P9). Therefore, there will be  27 Ariane 4's left to launch and 22 of the 37 satellites  currently on order. This does not include new future orders that  could lead Arianespace to order (between now and the end of the  year) a few more additional AR4 to meet the demand before the  arrival of Ariane 5 in less than two years. The European  operator has also already planned to order, this year as well,  the 14 first serial AR5 for operational flights beginning in  1996 (cf. A&amp;C No. 1455).</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Banham alleges Whitehall meddling SIR JOHN BANHAM, chair-man of the Local Government Commission, yesterday demanded government action against interference by civil servants in his organisation's review of the structure of local government in England. He said after giving evidence to the Commons environment committee that the commission would be unable to complete its work on time 'unless we get Whitehall off our backs'. He added: 'The commission must be free to manage the process as we see fit. To have continuous instructions which get cancelled - and artificial deadlines - is simply trying to manage the process by remote control. We are not going to have it.' He stressed to the committee that he was not attacking government policy. He complained that earlier this week he had received an instruction from the Department of the Environment to halt work on Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Hampshire, Cumbria and Lanca-shire, while a covering letter from Mr David Curry, local government minister, told him to ignore those instructions. The department said later: 'When the commission is conducting its review, we are 100 per cent hands-off.' It denied that Mr Curry's letter had contradicted civil servants' advice, which was that the reviews should be suspended 'and resumed when we are in a position to issue revised guidance'. Sir John also said that opinion polls had revealed that local people were 'rightly suspicious of reorganisation as time-consuming and costly'. But in the Commons, Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, said he saw 'no need at all for this to cost very much'. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said it would be 'outrageous' if the cost of the reorganisation was paid for by a council tax surcharge, as had been reported. Mr Gummer retorted that Mr Straw's worries were 'entirely unjustified'. However, Mr Gummer came under fire over the review from Conservative backbenchers as well as from Labour, with one Tory saying the process was 'getting murkier by the moment'. Sir John revealed later that the commission has decided to drop its original proposals for Derbyshire, one of the first three counties to be reviewed. Its proposal to convert the county into two unitary districts, one for the city of Derby and another for the rest of the county, had 'plainly received too much opposition and not enough positive support'.</p>

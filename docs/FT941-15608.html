			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / The Westminster Report: MPs see threat to Major's position Shocked Conservative MPs were last night absorbing the details of the report into Westminster council which some think threatens the leadership of Mr John Major, the prime minister. Most repeated warnings by Mr Major and other cabinet ministers that MPs should not 'rush to judgment' on the provisional findings released by the district auditor. A few also sought to minimise the impact of the report by drawing attention to auditors' investigations into the financial problems of the Labour-controlled councils of Monklands in Strathclyde, Liverpool, and Lambeth, south London. Mr Bernard Jenkin (Colchester North) said that Westminster council was 'one of the best housing authorities in London'. He told laughing Labour MPs: 'It is not a crime to encourage home ownership.' But there was mounting gloom in the Conservative ranks as MPs thumbed through unofficial copies of the unpublished full version of the district auditor's report. Labour MPs said the full report contained even stronger criticism of Westminster Conservatives than had been expected. Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, gleefully drew attention to repeated previous endorsements by cabinet ministers of Westminster as a Conservative flagship council. He said the report showed that the Conservative party had abandoned basic principles of public morality by putting party interests before the public good. The Conservatives had ignored the laws and conventions which separated functioning democracies from banana republics. Mr Straw added: 'Arrogance, incompetence and utter contempt for those who disagree with them have led to the systematic disregard of those laws and conventions by the Tory party. 'The public interest, and the Tory party's internal interest have, in the minds of leading Conservatives, become indistinguishable. The public's government has become the Tory party's private fiefdom.' The allegations against Westminster councillors dominated Mr Major's first appearance at question time since the Commons resumed after the Christmas recess. Amid rowdy scenes, Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, labelled the report 'a devastating example of financial corruption and the abuse of power by senior members of the Conservative party'. Mr Major retorted: 'If the allegations are confirmed, I condemn it unreservedly. But as has been made clear, this is the start of the legal process. 'Unlike you, most people will prefer to wait until that is completed and not to find people guilty until and unless they are proven to be guilty.' Mr John Gummer, environment secretary, also urged MPs to reserve judgment until the auditor's final report was completed. However, he added: 'If these allegations turn out to be supported and proved, no one will be tougher in opposition to them or in my insistence that the law should take its course.'</p>

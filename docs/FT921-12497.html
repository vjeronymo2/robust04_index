			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Reckitt to lose its North American spice RECKITT &amp; COLMAN, the food and household products group, plans to get out of the highly-competitive spice market in North America through disposals worth Dollars 88m (Pounds 49m). The group has agreed to sell its US-based Durkee-French spice and seasoning business for Dollars 80m in cash to Burns Philp Food, a subsidiary of the Australian food and hardware group, Burns Philp. Reckitt will also sell its Canadian spice business to Burns Philp for Dollars 8m. US supermarkets have in recent years seen a price war between Durkee-French and the Schwartz brand, which belongs to McCormick, the US group which is the world's largest supplier of spices. Reckitt said it was happy to be leaving what had become a low-margin, commodity of type business. The disposals were part of its strategy of concentrating on its higher-margin, branded consumer franchises. The group would retain a strong portfolio of brands such as French's Mustard, RedHot Sauce, French Fried Onions and Cattlemen's Barbecue Sauces. Proceeds of the disposals, which are subject to regulatory consents, will be used to reduce Reckitt's indebtedness. Net debt currently stands at about Pounds 358m, giving gearing of 55 per cent.</p>

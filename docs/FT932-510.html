			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / Gloom surrounds Italian wage bargaining talks MR GINO GIUGNI, Italy's labour minister, warned that crucial talks between employers and trade unions on a new wage bargaining system had got off to a difficult final week yesterday, with employers determined to get a favourable agreement. The talks, which the government wants to conclude by Monday, have faltered on difficulties in bridging differences over simplifying the bargaining system and increasing labour flexibility. Mr Giugni said: 'The chances of reaching an agreement. . . . have gone down.' He said yesterday's meeting between ministers and the Confindustria employers' federation had 'gone badly' and warned that 'big difficulties' remained. The government would present a compromise document later this week. Meanwhile, officials denied weekend reports that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, prime minister, had threatened that the government could fall if the negotiations failed to succeed. The government opted for separate meetings with the unions and employers after trilateral talks last week made only limited progress. Ministers are due to meet union representatives tomorrow. However, chances of reaching a settlement have been complicated by internal difficulties for two of the three union federations. On the first day of its annual conference in Rome, debate at the big CISL trade union federation was overshadowed by allegations that Mr Sergio D'Antoni, its leader, had accepted payments from a leading industrialist implicated in the political corruption scandal. Mr D'Antoni said he would contact Milan magistrates opportunity to rebut the allegations by Mr Vincenzo Lodigiani, a prominent industrialist, that he paid illicit contributions to the CISL and the UIL union federations. Separately, internal pressures within the CGIL, the biggest union federation, mounted as Mr Bruno Trentin, its leader, held out against a capitulation to employers' demands.</p>

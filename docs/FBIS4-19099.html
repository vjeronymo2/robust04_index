			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams by an </F> unidentified correspondent; place and date not given: "The IRA  Is Invincible"]    [Text] [Correspondent] Mr. Adams, were you informed in  advance about the IRA attacks on London's Heathrow Airport?    [Adams] No, never. Where did you get that idea from?    [Correspondent] Are you acquainted with the persons who  carried out this terrorist action?    [Adams] No. You forget that the Sinn Fein is separate from  the IRA.    [Correspondent] If you are not acquainted with IRA leaders,  how can you make the IRA stop its armed operations?    [Adams] One does not have to know the IRA activists  personally in order to move things along. My wish is to  demilitarize the Anglo-Irish conflict. Two armed groups are  facing each other in this conflict, the British Army and the  militant pro-British groups from Northern Ireland on the one  hand, and the relatively smaller IRA on the other. They must  all lay down their arms at the same time.    [Correspondent] You are the Irish politician with the  greatest influence on the IRA leadership because of your origins  as a Catholic-Republican resistance fighter. You cannot say you  have no connection with the IRA leadership.    [Adams] I have never dissociated myself from the IRA. That  would be a dishonorable thing to do. But while I am politically  active, the IRA is an armed, secret organization. I would like  it to stop its actions.    [Correspondent] Do you see any chance of that?    [Adams] The IRA is not going to stop unilaterally. In order  to speed the peace process along, I would like the British  Government to commence talks with our Sinn Fein. Then I could  go to the IRA and, hopefully, offer it a packet of solutions  that would permit it to reach a final decision on future policy.  The British Army has been trying to beat the IRA for 25 years.  But the IRA has not been beatable. On the contrary, it looks  as if the IRA could continue its armed actions forever.    [Correspondent] In other words, war to the very last?    [Adams] No. For Ireland, there is no military solution. We  have a political problem here, and it needs a political  solution. I have been trying to break the military stalemate  for years. Several times the IRA has publicly said that the  initiative coming from me and from John Hume, leader of the  Social Democratic party in Northern Ireland, could provide the  basis for peace. Hume and I suggested a roundtable of all  parties involved.    [Correspondent] Your credibility as a man of peace collapsed  when you were one of the pall-bearers of the coffin of the IRA  terrorist Thomas Begley, who killed nine persons in a bomb  attack in Belfast's Shankill Road. Does this gesture not have  the effect of a nod of approval to violence?    [Adams] What is violence? There is institutionalized  violence, the violence of the state. I was a victim of this  violence when the British Army locked me up for five years.    [Correspondent] Let us not get philosophical. What do you  say to the murder of innocent civilians?    [Adams] I am against that, of course. What happened in  Shankill Road was unforgivable and wrong.    [Correspondent] Then why do you help carry Begley's coffin?    [Adams] The man was dead. Why should I not carry his coffin  at his funeral? I am not going to leave Thomas Begley's family  alone in their grief. I would feel the same way about any  family that loses a 19 year old son. We cannot make teenagers  responsible for this conflict -- neither British soldiers, nor  young Protestants, nor IRA volunteers.    [Correspondent] After 25 years of bloodshed and 3,400  deaths, you said during your recent U.S. visit that "this  generation is going to see peace in Ireland." What makes you so  sure?    [Adams] The world climate of solving conflicts. If I had  said five years ago that Nelson Mandela would be released from  prison and become South Africa's president-designate, everyone  would have thought I was joking. The conflict seemed insoluble.    [Correspondent] Just like the conflict in Northern Ireland.    [Adams] I hope the progress in Africa also provides a signal  for people here in Ireland. The turnabout in South Africa  occurred because Mandela's enemy, the government of Pretoria,  was prepared to swallow the bitter pill and make concessions  that set the process in motion. The government in London should  learn something from that.    [Correspondent] Nonetheless, the London government has  already taken a big step and held secret talks with the IRA and  Sinn Fein. Do you think Prime Minister Major is determined to  find a political solution for Northern Ireland?    [Adams] British public opinion would surely approve the  taking of risks in order to achieve peace in Ireland, but  unfortunately Major is too much a victim of the obsessions of  his party's right wing, as well as being a victim of the  Unionists, the Northern Irish party that wants Northern Ireland  to belong to Great Britain at all costs. Major's weakness is an  obstacle to a peaceful solution. That is why we must seek other  ways of attaining our goal.    [Correspondent] London treats you like a persona non grata.  You cannot travel to England, Scotland, or Wales, and you  cannot be heard or seen on radio or television.    [Adams] That is just one example of the British Government's  stupidity.    [Correspondent] You and your family survive all attacks.  Once you were hit by five bullets when you entered a Belfast  restaurant. Do you feel in greater danger now that you are  involved in the peace process?    [Adams] I feel no hatred toward the people who tried to  shoot  me, nor toward those who might be planning to do so now. That  is the way things are here. Men act this way because they see  me as a danger to their interests. There is only one way: The  armed wings of the radical pro-British groups must be involved  in the peace process just like the IRA.    [Correspondent] Are you really prepared to sit down at the  negotiating table with your archenemies the Protestants?    [Adams] This has nothing to do with religion. My enemies  are not the Protestants. We are talking about political groups,  and they must all take part in the talks. There must be  dialogue without preconditions. Certain people have been  excluded for too long, and that is why no progress has been made.    [Correspondent] With your readiness for compromise, you will  also turn IRA hardliners into your opponents. For them, your  policy means treason. Do you not think that the next bullet  fired at you might come from an IRA weapon?    [Adams] No. The IRA would have to join the back of the line  of my potential assassins.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Ming Man and Michael Smith] </F>   [Text] British Minister with special responsibility for  Hong Kong Alistair Goodlad will meet legislators this morning  for talks on the plight of Hong Kong's 6,000 ethnic minority  residents after 1997.    Goodlad arrived in Hong Kong yesterday for a three-day visit  to discuss Hong Kong's political future with Governor Chris  Patten and the Executive Council.    His arrival came as British opposition spokesman on foreign  affairs Jack Cunningham announced he would meet Chinese leaders  in Beijing later this month for talks on Hong Kong's future.    While China has virtually severed ties with British and Hong  Kong officials it has approved the visit by Britain's Labour  spokesman on the territory.    Cunningham will meet Vice Foreign Minister Jiang Enzhu and  head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Lu Ping, as well  as other Chinese leaders.    Cunningham will also visit Hong Kong for talks with  political  and business leaders, including Patten.    Goodlad's visit comes 10 days before Patten flies to London  to meet Prime Minister John Major to discuss the next moves over  Hong Kong's political future.    Goodlad said he hoped there would be further talks with  China  over constitutional reform despite China's threat to disband the  legislature after 1997.    "We would think it would be highly desirable that there  should be a through train and we hope to continue discussions  with the Chinese side on that subject," Goodlad said.    "We very much hope there would be further talks on the  important subjects for the prosperity and the stability of Hong  Kong."    The minister had a one-hour meeting with Patten and spoke to  Executive Councillors yesterday as well as attending a cocktail  party with Financial Secretary Sir Hamish Macleod and some of  Hong Kong's leading businessmen.    Goodlad will go to the new airport site as well as visiting  the Black Point power station in Tuen Mun today.    But this morning Goodlad will confront the Legislative  Council's Nationality Committee to explain why the British  government has refused to grant citizenship to more than 6,000  ethnic minority residents who will be left stateless after 1997.    Topping the agenda will be the move by the House of Lords to  give non-Chinese ethnics [as published] the right of abode in  Britain.    The bill, which was introduced by Lord Bonham-Carter last  month, has majority support in the House of Lords but will be  blocked by the government in the House of Commons.    Committee chairman and independent legislator Emily Lau said  she wanted Goodlad to explain the government's position over the  controversial legislation.    "Like a bad penny, we'll keep showing up," she said.</p>

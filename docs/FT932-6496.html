			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Backward step in Latin America: Guatemala is only the latest state to see anti-democratic action, but some countries are changing LATIN America's new democracies look embattled. The bright new morning of 1991, when every country in Latin America and the Caribbean was being run by an elected government, has gone. The idea that Latin America was at last going to become a democratic continent espousing free market principles, beloved of former US President George Bush and adopted by the Clinton administration, has taken a battering. This week's suspension of the constitution in Guatemala by President Jorge Serrano follows closely on the suspension from office of Venezuelan President Carlos Andres Perez to face corruption charges. Two military coup attempts last year unsuccessfully tried to unseat Mr Perez. Elsewhere in Latin America, Brazil's President Fernando Collor resigned to avoid impeachment for corruption at the end of last year. In April 1992, President Alberto Fujimori of Peru suspended the constitution. The developments in Peru and Guatemala have underlined the immense difficulty of taking international action to reverse anti-democratic actions. This was most forcefully demonstrated in the case of Haiti, where the military overthrew elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in October 1991. Economic sanctions imposed by the Organisation of American States have been largely ineffective and the military has not been persuaded to step down. According to Mr George Philip, reader in Latin American Politics at the London School of Economics, the impression of international helplessness may have been accentuated by the current perceived weakness in US foreign policy, as exemplified by the anguished policy debate over Bosnia. The role of the military in the region also gives cause for concern. The era of dictatorships headed by bemedalled generals may be over, yet in the 1990s the military in many countries prefers to exercise its power behind the scenes. 'In Guatemala, you have an elected president suspending congress. It's very ambiguous; it makes it difficult to produce an international response,' said Mr Kenneth Maxwell of the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Peru, for instance, regained access to loans from the international financial institutions after a new congress was elected. Yet the freedom of action of that congress continues to be severely constrained by the constant threat of military intervention. Mr Serrano's move looked almost identical to Mr Fujimori's. He cited opposition in congress to economic reform, the influence of drugs traffickers and corruption as the reasons behind his 'self coup'. Like perhaps a third of Guatemalans, Mr Serrano is an evangelical Protestant, a group which helped bring Mr Fujimori to power in Peru. Both men preside over societies deeply divided on racial lines and both countries face leftist insurgencies. Yet, according to Mr Victor Bulmer-Thomas, head of the Institute of Latin American Studies in London, there is an important difference. While the Peruvian military could make a reasonable case that its hand needed strengthening in the battle against the left-wing Sendero Luminoso guerrillas, the Guatemalan military remained almost unconstrained by the trappings of democratic government. The military's role behind Mr Serrano's action could be a warning signal to future governments not to try to meddle in its affairs, for example in the field of human rights. Even in democratic Brazil the military has been growing restive, pressing for more funds and criticising the record of the civilian government. Another important common thread is the difficult relationship between the president and congress in many countries. The problems in making these relationships work grow when the judiciary lacks independence or is perceived as weak or corrupt. Corruption clearly remains a pretext for military intervention in Latin America. In some countries, the military is responsible for a good part of it and plays a role in drugs trafficking. In Brazil and Venezuela, however, the corruption cases reflect in part a genuine change towards a more open and accountable society. While the motivations of those pursuing charges against the heads of state were mixed, there is at least a hint that politicians in some countries have lost their immunity from prosecution. The political tensions emerging in both countries over the last two years are partly due to a clash between genuine democratic tendencies and old-style oligarchic politics. In many Latin American countries, the outcome of this clash is yet to be resolved. The moves in Guatemala do not provide much cause for optimism, but if Latin America no longer looks like the democratic continent it did two years ago, then that was because two years ago appearances deceived. The fact is, elections do not make for democracy, but are part of a process which needs to be supplemented by a host of other factors, such as judicial independence and a respect for the rule of law.</p>

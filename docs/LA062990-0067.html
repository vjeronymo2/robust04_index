			<p><P> June 29, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AID TO BUSINESS -- AND FEAR OF TOURISM EFFECT;  </P> <P> ECONOMY: THE REBUILDING WILL EMPLOY CONTRACTORS, LENDERS AND INSURANCE  ADJUSTERS. AND HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS WILL BENEFIT FROM THE DISPLACED. BUT  VISITORS MAY STAY AWAY.  </P> <P> As contractors and lenders ready for the rebuilding that lies ahead and hotels  and restaurants fill with displaced residents, firefighters and armies of  insurance adjusters, the devastating Santa Barbara fire has left the area with  a tragic business boomlet.  </P> <P> But behind confident official predictions that tourists will still flock to the  picturesque beach town, there is worry that the seemingly endless drought and  devastating fire will hurt one of Santa Barbara's most important industries --  tourism -- at least for a time. In the end, residents say they will rebuild and  get on with life, just as they did after the last big fire in 1977.  </P> <P> "When things aren't right in paradise, people want to know why," said Ed Caro,  president of the California Restaurant Assn.'s Santa Barbara chapter. "But we  will rebound quickly here in Santa Barbara."  </P> <P> The fire that blasted an area just west of Santa Barbara did its worst work on  homes -- destroying more than 500 of the county's 75,000 houses.  </P> <P> Most of the businesses destroyed were small mom-and-pop operations, including  such Santa Barbara institutions as the Philadelphia House restaurant and nearby  Eller Donuts. Some of the area's large nurseries also were damaged.  </P> <P> Contractors and lenders began gearing up for more business than they have seen  in a long time because of generally sluggish conditions in the building  industry coupled with the city's official no-growth philosophy.  </P> <P> "Now that it's happened, the job is to get it cleaned up as fast as we can,"  said Mike Lee, owner of Lee Construction in Santa Barbara. Lee warned that the  1977 fire, which destroyed more than 200 homes, drew many unscrupulous  operators who bilked victims anxious to rebuild quickly.  </P> <P> Santa Barbara hotel operators, who typically see 90% summer occupancy rates,  expect the fire to have little effect on business.  </P> <P> "It may scare some tourists away this weekend, but as far as the impact on the  business, that'll be taken up by people who were displaced from their homes,"  said Ron Derrico, general manager of a Holiday Inn. Several insurance companies  are sending agents into the area and they, too, will fill hotels.  </P> <P> Derrico reported his motel's 156 rooms occupied Thursday, in part by residents  forced from homes.  </P> <P> Guests at the Cathedral Oaks Lodge, about half a mile from burned areas,  included firefighters and police officers. Lee Ann Davis, a desk clerk at the  hotel, expected to rent all 126 rooms Thursday.  </P> <P> Hotels were offering hefty discounts to those forced from their homes. The  Holiday Inn charged $50 a night for rooms normally priced at $110. The Santa  Barbara Inn billed guests $60 a night, compared to $149 or $169.  </P> <P> "We're giving people rooms for just what it costs to clean them," said desk  clerk Joe Cabe.  </P> <P> But when residents find someplace else to stay and insurance adjusters go home,  will tourists return to fill the rooms?  </P> <P> Santa Barbara Chamber of Commerce Director Steve Cushman says yes, predicting  minimal damage to an industry that makes up 30% of the area's economy.  </P> <P> "People are still playing volleyball on the beach . . . and eating and carrying  on as usual," said Caro, director of human resources for Carrows Restaurants.  </P> <P> But some are concerned.  </P> <P> "Things like the drought and the threat of fire could definitely alter people's  plans to make us a stop on their vacation or weekend trip," said Gary Dorothy,  owner of Stampa Barbara, billed as the world's largest rubber stamp store.  </P> <P> Said one local business executive, who noted fewer tour buses in town: "People  are going to say, 'Drought, fire, it's just trouble. Let's not go to Santa  Barbara . . . dear. Let's go to San Francisco,' "  </P> <P> Zena Drewisch, executive director of the Santa Barbara Board of Realtors, lost  her house in the 1977 fire, Thursday was coordinating volunteers who were  helping displaced residents find shelter. "People rebuilt and went on from  there" 13 years ago, she said. "I imagine people will rebuild again."  </P></p>

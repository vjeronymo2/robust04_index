			<p>BFN     [Text] The oil companies financing the armed forces of the  Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola-Labor Party  [MPLA-PT], backed by mercenaries, must stop doing so, unless  they want to see their interests set ablaze. This warning comes  from the Armed Forces Command of the National Union for the  Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] in Soyo region, which has  been closely following the concentration of troops and  logistical equipment in Cabinda to carry out attacks on Soyo.  The source said the situation still remains under control.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Markets Report: Dollar puzzle Ambiguous economic data in the US yesterday prevented foreign exchange markets from getting a clear idea of the outlook for the dollar, writes Philip Gawith. The employment report, which the market had anxiously anticipated all week, was such a curate's egg as to leave unresolved the question of whether monetary policy should be further tightened. Renewed concerns about tension in Iraq, however, supported the dollar against the yen. The US currency closed in London at Y100.225, from Y99.75. It was the first time in five weeks that the dollar had closed above Y100. The dollar finished against the D-Mark at DM1.5411 from DM1.5444. Elsewhere, the focus stayed on the Italian lira and the Finnish markka. The Italian currency weakened after police raided the offices of prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest company. After touching a low of L1,020 against the D-Mark, it closed at L1,018, from L1,014. The Finnish currency maintained its recent run to reach FM3.075 against the D-Mark, from FM3.09,and other Nordic currencies rose in its wake. Sterling had an uneventful day, finishing at DM2.4511, from DM2.4526. Against the dollar it closed at Dollars 1.5905 from DM1.5888. For most analysts, it is a question of when, rather than if, the Fed next tightens. It is now expected to wait for next week's inflation, retail sales and industrial production data before making any move. The outlook for the dollar against the yen is slightly different. Some observers attribute the dollar's close above Y100 to the Iraq effect. Tensions in the region pushed oil prices to an eight-week high, and the yen has traditionally suffered from high oil prices. Mr Mike Gallagher, of the financial consultancy IDEA, said a re-rating of the yen was clearly underway. Having been firmly bullish of the currency, the market was now more neutral, following last weekend's US-Japan trade agreement. This view was borne out by movement in the yen yesterday. Despite firmer money market rates, apparently tolerated by the Bank of Japan, and hence encouraging speculation that the BOJ might wish to raise official rates, the yen maintained its weaker tone. Mr Brian Marber, a technical analyst, said that by closing above Y100, the dollar had broken the downtrend. The intermediate trend against the yen, he said, was now up. Against the D-Mark, however, Mr Marber was less sanguine. He said he remained of the view that the dollar would still break downwards. He said it had already done so against the Swiss franc, and this often tended to lead the dollar on the downside. He predicted that if the dollar closed below DM1.5350, breaking a pattern of five weeks, 'it goes down a lot further'. Mr Marber said it was not unprecedented for a currency to be rising against some currencies, while weakening against others. The Bank of England provided UK money markets with Pounds 480m assistance, compared to a forecast shortage of Pounds 600m. Three month sterling LIBOR was unchanged at 6 per cent. The firmer performance of gilts helped the short sterling market, with the December contract finishing at 93.37 from 93.30.</p>

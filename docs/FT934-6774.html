			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / International Company News: Austrian oil group sees Sch1bn deficit OMV, the Austrian oil and chemicals group, has reported heavier nine-month operating losses and forecast an operating deficit of around Sch1bn (Dollars 83m) for 1993 as a whole. Nine-month turnover was Sch59.44bn, down from Sch60.73bn in the same period of 1992. Operating losses for the nine months were Sch735m compared with Sch383m. Restructuring, including plant closures and drastic cost-cutting measures in the plastics and chemicals divisions, will cause extraordinary losses of about Sch3.7bn and bring the full-year net loss to Sch4.7bn. Mr Richard Schenz, chairman, said the losses were due to the severe recession in the chemicals business and low crude oil prices. The gas business was the group's most profitable activity and there was a small profit from refining.</p>

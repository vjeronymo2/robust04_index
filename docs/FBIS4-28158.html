			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mun Yong-nok] </F>   [Excerpts] The functionaries, party members, and workers  of Pyongsong City food administration highly upheld the militant  task presented in this year's New Year Address by the great  leader and the decisions made at the 21st plenary meeting of the  Sixth Party Central Committee, and vigorously launched into the  work to carry out the tasks of the first year of the adjusting  period in unison. They were successful in producing new corn  rice through an industrial method of which scientists in the  related sectors had conducted research. [passage omitted]    Extending over several occasions, the great leader gave  taught about improving the people's dietary life by solving the  problem of processing corn which is produced on a large scale in  our country. Also, the dear comrade leader personally looked  over the corn rice newly developed at an institute in fall of  last year and clearly elucidated the direction and method of  producing corn rice through an industrial way. [passage omitted]    The new corn rice which is being produced on a large scale  at  this work site through an industrial method is considerably  superior in its shape, color, and quality compared with the  previous corn rice.    The new corn rice swells two times better than the previous  corn rice and swells more than white rice. Therefore, when we  cook the corn rice, it swells over three times. When eating, we  can combine corn rice with the white rice or we can just eat the  corn rice.    Also, since the new corn rice melts over 20 percent less  than  the previous corn rice, it doesn't melt well in water and its  degree of white color and stickiness are high. Therefore, when  this is cooked, it not only looks and tastes delicious, it is  very digestive.    The new corn rice hardens over 40 percent less than the  previous corn rice.    The functionaries, party members, workers, and technicians  of  the Pyongsong food administration work site who were successful  in producing the new corn rice through an industrial method are  all the more consolidating the results that have already been  achieved, and are also achieving results in carrying out the  work to supplement more nutritive elements for the new corn rice.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 22 (YONHAP) -- The government will call  a unification and national security policy coordination meeting  Thursday morning to discuss strategy at a preliminary contact  for the proposed inter-Korean summit and the formation of a  delegation to the contact.    The meeting participants will draw up Seoul's position on  issues expected to come up at the preliminary contact and  consider possible proposals by the Northern side.    Song Yong-tae, vice national unification minister, said  Wednesday that the government will give Pyongyang a list of the  members of Seoul's delegation to the contact and its entourage  upon obtaining presidential approval and simultaneously make a  public announcement on formation of the delegation.    Song said, however, that the North will not necessarily be  handed the list on Thursday.</p>

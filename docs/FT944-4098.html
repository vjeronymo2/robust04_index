			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / International Company News: Restructure helps James Hardie rise to ADollars 37.1m James Hardie, the Australian building materials group undergoing a comprehensive restructuring and management changes, yesterday reported improved profits for the six months to end-September, at ADollars 37.1m (USDollars 30.2m) after tax. The company said it was firmly on track to achieve its forecast of a strong recovery in profits for the full year. The first-half figure was almost double last time's ADollars 19.5m, and scored on sales up to ADollars 955.4m from ADollars 862.9m. Earnings per share for the first half were 9.9 cents, compared with 5.3 cents in the first half of 1993-94. The interim dividend goes up to 6.5 cents from 6 cents. Hardie attributed the improvement to its extensive restructuring programme, and more focus on the core building sector markets. It said all divisions had posted better results, with the exception of James Hardie Pipelines in Australia. Here, PVC costs increases and 'unruly trading conditions' ate into margins. It said a number of divisions which had made losses last time moved into the black. These included the bathroom products division, the New Zealand building services operations and the irrigation unit in Australia. There were gains in the US, where Hardie posted an operating profit of ADollars 10.9m, on sales of ADollars 172m. The bottom-line figures were also helped by lower interest charges, down to ADollars 7.9m from ADollars 10.1m. Hardie shares closed unchanged at ADollars 1.96 yesterday. Coca-Cola Amatil, the Australian-based soft drinks company which is 51 per cent owned by the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola group, said yesterday it was about to start manufacturing soft drink products in the Ukraine, in a joint venture with the Kolos brewery in L'viv. The production company will be 57 per cent owned by CCA and 43 per cent by Kolos, with CCA granted management rights. Its capital will be about USDollars 11.5m. CCA has been building interests in central and eastern Europe, and has representation in Austria, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak republics. This year, it announced moves into Belarus and Slovenia, and is in talks to acquire companies supplying Coca-Cola products to much of Poland. The company said a wholly-owned sales and distribution operation was supplying Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, from Hungarian bottling plants, but the L'viv plant, which was close to completion, would service the western part of the country.</p>

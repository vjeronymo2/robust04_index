			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Shevardnadze calls for western aid to avert 'catastrophe' SOVIET economic reform requires technical and financial assistance from the west if it is to succeed, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the former Soviet foreign minister, urged yesterday. His plea was made during a speech to the Brookings Institution in Washington before he saw President George Bush and Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, with whom he developed a close working relationship until his resignation last year. The US is opposed to direct economic assistance to the Soviet Union at present, in view of its deteriorating economic condition and political uncertainties. Mr Bush has not taken a decision on a Soviet request for a further Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 880m) in US export credit guarantees to finance purchases of American corn, wheat and soyabeans, though many officials doubt whether approval should be given. Mr Shevardnadze said yesterday these credits were 'a very acute issue' for the Soviet Union. He said the decision 'will to a large extent determine the fate of reform and democracy in the Soviet Union. We have very little time.' He argued that the Soviet Union could 'not avoid getting assistance from the outside. This is not supposed to be a form of charitable assistance, but rather technological, intellectual and financial assistance on very favourable terms.' He said mistakes were being corrected and it was important 'to strengthen the new tendencies which are emerging and head for cardinal reforms, for the implementation of the laws which have already been adopted calling for the transition to a market economy.' Mr Shevardnadze warned that if these reforms were stifled there was not simply a risk of material loss but also 'a return of our country to the past would be a catastrophe.' He repeated earlier warnings about the threat of dictatorship which might emerge from a situation of chaos. This danger was 'very severe' during the autumn and winter, but every day the threat of such a development became less. Soviet migration law, Page 4</p>

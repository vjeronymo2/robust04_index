			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Wellcome sale may offer up to 330m shares: Medical charity expected to reduce holding in UK drugs group to about 35% WELLCOME TRUST, the medical charity, is expected to indicate today that it will sell about 320m to 330m shares in Wellcome, reducing its stake in the drugs group to about 35 per cent, in the global offering scheduled for next month. Robert Fleming, which is co-ordinating the issue, is understood to have received good indications of interest in the issue, particularly from UK investors, but also from the US. Wellcome Trust holds 73.5 per cent of Wellcome, which went public in 1986. It said in March it wanted to reduce its stake to below 50 per cent, although it aimed to retain a 25 per cent holding as a long-term investment. A reduction to 25 per cent would involve the sale of 417m shares, worth Pounds 3.8bn (Dollars 7.1bn) at yesterday's closing share price of 913p, down 18p. Fleming is to employ the 'green shoe' mechanism, whereby a further 15 per cent can be sold. This allows the merchant bank to over-allot shares which it can then buy from Wellcome Trust or it can buy shares in the after-market to stabilise the price. Full use of the green shoe would mean a further 50m shares being sold, taking the total available to around 380m. If demand for the issue continues strong, the deal could also be increased, possibly to the 417m share maximum. It is thought that UK investors will be allocated roughly half the shares available, with the US taking a quarter. The remainder would be spread between the regional syndicates in Japan, France, Germany, Switzerland, the Pacific Rim and the rest of the world. That would still leave Wellcome with a lower percentage of its shares held in the US than rivals such as Glaxo. Only about 2 per cent of Wellcome's shares are held in North America while 45 per cent of its turnover was made there in 1991. The group hoped the share sale would increase the proportion of its shares held in the US and it is seeking a New York Stock Exchange listing as part of the sale. There has been some nervousness about new issues recently as the UK and Japanese stock markets have weakened. Last week, GPA cancelled its flotation at the last minute but analysts say GPA's issue was an entirely different animal to the secondary offering of Wellcome shares. The indicated figure of the number of shares to be sold will be fine-tuned once the bidding process begins. The formal marketing campaign for the issue starts today. Under the timetable for the issue, the offer period will open on July 6 and a closing date will be set two to three weeks later. The tender book-building process will begin with investors putting in indicative bids for the number of shares they are prepared to buy at certain prices to regional syndicate managers. After the close of the tender period, a price will be struck which will be the basis for a UK public offer. Market report, Page 29</p>

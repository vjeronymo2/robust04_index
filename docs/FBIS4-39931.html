			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature: Compiled by </F> Nikolay Zherebtsov, Andrey Petrovskiy; edited by Vladimir  Shishlin]    [Text] On Thursday President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree  "On Participation of the Russian Federation in the Peacekeeping  Operation in the Zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian Conflict".    As reports the presidential press service, issuance of this  decree was caused by aggravation of the situation in the  conflict zone, support of this peacekeeping operation on the  part of CIS countries, and the request on the part of Georgian  and Abkhazian leaders to urgently deploy peacekeeping forces in  the conflict zone.    Yeltsin commissioned the government to ensure formation of  an  appropriate military contingent on the basis of the Russian  units which have the status of peacekeeping forces by using the  infrastructure of the Group of the Russian Forces in  Transcaucases. The Russian contingent can be later on  strengthened on the decision of the Federation Council of the RF  Federal Assembly.    The decree is to go into effect since the moment of its  signing, however, in accordance with the RF Constitution the  Federation Council is to determine the time of the operation.  The next sitting of the upper chamber has been scheduled for  June 21, however, Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of the chamber,  does not rule out that he would convene an extraordinary sitting  to consider this issue. IF Note: The previous week the upper  chamber of the Russian parliament declined Boris Yeltsin's  request to approve introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces  into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict (with a  majority of only one vote).    Meanwhile, on Thursday Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev  reported to Interfax in Yerevan that everything is ready for the  introduction of peacekeeping forces into the zone of the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict, "however, decision of politicians  is needed to start the operation."</p>

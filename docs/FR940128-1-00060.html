			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Decomposition can also occur before the fish are removed from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the harvest water if the fish dies in capture nets or on long  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> lines. In such an event, the degree of decomposition will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reflect the sea temperature, time in the water, and particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> species (Ref. 118). It is not uncommon to encounter water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperatures of 80  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F to 90  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F in tropical waters, which can  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce rapid decomposition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Thus, rapid cooling of fish when they are captured is very  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> important to prevent initiation of the process by which histamine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is produced. Fish subjected to 68  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F for periods as short as one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> day, a practice which can happen in warm climates on fishing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessels, will yield high levels of histamine, even if the fish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are later stored at refrigerated temperatures (Ref. 117).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  For these reasons, the guideline advises that processors of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fish and fishery products from scombroid toxin forming species  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must ensure that their raw materials are essentially free of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decomposition and histamine as a result of time/temperature abuse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that occurred before the processor received them. The guideline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provides for three interrelated controls for the processor to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply with regard to raw materials. For the first processor that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> takes ownership after harvest, these are: (1) Time/temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> records from the harvesting vessel (Appendix B, section 3.a.1.);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) organoleptic examination of the fish from the harvesting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel for decomposition (Appendix B, section 3.a.2.); and (3)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histamine analysis, if warranted by the time/temperature history  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the fish as revealed by the time/temperature record from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel or by the results of the organoleptic examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (Appendix B, section 3.a.3.), or both. Time/temperature records  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the vessel indicate whether entire lots from the vessel may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be suspect, and thus in need of a histamine examination, because  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unusual events on the vessel. Such records would not normally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reveal, however, whether there are individual fish in the lot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that may have decomposition. An organoleptic examination for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decomposition serves to screen individual fish. It also serves  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as a way to verify the time/temperature records from the vessel  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with regard to an entire lot. If organoleptic examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reveals an unusually high number of fish with decomposition, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entire lot should be considered suspect and subjected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> histamine analysis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Appendix B, section 3.a.1. provides for how the first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> processor can take measures to determine whether the fish were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> properly harvested and handled on board the harvesting vessel.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certification of the mode of capture, including information on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the time between physical capture and bringing the fish on board,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> handling techniques, and the use of temperature logs onboard the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vessel that record that time/temperature history of the fish (for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, catch date and time, means and rate of cooling, storage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> temperature, and refrigerated brine or seawater temperature)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provide documentation to the processor and to regulatory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorities that the fish were properly handled. Such records on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the handling of the fish should be part of an HACCP system and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> can be used in the specific HACCP plans of processors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

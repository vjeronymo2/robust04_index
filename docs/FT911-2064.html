			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Offices raided in Japanese insider trading probe JAPANESE prosecutors yesterday raided the offices of a listed company, Macross Corporation, and the home of its senior managing director after the Ministry of Finance decided to press charges of alleged insider trading. The raids were seen by the financial establishment as genuine evidence of attempts to combat insider trading, although the case involves a range of small investors and a relatively small amount of disputed funds, about Y10m (Pounds 42,700). Mr Yoshio Kamijo, 55, the Macross senior managing director, is alleged to have sold 22,000 shares in the company ahead of a damaging announcement last September that a separate Macross official had booked a fictitious share sale. The Finance Ministry, offended in the past by foreign criticism that insider trading is endemic in Japan, said investigators believed the advance sale saved Mr Kamijo from a holding loss of about Y10m. Mr Veji Sasaki, Macross president and head of an investor group and mail-order house called Friends of Freesia, said Mr Kamijo had sold the shares but maintained the timing of the sale was a coincidence. Yesterday's raid is only the second since a revised Securities and Exchange Law came into force in April 1989, banning company executives or employees from trading in a company's shares in advance of important announcements. The maximum penalty is six months imprisonment. The other raid, in April last year, also involved a company on the financial fringe - Nisshin Steamship, a shipping and leisure industry operator - and followed allegations of share purchases ahead of an announcement of a third-party allotment. Macross, listed on the second section of the Tokyo exchange, is an engineering equipment maker long managed by the same family but taken over by Mr Sasaki in February. He emphasised yesterday that the alleged offence took place under the company's previous management. Mr Sasaki rose to prominence after launching an unsuccessful Dollars 450 (Pounds 264m) bid last year for Avon Japan, the Japanese arm of Avon Products, the US cosmetics and toiletries company. His aggressive share purchases and unorthodox methods have made him a favourite of Japan's tabloid press, but excluded him from the financial establishment. A Finance Ministry official said it was 'regrettable' that a senior official of a listed company should be at the centre of an investigation, but said the ministry was determined to prevent insider trading on Japanese exchanges.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / FT Exporter (22): Sales are up but jobs numbers fall - Analysis / Review of the FT's latest list of Top 100 UK Exporters and finds that there has been little movement among leading companies The improvement in the world economy, the growing competitiveness in some sectors of UK industry, and the 1992 devaluation of sterling left many of the top British exporters enjoying strong sales growth abroad last year. However, the FT's latest survey of leading exporters suggests that the overall growth in exports did not lead to much job creation within the UK, with most of the more successful exporters reducing workforces during the year in an attempt to achieve greater productivity. Overall, the survey indicates that there has been little significant movement in the ranking of top exporters, with foreign-owned companies still representing a large proportion of the export table. The rankings of the three largest exporters, British Aerospace, British Petroleum and Shell UK, remain unchanged amid good export growth. Together they account for about a quarter of the total export sales of the top 100. Shell and British Petroleum benefited from a strong performance in the North Sea oil and gas sector, boosted in recent months by a number of new fields coming on stream. A spokesman for BP said: 'The main growth has come from oil and gas - it's mostly down to the North Sea.' Further down the table, the rankings showed more change. Zeneca, which entered the top 100 in 1992, after Imperial Chemicals Industry hived off its bioscience subsidiary, turned in an extremely healthy export performance. The group jumped from 10th to seventh place, with a 19.4 per cent increase in exports during the year. Mr Steve Mayo, finance director at Zeneca, said that the company was 'extremely proud' of its export contribution. Although the group's main markets were still the US and Europe, increasing sales in the Far East and Latin America had contributed to the export growth, he said. However, he pointed out that the company's performance overall appeared to be flattered by the export figures themselves, because the total actual sales increase during the year had been slightly lower, at about 12 per cent, than the growth in exports. 'This is probably a better guide to the underlying performance,' he added. ICI fared slightly worse, slipping from seventh to ninth place during the year, with only a 4.3 per cent growth in exports. Meanwhile, Ford Motors, the UK market leader in the vehicle sector, fell to eighth from fourth. The drop partly reflected difficult trading conditions in Europe's car market, with Ford's exports to Europe falling by 24.4 per cent in the year. Although Nissan Motors largely shrugged off these problems, showing a 6.9 per cent export growth into Europe during the year, the European recession also affected Vauxhall, where exports fell by 44.9 per cent. The drop dragged Vauxhall's ranking down to 31 from 15. One star performer in the table, however, was Compaq, the US-owned computer group which has been rapidly building its market share in Europe after establishing production sites in Scotland seven years ago. The group leapt from 25th to 13th during the year, on the back of an impressive 113 per cent increase in exports. Most of this growth was targeted on Europe, where exports rose by 138.8 per cent as the company benefited not only from increased demand for portable computers but also from a greater market share. After being ranked as the fourth largest PC supplier in Europe in 1992, Compaq is now estimated to have the largest share of the European market, after being number two last year. This growth in the computer market appears to have benefited other companies, such as International Business Machines. Overall, however, the table does not indicate particularly strong sectoral trends. Although the UK's strength in the world chemicals industry was underlined by good performances from companies such as Glaxo, the star performers among the smaller companies came from a range of industries. British American Tobacco, for example, saw exports grow by 30 per cent, primarily as a result of expansion into Asian and other non-European markets. Marks &amp; Spencer, the retailers, saw exports grow by 21.9 per cent, pushing the company up from 56th to 27th in the rankings. One theme that does emerge from the table is that with Europe in deep recession during most of 1993, much of the strongest growth came from markets outside the European Union, particularly in the US and Far East. Hillsdown, the food producer, for example, saw exports grow by 21.2 per cent overall, but fall by 1.8 per cent in Europe. Thorn EMI saw a similar pattern, with a 2 per cent growth in overall exports and a 7 per cent fall in European markets. Meanwhile, Vosper Thorneycroft, the defence contractor, saw exports grow by 35.2 per cent in the year, but fall by 5.9 per cent in Europe. Mr Martin Jay, managing director at Vosper Thorneycroft, said that the strongest export markets had been in the Middle East and Gulf. 'In the past five years we have increased productivity in steel ships by 50 per cent,' he said. Another trend apparent from the survey is that the growth in exports has not necessarily led to significant job increases. Nearly all of the 15 top exporters cut their workforce during the year, with the only exception being Nissan Motors, which is expanding its production in the UK. The employee cuts were not necessarily related to the export growth. Shell UK, for example, saw export growth of 25.4 per cent during the year - but reduced its workforce by 12.3 per cent. At the other end of the spectrum, Arjo Wiggins reduced its workforce by 7.6 per cent, after achieving 8.4 per cent export growth in the year. Some of these cuts may not have reflected redundancies - BP, for example, points out that its 22.6 per cent reduction in its workforce also reflected divestment of a number of subsidiaries. However, in many cases they suggest that companies are continuing to seek increasingly high levels of productivity on which to base any future export growth.</p>

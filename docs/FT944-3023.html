			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Survey of Charities Investment and Finance (8): Aiming for a sectoral 'CBI' - Profile, Stuart Etherington, the new director of the NCVO Influential figures in the voluntary sector feel that it has been badly left behind in the current public and political debate over the future of welfare services. That may be about to change. Mr Stuart Etherington became director of the National Council for Voluntary Organisations, the sector's umbrella body, last month with a mandate to clarify its role and raise its profile. Although Mr Etherington comes from a charity background, his appointment to one of the sector's top posts represents a break with tradition - the NCVO employed head-hunters and considered candidates with a wide variety of experience before selecting him. This reflected a recognition by its council of the need for clear leadership during the watershed that charities are facing. 'It is not good enough for the voluntary sector to have its position formed by other people's agendas, whether of the left or the right,' says Mr Etherington. 'The sector must speak for itself.' He has a vision of turning the NCVO - which, in spite of a long and successful tradition of research and innovation, carries minimal political influence - into a voluntary sector CBI. Doubters say that, since not all the NCVO's member charities share common interests, it would be difficult for a central organisation to speak with a strong, clear voice on sensitive issues. But neither do all CBI affiliates share common interests; and there is, the new director points out, a greater spirit of co-operation in the voluntary sector, even among 'competitor' charities, than in industry. Mr Etherington, a qualified social worker recruited from the Royal National Institute for Deaf People (RNID), where he had been chief executive for three years, is part of a new managerial tradition that is gradually developing in the voluntary sector. A London Business School MBA, he is proud of the businesslike innovations - like running customer and staff satisfaction surveys - that he introduced at the RNID. The charity flourished under his leadership, with staff doubling to 850 in three years. Growth was fuelled by the fact that the RNID has made a clear choice in favour of delivering services under contract to public bodies - probably the most sensitive single issue to face the voluntary sector in recent years. Etherington acknowledges that the question of whether charities should put their energies into providing contract services to health and local authorities, and if so on what terms, raises difficult questions. 'Do you use charitable funds to subsidise market entry? At a time when there is pressure on public finance, are contracts likely to be set at levels which are adequate enough to enable charities to fully recover their overheads? To what extent can charities continue to innovate with new forms of services if they are bound by contracts? 'All these are issues to which we must give attention. But the biggest potential downside is the danger that charities will lose legacy income, from which many meet their core costs, if benefactors believe they are simply agencies delivering public services.' Etherington had practical experience of this difficulty while at the RNID. Some people told him 'this place is run just like a business' - and used this as an argument for refusing to donate money rather than as a tribute to the charity's efficiency. If the government wants charities to take on public services, he says, it must ensure that contract fees are sufficiently high to meet overhead costs. 'But at the moment it is going the other way - residential home fees, for example, are being squeezed down.' The NCVO is setting up a high-level commission on the future of the voluntary sector, intended to stimulate new thinking about its role and priorities. In the shorter term, Mr Etherington intends to convene a panel of charity chief executives in the spring to thrash out a set of immediate strategic priorities. 'There is not enough strategic thinking. It is difficult because the voluntary sector is so fragmented, but we must try to get better at establishing our priorities.' His own include 'putting quality and all the things that relate to it high on the agenda' - his efforts at the RNID to ensure that both its staff and those who use its services shared common objectives is an illustration of this. 'I detect a growing public anxiety about charity efficiency,' he says. 'Still tighter regulation would not be the answer - that would push smaller charities over the edge - so the solution must be through self-regulation and the setting of quality standards. 'But we must remember that the sector has real strengths. The private sector is currently much occupied with issues like corporate governance, the social responsibility of business and the management of knowledge workers - these are all subjects where the voluntary sector has something to teach others.' At last month's Charities Aid Foundation conference Mr Etherington, in his first big speech as NCVO director, called for the voluntary sector - in spite of its legendary diversity - to identify common ground. 'That common ground is surely our purpose, and that purpose has an almost lyrical simplicity: we are driven by our stakeholders, not shareholders. We are motivated not by party politics but by our beneficiaries. We are value driven, not money driven.' The language will have reassured voluntary sector traditionalists, who fear that the arrival of Mr Etherington, with his business school ideas, could lead to a further blurring of the edges between the public, private and voluntary sectors. He now faces the task of convincing those traditionalists that, while the voluntary sector may be value-driven rather than money driven, there is no virtue in amateurism for its own sake. It is not a business, but success still depends on efficiency, probity and high quality services.</p>

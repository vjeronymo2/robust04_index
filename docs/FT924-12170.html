			<p>921022 FT  22 OCT 92 / Barclays to talk on staff loan cuts BARCLAYS Bank is to talk to unions about cuts in cheap loans for staff. The specialised staff loans are for cars, school fees and holiday and retirement homes. The move is consistent with attempts by all the banks to reduce costs in the recession. Barclays Group Staff Union, which represents more than half the 77,000 staff, said the bank's agreement to talks at a regular meeting was surprising. Barclays has always argued that the benefits are not negotiable. The cuts, which will affect only new loan applications, took effect from the beginning of this month. BGSU said it had not been consulted on the cuts and warned the bank to expect a 'fierce outcry'. The union said members were still smarting from a pay award of a little more than 3 per cent on average and substantial job losses. Bifu, the banking union, which also represents Barclays staff, condemned the cuts as 'petty and penny-pinching'. It said many staff thought the announcement was a joke. Barclays said the four loans had been replaced with two packages, similar to those available to customers, but at a discount to staff. The bank said that would offer staff greater flexibility and reduce the costly administrative burden. Barclays said it was happy to talk, but as the benefits were not contractual, they were not negotiable. Unions were free to make representations on any subject, but management did not plan to change its position.</p>

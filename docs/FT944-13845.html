			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Elected 'senate' to unite engineering profession The 13-year-old Engineering Council is to be replaced with an elected 'senate', creating a united engineering profession. Yesterday's announcement is an important breakthrough in a three-year battle by Sir John Fairclough, chairman of the council. Sir John announced a proposal that would create a body to bring together the views of the institutions, industry and academia and provide a single voice for the profession. The plan was warmly welcomed last night by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary. Mr Heseltine said: 'A unified body will give the engineering profession the single influential voice it badly needs.' The council is the umbrella body for 41 professional institutions, but many engineers believe it has failed to provide an effective voice for the profession. Bigger institutions have been wary of conceding too much power to it. After several months of discussions in a policy group set up in September last year the breakthrough came with the development of a proposal for a democratically elected 'senate' to be the focal point for the profession. The senate would have two boards, one for the regulation of the profession and the other for its promotion. Board members would be selected from the 54-strong senate, 24 of whose members would be elected by institution councils from their past and present council members, 24 by engineers and technicians, and six appointed by the Privy Council. The proposals have been unanimously endorsed by the policy group, and by a meeting of the council of institution presidents. Sir John said yesterday: 'I am very optimistic.' He hopes that all the institutions will sign a declaration supporting the proposal by the end of January, allowing the new arrangements to be in place by the middle of next year. It will have to appoint a director-general. Mr Denis Filer, the council's director-general, who is due to have retired, is to see the council through its transition.</p>

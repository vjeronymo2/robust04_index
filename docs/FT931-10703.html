			<p>930206 FT  06 FEB 93 / Travel: Just don't mention Crusaders - Emma Tucker upsets a film crew but still feels relaxed in Syria 'WHY DID you decide to come to Syria this winter?' 'Because I thought it would be interesting to spend Christmas in a Moslem country.' Ahmed, our guide, looks uncomfortable, then translates into the microphone. 'Cut]' The strong television light clicks off, the microphone is lowered and Ahmed sighs. 'This is a free country,' he shrugs. 'You are not supposed to talk about religion.' The Syrian TV news crew that has sought us out in the ice-cold bar of a hotel in Latakia is ready to try again. 'Why did you decide to come to Syria this winter?' 'There are many beautiful sites in Syria,' I say cautiously, 'and I've always wanted to visit the Crusader castles.' 'Cut]' We go through the same sequence. 'No crusaders,' says Ahmed while the other travellers in the bar, now high on the local aniseed arak, fall about laughing. Eventually we come up with a suitable response. 'Syria is a beautiful country; there are many beautiful things to see and the Syrians are very friendly people.' None of this I would dispute: it just isn't my idea of an interesting answer. Six days later, in the hotel Zenobia at Palmyra, we watch the result. I appear after a string of singing children and a floating love-heart from which Hafez al-Assad, the Syrian president, waves benignly. Only Ahmed is upset. His wife, at home in Damascus, had hired two video cassette recorders to capture his moment of glory, but he is cut out of the film and another, female, voice is used for the translation into Arabic. In Palmyra it is even colder than in Latakia. Outside, snow drifts around the columns lining the great colonnade of the ancient oasis city. The Zenobia hotel, built inside the ruins, looks out across the Temple of Bel with its massive courtyard and sacrificial altar. Palmyra, which dates from the 2nd century AD, is the highlight of any trip to Syria. The spectacular remains of the city and its funerary towers are all the more impressive because Tadmor, as the Syrians call it, after the Arabic for date, is in the middle of nowhere, at the very end of the anti-Lebanon mountains, 150km from the River Orontes in the west and 200km from the Euphrates in the east. But then most historic sites in Syria are deserted. Many of the places we visited were empty, apart from in and around Damascus where busloads of Iranians swarmed around Shi'a shrines. At the Omayyed mosque in Damascus they were gathered beneath the Dome of the Eagle, the women weeping loudly as an Iranian imam, swearing revenge on the Sunnis, recounted the split in Islam. Never mind that most Syrians are Sunnis - they did not appear to mind. The 2,000 or so Iranians that visit every week go home laden with the imported electrical goods now swelling Syria's shops. At Crac des Chevaliers, the most picture-book of the Crusader castles, there was a party of German visitors. But further up the coast, at the castles of Sahyun and Qalaat Marqab, old men had to be roused to open the doors for us. Much of the time we could have been in Scotland. Fog and drizzle masked Crac so that the bus almost crashed into its daunting outer wall. Inside, mist rolled out of doorways and around the ramparts like special effects for a hammy stage set. But at Sahyun, a prettier, airier castle built by the Arabs, the sun came out to light eucalyptus-lined paths and views across Syria's only forests. 'You are welcome in Syria,' said the man who opened the door, warming himself at an oil stove. We heard the same words everywhere we went, whether from the stall holders in the souk at Aleppo, a flamboyantly moustachioed singer at a nightclub in Damascus, or the Syrian orthodox priest in Malullah, a mountain village where Aramaic is still spoken. At the national museum in Damascus a guardian sidled up to thrust a pocketful of fat, sweet raisins into my hand. Never, on any travels, had I felt more at ease than I did during my two weeks in Syria. Accommodation was cheap, food and transport even cheaper. At the Aleppo souk you can buy silver jewellery cheaply and easily. The cosy atmosphere of the packed alleyways was heightened by daily power cuts - Syrians blamed the Turks for building a damn on the Euphrates, but cynics told us that the government was selling the power to Jordan to earn foreign currency. At some stalls generators grumbled into life, but in most the owners turned on oil lamps and lit braziers to keep business going into the evening. On Christmas Day we stopped at the ruins of a Byzantine monastery high up in a Druze village. Hundreds of brightly clothed children with blue lips and finger tips gathered to watch us eat humous and boiled eggs on the floor of a villager's house. In the evening, in Aleppo, we toured the churches. The Armenian church was closed, but around the corner a Catholic cathedral was packed with wealthy Syrians. It will not be long before someone brings out a satisfactory, up-to-date guidebook to the country. There is much to be discovered in Syria, and precious few tourists to get in the way.</p>

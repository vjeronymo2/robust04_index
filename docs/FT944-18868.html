			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Letters to the Editor: Competition best way to harness talent Sir, I am not surprised Colin Amery did not like the results of the architectural competitions for the South Bank and Cardiff Bay Opera House (Architecture: 'The tyranny of the few', September 26). Everyone to his taste. Not everyone likes the results of the architectural competitions in which Amery has sat on the jury. No one would argue that those results brought the competitions system into disrepute. I cannot comment on the lay jurors that Amery has dealt with, but I have yet to come across a group of lay judges who quietly acquiesced in the views of overpoweringly articulate architects. Architectural competitions have been designed to be the very opposite of 'jobs for the boys'. On the day Amery's piece appeared, the RIBA-run anonymous competition for the conversion of Baltic Mills in Gateshead was won by a Dominic Williams, an 'unknown' architect, the 29-year-old antithesis of an old boy. This RIBA competition gave an architect, too young to be 'fashionable' in Amery's sense, the opportunity to win an important commission. Gateshead has set the standard for lottery-funded projects. I can think of no better way than properly run architectural competitions for harnessing the broadest range of architectural talent to meet a variety of emerging needs.

			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TEACHER WHO FLED MOLEST CHARGES HELD  </P> <P> A fifth-grade teacher who jumped bail nearly three years ago to avoid  prosecution on felony charges of molesting students was brought back to Los  Angeles in handcuffs today after he was found in a homeless camp in Ventura.  </P> <P> Don Ray Moore, 56, who had taught for 16 years at the 97th Street School, told  police that he had been living among Southern California's homeless since  August, 1987, when 21 felony counts were filed against him.  </P> <P> He was already facing trial on misdemeanor charges of molestation and illegal  child paddling.  </P> <P> Moore, his goatee shaved off and his gray hair partly dyed auburn, was driven  into Parker Center downtown about 11:30 a.m. and walked inside. He was held on  $500,000 bail, and police said he should be arraigned on Monday.  </P> <P> "I think in a way he's probably glad it's all over," said Detective Ralph  Bennett, who went to Ventura to bring Moore to Los Angeles. "He said it was a  very difficult time."  </P> <P> Moore was recognized by a gas company employee who saw his face broadcast last  Sunday on the television show "America's Most Wanted." The employee called  Ventura police, who arrested Moore. The gas employee had been working around  the homeless encampment where Moore had been living, Bennett said.  </P></p>

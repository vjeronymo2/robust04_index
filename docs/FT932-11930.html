			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / A blind eye to the enemy within: Brazil's new economic plan takes a long-term approach, but are its measures tough enough For once, a Brazilian government has kept its word. Six months after taking office, President Itamar Franco has unveiled an economic strategy that abandons the unsuccessful 'shock therapy' of his predecessors. Out go wage and price freezes, the confiscation of bank accounts and currency devaluations; in comes a realisation that structural economic problems cannot be resolved overnight. The plan offers the first clear indication of Mr Franco's priorities since he was propelled into office by the impeachment of the disgraced Mr Fernando Collor, and signals an awareness that Brazil is trailing behind the rest of Latin America in reforming its economy. 'We have said goodbye to the era of magic solutions,' said Mr Roberto Freire, the government's congressional leader, after the package was announced. 'This plan tackles the problems which are strangling the economy without interfering with peoples' lives.' But positive reaction to the plan centres on what it does not do, rather than what it does. There is understandable public relief at the absence of grandiose measures, given the disruption caused by the five shock plans imposed since 1986. What has alarmed many observers is that, with prices rising by 30 per cent a month, the government has elected to make growth its priority rather than fighting inflation. The main focus of the package is a controversial cut in interest rates and a boost in government spending to alleviate poverty and stimulate growth this year of 3.5 per cent. Mr Franco announced that his empty Treasury coffers would finance a Dollars 2.6bn housing programme, Dollars 4.8bn in farm subsidies, Dollars 590m in road repairs, and provide Dollars 8bn in hunger relief and incentives to labour-intensive industries such as car making and construction. To finance the extra spending as well as plug a Dollars 10bn hole in this year's budget, Mr Franco is relying optimistically on a new tax on bank cheques, speeding up privatisation, cutting spending by state companies and a crackdown on tax evasion. Critics have attacked his plan for its focus on spending rather than on reducing the deficit. A former central bank governor warns: 'This plan is simply more fuel to the fire of inflation. We have spending decisions on one hand and intentions of cuts on the other. Well, the road to hell is paved with good intentions.' Mr Carlos Langoni, economics professor at Getulio Vargas Institute in Rio de Janeiro, likens the idea of reducing interest rates in Brazil's current climate to 'lighting a cigarette in a room full of gasoline'. Finance ministry officials retort that three years of tight monetary policy have succeeded only in shrinking per capita income by 10 per cent without reducing inflation. They say the Itamar plan is aimed primarily at re-establishing business confidence which, combined with sound budget management, will lead to a fall in inflation to monthly levels of 17 per cent by the end of this year. If the government restores its credibility through the plan, the argument runs, business will stop putting up prices defensively and the government will be able to fund its short-term Dollars 36bn domestic debt more cheaply. But most economists question this analysis and whether it is possible to cut Brazilian inflation without shock therapy. Such measures have been discredited by the failure of former plans but this was largely because they were badly implemented and lacked accompanying fiscal reforms such as making the tax system more efficient. Tough fiscal measures - needed to bring down the budget deficit, the main cause of inflation - are similarly absent from the Itamar package. Yet one reason why the proposals have not been more widely attacked is because inflation is seen as far less of a problem inside the country than outside. For years, Brazil has been living with levels of inflation considered by most economists to be unsustainable. For the past 18 months inflation has increased by more than 20 per cent a month; for most of the past 15 years it has been above 100 per cent a year. Inflation has become institutionalised. Daily or monthly indexes are issued for everything from construction materials to rents. The cruzeiro has retained its monetary credibility because 95 per cent of the money supply is in bank accounts which are indexed at the daily inflation rate. Mr Francisco Gros, ex-governor of the central bank, complains: 'Brazilians do not see inflation as the enemy. I could fill a stadium within minutes for a protest against recession but I doubt I could gather half a dozen stragglers to rally against inflation.' But inflation clearly is damaging the economy. Brazilian industry retains its competitive edge largely through cheap labour and tax evasion. Equipment is outdated and investment negligible because financial speculation is more profitable. Anyone who has driven on a Brazilian road or tried to make a phone call from Rio can see that the infrastructure is collapsing. The country has the world's largest income gap between rich and poor and holds the world record for the number of deaths in traffic accidents last year. Speaking at a recent conference in Sao Paulo, Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard economist active in Russia's economic programme, attacked Brazilian complacency. 'If this isn't a crisis, I don't know what is,' he said, accusing Brazil's leaders of 'luxuriating in the morass' with the excuse that the country's problems are too complex. He continued: 'Brazil's problems are not fundamentally different to other Latin American countries - it's just the last to get its house in order.' One result of the instability is that foreign investors are increasing reluctant to commit funds to the country. A western diplomat points out: 'Brazil's high inflation is damaging its credibility as a place to invest or do business. It's the world's ninth-largest economy and fifth-biggest country but people just don't take it seriously.' A prime factor in Brazil's slow progress on economic reform is the lack of political will to push through tough measures. Instead, successive governments have used shock plans to try to combat inflation at minimal social cost. But political leaders are beginning to understand that there is no easy way out. The lack of alternatives is illustrated by Mr Franco's conversion to privatisation - a policy he opposed as vice-president. In any case, his ability to implement reform is hindered by the 1988 constitution which allocates more than half of central government revenues to the free-spending states and municipalities. The fragmented political system, with 19 parties represented in Congress, means constant bargaining. But the main obstacle to reform is the number of people benefiting from inflation and with no incentive to change. Important industries, such as cement and cars, gain from protection in the form of high import tariffs, allowing them to charge excessive prices for poor-quality goods. The banking sector saw record profits last year. State companies closely guard their privileges, such as access to cheap finance, and support bloated workforces. Some observers believe that the country needs a hyperinflationary crisis similar to those suffered by Bolivia and Argentina to jolt it into action. Mr Roberto Macedo, the former economic policy chief, recalls that when feeling 'desperate' about political inertia he considered provoking this by giving in to all spending demands. The Itamar plan, while not subjecting the economy to more shock treatment, still flinches from badly needed fiscal surgery. The government will have another chance in October with a planned constitutional revision. This could change the funding balance between central and local government and could enable state employees to be sacked for the first time. But spending pressures are already mounting as campaigns get under way for next year's unprecedented simultaneous elections for president, Congress and governors. While the Itamar plan is a welcome signal that the government has at last acknowledged the deep-seated nature of its problems, few expect the small-town senator who came to the presidency by accident to have the political muscle or vision to set Brazil on a non-inflationary path to growth. Most Brazilians have already turned their attention to 1994. The fear is that they are still hoping for a miracle.</p>

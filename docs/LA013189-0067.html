			<p><P> January 31, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FRESNO STATE 'EMBARRASSES' CS FULLERTON, 65-44  </P> <P> After winning only 9 games in each of his first 2 seasons, Fresno State Coach  Ron Adams has been under scrutiny this season, his job almost certainly  depending on whether his team can come close to .500.  </P> <P> On Monday night in front of 9,856 in Selland Arena, Adams reached what may  prove a watershed, getting his 10th victory of the season as the Bulldogs  handed Cal State Fullerton its most thorough defeat of the season, 65-44, in a  game that Fullerton Coach John Sneed called "a total embarrassment."  </P> <P> With at least 10 games remaining, Adams has won more games than in either of  his previous seasons.  </P> <P> What does this mean?  </P> <P> "This means we're getting better," Adams said. "I haven't shared my feelings  about the first 2 years much. I have a lot to say, but I haven't said it. It  was difficult."  </P> <P> The Bulldogs beat Fullerton on a night when the Titans were not at their best,  making only 18 of 58 shots (31%) and scoring fewer points than any game since a  41-37 loss to New Mexico State last season.  </P> <P> Fullerton fell behind by as many as 14 in the first half, and then saw the game  completely unravel at the start of the second. Just 3 minutes into the final  period, freshman guard Wilbert Hooker made a 3-pointer and Fresno State had a  44-22 lead. The lead grew to as many as 28 points.  </P> <P> Senior forward Jervis Cole led Fresno with 22 points, and Kevin Stevenson and  Hooker each had 14.  </P> <P> Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos scored 15.  </P> <P> "We lost our poise and never recovered it," Sneed said. "I was very  disappointed in the way we took the court. We were never ready to play. We got  down and went in the tank. Fresno State showed more discipline and poise. We  regressed to the way we were playing earlier in the year. That's all I have to  say about it."  </P> <P> Fresno State's Adams took over in 1987, after the resignation of Boyd Grant,  who did not have a losing season in 8 years, and who had five 20-win seasons in  a row before his final season, when the Bulldogs went 15-15.  </P> <P> The first 2 years were dismal, but with this team, Adams is becoming more  confident.  </P> <P> "On any given night, we can be a very good team," Adams said. "Certainly it  feels better. Certainly a lot more people are pleased with what they say. . . .  Each game is winnable, but certainly -- knock on wood -- the opposite is true."  </P> <P> Granted, Fresno State's success should be met with some skepticism. Among the  10 victories are wins over Pan American, U.S. International, New Hampshire and  Southern Utah State.  </P> <P> On the other hand won close games against Utah State and Cal State Long Beach.  Among the losses 6 points to Nevada Las Vegas, 3-point losses to New Mexico  State and UC Irvine.  </P> <P> Like Adams, Fullerton's Sneed is in a precarious position himself, trying to  erase the first word from his title of acting coach. A decision will not come  until the end of the season, which in effect is one long tryout.  </P> <P> After the loss, Sneed said through a team spokesman that his players would not  be allowed to talk to reporters, but stood by while Ceballos spoke.  </P> <P> "We couldn't do anything," Ceballos said. "They just killed us. We couldn't run  our offense. We weren't ready to play."  </P> <P> With the victory, Fresno State is 10-8 overall and 5-4 in Big West Conference  play.  </P> <P> Fullerton fell to 8-9 and 3-5.  </P></p>

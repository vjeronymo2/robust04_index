			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WALL STREET / JOHN CRUDELE: PSSST! DO I HAVE SOME 'JOURNALOSSIP' FOR YOU  </P> <P> I'm going to spread some rumors that were told to me last week by a couple of  stock traders.  </P> <P> Specifically, I'm going to tell you that I hear (as in "I hear a rumor") that a  group of investors purchased a 3% stake in Paramount Communications.  </P> <P> In case that one doesn't interest you, I'm also going to tell you that I hear  (again, as in "rumor") that someone might be interested in acquiring Perry  Drug.  </P> <P> I'm not going to check out either rumor, quite frankly, because it's too much  trouble. And besides, I think that I can trust the guys who told me the rumors  even if they do have a vested interested in spreading them.  </P> <P> I could call the companies involved, but they'll just say "no comment." And  phoning investment bankers during the summer is futile -- most are on vacation  for three months.  </P> <P> So I'll just be honest with you, the reader, and say that the Paramount and  Perry stories are just "rumors." Phew, now my conscience is clear.  </P> <P> With the above exercise, I have become a practitioner of a new and dangerous  form of para-journalism that I'll call journalossip. I've done nothing wrong,  legally. I've just given the professional trader what he wants -- rumors.  </P> <P> And so what if the amateur stock buyer loses a lot of money if these rumors  don't come true. On Wall Street, I'll be a hero.  </P> <P> Journalossip is to business journalism what those tabloid TV news shows are to  the real broadcast news industry. But journalossip is worse -- because small  investors can get hold of these rumors, not recognize them for what they are  and endanger their financial health.  </P> <P> While financial journalossip has been around and growing for years, it reached  a milestone recently with the introduction of something called the "Traders  &amp; Investors Alert," a phone-in service with a "900" telephone number that  will give any rumor lover an earful of corporate takeover gossip for just $1.95  a minute.  </P> <P> How popular is the service? Barry Davis, the service's "broadcaster," says  Traders &amp; Investors Alert has more than 1,500 regular customers after being  in business just over seven months. And it probably will generate $4 million in  revenue this year.  </P> <P> Davis admits that most of the information on his "whisper" report -- as he  calls it -- is nothing more than unconfirmed rumors. "The difference," he says,  "is we lend some sophistication to the rumors because we check the (New York  Stock Exchange trading) floor on the quality of the buying."  </P> <P> In other words, Davis tries to see if the big professional traders are putting  their money where their mouth is by buying stock based on the rumors they are  spreading.  </P> <P> Davis is not a journalist by training. He says he was a stockbroker and  insurance salesman until he lost his licenses. He now lists his profession as  "broadcaster," but he also passes his time by trading some of the stocks that  he's talking about on the whisper wire for his own account.  </P> <P> The popularity of Traders &amp; Investors Alert raises a host of side  questions: Is there a conflict of interest if Davis trades stocks that he's  spreading rumors about on his wire? And should he be allowed to call himself a  journalist and claim protection under the First Amendment?  </P> <P> But for now, let's just discuss one thing: the phenomena of rumor mongering and  why Wall Street just can't seem to get its fill of gossip.  </P> <P> One trader last week offered this opinion: "The only action we have right now  are quasi-deals, possible deals and rumors. There aren't enough real takeovers  to go around at this point," he added.  </P> <P> So, he says, in order to earn a living, traders must buy stocks on rumors, ride  them as high as they can and sell the stocks before everyone moves on to the  next rumor.  </P> <P> Here's where Davis and the rumor mongering press come in. The more efficient  that the press is in helping spread a rumor, the longer that traders get to  ride the stock higher.  </P> <P> Davis makes a good point. He says he is doing nothing different from other  journalists these days. But he doesn't pretend -- like some journalists do --  to check the accuracy of rumors.  </P> <P> As for capitalizing on people's desire to hear takeover rumors, Davis says:  "This is the way the world is. Rumors make stocks go up and down. I'm teaching  people how to play the takeover game."  </P> <P> "It's a sick society that wants to get rich overnight," says Davis, adding that  other phone-line services that he offers -- like one that gives a technical  interpretation of the stock market -- get far fewer calls than the rumor hot  line.  </P> <P> Rumor mongering is likely to get worse. Since it's summer, there aren't likely  to be many real takeover deals announced in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> And since the stock market has been weak recently because of recession fears,  traders and brokers will probably have to continue to make money off "special  situations," Wall Street's polite term for stocks rumored to be takeover  targets.  </P> <P> Which gets me back to the role of journalossip.  </P> <P> Am I, as a journalist, actually doing my readers a service by spreading  unconfirmed rumors about Perry Drug and Paramount?  </P> <P> Readers may think so as long as the price of Paramount and Perry rise after I  spread the rumor. But when stock prices turn lower -- as they will someday --  those same readers will regret the day that they began playing takeover rumors.  </P> <P> Just ask anyone who was speculating in takeover stocks in October, 1987. A lot  of people probably swore off speculating in the stock market after that.  </P> <P> Here's more on hidden corporate assets that could lead to takeovers:  </P> <P> Probably the least hidden of all assets in America is land. It's just too hard  to conceal.  </P> <P> But while some companies, like retailers, obviously own valuable real estate,  there are many other companies whose land holdings aren't so apparent. Wall  Street has spent years exploring corporate landholdings, but the recent  takeover of NWA Corp. -- which came about after it was discovered that the  airline's secretly owned property in Tokyo was worth hundreds of millions of  dollars -- has rekindled interest in the subject.  </P> <P> Now companies as diverse as computer manufacturers, farming concerns and mobile  home manufacturers are coming under the microscope -- or, more accurately, the  surveyor's scope.  </P> <P> Michael Metz, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., says Data General  Corp., for instance, has facilities on real estate near Boston and in Southern  California that is so valuable that if the land and buildings were sold and the  proceeds given to stockholders, he estimates that it could mean a $10- to  $15-a-share payout.  </P> <P> And Data General's stock is only selling at about $17 a share.  </P> <P> As I mentioned several weeks ago, some of the older airlines are believed to  have foreign and domestic real estate that was bought quite accidentally  decades ago but is now worth small fortunes.  </P> <P> The same accidental purchases of real estate have blessed companies in other  industries.  </P> <P> Metz says that Coachman Industries, whose stock sells for around $9 a share,  Skyliner Corp. (around $17) and Fleetwood Enterprises (around $26) all have  stumbled into the ownership of some valuable real estate.  </P> <P> The three mobile home manufacturers located their factories on prime property  just off major highways to facilitate shipping. And now that same real estate  has risen sharply in value.  </P> <P> Hotel chains, obviously, own valuable parcels of land. A piece of property that  Hilton Corp. owns in Hawaii, for instance, could be the crown jewel that leads  to the acquisition of the company. Even McDonald's Corp., the hamburger chain,  has erected its golden arches on some pieces of property that have turned  platinum over the years.  </P> <P> "There are a lot of industries whose primary business isn't real estate but  which have valuable real estate assets," says Roderick MacIver, a specialist in  hidden real estate assets who heads his own firm in Basking Ridge, N.J.  </P> <P> Railroads, water utilities, agricultural companies, forest products companies  and industrial companies have all stumbled into valuable land holdings, says  MacIver.  </P> <P> His most successful pick was Alexander &amp; Baldwin Inc., an agricultural and  shipping company that owns 95,000 choice acres in Hawaii and California.  </P> <P> If you invest in the stock market, should you be cheering a slowdown in  economic growth or an acceleration in growth?  </P> <P> Oddly enough, the answer these days seems to be neither. The stock market has  put itself in the puzzling position of being afraid of accelerating growth  because it could bring with it inflation and higher interest rates, and even  more wary of an economic slowdown because it will hurt corporate profits.  </P> <P> Stock prices lately have been looking on the negative side of all economic  statistics. "A month ago there was nothing but ecstasy. Now you see nothing but  problems," says William King, a trader for Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben in  Chicago.  </P> <P> Next Friday, there will be a lot more for the stock market to worry about. The  government is scheduled to report how much producer prices rose in June. The  estimates are that prices rose a modest 0.3%, compared to a 0.5% rise in May.  Retail sales figures, industrial production levels and the capacity utilization  rate for factories are also to be reported that day.  </P> <P> "This is an extraordinarily difficult market to please," says Hugh Johnson,  chief investment officer of First Albany Corp. "What the market really wants  are numbers that say the economy is on a no-boom, no-bust trajectory."  </P></p>

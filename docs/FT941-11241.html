			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Gatt report praises Australia Australia's programme of economic and trade reform yesterday won praise from trading partners as a model for others to follow. A Gatt secretariat report on the country's trade policies and practices, says Australia has pressed ahead with far-reaching reforms despite recession and big balance of payments deficits. Noting that Australia took a leading role in the Uruguay Round of global trade talks, through chairmanship of the Cairns Group of 14 farm exporting nations, the report nevertheless points out that the drive for reform has been essentially autonomous as the government has tried to correct the distorting effects of years of trade protection. Tariffs have come down and and further reductions are planned, subsidies are being cut, and previously shielded areas of goods and services are being progressively opened to competition through deregulation and privatisation. However, Gatt chides Australia for very high tariffs on some items such as cars (up to 30 per cent) and textiles, clothing and footwear (up to 47 per cent), and for higher tariffs on processed goods. Other criticisms concern Australia's frequent use of anti-dumping actions, which comprised one-third of all actions notified to Gatt in 1991-92. Australian officials said tariffs on cars and textiles would be halved by 2000, and noted that the number of anti-dumping cases had fallen in 1993.</p>

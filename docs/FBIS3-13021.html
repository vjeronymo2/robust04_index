At the beginning of the one-day meeting, the Saudi minister  for petroleum and mineral resources gave a speech in which he  stressed the importance of cooperation among GCC members in  order to achieve their interests.    Minister Nazir expressed the hope that the meeting would  produce decisions in order to solve some "outstanding" matters.    During the meeting the ministers are due to hear a report  from Sa'id al-Shanfari, the Omani minister for petroleum and  minerals, on the results of his contacts with non-OPEC  oil-producing countries to urge them to respond to the  initiative of the GCC leaders regarding their countries'  readiness to reduce their oil production on condition that the  non-OPEC oil-producing countries took a similar step.

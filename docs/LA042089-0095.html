			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DOWNTOWN ZONE CHANGE OKD  </P> <P> The Torrance City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to change the zoning of a  block in the old downtown area, requiring a public hearing before any  construction takes place on that block.  </P> <P> In a petition to the City Council, 16 residents of the 1000 block of Amapola  Avenue had asked the city to help preserve the block by declaring it an  historic overlay district. During the meeting Tuesday some residents said they  feared that without the historic zoning, developers may tear down older homes  and build large condominiums.  </P> <P> "We are the only block left (in the area) that is original," said Mary Comon, a  resident of Amapola Avenue. "We are one of the last unique blocks."  </P> <P> The council opted against a historic overlay district because no such district  exists in the city, and it would take city staff months to develop one. Instead  the council voted to create a precise plan zone, which will require that each  building application have a public hearing before the city Planning Commission.  However, existing buildings could be demolished without a hearing.  </P> <P> In April, the City Council voted to downzone a 10-block downtown area,  including the 1000 block of Amapola Avenue, to control density. The council  also imposed a building moratorium until May 4, when the new zoning will become  effective.  </P> <P> After the meeting, residents said they are not satisfied with the council  action and fear that once the moratorium is lifted, developers will begin  demolition of houses on the block.  </P> <P> "We don't want condos next door," said Amapola resident Donna Braly. "We don't  want all that density."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 31, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> WASHINGTON, D.C.;  </P> <P> CONGRESS APPROVES SANCTIONS ON CHINA  </P> <P> The Senate, by a 98-0 vote, completed congressional action on a long-stalled  bill imposing military and economic sanctions against China and sent it to  President Bush.  </P> <P> He is expected to sign it. Bush had reluctantly accepted the sanctions but  vetoed the bill last year on other grounds. The bill, which also authorizes  money to operate the State Department, largely puts into law sanctions that  Bush imposed in response to Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators  last June.  </P></p>

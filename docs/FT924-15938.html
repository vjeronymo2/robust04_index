			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / Pound and lira come under fresh pressure THE LIRA and sterling came under renewed pressure against the D-Mark yesterday as tensions continued to dominate currency trading in and out of the ERM. The lira, which was suspended from the ERM two weeks ago, suffered a 5.8 per cent fall against the D-Mark after investors became increasingly concerned that the Bank of Italy would reintroduce exchange controls. The widespread rumour that Italy was planning a partial freeze on bank accounts was repeatedly denied by the Italian government and the Bank of Italy. This could not stop the lira falling to a low of L900 from a previous close in Europe of L847.6. It recovered to close in London at L876, while in New York it finished at L867.35. Markets remain concerned that Italy's emergency budget may have a difficult passage through parliament. The lira's difficulties triggered another fall for sterling, which touched a historic low of DM2.50. Investors recalled that the last big run on the lira was followed a day later by sterling's devaluation. The pound rallied to close in London at DM2.5175, down  1/4 of a pfennig. In New York it closed at DM2.5165. Sterling's weakness was partly compounded by another fall in the dollar against the D-Mark. Investors are increasingly concerned that the US non-farm payroll figure for August, due out tomorrow, will be very weak. The figure may trigger another cut in the US discount rate, widening the differential between US and German interest rates. The dollar closed in Europe at DM1.4135, after a low of DM1.4040. In New York it closed at DM1.4113. The D-Mark's renewed strength created another rise of tensions inside the ERM, with the peseta and franc weakening. Currencies, Page 37</p>

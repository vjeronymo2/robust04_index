Speaking at a meeting devoted to Baykonur's life-support in  Moscow on Monday, Soskovets said that "this object is  indispensable both for strategic purposes and scientific  research."    Russia and Kazakhstan have signed two agreements determining  the terms of use and exploitation of Baykonur facilities. Under  the agreement, the center is considered to be under Russian  jurisdiction.    Vladimir Ivanov, commander of the Russian Aerospace Forces,  said that Kazakhstan is "seeking to reconsider the status of the  cosmodrome to make it international." He stressed that despite  the signed agreements it is necessary to "reconfirm the  cosmodrome's Russian status."    Ivanov also called for signing an additional agreement  between Russia and Kazakhstan to specify the questions of  logistical support and joint financing of the cosmodrome.    The participants in the meeting called for a "reasonable  compromise between Russia and Kazakhstan on the exploitation of  the cosmodrome facilities." They noted that leasing the  cosmodrome to Russia could be one of the forms of cooperation.</p>

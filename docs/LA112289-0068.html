			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> EROTICA PUBLISHER IN SANTA CLARITA OPERATES LEGALLY, POLICE SAY  </P> <P> A vice officer with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Tuesday  that a company that prints sexually explicit material in the Santa Clarita  Valley is operating legally and cannot be shut down, despite protests from  residents who want to drive the firm away.  </P> <P> "While they do print explicit material, they do not print materials that courts  have held are obscene," Lt. Dennis Slocumb said.  </P> <P> The vice unit inspected London Press, in the Valencia Industrial Center, in  July shortly after the press moved to the Santa Clarita Valley from North  Hollywood, where it had operated for 28 years. Law enforcement officers say  London Press is one of the largest producers of sexually explicit material in  California.  </P> <P> This month, three residents, who earlier this year helped gather more than 800  signatures on petitions opposing the printer, asked the Santa Clarita Valley  sheriff's station to investigate.  </P> <P> The request was referred to Slocumb's vice unit, where it was received Tuesday.  Slocumb said the department saw no reason to alter its earlier assessment of  the printer's operations.  </P> <P> Slocumb said London Press officials cooperated when a vice officer asked to  inspect the plant in the summer. The officer did not have a warrant and could  have been turned away, he said.  </P> <P> London Press officials did not return phone calls Tuesday. Slocumb said the  company prints many types of publications, not just erotica, and carefully  disposes of sexually explicit materials to ensure they are not found by  youngsters rummaging through trash bins.  </P> <P> Slocumb said the company does not stage or photograph erotic scenes. He said  the firm did not violate obscenity statutes, which prohibit certain types of  hard-core sex scenes, while operating in North Hollywood.  </P> <P> The residents who led the petition drive said they still hoped to drive the  company out of the conservative Santa Clarita Valley. "Community influence can  do a lot," Laurie Winkle said.  </P> <P> Winkle said she and other neighborhood activists started a successful petition  drive five years ago that persuaded Liquor Barn, a large discount liquor retail  chain, not to open a store in a Valencia shopping center because it was near  five schools.  </P> <P> Marilyn Blanken said she and other Santa Clarita residents realize that London  Press only prints the erotic material and that the community has no X-rated  bookstores where it could be sold. But the residents are concerned about the  printer's impact on society as a whole. "We should be concerned about all  citizens, not just our own community," she said.  </P> <P> "I'm very much in favor of freedom of the press," Blanken said. But pornography  should be curtailed, she said, because it can produce criminal behavior that  can harm others.  </P></p>

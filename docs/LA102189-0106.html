			<p><P> October 21, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> MAN ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL IN RELATIVES' SLAYINGS  </P> <P> A 21-year-old man was ordered Friday to stand trial in the killings of his  grandmother and mother, allegedly committed during a dispute over high  credit-card charges.  </P> <P> Mario Newsome of San Diego is charged with strangling his grandmother Mamie  Newsome, 67, in her home Sept. 5 after being confronted about his use of her  credit card, on which he charged a television set and a videocassette recorder.  </P> <P> That same day, his mother, Marsha Newsome, 49, was stabbed to death in the same  home on Sychar Road.  </P> <P> San Diego Municipal Judge Nicholas Kasimatis ordered an arraignment and  trial-setting appearance in Superior Court for Nov. 2.  </P> <P> A key witness in the case, Steven Johnson, 18, testified several weeks ago that  he heard a woman screaming the day the women were killed. He was standing  outside the home.  </P> <P> Johnson said Newsome let him inside but that he became frightened and left to  call police.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Mark Pettine said Friday that his office was still weighing  the possibility of charging Newsome with special-circumstances allegations,  which could bring the death penalty if he were convicted of multiple murders.  </P> <P> Newsome, who remains in County Jail in lieu of $2-million bail, had worked as a  security guard. He surrendered to police 15 hours after the slayings.  </P></p>

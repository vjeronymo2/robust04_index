			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> An RTG could propose any pricing reform that is open to an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual utility and also other reforms that address the loop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow issue. Many approaches to reforming transmission pricing that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were suggested in the record of the Pricing Inquiry address the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loop flow issue and appear to require a regional approach. From  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the comments, the Commission discerns two major alternatives to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> traditional contract path pricing that RTGs could choose for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dealing with loop flow:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;``Enhanced'' contract path pricing, which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> improves the contractual institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> underlying traditional contract path trading; <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ``Enhanced contract path'' refers to any approach intended to reconcile capacity rights between points of receipt and delivery and actual power flows on a network of lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Flow-based pricing, which refers to pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designed to reflect the actual or projected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> power flows associated with a transaction.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  Cost-based pricing could be designed to accommodate either of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these alternatives. Examples of pricing reform based on a flow-based approach that the Commission would look approvingly on if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed by an RTG and if consistent with our principles include:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;A MW-mile method, which could be implemented in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> one of several ways. For example, it could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on ``or'' pricing and line-by-line power  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flows. Alternatively, a MW-mile approach could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be based on embedded cost for the whole  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company, allocated as the ratio of transaction-specific megawatt-miles to total megawatt-miles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Postage-stamp ``or'' ratemaking at the utility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> level that is combined with power flow analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the compensation due to all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> transmission owners on the parallel paths.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This would be a departure from the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contract path approach.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Zonal ``or'' pricing based on power flow analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine the use a transaction makes of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities in each zone.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Short-run marginal cost pricing with transmission prices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> based on line-by-line losses and opportunity costs caused  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by power flow constraints.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  RTGs may be able to design a pricing approach that combines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> elements of flow-based pricing with elements of contract path  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing. An example might be contract-path pricing for capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rights to engage in long-term firm transactions combined with flow-based pricing for short-term, nonfirm transactions that are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by such rights. As can be seen from these examples, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commission will provide RTGs substantial flexibility in choosing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> among a wide range of pricing approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Examples of Unacceptable Transmission Pricing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, any pricing proposal, even a proposal that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not conform to the traditional revenue requirement, must meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the just and reasonable standard of the FPA. Below we list two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> types of pricing proposals which we find unacceptable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  &bull;Postage-Stamp ``And'' Pricing: Some utilities have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed so-called ``and'' pricing, which would add an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> embedded cost rate to an incremental cost rate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the same service over the same facilities. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals have been based on traditional postage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stamp ratemaking for which costs are aggregated at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the utility level. This type of pricing has been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> found by the Commission to be unjust and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unreasonable. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  We cannot see how such an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach is consistent with either our fairness  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> principle or our efficiency principle. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  Penelec,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> supra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  n.5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The flexibility that we endorse in this Policy Statement regarding cost disaggregation, among other things, addresses the industry's underlying concerns regarding ``or'' pricing. That is, while we cannot justify pricing that purports to recover two measures of a single cost, allowing the entity to account for costs on a disaggregated basis would permit separate pricing for separate facilities or small groupings of facilities. Hence, we would entertain proposals for flow-based line-by-line ``or'' pricing. This would permit the use of embedded costs for some lines when this is the higher of embedded or incremental costs, and the use of incremental cost for other lines when this is the higher of embedded or incremental costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Pricing by Individual Utilities to Account for Loop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Flow: While individual utilities may propose new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and innovative pricing methods that seek to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apportion transmission costs on the basis of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scheduled flows ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , zonal or line-by-line  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> methods), we also believe that it would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inappropriate for individual utilities to reform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their own approach to transmission pricing in a way  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that is inconsistent with regional practices  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding unscheduled or inadvertent flows (loop  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow). <FOOTCITE>35</FOOTCITE>  We are concerned that individual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public utilities may propose approaches to loop flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pricing that lead to a patchwork of mutually  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent loop flow pricing methods within a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> region. Accordingly, a utility's proposal to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flow-based pricing generically to recover the costs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of unscheduled inter-utility power flows will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treated as a non-conforming proposal if it is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with regional loop flow practices, such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as use of a contract path convention. <FOOTCITE>36</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 35 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Of course, such individual utility pricing may be appropriate if there are no objections to the loop flow solution from any affected neighboring utilities or transmission customers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 36 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> However, a public utility may seek on a case-by-case basis relief from the Commission, including appropriate compensation, in situations in which it is experiencing severe unscheduled loop flows on its system because of specific power transactions by other neighboring utilities and it has been unable to resolve the problem through existing industry mechanisms.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See American Electric Power Service Corp., et al., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  49 FERC &para;61,377 at 62,381 (1989).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

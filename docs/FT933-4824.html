			<p>930907 FT  07 SEP 93 / The Lex Column: Reed Elsevier/OAG Reed Elsevier's acquisition of the assets of Official Airline Guides buffs up the company's reputation for shrewd, if unspectacular, dealing. The structure of the deal, in particular, which enables Reed Elsevier to take advantage of recent changes in US tax legislation typifies its adroitness. At first glance, the Dollars 417m outlay, representing an exit multiple of about 13 times stated earnings, seems a full price for a mature business facing stiff competition from airlines' own electronic reservation systems. But Reed Elsevier has scope to cut OAG's back office costs by pooling some operations with its existing ABC World Airways Guide. This should ensure the deal enhances Reed Elsevier's earnings within the first year. Moreover, OAG's strong cash flow eases the acquisition's financing. By buying a parcel of assets rather than the whole business, Reed Elsevier can also reduce its tax rate. Under section 197 of the new US tax code, companies which acquire assets for more than their book value are able to deduct tax on the goodwill they are required to amortise over the following 15 years. This should usefully help Reed Elsevier over the long term, given the acquisition may contain as much as Dollars 300m of goodwill. The new wrinkle in the US tax code could affect many other purchasers of branded goods or intellectual property. Significantly, perhaps, the shares of some unfashionable US consumer goods stocks have perked up in anticipation that some tax-efficient asset shuffles may be on the way.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / International Company News: Canadian airline hit by two setbacks CANADIAN Airlines International has suffered two potentially serious setbacks in its struggle to remain in the air as Canada's second leading airline. Tokyo Leasing, a creditor of the airline, said yesterday that it would not support financial restructuring proposals in their present form, and declared Canadian in default on a Y10bn (Dollars 90m) loan. In addition, a Canadian newspaper reported yesterday that the National Transportation Agency will urge the government to reject a proposed alliance between Canadian and American Airlines of Dallas. The NTA's findings are due to be made public next week. The link between Canadian and American, which includes a CDollars 246m (Dollars 195.20m) equity injection by the US carrier, is crucial to Canadian's survival. Canadian has warned that it will collapse if the deal does not go through. The NTA was reported to be unhappy with provisions of the deal which would give American Airlines control over some aspects of Canadian's business, including major capital expenditures. Under Canadian law, foreign shareholders are limited to a 25 per cent stake in a Canadian airline. Canadian Airlines yesterday dismissed Tokyo Leasing's action as a negotiating ploy. It said that several other creditors have also filed default notices, and that negotiations with the leasing group are continuing.</p>

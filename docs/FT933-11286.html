			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Nadir affair threatens to draw Lyell back in SIR NICHOLAS Lyell, the attorney-general, may be drawn again into the Asil Nadir affair over the case of a senior Inland Revenue investigator arrested on Wednesday by police probing alleged corruption. This emerged yesterday as Turkish Cypriot officials said they had given the UK's Serious Fraud Office bank documents relating to Mr Nadir, the fugitive tycoon who jumped bail and fled to the island in early May. However, the Turkish Cypriot authorities yesterday ruled out extraditing Mr Nadir to Britain. Mr Kenan Atakol, foreign minister, said the move was 'out of the question', but added: 'If the Serious Fraud Office representatives wish to see us, we will consider their request to see us.' Britain does not recognise the Turkish Cypriot-controlled territory and no extradition treaty exists. Lawyers acting for the Revenue investigator, Mr Michael Allcock, said yesterday that their client, who was released without charge on police bail pending further investigations, could face prosecution under the Corruption Act 1906. The act refers to bribery cases. Evidence gathered under the act must be referred to the attorney-general to decide whether a prosecution should take place. Sir Nicholas was embroiled in controversy last month after Mr Michael Mates, the former Northern Ireland minister, alleged 'improper collusion' between the Revenue and the SFO. Mr Allcock was suspended in September last year as head of the Revenue's Special Office 2, which investigates cases of large-scale tax evasion or avoidance, particularly by foreign residents. He claims to have passed information about Mr Nadir's financial affairs to the Stock Exchange during the 1980s. Fraud squad detectives took documents and correspondence when they arrested Mr Allcock and his wife Sally at their home in Colchester, Essex at about 6.30 on Wednesday morning. Mrs Allcock was arrested on suspicion of perverting the course of justice. A third person, believed to be an Iraqi businessman who had been the subject of an investigation by the Inland Revenue, was arrested at an address in central London at about the same time. Speaking from his home yesterday Mr Allcock said he denied all allegations of bribery or corruption: 'I'm going to fight it every step of the way.' In northern Cyprus Mr Haki Onen, the island territory's deputy attorney-general, said five pages of documents relating to cash positions of the local subsidiaries of Polly Peck International, Mr Nadir's former company, had been given to Ms Lorna Harris, the SFO case officer in charge of the Nadir investigation. Mr Onen said the documents were provided on request from the SFO. Local officials say the documents relate to the Pounds 140m which Mr Nadir claimed was held on deposit on September 30 1990 at banks including the Cyprus Industrial Bank, his privately owned bank. The SFO said yesterday it was 'very pleased' with the progress its officials had made in northern Cyprus this week. Yesterday Mr Onen said an investigation had established that some of the bank documents had been forged. He added that there was no evidence that Mr Nadir was involved. The document purports to show that on October 8 1990, just before the group went into administration, the bank was holding a cash deposit of Pounds 39.7m. Mr Nadir's wardrobe, including 150 suits, 200 silk shirts and 480 silk ties, is being auctioned by trustees of his estate to help clear his debts.</p>

			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / BBC governor discloses that he is not paying tax on pounds 80,000 of pay MR KEITH OATES, a BBC governor who voiced criticism of Mr Birt's financial deal, last night disclosed that he is not paying tax on Pounds 80,000 of his own pay. The money, part of his Pounds 400,000 salary as managing director of Marks and Spencer, is paid abroad. Mr Oates denied that the deal was a tax dodge, adding that the money was paid for work done abroad, or in England for the company's subsidiaries in other countries. Mr Oates's fees, including those as a BBC governor, are paid under the PAYE system. A telephone poll of TV executives by Broadcast magazine found that more than 90 per cent thought both Mr Birt and Mr Hussey should resign.</p>

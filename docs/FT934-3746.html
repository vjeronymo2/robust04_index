			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Italian markets make gains after clear poll win by left Italy's financial markets reacted favourably yesterday to the clear victory of leftwing alliances in large cities in Sunday's second round of local elections. The Milan stock market rose by 3.3 per cent and the lira strengthened compared with its Friday close against the D-Mark from L998 to L988. This contrasted with nervous trading after the first round of local elections, held on November 21, when the vote for the long-ruling Christian Democrats collapsed, and coalitions supported by the former communist party of the Democratic Left (PDS) did well across the country. In the aftermath of those poll results shares on the Milan bourse fell by nearly 5 per cent, the biggest drop in a year, while the lira also weakened. Dealers said yesterday that the market took a positive view of earlier commitments by Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS leader, to ensure that the 1994 austerity budget passed through parliament. Mr Occhetto repeated these commitments on Sunday as PDS-backed candidates won a total of 53 of the 129 towns involved in the run-off, including Genoa, Naples, Rome, Trieste and Venice. The budget is now likely to be approved by December 21, to be followed shortly by the dissolution of parliament and the holding of general elections in March. If the budget is approved in its present form, it will lock any government into policies that will reduce the public sector deficit to 8.7 per cent of gross domestic product from its current level of about 10.5 per cent. The markets also appeared relieved that the neo-fascist movement, MSI, was narrowly blocked in its bid to capture the administrations of Naples and Rome. An MSI victory in either or both of these cities would have radicalised the political climate. However the movement claimed on the basis of the election results to be the largest single party nationwide with 16 per cent of the vote. The brake on the rise of the MSI looked likely last night to stimulate the search for a new centre grouping to fight the next general elections. Mr Mario Segni, leader of the Referendum Movement for electoral reform and one of the few figures of any stature capable of mobilising a centrist coalition, was quick to stake out his candidature as a future prime minister.

Changes to the applicable law were made by section 6239(a) of the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA) (Pub. L. No. 100&hyph;647, 102 Stat. 3342). These regulations affect all taxpayers involved in an administrative proceeding within the Internal Revenue Service, and provide guidance regarding the definition of reasonable administrative costs and the period within which the costs must be incurred in order to be recoverable. These regulations also set forth the requirements and procedures for the recovery of such costs, and the definitions of prevailing party, administrative proceeding and administrative proceeding date. A table of contents to the regulations under section 7430 is provided in &sect;301.7430&hyph;0. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Sections 301.7430&hyph;0 and 301.7430&hyph;2 through 301.7430&hyph;6, except for &sect;301.7430&hyph;2(c)(5), are effective June 7, 1994, and apply to claims for reasonable administrative costs filed with the Internal Revenue Service after December 23, 1992, with respect to costs incurred in administrative proceedings commenced after November 10, 1988.

The estimated average annual burden per respondent is 120 minutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments concerning the accuracy of this burden estimate and suggestions for reducing this burden should be sent to the Internal Revenue Service, Attn: IRS Reports Clearance Officer, PC:FP, Washington, DC 20224, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Attn: Desk Officer for the Department of the Treasury, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Proposed additions to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR Part 301) under section 7430 of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code) were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 23, 1992 (57 FR 61020 [IA&hyph;003&hyph;89, 1993&hyph;1 C.B. 789]). These proposed additions were issued under the authority contained in section 7805 of the Code. A summary of the proposed additions is contained in the preamble that was published with the proposed additions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Changes to the Proposed Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No changes have been made to the proposed regulations. One public comment objected to the failure of the regulations to provide for the recovery of amounts expended by taxpayers during the examination of their returns. As section 7430 does not provide for such awards, this suggestion was not adopted. After consideration of the public comment received, the proposed regulations are adopted as revised by this Treasury decision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Special Analyses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been determined that this Treasury decision is not a significant regulatory action as defined in EO 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment is not required. It has also been determined that section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5) and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section 7805(f) of the Code, the notice of proposed rulemaking preceding these regulations was submitted to the Small Business Administration for comment on their impact on small business.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Drafting Information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The principal author of these regulations is Thomas D.

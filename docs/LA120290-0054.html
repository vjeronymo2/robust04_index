			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'BOOTLEG' HOUSING STORY DRAWS FIRE, CLAIMS OF 'BIAS'  </P> <P> As a resident of Altadena for the past 13 years, I have been silent until now  in voicing my strong objection to the changes which have taken place on  Woodbury Street in recent years. I find the trend toward increased population  density and "multiple use" property in the area disturbing.  </P> <P> I believe we have been victimized by non-enforcement of zoning codes and those  who are exploiting this situation for monetary gain.  </P> <P> Conversion of garages for rental property, use of residential property for  business purposes, for schools, preschools, or communes is inappropriate for a  single-family neighborhood. I use the term "family" in its well-known,  traditional sense.  </P> <P> The attendant increase in traffic, strain on public services, noise,  accumulation of trash of all descriptions, parking of vehicles (many of which  are inoperative) on front lawns and uses of property for other than  single-family residences provide ample evidence of blatant disregard for zoning  codes and the wishes of neighbors in the surrounding area. In addition, many of  the structures may be in violation of fire and safety codes.  </P> <P> The concerned citizens in this matter wish to protect and enhance the quality  of our neighborhood. We loved Altadena. That's why we moved here in the first  place. In addition, we wish to protect our property values. The rising tide of  squalor and blight on Woodbury must be stopped and turned back. We ask all  relevant regulatory agencies to assist us in this matter.  </P> <P> GEORGE C. HOPKINS  </P> <P> Altadena  </P></p>

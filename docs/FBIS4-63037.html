			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Tamara Ivanova and Vladimir </F> Solntsev]    [Text] Moscow May 19 TASS -- Sergey Filatov, chief of the  Russian president's staff, said he did not rule out the  possiblity of Boris Yeltsin running for the Russian presidency  in the 1996 presidential polls.    "I believe this is even necessary", he said at a meeting on  Wednesday with representatives of the business community and  mass media of the Japanese district of Hokuriku. At the same  time, Filatov noted that careless moves may result in launching  election campaign "ahead of schedule."    According to the chief of staff, the number of candidates  for  president, of which there are now over a dozen, will probably  shrink by the time of elections. Much will depend on the  election law and electoral thresholds. When asked about the  possiblity of postponing presidential polls, Filatov said this  was "very unlikely."    "Whether we will begin overcoming the crisis this year or  drag on for some more time depends on the social and political  situation," the chief of the presidential staff stressed. He  noted that the passage of the new constitution and creation of  the supreme legislature made it possible to develop a calm  social and political situation in the country.    Giving his assessment of Russia's current economic  situation,  Filatov reiterated the government's commitment to the course of  reforms. "They are going ahead with the same line, but the  situation calls for manoeuvres," he said.    The official expressed hope that constructive opposition  forces would join the treaty on civil accord. He reported that  the agrarian faction in parliament was ready to sign the treaty,  but only after the federal budget was approved and certain  concessions were made. According to his information, Russian  Communist leader Gennadiy Zyuganov also agreed to sign the  document, but did not met understanding in this issue from his  fellow party members, who decided at their conference not to  join the treaty.    Filatov said various aspects and directions of this treaty  would be discussed and further elaborated by a conciliation  commission and round-tables, at which representatives of  different parties and movements will be able to consider ways  for further advance. I believe, the chief of staff pointed out,  that "opposition forces should sit down at this negotiating  table and to take part in this process, otherwise they will  simply disarm themselves before the public."    Filatov assessed positively the recent reshuffles within the  Russian cabinet, noting that it was for the first time that a  regional representative, Nikolay Travkin, was included into the  government.    According to Filatov, the problems currently facing Russia  are related to its consolidation as a democratic law-governed  federative state. "We are only on our way to all these goals,"  he said, noting that a well-functioning law-governed state  should have not less than 5,000 legislative acts, while their  number in Russia does not exceed one thousand.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Protocol on results of discussions between Andrey Kozyrev, </F> the Russian Foreign Minister, and the NATO Council" -- ITAR-TASS  headline]    [Text] Brussels, 22 Jun 1994 -- 1. Russia and NATO have a  significant contribution to make to guaranteeing European  stability and security. Constructive relations of cooperation  between Russia and NATO, based on mutual respect, advantage, and  friendship, are therefore a key element in security and  stability in Europe and accord with the interests of all other  states in the CSCE region.    Russia and NATO welcome the progress that has already been  achieved in their relations, including that within the framework  of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, and they will strive  to strengthen it further.    2. Russia's signing of Partnership for Peace opens up big  new  opportunities for the development of relations by means of  practical cooperation in spheres covered by the framework  document of Partnership for Peace.    Russia and NATO have agreed to prepare a wide-ranging,  individual program of partnership, in keeping with Russia's  size, importance and potential.    3. They have agreed to establish far-reaching Russia-NATO  cooperation relations both within and outside the framework of  Partnership for Peace. These relations, aimed at strengthening  mutual confidence and openness, will develop to reflect common  goals and supplement and strengthen relations with all other  states. They are not directed against the interests of third  countries and will be transparent.    4. Russia and NATO have agreed on broad and in-depth  dialogue and cooperation in those areas where Russia can make a  unique and important contribution commensurate with its weight  and responsibility as a major European, world and nuclear power:    -- by exchanging information on security policy problems of  European dimension;    -- by holding, as required, political consultations on  issues  of mutual interest;    -- by cooperating on the entire range of security issues,  including, as required, in the sphere of peace-keeping.</p>

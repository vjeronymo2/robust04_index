			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / The Lex Column: Rentokil The performance of Rentokil's shares yesterday underlines that the market is now taking its 20 per cent earnings growth for granted. To be fair, the interim figures offer no reason to do otherwise. The results were achieved in spite of an adverse move in exchange rates which took Pounds 2m off the bottom line on translation. The company continues to squeeze margins higher and is generating cash at an almost embarrassing rate, perhaps Pounds 45m over the full year. Yet the shares are trading on a prospective price earnings premium of 60 per cent relative to the market. On this measure, the market has already capitalised another three to five years' earnings growth at the same demanding pace. This leaves little to chance. On a yield of 1.5 per cent, the dividend is barely an attraction. Without yield support the stock would look vulnerable if growth prospects are ever called into question. Common sense suggests that Rentokil can only squeeze margins so far, and that ultimately it will have to rely on increased turnover if expectations are to be met. If a candidate for a large acquisition can be found, Rentokil might be tempted to use the high multiple for a paper bid. Alternatively, cash flow is strong enough to support a substantial debt-funded acquisition. But that prospect looks unlikely: Rentokil prefers to fund small acquisitions from cash. The question for investors is whether it can reconcile this prudent approach with the growth targets.</p>

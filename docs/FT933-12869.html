			<p>930722 FT  22 JUL 93 / Cable channels in satellite transfer UNITED ARTISTS Programming (UAP) will today launch two channels on the Astra satellite system - Discovery and Bravo. Both channels are already available to cable networks in the UK through low-power satellites. The transfer to the latest Astra satellite extends their reach and means that Discovery - with mainly documentary-entertainment programmes - will be available to more than 3.3m homes in the UK and a total of 6.8m homes in eight European countries. Bravo, whose output is based on cult series such as The Man From UNCLE and films such as Casablanca, will be available to more than 2.5m homes capable of receiving cable or satellite in the UK. From the beginning of September Discovery and Bravo will also be part of the 14-channel subscription package being marketed by British Sky Broadcasting, the satellite venture in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake. Channels joining the BSkyB package will each receive 15p per subscriber per month. UAP - which is owned by TCI of Denver, the world's largest cable television group - has a stake in or involvement with six of the channels in the new subscription package. As well as Discovery and Bravo there are The Children's Channel, UK Gold, UK Living and Country Music TV. UAP also runs three cable-only channels in the UK - Wire TV, which combines entertainment with local television, The Parliamentary Channel and The Learning Channel. Ms Joyce Taylor, UAP chief executive, said that the move to Astra was a natural extension of the business. 'With Discovery we are putting a lot of money into production and co-production,' she said.</p>

			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Arts: French without tears - Opera in Switzerland The days when French singers were deemed necessary for French opera are long past. We want to hear the repertory, but there are no longer enough good native singers to go round. One solution is to sing in the vernacular, but this destroys the unique tonal blend of word and vocal line in French music. Another is to find non-French singers who have mastered the subtleties of the language - as in the latest Geneva staging of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmelites. Or you engage a stock international cast who muddle their way through as best as possible, as Zurich has just done for Massenet's Herodiade. Switzerland's linguistic mix means that audiences never have trouble understanding French when it is intelligently sung. But finding the right singers is no easier than elsewhere. This puts a premium on the artistic judgment and casting skills of theatres, qualities for which Geneva's Grand Theatre has become justly renowned. Recent seasons have included Louise, Ariane et Barbe-bleue, Mireille and Benvenuto Cellini, all with Anglophone principal singers. Now comes Poulenc's Christian tragedy - with Felicity Palmer, Marie McLaughlin and Alison Hagley as the three nuns whose words count the most. They did themselves proud, and in the case of Miss Palmer's Old Prioress outstandingly so - not just in her fearless French declamation, but in her very human portrait of a woman whose redoubtable exterior crumbles before the agony of death. As Constance, Miss Hagley was spontaneous and child-like, a perfect foil for Blanche as portrayed by Miss McLaughlin: a troubled spirit searching for inner peace, sung and acted with quiet intensity. In the same way, Martine Dupuy's obsessive Mere Marie was the alter ego of Valerie Millot's fragrant, pragmatic Madame Lidoine. This is an opera of opposites, all of them underlined in Francois Rochaix's staging. Robert Dahlstrom's representational decor allowed each scene to dovetail into the next. Here was the turmoil of Paris next to the solace of Compiegne, revolutionary hysteria face-to-face with religious order, mundane chatter amid a world of prayer. This most Catholic of operas made strong theatrical sense - never more so than when the nuns mounted the scaffold one-by-one in the final scene. And it would be hard to imagine Poulenc's serene, unspectacular music sounding more heartfelt than in the hands of Michel Plasson and the Suisse Romande Orchestra. On these terms, the charge of longwindedness is hard to sustain. The criticism might be better targeted at Herodiade, judging by the Zurich Opera House's belated 150th anniversary tribute to Massenet. This grand operatic treatment of the Salome story has survived on the fringe of the repertory as a vehicle for star singers. What it really needs is a trenchant modern staging. Zurich built this revival around Jose Carreras and Grace Bumbry, but Carreras cancelled, causing renewed worries about his health. Miss Bumbry, pro that she is, struggled valiantly to give the show some credibility. The odds were against her. Carreras' replacement as John the Baptist was Boiko Zvetanov, a young Bulgarian with a sweet voice, who sang with little dramatic purpose in a mush of vowel sounds. The virginal Salome was Cecilia Gasdia, who was similarly uninvolving, despite her touching delivery of the first act aria 'Il est doux'. As Herod, the American lyric baritone Rodney Gilfry enunciated well, but seemed temperamentally at odds with such a mature part. More convincing were Laszlo Polgar's Phanuel and the orchestra under Manfred Honeck, who made the most of Massenet's fund of lush melodies. No expense had been spared on Gian-Franco de Bosio's staging, a fancy dress parade framed by arched columns and regularly interrupted by a quaint pictorial drop-curtain (designed by Pasquale Grossi). It was money down the drain. The chorus looked as if they were rehearsing for Verona. The ballets ranged from elementary acrobatics to a crotch-dance by a pretty boy in a loin cloth. To describe this as kitsch would be too generous.</p>

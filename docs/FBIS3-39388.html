Last year, diplomatic relations became tense and Ankara and  Bern drew their ambassadors back upon the outlawed separatist  terrorist PKK [Workers Party of Kurdistan] organization's attack  on Turkish Consulate in Bern.    Dreifuss who came to Strasbourg to attend a Council of  Europe  ministerial meeting on drugs, speaking to an AA reporter said  Switzerland was ready to improve bilateral relations with Turkey.    Recalling Swiss justice authorities' request for  investigation on Turkish Consulate in Bern, Dreifuss said  Turkish Government did not want the investigation to be done and  drew its ambassador back.    Dreifuss defended the idea that it would be more difficult  to  put the separatist terrorist organization under control if they  ban this organization adding that the Swiss Government will  never allow any terrorist organization to create violence.</p>

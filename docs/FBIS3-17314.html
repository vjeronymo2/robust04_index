			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Russia and Belarus are moving toward monetary  union. [passage omitted]    [Correspondent] In Stanislaw Shushkevich's opinion:    [Shushkevich, interviewed at home] If monetary union is a  payment for Russia agreeing to a customs union, I am for a union  of this kind. If it is yet another game, and we have monetary  union but there will be no customs union, I am categorically  opposed to it.    [Correspondent] It is true that the political games behind  this agreement are quite convoluted. It is interesting that  Prime Minister Vyacheslav Kebich even agrees that the rumors of  a political plot in Moscow may be connected with an attempt to  disrupt the agreement on monetary union between the two  countries.    [Kebich, interviewed standing in corridor] It could be, yes.  Unfortunately I cannot exclude that. [passage omitted]</p>

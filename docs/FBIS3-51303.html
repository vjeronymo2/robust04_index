			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 15 Jan (NA) -- Foreign Minister Guido  Di Tella has confirmed that the government is studying "generic  information" that members of the Montonero movement who live in  Mexico are active in the National Zapatist Liberation Army  [EZLN] which is operating in that country.    Moreover, Di Tella denied that there will be a "witch-hunt"  among foreign residents in Argentina, in search of presumed  subversive elements.    The foreign minister said that President Carlos Menem was  already concerned about the issue "before", especially because  there were reports that members of several guerrilla groups  which were active in the 1970's had sought refuge in Mexico and  could have joined the EZLN.    "Many ex-guerrillas have been absorbed by the policy of  democracy, others have not," the minister said in remarks to the  newspaper CLARIN.    He said that the information being studied by the government  was not provided by his Mexican counterpart. He also denied that  the CIA had provided information on this matter, although he  admitted that there had been an "exchange of information via  diplomatic channels with the State Department and other Latin  American governments."    He said that in the case of EZLN uprising in Chiapas, "there  is a very important organization which was based on a social  problem." He added that the Argentine socioeconomic situation is  "totally different" from that of Mexico.    Although "there is the possibility of a subversive  infiltration" in some Latin American countries, he explained  that that is not the case in Argentina.    He thus ruled out the possibility that the alert given by  the  executive branch to the intelligence services on a supposed  subversive outbreak could prompt "a witch-hunt."    However, yesterday some 30 illegal Peruvian residents were  deported for "usurping a house" at 600 Senillosa Street,  although there are still two weeks before 31 January, the legal  deadline established by the Immigration Department for the  regularization of foreigners who are in an illegal status.</p>

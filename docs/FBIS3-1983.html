			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Tung Fang-jan (2639 2455 0373): "Deng </F> Xiaoping's Recent Speeches in Shanghai"]    [Text] Last December, Deng Xiaoping, the chief architect  of China's reform and opening up, came to Shanghai to recuperate  in the company of his family. During his stay in Shanghai, he  separately met with Shanghai party and government leaders Wu  Bangguo, Huang Ju, Chen Zhili, Chen Liangyu, Chen Tiedi, Xu  Kuangdi, Pudeng New District Administrative Committee Director  Zhao Qizheng, and former Shanghai leaders Chen Guodong, Hu  Lijiao, Wang Daohan, and Yang Di on 26 and 27 December. At the  meetings, Deng also talked about Shanghai's reform and Pudong's  development.    Deng Xiaoping said: When I was in Beijing, I often  thought about Shanghai and Pudong. It was impossible to forget  them. The development of Pudong is too late, but a good  opportunity remains now, so we must keep a high speed and must  not slow down. Some people are worried that such a practice may  cause trouble. What trouble could there be? I do not believe  this. Those who have such concerns also cannot say what trouble  there will be. Our minds should be further emancipated. We  must have courage and must not slow down the speed. Quicker  economic development may bring about a better situation in  reform and opening up. You should not fear. Otherwise, you will  not be able to accomplish anything. I will give protection to  you all. (Those present all laughed).    The development of Pudong in Shanghai was announced in the  12th year of China's reform and opening. During the 12  years, China's economic reform took two separate, major steps in  regional opening and industrial opening. In the first step,  China successively set up five special economic zones in  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Shantou, Xiamen, and Hainan, as well as 14  economic and technical development zones in coastal areas  between 1979 and 1988. In the second step, in 1990, China  decided to open and develop Shanghai's Pudong New District. The  two strategic steps were both personally decided by Deng  Xiaoping. Deng's decisions were made on the basis of his  assessment of the world situation and China's current realities.  China has a large population, but China's economic foundation is  weak. It is impossible to start large-scale construction in all  parts of the country in one single move. Breakthroughs should  first be made in some key points in the process of economic  development. The first-step and second-step decisions were made  by Deng on the basis of such realities. Deng held that  Pudong's development had a bearing on Shanghai's development,  and if Shanghai develops, "the situation of reform and opening  in the Chang Jiang Delta area, in the whole valley of the Chang  Jiang, and even the whole country will be different."  Therefore, he required that "Pudong's development be tightly  grasped without vacillation through to its completion."    On 3 January, in the company of State Council Vice Premier  Li  Lanqing, Shanghai Municipal CPC Committee Secretary Wu Bangguo,  and Shanghai Mayor Huang Ju, Deng Xiaoping mounted the Yangpu  Bridge and tried to walk 100 meters on the bridge. The  officials and the assistants around tried hard to dissuade Deng  from doing this. So he stood in the middle of the bridge to  look at both sides of the Huangpu Jiang. He stretched his hand  to point and said that he was glad to see that the buildings  were getting taller and taller.    That evening, Deng met with principal leaders of the  Shanghai  Municipal CPC Committee and Zhao Qizheng, Xia Keqiang, and Hu  Wei, responsible officials of the Pudong New District  Administrative Committee, and he delivered a speech to them.    Deng Xiaoping said: Things that can be accomplished  within this century should not be postponed to the next century.  Developing the economy at high speed is a major principle and  policy. Pudong is the locomotive of such development. Its  development has been delayed, and I was anxious about this.  Major construction projects in the fields of energy and  transportation should be started as soon as possible, with the  necessary funds being concentrated so that they will yield  returns at an earlier date. He added: An international  financial center is certainly a place where all currencies can  be freely converted. For Shanghai, this is of great importance.  If China tries to acquire a certain international status in the  financial aspect, it should first rely on Shanghai. I have  reiterated this point many times. I have said this in Shanghai  and have also mentioned this in Beijing. Some people say that I  have partiality for Shanghai, but I said that no place could  replace Shanghai's status. Pudong is the locomotive of  development, and this has been written into the report to the  14th CPC Congress. (CHING PAO editor's note: On 12 October  1992, CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang Zemin  particularly mentioned in his report to the 14th CPC Congress  that "the opening and development of Shanghai's Pudong will  function as a locomotive to promote the further opening of the  cities along the Chang Jiang, and Shanghai should be built into  an international economic, financial, and trade center as soon  as possible, thus bring along a new leap forward for the  regional economy of the Chang Jiang Delta area and the whole  valley of the Chang Jiang.") Therefore, You must do a good job!  Your successes in development will enable me to speak aloud.  (All of those present laughed.)    Deng Xiaoping then added: I have seen the model of the  Lujiazui Financial and Trade Development Zone you sent to me  (author's note: this was the latest of three models.) It is  very nice. Such projects should be started. There are more  than 100 buildings with a total of more than 4 million square  meters of floor space. They are indeed impressive! There  is no limitation in the emancipation of people's minds. Nothing  will be accomplished if people fear this or that. In the final  analysis, Shanghai's development was the result of daring  practice. You should advance the process of reform and opening  by grasping the opportunity and should not waste your time by  getting involved in unnecessary courtesy activities and, thus,  should not let the opportunity slip. This time, I came a  bit earlier than before, because I want to have more time to  listen to your reports and to see what you have done. Shanghai  is able to make great accomplishments, but I must again  emphasize that the faster economic development, the more  attention we should pay to the building of material and  spiritual civilization. This is also a constant principle,  which must be understood by our cadres at all levels.  Rapid economic development will also require us to  further improve our work style. We should say less and do more  and should stress practice. Whatever they are doing, our cadres  should give consideration first to whether the people are glad  and satisfied or not and whether the people support the policies  or not. This is the key to the success of our reform and  opening.    Deng Xiaoping also said: The development of the present  international situation is favorable to us, and we are facing an  opportunity that has rarely been seen. Recently, there  have been some little troubles in Hong Kong. Chris Patten is  playing little tricks there. We should ignore him and do what  we need to do on our own. Hong Kong's prosperity and stability  are still dependent on our economic development. In my view,  they do not understand the Chinese people and the Chinese  Government. There is no Li Hongzhang [Qing Dynasty official  blamed for ceding Hong Kong Island to Britain] any more. The  people will not agree if we do not recover Hong Kong.  Therefore, Patten and the British Government will get nowhere  on the Hong Kong issue.    Reportedly, after leaving Shanghai, Deng Xiaoping may travel  southward to inspect Guangdong and Hainan.    On 13 January, JIEFANG RIBAO, the organ of the Shanghai  Municipal CPC Committee, published a commentator's article at  the top of the front page, entitled "Further Emancipating  People's Minds," which revealed Deng's talk about emancipating  people's minds. Next day, XINHUA dispatched the excerpts of the  article. On 14 January, RENMIN RIBAO published a lengthy  article entitled "Deng Xiaoping's Ideas About Opening and  Development and the Development of Shanghai's Pudong" by Huang  Qifan, deputy director of the Pudong New District Administrative  Committee. All this formed another "opinion storm" in Shanghai  after the series of commentaries written in the name of Huangfu  Ping in 1991.    Zhou Ruijin, the former party committee secretary of JIEFANG  RIBAO, who organized the writing of the Huangfu Ping articles,  has been in the post of deputy editor-in-chief of RENMIN RIBAO  for several years. This time, RENMIN RIBAO in the north and  JIEFANG RIBAO in the south echoed each other, and brought about  a lively and dynamic situation in public opinion. It is  believed that the CPC newspapers will publish more articles with  original ideas in 1994 to meet the needs of economic development.</p>

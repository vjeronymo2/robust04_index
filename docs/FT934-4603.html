			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Repo rate cut by Bundesbank The Bundesbank surprised European financial markets yesterday by announcing a quarter of a percentage point cut in the securities repurchase agreement, the 'repo' rate which determines money market interest rates, without lowering the 'official' Lombard and discount rates, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The bank's council fixed the repo rate at 6 per cent for the next five weeks, down from 6.25 per cent. Although markets were initially disappointed about the discount rate, the repo rate cut was enough to trigger a round of easing in other European countries. The Dutch and Belgian central banks announced they would cut rates from today: the Dutch by a quarter point and the Belgians by between a quarter and half a point. The German rate cut move comes against a background of slowing inflation and economic stagnation in the country. Currencies and Money, Page 33</p>

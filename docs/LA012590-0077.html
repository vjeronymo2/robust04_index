			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP MUSIC REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> IT'S ROCK VS. REALITY AT 'WEDDING' BAND'S SHOW  </P> <P> It was just another Monday night at the Coconut Teaszer, except that the  big-haired band on stage wasn't real, most of the Gypsies, tramps and shady  businessmen in the colorful crowd weren't real, the record-company president  and his lovely assistant unctuously greeting the reviewer weren't real, and  after a while even said reviewer began to feel not long for this sphere of  reality.  </P> <P> What this was was the local club debut of Donny Dulce &amp; Fusion, better  known as the "Tony N' Tina's Wedding" band, as seen in the brilliantly funny  interactive theater production currently packing 'em in at the Park Plaza  Hotel. The rockin' quartet used its night off from Madonna medleys to try out a  batch of original material from a supposedly imminent album debut, with the  entire wedding party on hand and in character.  </P> <P> Spinal Tap's show at the Music Machine back in '84 is the closest thing in  memory to the sense of disorientation offered here. If anything, cheerful  popsters Dulce &amp; Fusion have a much harder job than those dinosaur-rock  imposters, in that they're reasonably proficient, spookily commercial and  entirely believable in their unerring sense for the contemporary cliche -- all  the way down to the requisite cautionary tale about "life on the edge" and a  romantic power ballad amid their party anthems.  </P> <P> Nothing is too obvious about any of this on-target musical fiction. So you had  to wonder what any oblivious Teaszer patrons thought when the second set  finally descended into pandemonium, like the wedding itself. It seems that  about the time bridesmaid Donna stripped down to her lingerie to warble "Wind  Beneath My Wings" with the band, her boyfriend Dominick realized that she had  indeed been carrying on with singer Donny. Much brawling, pipe-wielding and  Italian profanity ensued, on stage and in the courtyard.  </P> <P> Most of the disgruntled male wedding-party members, still in character, headed  down the street to the Body Shop, while the ersatz record-company head  drunkenly crawled around the corner of Sunset and Crescent Heights with his  pants around his ankles. It wasn't any more inconceivable than a night out with  Thelonious Monster, and at half the actual danger to one's person. CHRIS  WILLMAN  </P></p>

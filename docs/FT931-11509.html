			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Rank earnings fall under new accounting rules THE RANK Organisation, the diversified leisure group, said yesterday that under new accounting standards which take effect in June, its 1992 earnings per share would have been 6.8p rather than the 37.8p it reported. The disparity results from the new standard's different treatment of extraordinary items, profits and losses on disposals of businesses, and property revaluations. The City said the sharply reduced earnings per share figure demonstrated the difficulties the new accounting standard will cause rather than being a reflection of the leisure group's performance. Earnings per share figures are likely to fluctuate more widely under the new system than under the old. One analyst said: 'The important questions remain: what are the core earnings of the company; what is its debt position; what is its cashflow?' Rank said that although the new accounting standard, FRS 3, only applies to companies with financial years ending after June 22, it had decided to publish an additional group profit and loss account in its annual report, presented as if the new rules had already taken effect. The Accounting Standards Board has encouraged companies to adopt the new standard early. Under the new rules, Rank's after-tax profits would have been Pounds 44.3m, rather than the Pounds 140.1m it reported. The new system provides that extraordinary items previously taken below the line now have to be included in profits. This had little effect as Rank had only Pounds 100,000 in extraordinary items. The disposal of the group's motorway service business had a more significant impact. Under the new system, the sale price achieved has to be set off against the revalued worth of the business rather than the historic cost. This reduced Rank's after-tax profits by Pounds 38.8m. Profits were reduced by a further Pounds 56.9m as the result of a downwards revaluation of hotel assets which have been put up for sale. Under the new standard, these are reflected in the profit and loss statement rather than only in the balance sheet. Rank said: 'In this profit and loss account nothing is hidden. People have got to think a bit more about the figures and that's not a bad thing.' Lex, Page 24</p>

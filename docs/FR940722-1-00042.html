			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.785&blank;Seats, Berths, Litters, Safety Belts, and Shoulder Harnesses  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Seat requirements of part 23 would be clarified by moving the seat provisions in current &sect;23.1307(a), which require a seat or berth for each occupant, to the introductory text of &sect;23.785. The requirement of &sect;23.1413, for a metal to metal latching device for seat belts and shoulder harnesses would also be referenced in &sect;23.785(b). These proposed changes would combine related seat requirements in one section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.787&blank;Baggage and Cargo Compartments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.787 would be revised by extending the present requirements for cargo compartments to baggage compartments. As proposed, future baggage compartments on all airplane categories would be required to: Be placarded for their maximum weight capacity; have a means to prevent the baggage from shifting; and have a means to protect controls, wiring, lines, and equipment or accessories that are located in the compartment and whose damage or failure would affect safe operation of the airplane. These standards have been applicable to cargo compartment designs for some time and should be applied to baggage compartments since the same safety factors are involved. Because manufacturers recognize the need for these standards, many of these provisions have been included in the current design of baggage compartments and, therefore, the proposed requirements are not expected to create a significant burden. With this revision the commuter category requirements of &sect;23.787(g) would be redundant and that requirement is being removed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed revisions to this section would also move the substance of paragraphs (d) and (f) to a proposed new &sect;23.855, which will address cargo and baggage compartment fire protection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed new paragraph (c) of this section would require flight crew emergency exits on all cargo configured airplanes to meet the requirements of &sect;23.807. This requirement would provide increased assurance that flight crews of all cargo airplanes will have ready access to an emergency exit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.791&blank;Passenger Information Signs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This proposed new section would require at least one illuminated sign notifying all passengers when seat belts should be fastened. This proposed requirement applies to airplanes where flightcrew members cannot observe occupant seats or where the flightcrew member compartment is separated from the passenger compartment. When illuminated, the signs must be legible to all persons seated in the passenger compartment. Each sign must be installed so that a flightcrew member can turn it on and off from his or her station.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.807&blank;Emergency Exits  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> Proposed new &sect;23.807(a)(4) would provide the same protection from any propeller disk and other potential hazard for a person who uses emergency exits as that provided by proposed &sect;23.783(b) for a person who uses a passenger door. (See discussion for proposed &sect;23.783 in this notice.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision of &sect;23.807(b) would provide that the inside handles of emergency exits that open outward must be protected against inadvertent operation. Currently this protection is required by applying the general safety provisions of this subchapter. The addition of the specific requirement in &sect;23.807(b) would clarify the need for this protection by providing a requirement that addresses outward opening emergency exits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed revision to &sect;23.807(b)(5) and new &sect;23.807(b)(6) would apply to acrobatic and utility category airplanes that are approved for maneuvers, such a spinning. The proposed rule would require that emergency exits for these category airplanes allow the occupants to abandon the airplane at certain speeds related to such maneuvers. These emergency exits need to function under different environmental conditions than the emergency exits on normal category airplanes. The revision of the text in paragraph (b)(5) would provide the same terminology that is used in added new paragraph (b)(6).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.841&blank;Pressurized Cabins  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The proposed revision to &sect;23.841(a) would extend the cabin pressure requirements of current paragraph (a), which now apply to airplanes certificated for operation above 31,000 feet, to airplanes certificated for over 25,000 feet. Current 14 CFR part 25, JAR 25, and proposed JAR 23 include the same requirement as this proposal. This proposed requirement is intended to protect the airplane occupants from harm if a malfunction occurs at altitudes where symptoms of hypoxia occur, usually above 25,000 feet. Due to the increasing use of turbine powered engines, more part 23 airplanes will be approved for operations above 25,000 feet, thus exposing an increasing number or occupants, who may have some breathing difficulties, to these altitudes. The occupants should have the same protection provided by the airworthiness standards of part 25 and JAR 25.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.853&blank;Passengers and Crew Compartment Interiors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This proposal would revise the section heading from ``Compartment Interiors'' to ``Passenger and crew compartment interiors'' for consistency with the introductory text of the section and to clarify the content of the section.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=2 --> Section 23.855&blank;Cargo and Baggage Compartment Fire Protection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This proposed new section would require the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (a) would require all sources of heat within each cargo and baggage compartment that are capable of igniting the compartment contents to be shielded and insulated to prevent such ignition.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Proposed paragraph (b) would require cargo and baggage compartments to be constructed of materials that meet the appropriate provisions of &sect;23.853(d)(3). Currently these requirements apply to commuter category airplanes and to the materials used in the compartments of these airplanes. The proposed new requirement would expand this applicability to the cargo and baggage compartments of all part 23 airplanes. In effect, the proposed new requirement would require materials that are self-extinguishing rather than flame resistant as currently required under &sect;23.787(d).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

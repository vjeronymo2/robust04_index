			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Bottomley announces new round of trust hospitals MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, announced yesterday that a further 99 hospitals and other medical establishments would be given self-governing trust status in April. She also promised to expand the number of family doctors authorised to control their budgets, and forecast administrative savings through a reduction in the number of health authorities. Details of the administrative changes - expected to make the most impact on regional health authorities - would be announced to parliament. Mrs Bottomley said trust status - which removed hospitals from the control of district health authorities - had benefited patients. Waiting times had been reduced, and 116 patients were being treated compared to 100 before the switch to trust status. She said: 'In two years' time virtually every hospital, community and ambulance service will have become a trust'. Scoffing at abolition threats made by Mr David Blunkett, Labour's shadow health secretary, she maintained that trusts were good for staff, good for patients and were 'here for good'. Mrs Bottomley undertook to apply the same determination in extending the number of 'budget-holding' family doctors, whose skills 'make our money go further for patients'. She contended that Labour MPs loathed fundholding - 'they level down,' she said. 'We level up.' Emphasising the importance of avoiding waste in the NHS which spent Pounds 100m every day, she said the saving of one penny in the pound meant an extra Pounds 1m every day for patients.</p>

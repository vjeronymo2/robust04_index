			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Parliament and Politics: Unions warned in Labour links row UNION leaders were warned yesterday that they risked damaging the Labour party's reputation by opposing reforms of their links with the party urged by Mr John Smith, its leader, Ralph Atkins writes. As leaders of six of Britain's biggest unions prepared to meet later this week to discuss alternatives to Mr Smith's proposals, Mr Roy Hattersley, former deputy leader, warned that Labour would be 'cruelly handicapped' if it continued to be regarded as being dominated by trade unions. Labour party officials say Mr Smith is braced for a showdown with unions over his plans to introduce one-member-one-vote for the selection and re-selection of Labour parliamentary candidates. Opposing him are likely to be the Transport and General Workers' union, the GMB general union, the MSF technicians' union, the UCW communications union and the RMT, the rail and seamen's union.</p>

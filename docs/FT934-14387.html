			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Despatches: From Russia with stitches IT WAS a moment one never believes will actually happen. On my left a Russian nurse, sporting outrageous green eyeshadow, was trying to push a huge needle into my arm. On my right, another nurse was fiddling with a 1950s-style machine, with shiny dials and ominous steel levers. Above me, as I lay on the operating table, a bearded surgeon was asking, in sign language, if I had any allergy to medicines. 'No - but do you have any disposable needles?' I squeaked nervously, as I tried to remember the Russian for 'blood transfusion.' Ever since I had first arrived in Russia, I had regarded its medical system with horrified awe. I had heard the aprocryphal rumours of equipment-starved hospitals, where conditions were suspect and hygiene was minimal. Indeed, in central Asia I had once made an anthropological study of a village hospital, which had left me relieved that I had never been ill there. I had never expected that I would be thrown on to the mercy of a Russian operating table myself, let alone in the remote town of Chelyabinsk in the Urals. I had not even arrived under any politically dramatic pretext. Earlier that evening, while visiting the dacha of a local political leader, I had mistakenly opened the cellar door looking for the toilet - and tumbled 12ft down into the darkness, slicing my leg in gory fashion. As we later sped through the night to Chelyabinsk's best - or it seemed, only - hospital, I breezily declared that all I needed was a few quick stitches. But 'quick stitches' were not, it seemed, something the Russian medical system was geared for. In spite of being one of the most industrial regions in Russia, with 3.6m inhabitants, Chelyabinsk's hospital did not have any local anaesthetic. Nor did it appear to have an x-ray machine, or, as I later discovered, any elasticated bandages. What about disposable needles? my companions asked. I reflected that at least he had never heard of press reports of hepatitis or Aids in the Urals. 'Sadly, we don't have any,' murmured the surgeon, as he made a great show of sterilising everything in sight. 'Well, I don't want anyone else's blood under any circumstances,' was my final plea, as the general anaesthetic took hold. Four hours later I came around, dizzy and thirsty. As the hospital's first Western visitor I had been assigned the best suite - a single room, with a wash basin, iron-sprung bed, two broken radios and a mysteriously locked fridge. A young medical assistant popped in, sloshed iodine everywhere, and solemnly informed me that I had 20 stitches, sewn with thread that looked like gardening twine. Hours later I was woken again, this time by a sturdy dezhurnaya, the legendary caretaker women who control the keys to every institution in Russia, wielding God-like power. 'Breakfast is ready in the restaurant. Sit in your correct place - Number 5,' she barked. I limped shakily down the dimly lit corridor, decorated - I later noticed - with posters warning of the dangers of industrial electrocution. Just when I had found place Number 5, another dezhurnaya popped up. 'It's too early]' she shouted, ignoring my leg. I obediently limped back. My surgeon reappeared, looking exhausted. He daubed thick black liquid on my leg, turning itinto something from a horror film set. As I attempted to engage him in small talk, he told me that most of the doctors in the hospital were Jewish or German. The surgeon - who I was later told by Western doctors had done an extremely good job - had seen his salary slashed by economic reform, and earned the equivalent of Dollars 40 (Pounds 26.40) a month. Meanwhile, he told me, I would have to stay in the hospital for several days. Horrified, I hopped back to the restaurant, where the rest of the patients had been rounded up by the dezhurnayas. They all looked remarkably healthy, but on closer questioning it transpired that many had already been in the hospital for weeks, reluctant to relinquish the free treatment, food and gossip - the two main topics that day, I discovered, was my own arrival and the 'terrible events' that had been happening in Moscow. A mug of tea, with a ration of sugar - a luxury that I alone was given, apparently because I was a foreigner - was plonked in front of me. Then came a tin bowl of cold kasha, buckwheat porridge. I ignored it. But the dezhurnayas were determined. 'You've got to eat your kasha,' one said, chasing me down the corridor. Defeated, I limped into my room with the kasha and hid it in a drawer. Hours later, to my huge relief, a cheerful American journalist from the Christian Science Monitor appeared, clutching bars of chocolate and a doctor's white coat. In accordance with the 'hygiene regime' in the hospital, he had been ordered to wear it before entering my room. Tickets had been obtained, he said, for the next flight to Moscow. And although Aeroflot was officially banned from carrying sick passengers, a Finnish doctor had advised drinking vodka so that I could play drunk if there were any questions. The release forms were finally produced, the dezhurnayas gave me two more bowls of kasha and then finally, to my relief, I was free to go. 'We are hoping to introduce all kinds of new equipment, although these economic reforms have made things very difficult. So of course we would like some Western aid,' said one of the doctors as he gave me a final check. 'I do hope that this hospital can see you again,' he added. It was not a sentiment I could truthfully share.</p>

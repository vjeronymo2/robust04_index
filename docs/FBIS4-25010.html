			<p>BFN     [Text] A five-story factory building in Shenzhen City's  Longgang District suddenly collapsed at 0730 yesterday, trapping  106 workers who were staying in the factory dormitory on the  second floor of the building beneath collapsed concrete ceilings.    After the collapse, the Longgang District Government  immediately set up a rescue command center at the scene and  organized members of the party, government, and Army to start a  rescue operation with all their strength. Li Youwei, secretary  of the Shenzhen city party committee and mayor, and other  officials also rushed to the scene to attend to the operation.  By the time this report was filed last night, a total of 63  casualties had been hospitalized, of which 34 were still in the  hospital, four had died, and nine were seriously injured.    It has been verified that this building belonged to the  Jiecheng Plastic Factory, which is wholly owned by Hong Kong  businessman Wang Chengen. The factory building had been built  on a plot of reclaimed land, formerly part of a river bed, which  had been filled with soft soil. The construction had been  started hastily in the absence of any architectural plans,  before any application had been lodged with the authorities, and  before any legal examination and approval procedures had been  completed. Both the steel frame and the beam and column  concrete support structures were of inferior quality; the  project's quality control was not up to standard; and the  building had been put into use before all the construction work  was completed. The rescue operation is still in full swing.</p>

			<p>941110 FT  10 NOV 94 / German health insurance call The German government yesterday called on statutory health insurance bodies to cut contributions paid by workers and employers by January 1995, prompting a sharp reaction from the federation of health insurance funds (AOK). A government statement said contributions - averaging around 13 per cent of salary, divided equally between workers and employers - should be lowered because the new state scheme of care for the aged would relieve the insurance funds of the need to support those needing special care after next April. However, the AOK said contributions had been reduced last year and more than DM2bn (Dollars 1.3bn) passed on to individuals and employers. The AOK said it had no financial reserves which would justify cutting contributions, but would consider cutting them again in 1995.</p>

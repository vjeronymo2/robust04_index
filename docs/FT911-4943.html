			<p>910417 FT  17 APR 91 / The Lex Column: Royal Insurance Given that Royal Insurance chalked up pre-tax losses of Pounds 187m last year, it might seem odd to sell a subsidiary which actually makes money. Disposing of Royal Reinsurance, however, is surely the right decision. The price extracted from General Re - perhaps a little over Pounds 100m - is secondary. The point is that primary insurers should not be in the highly specialised, highly risky business of reinsurance unless they are determined to be really big. History shows a clear correlation between size and profitability, a lesson which Legal &amp; General absorbed last year when it sold Victory to the Dutch. Now that Royal has conceded it has neither the resources nor the expertise to grow the product or geographical base of Royal Re, perhaps the Pru will be next to follow suit. Its Mercantile and General might have entered the big league if all had gone to plan: yesterday's evidence of buyers in the market could be as good a time as any to bail out. deal does little to mend its battered balance sheet. This year's bounce in equities has lifted the solvency margin from 32 per cent to about 40 per cent; the disposal will not take it much beyond 43 per cent. The company continues to insist that its Aachener and Munchener stake is not for sale and that there are no plans for a rights issue. But with premium rates set to increase and dividends unlikely to be covered for at least another year, the stock market's health could be crucial.</p>

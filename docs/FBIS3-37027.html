However, he emphasized that Ukraine did not intend to back  down from the earlier agreement with the UN concerning an  increase in Ukraine's military presence in the former Yugoslavia  by 3 times its current number within the scope of UN peacemaking  forces.    The Ukrainian parliament decided to increase the personnel  of  the Ukrainian battalion within the UN forces in Sarajevo from  400 to 1,220 people in late 1993.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / Bank damps hopes of rate cut THE BANK of England yesterday moved to stamp out speculation of an early cut in interest rates - but left the markets half expecting one next week. Hopes of a cut have been building strongly ahead of the sharp fall in inflation likely to be announced next Friday, the day after the Monmouth by-election. The government has, in cutting base rates four times since mid-February, twice done so on the same day as it announced falls in the retail prices index. In a deliberate squeeze on the market which it agreed with the Treasury in advance, the Bank damped speculation of a cut by lending Pounds 965m at the current base rate of 12 per cent for a period of 14 days. As it had declined to buy Treasury bills yielding 11 1/2 per cent from the market earlier in the day, this tightened monetary conditions and underlined its desire to see the 12 per cent base rate stick. It is thought the Bank took tough action after earlier signals failed to take effect. On Thursday it was forced to keep the market short of funds the day after Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor, cautioned against reading too much into the predicted fall in inflation to 6.2 per cent. He warned then that the headline rate's fall from 8.2 per cent would reveal 'no more' than the effect of last year's imposition of the community charge dropping out of the 12-month figures, aided by recent interest rate reductions. However, as next week is expected to bring a fresh crop of recessionary data as well as a sharp fall in inflation, hopes of a  1/2 percentage point cut remain alive. In the City, analysts pointed out a recent precedent for a cut in interest rates during a period of central bank lending at the current base rate. In late February, the rate was cut to 13 per cent just five days after the Bank lent to the market at 13 1/2 per cent for seven days. Sterling rates are already discounting a cut, while the pound is firm on the foreign exchanges. It closed yesterday in London at DM2.9650 from DM2.9700, well above its European exchange rate mechanism rate. The three-month interbank rate was unchanged from Thursday's closing level of around 11 1/2 per cent. In a market survey yesterday, MMS International, the financial research company, suggested that the authorities may 'sneak in' a cut before the Monmouth poll. Money Markets, Page 13 Lex, Page 24</p>

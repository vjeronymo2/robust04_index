			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Extended welcome to Italian family: The Agnellis' increasing investment in the French market Over the past five years, Italy's Agnelli family has gradually turned itself into France's largest foreign corporate investor, in turnover terms, almost without anybody noticing. The Agnellis have slid into the French business establishment with patient steps, doing their best to avoid treading on sore spots. They have led a general increase in Italian investment, there and provide an example of how to understand and infiltrate a foreign market, especially one as sensitive to foreign invasion as France. The latest advance for the Agnellis' French interests comes via Saint Louis, the paper and sugar group in which they have a large minority stake. It has paid FFr1.5bn (Pounds 154.3m) for 13.8 per cent of Source Perrier. This stake, formerly held by Perrier itself, has indirectly tightened the Italian family's grip on the world's largest mineral water group. It also brings a powerful French shareholder into Perrier, soothing French fears that the group was about to pass into entirely foreign hands. Ifil, an Agnelli holding group, owns only 6.4 per cent of Saint Louis - bought last July - but works in partnership with Worms et Cie, the French family-controlled holding group which holds 36 per cent of Saint Louis shares and nearly 49.5 per cent of the voting rights, so giving the pair a clear majority. Separately, another Agnelli holding company, Ifint, is bidding for Exor, the wine-to-property holding group in which it had been buying shares since the start of last year and which controls 35 per cent of Perrier. Between them, Exor and Saint Louis control 48.8 per cent of Perrier shares. Saint Louis would hate to be seen as a pawn in the Agnellis' latest move. The deal has an industrial benefit for the sugar and paper group, says Mr Bernard Dumon, Saint Louis' chairman. He told shareholders on Monday that Saint Louis wanted to reinforce its food business and had been in contact with Mr Jacques Vincent, Perrier's recently retired chairman, since 1987. He did not exclude increasing Saint Louis' stake in Perrier further. So what are the Agnellis up to in France? They may not have a very fixed idea themselves, according to Mr Gian Luigi Gabetti, head of Ifint. 'The Agnelli group must not be seen like some monolithic bloc. There is no centralised programme, nor a central brain. What counts is personal connections . . . Co-ordination at the highest level to avoid collisions in business,' he said. Some Agnelli-watchers in Paris say that, in the food industry at least, the long-term prize is BSN, the leading French food group and Perrier's main competitor in mineral water. BSN's chairman, 73-year-old Mr Antoine Riboud, has made little apparent provision for his succession, and has become one of Italy's biggest food operators with the Agnellis' help. BSN and Ifil's partnership began in early 1987 when they jointly bought Ferrarelle, an Italian mineral water producer, and exchanged small stakes in each other later that year. Since then, they have snapped up Galbani, the Italian cheese group, the Panzani and Agnesi pasta brands and a stake in Peroni, Italy's largest beer group. Last month, Ifil sold full ownership of its jointly-held Italian mineral waters to BSN, making the French company Italy's leading supplier of mineral water. The bargain could be that the Agnellis will support Mr Riboud's food and drink ambitions as long as he is at the helm at BSN, on the understanding that their interests will be well placed to succeed him, speculates an observer. Ifil has always stressed that it will do nothing in BSN without Mr Riboud's agreement. Whatever the Agnellis' ultimate goal, the rules by which they play in France are clear - to observe the sensitivities of the local establishment and to avoid making hostile moves. Ifint, for example, briefly jarred two leading French banks last year by offering to buy only 66 per cent of Exor, but extended its offer to include all of the shares when it saw dissent in the air. Food and drink is only the latest theme to enter the Agnellis' French interests, which represent an estimated combined turnover of FFr44bn, slightly ahead of IBM France, the second-largest foreign investor. There is a joint leisure venture between Ifil and Accor, the French hotel group, plus minority stakes held by Ifint in the Club Mediterranee holiday group and a number of other French companies. There are also the French automotive and components businesses of Fiat, the Italian carmaker chaired by Mr Giovanni Agnelli, with a FFr30bn annual turnover. Fiat's French arm is headed by Mr Giorgio Frasca, who made the first contact with Mr Pierre Suard, chairman of the Alcatel Alsthom telecommunications and engineering group, which led in 1990 to the exchange of minority stakes between them. It is the same technique as used to seal the BSN partnership, although in the Alcatel Alsthom deal the pair also exchanged some businesses. The Agnelli family's recent advances invite the question of whether France is attracting a general inflow of Italian capital. Mr Raul Gardini is another recent investor, with his acquisition of a stake in Sucres et Denrees, the commodity trader. Not all Italian investors have had a smooth ride, as shown by the losses at Cerus, Mr Carlo De Benedetti's French holding company, following its failed bid for control of Societe Generale de Belgique. But that has not dimmed the perception, that with the single European market, the Italian business world sees a profitable home for itself in France.

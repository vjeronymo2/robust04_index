			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks recorded] </F>   [Excerpts] The destiny of nuclear waste from the Loviisa  power plant in Russia is dividing Finnish opinion. The  environmental organization Greenpeace, which visited the area,  claims that the nuclear waste from Loviisa ends up in nuclear  bombs. The Radiation Protection Center, which visited the area  a little later, denies this categorically. Jaana Kanninen  reports.    Kanninen: The representatives of the Radiation  Protection Center visited the Chelyabinsk nuclear plant in  February and the representatives of international Greenpeace in  January. They both had the same aim: to find out what happens  to the nuclear waste from Loviisa and whether the Mayak  reprocessing plant is safe. The people from the Radiation  Protection Center were able to visit the actual closed town that  consists of Chelyabinsk Number 65 with its 85,000 inhabitants  and the military and non-miltary part of the Mayak nuclear  plant. The Finns were not allowed in the military plant.  Greenpeace, for its part, was not even allowed to visit the  closed town but had to content itself with information from a  capital city about 80 kilometers away. In reading the reports  of those two groups it seems as if they are talking about  different planets. One of the central claims of Greenpeace is  that the nuclear waste from Loviisa at least partly ends up as  material for nuclear bombs. [passage omitted]    Nuclear safety manager Jukka Laaksonen from the Radiation  Protection Center denies this categorically.    Laaksonen: ``The nuclear waste from Loviisa is not  used for military purposes, this is absolutely clear.''    Kanninen: Two military reactors are still  operating in Mayak and they manufacture mainly tritium, an  explosive used in nuclear warheads. Laaksonen says, however,  that nuclear waste has nothing to do with the manufacturing of  tritium. Ida Siimes of Greenpeace, for her part, thinks that it  is quite possible that plutonium is also manufatured in Mayak  and the spent nuclear fuel is suitable for that. The only thing  the two parties agree on is the health of the local inhabitants.    Laaksonen: ``It is clear that the old waste has  caused an increased risk of cancer and some of the people in the  area who have cancer have no doubt contracted it because of the  waste.''    Kanninen: Jukka Laaksonen from the Radiation  Protection Center says that the incidence of cancer is caused by  old sins: accidents and emissions, of which there were many in  the history of Chelyabinsk. According to him, the waste  reprocessing plant is now well-managed and no emissions into the  environment take place. Greenpeace disagrees.    Siimes: ``The local laboratories in Chelyabinsk  have measured an increase in the quantity of plutonium isotopes  outside the closed area, and this is believed to be caused by  Mayak's emissions into the atmosphere. The amount of plutonium  has increased even in the 1990s and it is therefore reasonable  to assume that the plant is still making dangerous emissions  into the atmosphere.'' [passage omitted]</p>

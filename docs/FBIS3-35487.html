This German doctor has concluded from  intensive laboratory tests that the Americans and their allies  used nuclear radioactive weapons in their aggression against  Iraq, contrary to international conventions banning the use of  such weapons; foremost of which is the Geneva Convention of  1949. One of the conclusions reached by this European scientist  is that several Iraqi children actually died from exposure to  radiation from the abovementioned ammunition, and that 30-40  tonnes of radioactive uranium were dropped by U.S. and allied  forces over the southern desert region of Iraq.    There is no doubt whatsoever about Dr. Guenther's findings,  since they are the result of a scientific and analytical study  of samples obtained from the battlefield. He has no interest in  them, other than his desire to serve the truth and to expose the  aggressors and their false claims, which has subjected him to  many dangers. Therefore, his findings are considered  irrefutable testimony. Dr. Gunther wanted to tell this truth so  it will be added to the other facts and conclusions reached by  the working team of former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark,  the working group of "Doctors Without Borders," the Harvard  University Committee, the secretary general of the World Health  Organization, and several other international organizations and  figures known for their objectivity and honesty.    Professor Guenther's testimony and the previous facts and  conclusions about the same subject must not, by any moral or  political standards, be let to pass by without moving the world  public and regional and international organizations concerned  with human rights and the causes of peace, condemning the U.S.  aggressor and its allies, and removing the injustice done to  Iraq as a result of this despicable act, which violated all  laws, norms, and values.    The U.S. crime of using nuclear weapons against the Iraqis  is, in fact, a double crime because: First, the United States  has violated the provisions of an international law, which was  endorsed by the world community and to which many states have  given their commitment, headed the United States itself. So by  torpedoing this law, the United States has assumed full  responsibility for deliberately committing a crime while aware  of the great harm it would do. Second, the Americans have  cheated the United Nations by using it in carrying out their  odious aggression, which also means that they are responsible  for the crime of diverting this world organization from the  noble purposes and objectives enshrined in its charter. We  cannot possibly imagine the United Nations agreeing to serve as  a cover for the use of nuclear arms, when it does not stop  talking about its responsibility to prevent the proliferation of  nuclear weapons, and when it is the international sponsor of the  nonproliferation treaty.    The world is called upon not to let the case of the U.S. use  of nuclear weapons against Iraq be forgotten or treated  slightly. The least that must be done is to stop the  ramification of that crime in the form of the existing unfair  blockade, which is in fact a supplement to the nuclear weapons  used by the Americans and their allies. It is only fair and just  for world public to agree to the proposal made by Ramsey Clark  to form an international pressure group in order to urge the  Security Council and the Sanctions Committee to remove that  blockade.    What the Security Council and the Sanctions Committee can do  in this regard will correct part of the gross mistake they have  made. Moreover, it will ensure the return to political logic  that must prevail in international life.</p>

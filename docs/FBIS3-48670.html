			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Ray of Chuche" program: "The Invincible Vitality </F> of the Line for Building a Self-Reliant National Economy"]    [Text] Our party has persistently adhered to the line of  building a self-reliant national economy. Our party's line for  building a self-reliant national economy is the embodiment of  chuche ideology in economic construction and is a policy for  building an economy that is not subjugated to others, but  marches by itself, serves its people, and develops with its own  country's resources and the might of the people.    It is not easy to implement the line for building a  self-reliant national economy. Our people had to build the  economy anew on an empty field where everything was destroyed  and have firmly adhered to the line for building a self-reliant  national economy even under the circumstance of carrying on  socialist construction while constantly facing the imperialists'  invasion threat.    The dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il is wisely leading us  today to firmly maintain the line for building a self-reliant  national economy, even while socialist construction is  progressing at a high level. The dear leader Comrade Kim  Chong-il has pointed out: Only when we build a self-reliant  economy that marches by itself based on modern technology, can  we firmly guarantee an independent and creative working and  material lifestyle for the people, achieve chuche in ideology,  independence in politics, self-reliance in defense, and  strengthen the country's independence.    We cannot think of the great results and victory achieved in  revolution and construction by our people in recent years  without the dear comrade leader's wise leadership in the  implementation of the line for building a self-reliant national  economy.    The line for building a self-reliant national economy is  vigorously displaying its correctness and vitality in our  country today. The invincible vitality of our party's line for  building a self-reliant national economy is represented, above  all, by the fact that the country's political independence is  firmly defended.    Political independence is the very life of a sovereign and  independent country. Such important political independence is  guaranteed by a self-reliant national economy. A self-reliant  economy is a material guarantee for achieving political  independence.    The serious situation in which socialism was recently  frustrated in many countries shows that political independence  cannot be achieved without a self-reliant economy. These  countries were economically bound to big countries because they  failed to build a self-reliant economy earlier, and as a result,  they could not establish self-reliance in every aspect, but kept  following others' modifications, thus spoiling the revolution.    Under the wise leadership of the party and the leader, our  people have always firmly defended political independence by  building a self-reliant national economy. It is our party and  people's firm stance and will that we cannot concede national  dignity and interest to anyone and that there is nothing to be  afraid of.    Thanks to the strong and self-reliant economy, our party and  people are able to independently establish a line and policy in  conformity with our own demands, implement with our own might,  and exercise the rights as an independent country in a dignified  manner with complete equality and sovereignty in the  international arena.    The invincible vitality of our party's line for building a  self- reliant national economy lies in the fact that it  ceaselessly strengthens the country's material and technological  base and accelerates economic development at a high speed. To  strengthen the country's material and technological base and to  guarantee a high speed in the country's economic development is  to build a self- reliant national economy.    Only when we build a self-reliant economy can we develop a  stable economy at a high speed and ceaselessly strengthen the  country's material and technological base under all  circumstances.    Because the South Korean economy is a colonial  subordination economy heavily relying on outside technology and  resources, its base is weak and it is deteriorating into a  bubble economy that is empty inside. By contrast, our economy  is a powerful economy that enables us to live by our own efforts  under all circumstances. The material and technological base of  a self-reliant national economy built with our people's own  power is very superior and continues to be consolidated.    Modern plants and complexes are being built, and numerous  monumental creations, such as the magnificent and splendid Sohae  Lock Gate and Kwangbok and Tongil Streets, are being set up in  our country. This clearly proves the superiority of our  self-reliant economy.    Thanks to powerful self-reliant economy, our party and our  people, under all circumstances, are rapidly developing an  economy based on a self-reliant economy.    The imperialists and reactionaries are now persistently  resorting to the political, military pressure and economic  blockade to isolate and stifle our Republic, which is advancing  under the uplifted banner of socialism. With the collapse of  the socialist market of the world, we are faced with a new  obstacle in external economic relations. Because there is a  firm self-reliant national economy built with our own efforts,  our people are developing an economy with initiative.    Industrial output increased 50 percent and the average  annual  growth of industrial output reached 5.6 percent during the Third  Seven-Year Plan. This clearly shows how rapidly our  self-reliant economy continues to develop. The invincible  vitality of our party's line for building a self-reliant  national economy lies in the fact that it consistently promotes  the people's standard of living and fully displays the  superiority of socialism of our style.    The basic purpose of socialist economic construction is to  promote the people's standard of living. In order to fulfill  this purpose, socialist construction should be done on the basis  of self-reliance.    Only a self-reliant economy can satisfactorily guarantee the  people's increasing demand for goods and culture and can highly  display the superiority of the socialist system. It is a matter  of course that the people are not ensured with basic goods and  cultural conditions in capitalist countries where economic  activities only benefit the few of the privileged class, and in  the countries where economic life is thoroughly dependent on  monopolistic foreign capitalists. In our country, all the  people choose occupations according to ability and propensity  and enjoy life and happiness, free from any worries over  clothes, food, and shelter.    Our people are enjoying goods and cultural life under the  benevolence of communism, such as free medical care and free  compulsory education given by the party and the state. This is  the true aspect of our society.    In this way, in our country, the people's standard of living  is getting higher as days go by and the superiority of socialism  is fully displayed. These are unthinkable apart from our firm  self-reliant national economy.    Thanks to our country's superior self-reliant economy, the  party and the state ensure happy life for the people. All of  these facts clearly show the superiority of socialism of our own  style to capitalism and are a proud reality brought forth by a  self-reliant national economy.    Today we are faced with the honorable, yet heavy, task to  thoroughly carry out the revolutionary economic strategy set  forth by the party. Only when the party's economic strategy is  brilliantly implemented can the superiority of a self-reliant  national economy be further strengthened and a new upturn be  registered in the people's standard of living and socialist  construction.    All party members and working people, under the wise  leadership of the party and the leader [suryong], should firmly  adhere to the line for building a self-reliant national economy  and thoroughly carry out the revolutionary economic strategy set  forth by the party.</p>

			<p><P> September 6, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> RECREATION;  </P> <P> BIKE HIKES;  </P> <P> LONG STRETCHES OF FOUR SUGGESTED ROUTES ARE FLAT OR DOWNHILL, SO DUST OFF YOUR  TWO-WHEELER.  </P> <P> Flip through a Thomas Guide and you will be struck by the white space between  cities. All that land, intersected by asphalt, is a bicyclist's dream: acres of  flower farms, rolling citrus orchards dotted with windmills and just plain,  wide-open space.  </P> <P> Drawn from the experience of bicycle club members, shop owners and the county's  Transportation Commission, here are four routes that encompass ocean, country,  mountain and lakeside views. A considerable portion of the routes are flat or  downhill, so there's no excuse for not dusting off your garaged bicycle. We've  even thrown in a few rest stops.  </P> <P> Portions of the following route descriptions include bike paths detailed in a  bikeway map, a first for the county, recently issued by the Transportation  Commission. Call 642-1591 for a copy.  </P> <P> Mileage for the following looped routes is given in round-trip figures.  </P> <P> * The Rancho Run: 22 miles  </P> <P> Rolling farmlands and citrus groves are the main attraction along this country  loop that begins at Dos Caminos Park in Camarillo.  </P> <P> Park at Senan Street and Vincente Avenue in the Dos Caminos parking lot.  </P> <P> Turn right on Vincente, left on Antonio Avenue and right on Las Posas Road,  which will lead you to Lewis Road. As you take a left, the road immediately  becomes Somis Road, a nice line of black asphalt that parallels the old  Southern Pacific railroad line. You'll spot several rail yards and lumberyards  to your right and fields of bluish-gray kale on the left.  </P> <P> Within one mile on the right is Kitty's Produce, should you care to grab a  bagful of peaches or plums.  </P> <P> Just beyond Kitty's, turn left on North Street, which takes you through a  residential stretch packed with front yards sprouting roses, gladioli and  wildflower sprays. Within one mile the road curves to the right and dead-ends  in a tractor yard at California 118. Turn left on 118, then right on Bradley  Road for views of an idyllic countryside -- rows of orange trees stretch across  distant, tan hills and oleander bushes hug the narrow road with bursts of red  and white. Cars are scarce, so enjoy the quiet and don't forget to breathe in  the sage and fennel.  </P> <P> After one mile, take a left on Berylwood Road, a right on Aggen Road and a left  on La Loma Avenue. This rolling, four-mile expanse intersects Rancho Las Posas,  Rancho Santa Clara del Norte and Rancho Margarita.  </P> <P> Tired? Prop your bike against some willow trees and watch the lazy windmills  sprouting from the landscape.  </P> <P> La Loma curves left into La Vista Avenue and dead-ends at California 118. Turn  right on 118 and follow the winding, downhill road for two miles to Wright Road  where a lemon-yellow house smothered with hollyhocks stands on the southeast  corner. Take a left on Wright and travel for one mile beneath a windbreak of  ash trees, just to the left of acres of fledgling pepper plants.  </P> <P> Turn right on Beardsley Road, which dead-ends at Central Avenue, where you'll  take a left and ride one mile before passing over the Ventura Freeway. Take a  left on Ventura Boulevard and a left on Las Posas Road. Pass back across the  freeway and veer right within one-half mile (still on Las Posas) for a two-mile  ride back to Antonio Avenue. Turn right on Antonio and right on Vincente Avenue  and you're back at Dos Caminos Park.  </P> <P> * The Inter-City Improvise: 44 miles  </P> <P> If it's Monday afternoon, you must be in Montalvo. This challenging intercity  route with excellent ocean views also takes you in or near El Rio, Camarillo,  Port Hueneme, Oxnard and Ventura.  </P> <P> From Camarillo's Freedom Park, head west on Pleasant Valley Road four miles  past a lima bean farm. When Pleasant Valley intersects Pacific Coast Highway,  jog left along Rice Avenue, then right, to pick up Pleasant Valley Road once  again. Turn right on Rose Avenue and left on Channel Islands Boulevard.  </P> <P> Within one-half mile on your right is Jonsons Farms (1111 E. Channel Islands  Blvd.), a mammoth red barn packed to the rafters with crates of exotic fruit,  local vegetables and cold drinks.  </P> <P> Cycle four more miles to Channel Islands Harbor and take a right on Harbor  Boulevard, following it along the ocean for six miles. Take a left on Peninsula  Street (near the Ventura Freeway) and a right on Pierpont Boulevard, which will  take you to a two-mile length of Class I bikeway that begins at San Pedro  Street. Now may be a good time to have lunch at one of several restaurants  along the route. The view will never be better.  </P> <P> Follow the path as it turns inland for half a mile. Turn right on Main Street  and right on Thompson Boulevard (just before Ventura Boulevard). Thompson  curves to the left and travels for nearly three miles before veering right and  turning into Main Street. Follow Main Steet under the Ventura Freeway and turn  right on Arundell Avenue, which turns into a Class I bikeway for nearly one  mile until it dead-ends at Harbor Boulevard.  </P> <P> Turn left on Harbor, left on Gonzales Road for four miles and then left on Rose  Avenue. Pass over the Ventura Freeway and turn right on Central Avenue. Cross  over the Ventura Freeway again, turn left on Ventura Blvd., right on Las Posas  Road and right on Pleasant Valley Road, taking you back to Freedom Park.  </P> <P> * Foster's Favorite: 27 miles  </P> <P> Begin at Foster Park, just south of Ojai, for this mountain valley loop, half  of it along a Class I bikeway and most of it with expansive views of Sulphur  and Black mountains.  </P> <P> From the park, head north along the bikeway, which skirts the Ventura River.  Look closely, you may spot red-tailed hawks gliding just above hundreds of oak  trees on the surrounding hills. The path ends at the eastern edge of Ojai at  California 150, also called Ojai Avenue. Head west on Ojai Avenue toward town  where you'll be sharing the road with Ojai's emerald-green trolley car.  </P> <P> If you're ready for lunch, try the O-Hi Frostie, Home of the Hi-Burger, just  past Blanche Street on the north side of Ojai Avenue. Don't worry, there's  plenty of road ahead to cycle off any cholesterol.  </P> <P> Rest your legs at the clean, aqua-colored picnic benches where a sign reads:  "Ladies and Gentlemen do not sit or put their feet on tables." Do as you're  told.  </P> <P> Saddle up and follow Ojai Avenue west as it becomes Paseo Road. (Don't veer  left). Turn right on Foothill Road and left on Fairview Road where miles of  white, split-rail fences stripe the hills. The narrow road dips and rises, then  takes a three-quarter-mile spiral plunge through the hills -- an exhilarating  descent. Take care as you cross Maricopa Highway -- a blind curve to your left  conceals oncoming speeding cars.  </P> <P> Continue straight ahead along Fairview and turn left on Rice Road for two miles  to California 150, also called Baldwin Road in these parts. Take a right on 150  and a left on Burnham Road, following a curved descent among horse farms with  such names as Rancho del Rey and God's Little Acre. Burnham turns into Santa  Ana Road -- another downhill stretch to Casitas Vista Road. Turn left on  Casitas Vista, which becomes Foster Park Drive, taking you back to Foster Park.  </P> <P> * The Chumash Challenge: 26 miles  </P> <P> This route intersects Ventura and Los Angeles counties and rounds serene Lake  Sherwood, following the path of the Chumash Indians who lived in the area about  700 years ago.  </P> <P> Begin at the Landing Shopping Center on Lindero Canyon Road in Westlake  Village. Head south on Lindero and turn right on Triunfo Canyon Road, which  skirts the Westlake Marina. Turn left on Westlake Boulevard, and right on  Potrero Road into the foothills for some roller-coaster cycling past Lake  Sherwood.  </P> <P> Past the lake, Potrero Road offers some expansive views on your right, and, on  your left, sprawling country manors with such names as Boxfield Riding Stables,  Brookfield Farms and Howlett's Valley Farm.  </P> <P> Look for an Arabian horse ranch on your left (formerly owned by Sylvester  Stallone) as you round a wide right curve eight miles into the ride. Turn right  on Wendy Drive in Thousand Oaks and right on Lynn Road, a wide ribbon of  asphalt that will take you four miles past more horse ranches and country  vistas. Pass over the Ventura Freeway, take a right on Hillcrest Drive and look  for the Class I bikeway that curves around The Oaks and Janss Mall. The bikeway  will lead you to Moorpark Road. Turn right on Moorpark and left on Thousand  Oaks Boulevard.  </P> <P> About three miles up on the left, just before Duesenberg Drive, drop into  Pancho's Mexican Restaurant for food prepared by Kim Pancho -- the Chinese chef  and owner. He recommends the chile relleno for $5.29 and a glass of cold Tecate  enjoyed on the shaded patio.  </P> <P> Saddle your mechanical steed and continue down Thousand Oaks Boulevard to  Lindero Canyon Road. Take a right and continue south to the Landing Shopping  Center.  </P></p>

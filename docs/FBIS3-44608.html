Yesterday, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier  Li Peng had an informal discussion with some of the delegates  and gave important instructions on strengthening political and  legal work, maintaining social stability, and safeguarding  reform, opening up, and economic development, which fully showed  that the party Central Committee and the State Council set much  store by political and legal work and are determined to uphold  the principle of doing two types of work simultaneously and  attaching importance to both, thus greatly inspiring comrades  attending the meeting and vast numbers of capable policemen on  the political and legal front throughout the country.    The key agenda item of the national political and legal  meeting is studying how to implement on the political and legal  front the guidelines laid by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and how to strengthen and reform  political and legal work to ensure smooth and healthy  development of our socialist market economy in light of the  outstanding issues which affect social stability. The "Decision  of the CPC Central Committee on Some Issues Concerning the  Establishment of a Socialist Market Economic Structure" adopted  by the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee  is the overall plan for establishment of a socialist market  economic structure in our country and the program of action for  reforming our economic structure, as well as a working guide of  our legal and political front.    The current domestic and international situation offers us a  rare and excellent opportunity, but in the process of  transforming the old system into a new one and readjusting  various relations of interests, all kinds of conflicts often  arise. In a certain period of time, criminal offenses and  economic crimes may increase and such corrupt phenomena as  embezzlement and bribes will still grow, and all these may  affect political and social stability. Hence, under the new  situation of developing the socialist market economy, the  political and legal front is undertaking a even more arduous  task and political and legal work can only be strengthened and  never weakened. Centering on economic construction, the  political and legal front is faced with two key tasks: First,  they must spare no effort to create a stable social and  political environment for reform, opening up, and modernization;  and second, they must furnish the development of the socialist  market economy with good legal protection and services. The  relationship between reform and opening up, economic  development, and social stability is a dialectic, reciprocal,  and integrative one. The solid foundation of consolidating the  stable and unified political situation is to deepen reform, open  up wider, and accelerate development; whereas the precondition  of reform and development is to maintain political stability.  Comrade Xiaoping pointed out, "To reform, we must have a stable  political environment; we can do nothing without this  condition." Only when we uphold the four cardinal principles  and maintain social and political stability, can we vigorously  ensure the smooth proceeding of reform, opening up, and economic  construction. Hence, we must resolutely smash disruptive  activities launched by hostile forces, continue to fight against  all kinds of criminal activities in a strict and fast manner  according to law, unremittingly wipe out various hideous  phenomena in society, resolutely keep launching the  anti-corruption struggle, and devote our energies to  investigating and punishing large and important cases. Leaders  at all levels must learn how to handle internal conflicts among  the people under the new situation and make efforts to go deep  among the masses to resolve conflicts. We must carry forward  the glorious tradition of integrating special work with the mass  line and rely on the masses to do a good job in the  comprehensive management of public security.    The development and protection of the socialist market  economy relies on the legal system. The structure of the main  body of market, the operation of market behavior, and the  government's macroscopic regulation must all proceed according  to law, and it is only under these conditions that can we ensure  that the market economy develops in a fair and orderly  direction. The political and legal front must give full play to  the function of serving the socialist market economic structure,  further strengthen economic, civil, and other kinds of judicial  work, accelerate the pace of reforming the lawyer and notary  system, and accomplish all kinds of work related to legal  services. At the same time, the political and legal front must  strictly investigate and punish economic criminal cases, such as  smuggling, fraud, tax evasion, refusal to pay taxes, trade mark  imitation, and production and selling of fake and poor- quality  goods, ensure normal operation of the market economy, and  establish a legal order of the socialist market economy.    To fulfill the arduous task of political and legal work  under  the new situation, leaders at all levels must conscientiously do  two types of work simultaneously while attaching importance to  both. At present, some leading cadres really do not have a  clear and firm understanding of the thinking of "simultaneously  doing two types of work" and do one type of work while  neglecting the other one. They are relatively competent at  economic work and appear impressive, but they do not give much  consideration to cultural and ideological progress, party  building, and the work of maintaining stability. Moreover, some  of them merely pay lip service to the work without making any  conscientious efforts. "Not to grasp firmly is not to grasp at  all." The situation of attaching importance to economic work  without paying heed to political work and attaching importance  to material progress without paying heed to cultural and  ideological progress is very dangerous and must be changed  thoroughly. Comrade Xiaoping pointed out long ago: "Without  enhancing cultural and ideological progress, material progress  will also be destroyed and we will take a tortuous path." Even  if we have rich material conditions, if hideous social phenomena  break out, corruption runs wild, and the social atmosphere is  very bad, this type of socialist modernization is not the one we  want. Hence, we must arm our minds with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, reach  a common ideology and understanding, and strengthen party's  leadership over political and legal work. First of all, we must  be determined to solve the kind of problems which are related to  the ideology and understanding of party and government leaders  at all levels.    We believe that through the national political and legal  work  meeting, all the comrades on the political and legal front,  under the guidelines laid by the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee, will definitely be able to uphold  the basic party line, conscientiously perform their tasks, spare  no effort in blazing a new trail, and be of one heart and one  mind to make greater and new contributions to fulfilling the  glorious mission entrusted to us by the epoch!</p>

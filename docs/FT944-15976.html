			<p>941015 FT  15 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases as Seoul records fifth consecutive high Heavy selling by banks depressed share prices and the Nikkei index, declining for the first time in five trading days, fell below the 20,000 level to which it had recovered on Wednesday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The 225-share average retreated 179.54 to 19,969.29 after opening at a high of 20,107.12 and hitting a low of 19,964.49 in the afternoon session. Selling linked to yesterday's options settlements and profit-taking by banks depressed share prices, while foreign investors continued to buy chemicals and steel issues. Volume totalled 397m shares against 353m, some 80m shares of the total accounted for by options settlements-related trading. The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 13.08 to 1,593.08 and the Nikkei 300 index fell 2.91 to 291.27. Losers led gainers by 675 to 334, with 156 issues remaining unchanged and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.77 to 1308.11. Steels were firm on buying by overseas investors. Sumitomo Metal Industries, the most active issue of the day, rose Y6 to Y356, while Nippon Steel fell Y7 to Y388. Foreigners also supported chemical stocks, with Mitsubishi Chemical up Y7 to Y583. 'People are betting on the rise in demand of steel and petrochemical products in south-east Asia and China,' said Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities. Banks were weak on profit-taking by companies. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y70 to Y3,000 and Sumitomo Bank declined Y60 to Y1,840. The rise of the yen to the Y98 level hit high-technology stocks. NEC fell Y10 to Y1,260 and Matsushita Electric Industrial lost Y20 to Y1,670. Japan Telecom fell Y10,000 to Y3.9m but Nippon Telegraph and Telephone rose Y3,000 to Y886,000, advancing for the fourth straight day. In Osaka, the OSE average fell 83.07 to 22,348.62 in volume of 19.7m shares. Roundup The region was supported by overnight gains on Wall Street. Nomura, once again, in-creased its asset allocation to south-east Asia; it did so at the expense of the US, with Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia each attracting an additional 1 percentage point weighting in its global portfolio. The Indonesian parliament yesterday approved a 5 per cent reduction in corporate and personal tax rates. Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia commented that this was positive for the market in terms of both earnings growth and sentiment: 'Put in a regional context, the new tax rate - of 30 per cent effective from January 1 1995 - will make Indonesia even more attractive compared with its rivals.' SEOUL finished at a fifth consecutive record high after further selling by the state-run stock market stabilisation fund failed to stop a buying spree. The composite index picked up another 6.83 to 1,103.37, taking the week's gains to 3.6 per cent. The index also posted a new record high of 1,108.08 during the morning. Volume totalled 58.2m shares, up from Thursday's 53.8m. HONG KONG finished firm, but well off the day's highs as investors were quick to take profits after an early rally. The Hang Seng index added 18.58 to 9,550.93, having been 128 points ahead in early trade, for a rise over the week of 2.9 per cent. HSBC Holdings was the lone bright spot carrying the index ahead. The stock gained HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 91 mainly on overseas buying. 'If it weren't for HSBC, the market would have fared rather worse,' said Mr Howard Gorges at South China Brokerage. Taking HSBC's lead, Bank of East Asia added 50 cents to HKDollars 33.30 and Wing Lung Bank rose 50 cents to HKDollars 54.50. Hong Kong Telecom slipped 10 cents to HKDollars 16.50 after news late on Wednesday that it was prepared to invest HKDollars 2bn in China's mobile and fixed phone networks. SINGAPORE was higher on fresh demand from institutional funds and the Straits Times Industrials index rose 19.48 to 2,377.30, for a 2.0 per cent rise on the week. QAF, which makes Gardenia bread, rose 10 cents to SDollars 1.62 amid rumours that a British company was planning to buy a stake at SDollars 2.50 a share. BANGKOK put on 1.6 per cent on an afternoon rally on reports that one of the parties forming the governing coalition had resolved a dispute over proposed nominations for senior ministerial posts. The SET index rose 23.49 to 1,498.55, for a week's gain of 2.7 per cent, in heavy turnover of Bt9.7bn. Shinawatra Computer ad-vanced Bt16 to Bt760 and its subsidiary Advanced Info by Bt20 to Bt450 on expectations the group's founder might be nominated as foreign minister. The banking sector saw some of the biggest gains, with the sub-index improving 3.1 per cent. Krung Thai Bank rose Bt3.50 to Bt82 with 19.8m shares changing hands, while Bangkok Bank put on Bt6 to Bt218 and Thai Farmers Bank Bt4 to Bt174. SYDNEY was motivated by Wall Street's good overnight gains, as well as by a strong rise in the gold sector. The All Ordinaries index added 7.1 to 2,006.0, up 2 per cent on the week. The gold index put on 34.1 to 2,327.3, bolstered by a 14 per cent rise in Plutonic Resources, the shares rising to a four-month high of ADollars 6.83. Plutonic reported that it had doubled its reserves at its deposits in Western Aus-tralia. Brokers said that investors, generally, remained nervous ahead of the release of inflation data next week. In the mining sector, CRA added 24 cents to ADollars 18.90, with MIM steady at ADollars 2.73 and WMC off 1 cent at ADollars 7.99.

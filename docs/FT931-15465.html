			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / International Company News: Buoyant Paramount lifts net income to Dollars 261.4m A STRONG recovery in movie and television profits helped Paramount Communications, the publishing, entertainment and theme parks group, to achieve a 21.7 per cent rise in its net income, to Dollars 101.4m, in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, ended October 31. For the whole of Paramount's fiscal 1992, net earnings were more than doubled - from Dollars 122.2m to Dollars 261.4m. Earnings per share for the full year were Dollars 2.19, against Dollars 1.03 last time. The company stressed yesterday that while it expected earnings momentum to continue in fiscal 1993, comparisons with its exceptional motion picture results in the early part of last year would prove to be unfavourable. Last year's earnings, struck on Dollars 4.26bn of total revenues, up from Dollars 3.9bn, benefited from substantial operating income from box office successes such as Wayne's World. Paramount said it also had a sharp improvement operating income from television programming. Results from theatre operations declined, while Madison Square Garden did better in 1992 thanks to proceeds from The New York Knickerbockers basketball team as well as income from last July's Democratic National Convention. The publishing division, which includes Simon and Schuster, turned in operating income of Dollars 182m, against Dollars 156.2m in 1991. Although a breakdown was not supplied, Paramount also said results were sharply higher in the business and professional publishing sector, primarily due to contributions from Prentice Hall Computer Publishing, acquired in November 1991. Last summer, Paramount signalled plans to diversify its holdings when it agreed to pay Dollars 400m to buy a string of US theme parks.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / Parliament and Politics: Mellor attack on PSBR proposals - Economy TORY frontbenchers yesterday sought to exploit uncertainty about Labour's plans for redefining the public-sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in the wake of the apparent climbdown over capital receipts by Mr Clive Soley, the party's housing spokesman. Mr David Mellor, chief secretary to the Treasury, said Labour was claiming to have 'discovered the political philosopher's stone'. The capital receipts had already been counted as negative public expenditure, he said. 'If the spending has to be made, the money has to be raised, and no amount of creative accounting will obscure that fact.' Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, turned his guns on Mr John Prescott, his opposite number in the shadow cabinet, who he said had 'recently dismissed the prevailing Treasury rules on public borrowing as 'stupid''. Labour's transport spokesman claimed to have the backing of Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, to change those rules, Mr Rifkind continued. 'The travelling public are entitled to an explanation. They need to know whether this really is agreed Labour policy, or just another example of a promise made 'on the hoof'.' Mr Prescott's office confirmed that he had secured clearance from the party leadership for two specific Treasury rule changes, in connection with a proposal to allow British Rail to lease badly needed commuter trains for Network SouthEast. The changes would ease restrictions on the sources of British Rail's borrowings and remove the need to include the entire capital cost of the trains in the PSBR in the first year of the leasing period. The proportion of the capital cost paid back in any given year under the terms of the lease would, however, count for PSBR purposes, Mr Prescott's office said.</p>

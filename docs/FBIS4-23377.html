			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] It is worth noting that at a time when the  international community is trying to assist Rwanda, it is to be  regretted that the Egyptian Government continues to support the  Rwandan Government clique which plunged the whole country into  bloodshed. The Egyptian Government recently allowed Rwandan  leaders to purchase 33 tonnes of arms, worth $765,000, as  specified in a fax dated 25 May 1994 from Cairo, from the second  secretary of the Rwandan Embassy to Egypt, Mr. (Jean-Baptiste  Vikamira Baviri), to Defense Minister Augustin Bizimungu.  [passage omitted]    Most of the weapons used by the Rwandan Government are from  Egypt, France, and South Africa, the apartheid South Africa. It  is worth noting that today, democratic and nonsegregationist  South Africa has made a positive change, as expected. Instead  of backing a regime of butchers in Kibungo, Kibuye, or else in  Gitarama, for it is no longer in Gitarama that the government is  headquartered, South Africa agrees to provide humanitarian  assistance [sentence as heard].

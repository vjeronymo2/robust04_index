The lithographs, signed by  Rockwell, will be displayed in GlenFed's Anaheim branch starting Monday before  they leave the county.  </P> <P> The exhibit was put together by GlenFed as its part in celebrating the  Bicentennial. The exhibit includes some of Rockwell's best-known paintings for  the Saturday Evening Post, including the "Four Freedoms," which are entitled,  "Freedom of Speech," "Freedom of Religion," "Freedom From Want" and Freedom  From Fear."  </P> <P> Glendale Federal first set up the exhibit at its main office in Glendale and  then sent it on a trip to 42 of its 208 branches in California and Florida.  Meantime, the S&amp;L also picked up University Savings in Washington, but the  exhibit is not scheduled to go there.  </P></p>

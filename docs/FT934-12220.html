			<p>931027 FT  27 OCT 93 / Survey of French Finance and Investment (11): Chasing pole position - Profile: UAP AS SOON as the Balladur government put the finishing touches to its privatisation plans Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union des Assurances de Paris (UAP), started to argue that his company, as the largest player in French insurance, should be the first insurer to be sold. Mr Peyrelevade might not be around to supervise the sell-off. He is mooted as a prime contender to take over the chair of Credit Lyonnais, with Jacques Friedmann, a long-standing ally of Mr Balladur, succeeding him at UAP. Yet Mr Peyrelevade is as busy as ever at UAP. He recently trumpeted a 'significant increase' in profits for this year after UAP's net profits tumbled to FFr1.1bn in 1992 from FFr3.8bn in 1991. He did warn, however, that the group was unlikely to return to its peak profits of FFr4bn in 1990. The forthcoming privatisation, coupled with speculation about his own move to Credit Lyonnais, has prompted Mr Peyrelevade to tidy up the main piece of unfinished business at UAP - its four-year struggle to win control of Colonia, the German insurer. He has now done the deal. UAP, as he proudly pointed out to the Paris stockmarket, is now the second largest insurer in Europe and is chasing hard on the heels of Germany's Allianz for pole position.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- UNION DES ASSURANCES DE PARIS (UAP)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Estimated value*                           FFr33.7bn Government stake                       53.5 per cent  ----------------------------------------------------------------------                                 1992            1991  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Consolidated sales          FFr126bn        FFr105bn Net profits                 FFr1.1bn        FFr3.8bn  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- * Morgan Stanley, European Privatisation 1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

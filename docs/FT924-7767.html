			<p>921114 FT  14 NOV 92 / Figures offer little hope of recovery THIRD QUARTER figures on bankruptcy and corporate liquidation offer little prospect for economic recovery, KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, warned yesterday. The number of personal bankruptcies fell 3.7 per cent for the period July to September over the previous quarter to 7,506, but growth in the first three quarters was up 51.5 per cent on the same period last year. The number of company liquidations dropped 7 per cent to 5,562 between the second and third quarter, compared with 4,670 for the third quarter last year. Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG, warned: 'I cannot see any significant downward trend in liquidations for the remainder of the year.' He said increased competition in response to the worldwide economic slowdown was likely to force even more companies into liquidation. His comments contrast with figures showing a reduction in the number of company receiverships and administration appointments, analysed by accountants Touche Ross from the official London and Edinburgh gazettes. Mr Hayward said there was a time lapse before any turndown in receivership appointments is followed by a reduction in the number of liquidations.</p>

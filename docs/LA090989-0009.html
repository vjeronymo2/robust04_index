			<p><P> September 9, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE TACTICS OF OPERATION RESCUE LEADERS  </P> <P> Certain city council members, judges and police officials seem almost obsessed  with stopping the anti-abortion "rescuers" who nonviolently block abortion  centers to save unborn babies, and commit minor offenses in the process.  </P> <P> When will these public officials show similar enthusiasm for stopping:  </P> <P> * The open selling of deadly drugs to children on our street corners.  </P> <P> * The thousands of burglaries, armed robberies, assaults, rapes and murders  committed yearly, especially against the elderly.  </P> <P> * The widespread selling and renting of X-rated videos, distributed by  organized crime, that violate our state's new anti-pornography law.  </P> <P> * The killing and maiming of hundreds of citizens by drunk drivers.  </P> <P> Police and judicial resources are limited. They should be used to punish real  criminals, not peaceful protesters whose cause is politically unpopular in City  Hall.  </P> <P> MARY CATHERINE FINN  </P> <P> Redondo Beach  </P></p>

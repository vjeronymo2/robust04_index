			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Russian deputies block reforms EFFORTS by the Russian government to push through vital measures on privatisation, the centrepiece of its economic reform, have been foiled by the Russian parliament. Ministers last night angrily accused pro-communist and nationalist forces of seeking to derail the reforms. Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has in his trip round the country in the past few days threatened to go over the heads of parliamentary deputies by calling a referendum on a new constitution and on private ownership of land. Parliament yesterday refused to pass a new law and a state programme on privatisation, leaving the government without the tools to introduce vouchers for the population. At the same time it demanded that workers in enterprises get at least 51 per cent of the stock of privatised companies. On Thursday, parliament turned down a draft law on bankruptcy, regarded by ministers as necessary to force inefficient enterprises to the wall as an example to others. Mr Pyotr Fillipov, a pro-reform deputy who heads the privatisation subcommittee in parliament, said: 'I get the impression the pro-Communist and nationalist deputies, in their failure to pass the bankruptcy law and the privatisation documents, want to force the president to hold a referendum at a time of rising public discontent. They see this as a means of regaining power'. Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president, meanwhile, told the Komsomolskaya Pravda daily he saw 'the most terrible economic and political consequences' from the Russian government's 'increasingly authoritarian policies'. Estonia, smallest of the three Baltic republics, said it would soon introduce its own currency, the kroon, to run parallel with the rouble, now in short supply. Ukraine said it would introduce rouble coupons from July 1 in all domestic transactions.</p>

			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / International Company News: Dutch food group ahead 7% despite sales decline BOLS WESSANEN, the Dutch food and beverages group created by a merger this year, reported a 7 per cent rise in net profit for the first half of the year, in spite of a slight decline in sales. Net profit rose to Fl 119.6m (Dollars 64.6m) from a pro forma Fl 111.8m a year earlier, while sales dropped 4.8 per cent to Fl 2.5bn. The sales decline was due mainly to divestments, which reduced turnover by a combined Fl 231m. Another reason was a 7 per cent fall in sales in the beverages group, largely reflecting the lower value of the Italian lira. Despite the sales drop, the beverages group raised operating profit 5 per cent to Fl 77.6m, representing the largest single contribution to Bols Wessanen's total operating profit of Fl 173m. In the dairy group, which includes Leerdammer cheese and frozen yoghurt, sales were flat but operating profit also rose 5 per cent, to Fl 65.7m.</p>

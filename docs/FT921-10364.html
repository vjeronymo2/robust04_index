			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / TV company to take case to the Lords THE FINAL SHAPE of the new ITV network was still in doubt last night after the Appeal Court gave Television South West permission to go to the House of Lords to challenge the Independent Television Commission's decision not to renew its franchise. TSW failed to persuade the court to quash the ITC's decision to award the licence for south-west England to Westcountry Television, which bid Pounds 7.8m against TSW's Pounds 16.1m. Mr Harry Turner, TSW's managing director, said the company's stance had been totally vindicated. 'We have shone a torch in the very dusty corners of some ITC procedures,' he said. TSW had criticised the ITC's decision as 'unfair and irrational' and said it had misled TSW by applying more stringent criteria in assessing its key financial forecasts than had been originally indicated. The ITC rejected TSW's application on the ground that it had overbid to such an extent that it would not be able to sustain a quality service over the 10-year licence period. It described TSW's forecast of growth in advertising revenue over the period as 'excessively optimistic'. Dismissing TSW's case by a 2-1 majority, the Appeal Court said the detailed grounds on which the commission had assessed TSW's business plan as unacceptably optimistic had been put before the court. Lord Justice Nolan said: 'The judgment of the ITC may be right or wrong, but it is fully explained and, thus explained, it is plainly one which the ITC was entitled to make.' Lord Justice Steyn, agreeing, said TSW had not established its claim that the ITC's decision was influenced by a flawed and unfair assessment of its bid prepared by the ITC staff. The assessment was so obviously a distortion of the true position that the commission's experienced members would probably not have been misled by it, he said. In a dissenting judgment, Lord Donaldson, Master of the Rolls, said he would have set aside the ITC decision so the commissioners could take a 'fresh look' at both bids for the south-west franchise. Lord Donaldson said that, although his description of the staff assessment paper during the court hearing as a 'hatchet job' might have been an exaggeration, the fact remained that it did not fairly state the case for, as well as against, TSW's application. There were 'reasonable grounds' for considering that TSW's bid had not received the fair evaluation to which it was entitled under the 1990 Broadcasting Act. The evidence put in by the ITC had not changed his mind on that point. High bids jeopardised franchises, Page 24</p>

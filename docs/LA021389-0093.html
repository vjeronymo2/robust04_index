			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> ARAB-AMERICANS;  </P> <P> KHOMEINI, OIL HAVE PROVIDED MISLEADING, DISTURBING FUEL TO THOSE WHO WOULD FIND  ISLAM 'DIFFERENT' IN OUR SOCIETY  </P> <P> One Friday afternoon three years ago, French teacher Nadia Bettindorf came home  to a ringing phone. "Did you hear the news?" a friend asked. "Alex has been  killed."  </P> <P> Bettindorf, a founding member of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  Committee, had known its regional director, Alex Odeh, for 11 years during  which both Palestinians spoke out for understanding, for dialogue and for an  end to stereotyping of all Arabs as greedy, oil-rich terrorists.  </P> <P> The news brought tears for her friend, a gentle man who never raised his voice  in anger. It also released an old anxiety.  </P> <P> "As a Palestinian, I knew I was not safe in Israel," said Bettindorf, who was 5  years old in 1948 when the state of Israel was created and her family confined  to a ghetto in Jaffa. Now she felt "as a Palestinian, I was not safe even in  the United States."  </P> <P> Odeh's suspected killer has been traced to the West Bank of Israel but not  arrested on charges of throwing the fatal bomb into the committee's West Coast  office in Santa Ana.  </P> <P> At the time, Bettindorf said some Orange County Arabs wanted to move to a place  that would be safer or camouflage their heritage, stop identifying themselves  as Arabs, change their names. Many still do.  </P> <P> But Bettindorf picked up Odeh's speaking engagements because, she said, "the  truth has to be heard. I refuse to be silenced."  </P> <P> She smiled wryly. "My husband says, 'Go get 'em, Don Quixote.' "  </P> <P> Bettindorf, a teacher at St. Paul's Catholic High School in Santa Fe Springs,  married an American she met at the University of Minnesota where she was  studying French and classics.  </P> <P> Because of his German-derived name and because she is Christian, not Moslem,  she said she and her two children have been spared the blatant name-calling or  job and rental discrimination reported by some of the 75,000 Orange County  immigrants from among the 23 Arabic countries in North Africa and the Middle  East.  </P> <P> Bettindorf saw prejudice turn to emotional bias and bigotry spread by  stereotypes of Arabs in cartoons, television news and drama. "They show the  stereotype of the greedy Arab, rich, controlling money. It dehumanizes a whole  section of society -- then it's easy to do bad things to them.  </P> <P> "In the 80s, of course, we added the religious dimension with (Iran's Ayatollah  Ruhollah) Khomeini and Islam, and you got all of this misinformation and  disinformation about what Arabs and Muslims are. This wave of bigotry came and  aggravated the situation altogether. Because Arabs are considered different and  evil, then you did not want them to work for you and all of that."  </P> <P> When emotions flared after a wave of Arab kidnapings, she said an Arab bakery  in Garden Grove burned down. But the owner did not want to report it. "He said,  'Don't do anything.' He was afraid they would come to his house and burn it,  too."  </P> <P> One Palestinian accountant who asked not to be identified said his boss refused  to let him handle checks because "I would steal it and give it to the PLO."  </P> <P> The man, whose wife has a master's degree in psychology, said he was also told  he could not supervise women because of "the way your culture treats women."  </P> <P> An Orange County resident for 15 years, he said he has been thinking of  changing his name to Robert Higgins, "a complete Anglo name." A friend of his  changed his name from Nadiem to Ned. "At least when you send your resume, they  don't know who you are," he said.  </P> <P> Bettindorf's son Eric said his eighth-grade social studies teacher was  explaining stereotypes to the class one day. "He said one that's not a  stereotype is that the Arabs all have 15 children so they can drive the Jews  into the sea," he said. "I knew it was wrong." But rather than make an issue of  it in class, he told his mother who later explained to the teacher that she is  an Arab who does not fit that description. She received a noncommittal response  without an apology and chose not to pursue it.  </P> <P> "As a mother, I don't want to do anything so the teacher would take it out on  my child," she said.  </P> <P> But the experience left her son frustrated and feeling his teacher was  "stupid," she said.  </P> <P> He also told her about another teacher, annoyed with an Egyptian boy in class,  who said, "Why don't you go buy a Mercedes?" and on another occasion, "Go pump  some more oil."  </P> <P> "People don't think how that affects a 14-year-old child. He knows not all  Arabs pump oil and have Mercedes," Bettindorf said.  </P> <P> Similar complaints were reported about Cal State Fullerton and UC Irvine  professors, she said. When students try to contradict the professor, they  receive an answer such as, "Who's the teacher here?"  </P> <P> Despite the brutal, petty and insensitive acts of some, Bettindorf can still  say, "I do believe in the goodness of the individual."  </P> <P> Both Bettindorf and the man who would be Robert Higgins have joined the Orange  County Cousins Club, a group of about 30 Jews and Palestinians who meet to talk  over current events in the Middle East.  </P> <P> "The more we talk, the more human we become to each other," she said.  </P></p>

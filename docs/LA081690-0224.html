			<p><P> August 16, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PICTURES ON NEWSCAST FUEL FIGHT;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: FCC TAKES ACTION AFTER A COMPLAINT BY THE AMERICAN FAMILY ASSN.  SEXUALLY EXPLICIT PHOTOS ARE PART OF A MAPPLETHORPE SHOW.  </P> <P> A collection of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs -- already a lightning rod for  controversy in four cities -- has acquired a new dimension with disclosure that  the Federal Communications Commission is reviewing a complaint against a Boston  public-television station for airing several sexually explicit Mapplethorpe  images.  </P> <P> The FCC said that it initiated an inquiry Tuesday into the broadcast of the  Mapplethorpe images by WGBH-TV in Boston as a result of a complaint by the  American Family Assn., a Tupelo, Miss., Christian organization led by the Rev.  Donald E. Wildmon.  </P> <P> The complaint accuses the broadcast of being both obscene and indecent.  Existing U.S. Supreme Court precedents have consistently held that obscenity is  not protected under the First Amendment. Indecent material, although  constitutionally protected, can be curtailed to prevent minors from exposure,  the court has ruled.  </P> <P> Eric Brass, WGBH's corporate counsel, denied Wildmon's allegations, saying that  the broadcast was "not legally obscene, nor would I think there's any reason to  believe it would be harmful."  </P> <P> The Wildmon organization touched off an ongoing controversy over the National  Endowment for the Arts in April of last year when it complained about federal  support for an exhibit that included an image of a crucifix immersed in urine  by New York photographer Andres Serrano.  </P> <P> The FCC said that Wildmon's complaint, dated Aug. 7, was received at commission  offices on Monday. The agency said it began processing the case Tuesday  morning.  </P> <P> The pictures broadcast by WGBH on its 10 p.m. newscast July 31 are part of "The  Perfect Moment," a Mapplethorpe show that had already roused controversy in  Washington, Philadelphia, Cincinnati and in Boston when fundamentalists and  other political conservatives attempted to have law enforcement officials  prosecute the gallery showing it on smut charges.  </P> <P> Wildmon's three-page letter to the FCC said that "seven of the photographs that  were the subject of the broadcast have been alleged to be obscene and are  currently the subject of a criminal indictment in Cincinnati." He apparently  referred to a pending state court prosecution in Ohio in which the Cincinnati  Contemporary Arts Center and its director face obscenity and child pornography  charges in connection with a display of "The Perfect Moment" earlier this year.  The judge in the Cincinnati case has set an Aug. 24 hearing to set a trial  date.  </P> <P> Wildmon specifically described two allegedly homoerotic photographs in his  letter, contending that "the photographs were not held up for their artistic  merit, but rather for their individual and collective ability to 'shock' the  viewer."  </P> <P> According to Roger Holberg, supervisory attorney for the FCC's mass media  bureau, the Wildmon complaint was judged appropriate for FCC action, unlike two  previous letters it received criticizing the WGBH broadcast. The decision to  initiate the review was taken because, he said, Wildmon included all the  necessary components to process a complaint -- including a videotape of the  broadcast.  </P> <P> The WGBH program devoted most of its coverage that night to controversial art,  according to Alan Foster, executive producer of news at WGBH, because of a  then-current Mapplethorpe exhibit at the Institute of Contemporary Art in  Boston.  </P> <P> Foster denied Wildmon's accusations of obscenity and sensationalism, saying  that the First Amendment and a previous FCC policy that considered the period  between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. to be suitable for indecent material both apply to  the Mapplethorpe broadcast.  </P> <P> "We gave it a mature treatment, it was intelligent. . . . It did more than  titilate," Foster said. "The question I feel is fundamental is not why we did  air it, but why others did not. The media's covering us as if we did something  wrong, but they haven't been able to treat (the Mapplethorpe photos) with  intelligence. . . . We feel strongly that knowledge of the photos is what was  lacking in public debate."  </P> <P> Wildmon said in his complaint that WGBH, "knowing the harmful nature of the  material, presented several 'disclaimers' regarding the airing of the  material." He contended, however, that the warnings were insufficient.  </P> <P> A court ruling is pending on the constitutionality of a 24-hour ban on indecent  program material recently promulgated by the FCC. The FCC decision barring  indecent programming was cited by Wildmon as a major ground for his complaint.  </P> <P> Wildmon was unavailable Wednesday, but AFA lawyer Peggy Coleman said that the  complaint was more motivated by WGBH's actions than by the fact that  Mapplethorpe photos were involved.  </P> <P> "This was not done in respect to the NEA or Mapplethorpe," Coleman said. "The  AFA has participated in regular complaints against obscene broadcasting for the  past several years."  </P></p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUILDERS PREDICT A 7.4% DROP IN HOUSING STARTS  </P> <P> The nation's home builders on Friday forecast a 7.4% decline in housing starts  and a 5% drop in new home sales this year, continuing a three-year decline.  </P> <P> The forecast by the National Assn. of Home Builders came a day after the  Commerce Department reported 1988 housing starts of 1.49 million, an 8.2%  decrease from 1987's 1.62 million.  </P> <P> Despite the decline, NAHB economist David Seiders said housing starts will  remain above 1 million at an estimated 1.38 million. "Frankly, that's not a bad  year," he said.  </P> <P> Seiders and other economists appearing Friday at the NAHB's annual meeting in  Atlanta said that they expected the Federal Reserve Board, the nation's central  bank, to maintain a tight rein on credit, causing interest rates to rise early  in the year to restrain inflationary pressures.  </P> <P> "The economy is destined to slow down in 1989. It has to," said Seiders,  although he added that "it would take a policy mistake" to bring about a  recession.  </P> <P> The popularity of adjustable rate mortgages since the last round of rising  interest rates also presents a new problem, the economists said.  </P> <P> Lynn Michaelis, the chief economist for the forest products firm Weyerhaeuser  Co., said mortgage holders could find themselves paying as much as $10 billion  more in house payments as increasing rates are reflected in their loans.  </P> <P> "Most people have had a positive experience" with ARMs, he said, but now will  face higher payments.  </P> <P> Richard Pratt, chairman of Merrill Lynch Mortgage Capital, admitted that the  phenomenon may cause delinquency rates to increase, but said the overall effect  is unclear.  </P> <P> The economists estimated that ARMs account for about $500 billion of the total  $2-trillion mortgage debt.  </P></p>

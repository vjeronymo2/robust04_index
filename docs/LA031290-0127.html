			<p><P> March 12, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TOKYO TRAINS KEEP COMMUTERS ON THEIR TOES  </P> <P> A Tokyo train line introduced seatless cars today to reduce overcrowding during  rush hours and got a mixed response from commuters, some of whom complained of  being treated like packages.  </P> <P> The new cars on the crowded Yamanote loop line have foldable seats that can be  lowered or folded back into the wall automatically by pushing a button, a  railroad official said.  </P> <P> The seats will remain folded during morning rush hour to increase the capacity  of the cars and allow easier movement of passengers on and off trains, he said.  </P> <P> Regular train cars on the line have a rated capacity of 144, while the new cars  can officially carry 162 people. The cars actually carry many more passengers  during rush hour, when they frequently are packed so tightly that people can  hardly move.  </P> <P> Only two trains with two seatless cars each were introduced today as an  experiment, said an official who requested anonymity. "We will see how it goes  and will decide whether we will continue the experiment," he said.  </P> <P> The reaction of passengers was divided. A middle-age commuter told Kyodo News  Service that he liked the new car because it was less crowded and that few  people are able to sit anyway in cars that have seats. Other passengers said  they felt they were being treated like packages and were riding in a freight  train.  </P> <P> The train official dismissed the criticism. "We decided to introduce the  seatless cars to give better service and have never thought of treating our  customers as packages," he said.  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses muted as rate hopes subside A FEW points shaved off the German repo rate, and a notice of no press briefing after today's Bundesbank meeting left most bourses muted, writes Our Markets Staff. PARIS turned slightly lower after six straight rises although, said Lehman Brothers in London, it got a late uptick from the futures expiry in the afternoon, which inflated turnover to a maintained FFr3.9bn. Individual features included Schneider, the electrical engineering and construction group, down FFr30 or 4.1 per cent to FFr700 on a story that it might be absorbed into its parent company, SPEP. Anglo-French hybrids stayed in the news, positive results from Carnaud Metal Box, the packaging group, leaving the shares FFr2.50 higher at FFr217.30, but Eurotunnel down another FFr1.35 to FFr38.10 for a two-day loss of 7.6 per cent following reports of further problems in rolling stock production. FRANKFURT finished with the DAX index 0.86 lower on the day, but 9 per cent higher over the first three months of 1993 at 1,684.21. Turnover eased from DM6.1bn to DM5.8bn. One or two of the days winners and losers reversed their first quarter trends. Volkswagen, which revealed first quarter losses but hopes to break even in 1993, fell DM5.90 to DM306 but stayed 26.3 per cent ahead over the first three months as a whole; Metallgesellschaft, however, rose DM3.40 to DM316.90 and still showed a three-month loss of 5 per cent. Mr Eckhard Frahm of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, who produced the quarterly digest of the DAX constituents' share price performance, noted that this year's six top performers include strange bedfellows, with VW at the top of the list joined by Daimler and BASF in third and fourth place - cyclicals all - with the interest rate-sensitives, Commerzbank, Dresdner and Allianz in the other three positions. Deutsche Bank, which help stabilise the market yesterday with solid 1992 results and good expectations for 1993, rose DM2.90 to DM713.50. MILAN was in calmer mood after Tuesday's events with investors awaiting an indication of the broadly-based government which the president, Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, might be able to stitch together. The Comit index edged 1.90 lower to 475.01. Continuing worries that the privatisation programme faced delays left Credito Italiano L30 lower at L2,550 before recovering to L2,565 after hours. Fiat settled L101 lower at L5,799, before recovering to L5,850 after hours on the view that the arrival of the new French government could soon clear the way for the much-rumoured deal with Renault. Against the trend, La Rinascente, the country's biggest retailer, rose L254 or 3.2 per cent to L8,170 on its better than expected 1992 earnings. AMSTERDAM was firmer, benefiting from foreign demand, and the CBS Tendency index added 0.40 to 107.70. Philips added Fl 1.10 to Fl 25 in active trade after a newspaper report that it was discussing a common standard for multimedia products with IBM and Apple of the US. Concern that the government might tax income from capital growth investment funds continued to provoke a switch into blue chips. ABN Amro's Obligatie Groeifonds dipped 20 cents to Fl 193.40 with more than 1m shares traded. Nedlloyd, the transport and shipping group rose Fl 1 to Fl 31.10 in active trading amid rumours that large investors were building stakes. Aegon, the insurer, firmed 60 cents to Fl 88.80 ahead of today's results, with analysts looking for a rise in net profits of up to 15 per cent. ZURICH was steady although business thinned as the day progressed amid uncertainty over the prospects for further interest rate cuts and end of quarter book squaring operations. The SMI index remained at a record high for the second consecutive day, rising 1.0 to 2,190.3. VIENNA dropped 1.6 per cent, the ATX index losing 12.99 to 778.69 as traders said that the market was technically weak, that interest in shares was poor, volumes were low, and banks were passing shares back and forth like 'hot potatoes'. Among ATX shares the day's biggest faller was OMV, the oil company, down Sch18 at Sch583 after the US again called for a UN oil embargo against Libya, where OMV has upstream interests. DUBLIN continued ahead with foreign buying helping the ISEQ overall index 37.23 or 2.5 per cent higher to 1,517.96. Analysts attributed the strong performance to expectations of lower interest rates and good corporate results.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- March 31                                           THE EUROPEAN SERIES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1152.37    1152.12    1151.19    1151.26 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1219.65    1218.91    1220.26    1221.02  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1149.88    1149.50    1149.07    1149.13 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1221.47    1219.84    1218.05    1220.16  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Mar 30    Mar 29    Mar 26    Mar 25    Mar 24  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1152.62   1148.76   1147.31   1133.08   1130.66 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1219.87   1213.37   1213.80   1200.17   1202.55  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1152.37; 200 - 1222.59 Low/day: 100 - 1148.05 200 - 1217.77.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

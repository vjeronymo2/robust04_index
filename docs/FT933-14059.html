			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / Last nail put in coffin of Star Wars THE US has placed a legal full stop at the end of a 10-year chapter of efforts to develop a 'Star Wars' anti-missile defence system by now declaring its full adherence to the traditional, narrow interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The Clinton administration, by formally announcing its adherence to this interpretation, renounced efforts to develop, test or deploy sea-based, air-based, space-based or mobile land-based ABM systems. The treaty was designed to prevent nuclear escalation by denying the US or the Soviet Union the temptation to launch a first strike in the belief that it could survive retaliation. President Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980s had sought to argue that the ABM treaty did not prohibit development of space-based defences, a key component of Mr Reagan's 'Star Wars' strategic defence initiative. Mr Thomas Graham, acting director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, announced the position in a letter to Senator Claiborne Pell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who welcomed the return to the traditional interpretation. 'This wise decision closes, on a high note, a sad chapter in US arms control treaty relationships and in the relationship between the US Senate and the executive branch,' said Mr Pell. He added that strict adherence to the treaty would help persuade Ukraine to eliminate its nuclear weapons, and to ensure Russian ratification of the Start II missile reduction treaty. The Clinton administration has already renamed the SDI programme the ballistic missile defence organisation. Funding has remained relatively high but has been shifted away from programmes designed to defend against strategic nuclear missiles, and towards tactical defences.</p>

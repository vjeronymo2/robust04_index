			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Appointments: New head for PA PA Consulting Group, the international management and technology consultancy, yesterday named Jon Moynihan as group chief executive. Moynihan moves to PA from First Manhattan Consulting Group in New York where he is currently managing vice president. He joined First Manhattan in 1982 shortly after the company was founded and played a prominent role in its growth in financial services consulting. Before joining First Manhattan, Moynihan, 43, worked for McKinsey in Europe, and Strategic Planning Associates in the US. His education similarly spans the Atlantic; he has degrees from Balliol College, Oxford, the North London Polytechnic and MIT. Moynihan's appointment follows the decision made last September by John Foden to step down as PA's chief executive having completed six years in that post and three as chairman, though he remains non-executive chairman. PA Consultancy currently employs 1,700 staff worldwide.</p>

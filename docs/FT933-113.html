			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Battle set to be joined over Pounds 70m Extel disposal A FIERCE battle for control of Extel Financial, the on-line financial information service company put up for sale last week by its owners, United Newspapers, is expected to unfold over the next few months. Many of the world's largest information providers have already expressed interest in buying the 121-year old organisation. It is seen as an attractive acquisition by a range of companies to whom its products and services are either complementary or competitive. United executives hope that a deal can be concluded by the end of the year. Indicative bids must be submitted within the next two weeks, a timescale that some potential bidders have said is ridiculously short. The selling price was likely to be up to Pounds 70m, they believed. United bought the Extel group for Pounds 250m in 1987 but has since disposed of much of it. Extel Financial represents about 14 per cent of the original purchase. Extel makes profits of about Pounds 5m but last year soaked up Pounds 6m in investment in technology. Reuters, the world's largest electronic publisher, said that it had decided against taking further part in the negotiations. It is understood that it has already investigated the company and received the confidential circular outlining terms of the sale. Analysts suggested that an attempt to buy Extel would bring Reuters into conflict with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The list of companies known to be interested includes Thomson Financial, the Boston-based subsidiary of the Thomson Group; Datastream, the London-based supplier of historical securities prices owned by Primark of the US; Disclosure, which is US-based but owned by VNU, the Dutch media group; and FT Profile, the on-line information service owned by the Financial Times. FT Profile is being investigated by the MMC as part of an examination of on-line text retrieval services. Analysts were unimpressed by talk that BT could be a bidder but did not discount the possibility that Telerate of the US, the Scandinavian company Esmerk, Hoppenstedt of Germany, and Standard and Poor's and Knight Ridder of the US could be interested. United seems prepared to sell Extel in two packages; the profitable on-line information services group that includes the market-leading portfolio valuation service, and the bureau-based investment accounting service. The accounting service's profitability has declined in recent years but it has developed a new software package, the IAS-2, which sells for up to Pounds 400,000 and could make it attractive to a software house specialising in financial services. Extel's value to potential buyers lies in its spread of products, many of which are market leaders in niche sectors. Datastream's interest for example, must be related to the fact that virtually all its basic data comes from Extel while Examiner, Extel's real-time financial and business news service, would be complementary to Datastream's analytical products.</p>

			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / Proposal seeks to spread road costs NEW WAYS of making dev-elopers pay for the traffic growth they generate were proposed by the Department of Transport yesterday. The aim is to ensure that companies carrying out big developments pay their fair share towards the cost of any trunk road or motorway improvements needed to serve developments. Under the existing system developers are not required to contribute to the cost of improving trunk roads if the traffic growth they generate can be accommodated by existing roads. If they are joined by another company whose proposed development just tips the balance by requiring new trunk road capacity, that last company has to meet the whole cost of the improvements. The department plans to examine local authorities' draft development plans and identify where potential developments are likely to make improvements to motorways or trunk roads necessary. It will then set out the estimated costs of the improvements and create a formula for sharing the contributions among all the companies involved. The formula will be based on how much traffic each part of the development is expected to generate. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, said the lack of a fair method of allocating highway costs sometimes resulted in developments being blocked. The new system would enable more developments to go ahead. Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said the proposals would result in better links between land-use planning and the planning of transport infrastructure.

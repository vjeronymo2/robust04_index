			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Libreville, 8 Feb (AGP-GAB/PANA) -- The Gabonese  Trade Union Confederation [COSYGA] and affiliated unions have  sent a general strike notice to Prime Minister Oye-Mba,  according to a trade union source here. COSYGA and the  affiliated trade unions may embark on a strike action next week  "if the government does not find solutions to the social crisis  arising from the 50 percent CFA franc devaluation," the same  source stated.    The strike notice sent to the head of government yesterday  reproached him for refusing to have dialogue with the unions and  for showing no interest in negotiations on crucial and  disturbing issues." Finding solutions to the crisis cannot be a  monopoly of the government alone," they stressed, affirming that  Gabon is a country where the rule of law prevails and as a  result consultations must be the rule where actions involving  the very existence of the nation are concerned."    In a platform, COSYGA and the affiliated unions are  demanding  above all the abolition of the National Solidarity Tax, the  complementary tax on salaries lower than 500,000 CFA francs.  The Central Gabonese Union is also demanding 50 percent  reduction in the price of revenue bands and in the rate of  indemnity on the income of natural persons and a fall in customs  duties for essential commodities. Their claims relate also to  the reorganization of trade, the reorientation of the National  Housing Fund, the restructuring of parastatal companies, and the  need to find a solution to the health workers strike.    It was also learned that in their strike notice, the  Gabonese  unionists finally expressed astonishment at the proposed  establishment of a senate. In the communique issued after the  cabinet meeting held on 4 February, the government had announced  its decision to give parliament maximum flexibility and  efficiency through the creation of a senate, they recalled. The  unionists are against the establishment of a second chamber of  parliament, they remarked.    Last week, COSYGA sent a list of complaints to the prime  minister's office containing various claims, including an 80  percent salary hike. The unionists consider that "the combined  effects of the deterioration of the people's purchasing power  and of the devaluation of the CFA franc authorize them to demand  an increase.</p>

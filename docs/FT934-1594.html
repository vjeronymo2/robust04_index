			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans in protest over Gatt banana deal The British banana market, already in a parlous state, could be further damaged as a result of offers made by European Union in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tarrifs and Trade. That was the message delivered to UK junior agriculture minister Mr Michael Jack yesterday by representatives of Caribbean banana exporting countries and three importing companies, Fyffes, Geest and Jamaica producers. The offers would entail rises of 100,000 tonnes in 1994 and 1995 in the 2m-tonnes-a-year tariff quota for so-called 'dollar' bananas - produced in Central and South America - set in July this year, they told the minister. They added that the existing quota had already resulted in oversupply and falling prices in the UK market. The delegation also claimed that the new banana regime meant the EU was failing to meet its legal commitment under the Lome trade and aid convention that no Caribbean producer should be 'in a less favourable situation than in the past' in regard to access to its traditional markets.</p>

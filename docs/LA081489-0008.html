			<p><P> August 14, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NIXON LEFT HIS MARK, AND IT IS ALL AROUND US  </P> <P> It was a dramatic, unparalleled scene in the history of American politics. The  choked, emotional farewell to the last of the loyal White House staff, the red  carpet rolled out to the waiting helicopter on the South Lawn. Then, with a  last characteristic wave at the door, Richard M. Nixon, who had been with us  somewhere on the national stage for so long, was suddenly gone. The 37th  President of the United States had resigned from office under the threat of  impeachment, soon to be saved from a likely criminal conviction only by the  controversial pardon by his successor and old friend, Gerald Ford.  </P> <P> Fifteen years later, it seems almost surreal, this constitutional crisis of the  century. In part, of course, time has blunted and blurred the images. And Nixon  himself, as he did again and again in his remarkable career, has staged  something of another skillful and fiercely determined comeback in public  relations. After the bipartisan ineptitude and relative dimness of his  successors, there is a sort of nostalgia for his old diplomatic initiatives  toward the Soviet Union or China, and even what seemed clear villainy 15 years  ago now takes on the soft tint of competence and decisiveness.  </P> <P> Not that the dramatic Nixon foreign policy does not deserve careful study --  though there may have been, as Tallulah Bankhead used to say, less here than  meets the eye. His mutual propping with Leonid S. Brezhnev's corrupt and  sclerotic government may only have delayed and obstructed the liberalization we  now see unfolding in the Soviet Union, and the savage repression in China shows  all too clearly the character of the regime he embraced so expediently in  Beijing in 1972. It was also Nixon who instituted in earnest the covert little  Punic and proxy wars that now pass for our foreign policy in the Third World,  who presided over the first, perhaps fatal decline in our international  competitiveness and currency strength, whose refracted Realpolitik with Henry  Kissinger roundly ignored the vast problems of poverty, migration, and  environmental decay that threaten to overwhelm statesmanship in the next  decade.  </P> <P> At any rate, his proteges, and his mark, are everywhere -- from a defeated  young Texas politician named George Bush whom he rescued from oblivion in 1970  and named to the U.N. ambassadorship, to Chief Justice William Rehnquist and  his conservative majority on the Supreme Court, or to the former Kissinger  aides and clients who now crowd the upper levels of the National Security  Council and the State Department, guiding the otherwise-frozen hands of an  uncertain new Administration.  </P> <P> Yet the real danger to memory and history is not in romanticizing Nixon's  global strategies, or mistaking his considerable patronage. The problem goes  much deeper, coming home to the nation and body politic we truly are -- and to  how much this once-disgraced, fallen President made us so.  </P> <P> For it was also Nixon who largely wrought the Republican revolution in the  South and the West, and thus redrew the map of America's Electoral College  politics that gave us Ronald Reagan and George Bush. More than any other  politician of the era, it was Nixon who led and rode the huge tides of  anti-communist fear and reaction, and the great-if-furtive counterrevolution  against the racial and social upheavals of postwar America -- all of which have  driven the Democratic Party into a political wilderness from which it has yet  to emerge.  </P> <P> And back further still, in the brilliant and tireless young politician he was  at his beginnings, it was Richard Nixon who represented above all the elemental  forces of corporate power, finance, agribusiness and energy, who epitomized the  manipulative might of the media in politics, who in California in so many ways  pioneered the use and masking of great money in political campaigning. And,  above all, who artfully tapped the insidious prejudice, vengeance and smear  mentality in American politics long before Bush ran his effective ads against  Michael Dukakis.  </P> <P> Richard Nixon is never going to be the most beloved American President of the  century. But he is going to turn out to be the quintessential politician of the  epoch, and most of what he really embodied is in the ascendancy.  </P> <P> It has been a long time since they rolled up that red carpet from the departing  helicopter, but he is with us still. And in the end, in ways yet little  understood, he has probably won.  </P></p>

			<p>920109 FT  09 JAN 92 / UK Company News: GrandMet expands US bakery operation GRAND Metropolitan, the drinks, food, and retailing group, has agreed to buy the frozen products division of McGlynn Bakeries, a leading company in the US bakery products industry. City estimates value the deal, which will be funded by the issue of new GrandMet ordinary shares, at about Dollars 140m (Pounds 76.9m). McGlynn's frozen products division manufactures and markets a line of frozen dough, batter, and pre-baked products, and pastries and biscuits. It made profits last year of Dollars 15m on sales of Dollars 130m. Mr Ian Martin, GrandMet's group managing director, said the acquisition would complement the Pillsbury baked goods business in the US. 'It provides a prime opportunity to gain critical mass in the growing US in-store bakery sector and it will help build the presence of Pillsbury by expanding the product line as well as adding significant scale,' he added. McGlynn, based in Minneapolis, is privately owned. Its frozen products division employs more than 700 people.</p>

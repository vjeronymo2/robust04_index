			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Birgitta Jernvall Ingman: "Food Industry </F> Satisfied With EU Agreement"]    [Text] Mining counselor Bjorn Mattsson, the chairman of the  food industry, is more or less satisfied with the European Union  [EU] agreement that was reached yesterday.    "My opinion is that the agreement as a whole gives Finland  possibilities for development," he says, at the same time as he  points out that, as in all agreements, there are compromises  involved.    In addition to all the principles, it is a matter of a  fierce  struggle for jobs, as to which countries attract industrial  activity, he concludes.    Now he only hopes that it will be possible to avoid a long  political quarrel about the domestic part, something that would  only prolong industry's period of uncertainty. Mattsson  therefore rejects Member of Parliament Paavo Vayrynen's proposal  to postpone the EU membership.    "That does not improve anything. I am of the opinion that  our  EU negotiations have been handled well. Always, when you  approach the end, the whole must have precedence over the parts."    Mattsson describes the EU agreement as acceptable for his  own  company, Cultor AB, as well, despite the fact that the lowered  sugar quota was a blow.  <H5>  Lower Volume Threatens Sugar Refineries </H5>   From Cultor's point of view, Finland's sugar quota was one  of  the three important parts of the EU agreements. The decrease of  about 10,000 tons from 144,000 plus 14,000 tons to 133,000 plus  13,000 destroys the previous adjustment regarding productivity  and margins and threatens the existence of one of the group's  three sugar refineries. It is said that 10,000 tons of sugar is  the equivalent of about 100,000 sugar beets and a cultivated  area of about 2,500 hectares.    "Now the question is how, with a lower volume, it will be  possible to achieve the previous productivity," says Mattsson.    The other two important parts of the EU agreements concern  grain production in Finland and Sweden and the export of fish  from Norway to Europe.    What Norway achieved in the matter of fishing means that  Cultor's fodder production in that sector can continue as  before, at the same time as EU provides greater stability.    The grain production in Finland and Sweden also gives the  company's fodder production reasonable opportunities,  particularly since one has to come down to European grain prices  right away. But one precondition for a promising fodder industry  is that the meat and dairy sector maintain their positions, the  head of Cultor states.    Part of the domestic adjustment is to decide on how to  handle  inventories of raw materials bought before joining the EU. Here  the government's grain inventory is the central matter -- but it  is obvious that all companies are now striving to minimize their  inventories and plan them in detail.    One problem is that the EU does not know about such a thing  as the primary product subsidy that Finland now has, which  reduces the consumer price for meat and milk, for example. In  order to compensate for that loss, the value-added tax on food  must be lowered to 10 percent in this phase. In 1997 the  value-added tax on food in the EU must be coordinated at 5  percent.  <H5>  Certain Demands Met -- Others Not </H5>   On behalf of the entire food industry, Mattsson states that  a  part of the demands were granted, but for milk, meat, and  vegetables, for example, one did not get the period of  adjustment that had been sought.    Now it is important for people at the company level to  review  their possibilities.    In any case, Mattsson points out that in the EU there is  money that, supplemented by domestic support, can be granted to  the food industry for adjustment to the new market situation.  Harsh conditions are tied to the subsidy, that, among other  things, must not distort competition.    The authorities will first make an industry evaluation and  then distribute the subsidies, both the one from the EU and the  domestic one. In one and the same industry there might be  companies that need support and those that do not.    "I want to call this a type of debt reorganization; it must  be a serious matter for the company," Mattsson says.    Cultor will not apply for any subsidy. The company has long  prepared itself for the agreement that was completed yesterday,  the concentration on core areas has been achieved, and the  productivity is in order. "Our productivity is at the European  level and our goal is to manage by ourselves," says Mattsson.  <H5>  Labor Conflict Frustrating </H5>   Mattsson today regards as much more serious than the EU  agreement the labor conflict that the food industry has just  suffered through, "in a situation where a part of our industry  was fighting for its life," as he expresses it.    "Wage demands were put forward that were twice as high as  within the export industry, in a situation where the parties had  a common view of the declining employment capability in the food  industry, and they were aware that we are facing a painful  structural change," Mattsson says.    He wonders whether one could call the system of negotiation  bankrupt, that one negotiated for months in order then to reject  both the national arbitrator's and the arbitration commission's  unanimous proposals.    According to the chairman of the food industry, working  conditions will now have to be accomplished such that the  employees feel loyalty toward their companies, which then also  increase their influence. The other, and worse alternative,  according to Mattsson, is a system similar to the one in Norway,  with forced arbitration of some sort.    "We felt frustrated over the situation that occurred," says  Mattsson.    What he is now hoping for is genuine cooperation.</p>

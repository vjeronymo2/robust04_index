			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JACK SMITH: WELL-VERSED IN OFFERINGS OF LIGHT RHYMES  </P> <P> Like almost everything else, light verse, I find, is in greater supply than we  realize.  </P> <P> Lately, in printing a few verses by such masters as Richard Armour, Ogden Nash,  Dorothy Parker and Samuel Hoffenstein, I have mourned the passing of this  blithe form.  </P> <P> But there are plenty of versifiers out there, eager to find some ink. Some have  published, most have not.  </P> <P> Molly C. Rodman recalls that she published some in Judge magazine; then it  folded. Here's a sample of her work:  </P> <P>  How can I know what you're thinking  </P> <P>  Since your heart is wearing a mask?  </P> <P>  My heart is yours for the asking,  </P> <P>  But dammit -- why don't you ask?  </P> <P> Sherry Lewis of Costa Mesa says she spent the 1930s trying to write light verse  in the Parker style, but none was ever published. All right, one is now:  </P> <P>  He sent me a lily,  </P> <P>  So white, so pure;  </P> <P>  My heart beat a silly,  </P> <P>  "He's mine, for sure!"  </P> <P>  Until I discovered --  </P> <P>  And that was the end --  </P> <P>  He'd chosen red roses  </P> <P>  For my best friend.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Josephus Reynolds of Beverly Hills says he is reminded by my remark that "the  British are so deucedly civil" of a limerick he wrote on safari in Tanganyika.  Inspired by the long, thin, sharp horns of the local rhinos, and the typical  British reserve, he wrote:  </P> <P>  Two hunters from Britain that I know  </P> <P>  Were impaled on the horns of a rhino  </P> <P>  And, although en brochette,  </P> <P>  Had not formally met.  </P> <P>  Did they speak to each other? Oh, my, no!  </P> <P> </P> <P> Walt Hopmans of Santa Barbara chides me for not printing numerous verses he has  sent me in the past, and tries again. His shortest:  </P> <P>  Avoid  </P> <P>  Freud  </P> <P> </P> <P> Joan G. Gabrielson goes for the the purely hysterical in "The Hypochondriac and  the Doc, no quack:"  </P> <P>  She asked the Doc to diagnose  </P> <P>  Her pains -- from head to toes.  </P> <P>  Unperplexed, he Rx'd:  </P> <P>  "You must cut down on leisure,  </P> <P>  For you've had a Julius Caesar."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Gene Riley of Torrance says he has collected his own verses as "Cursory  Rhymes," striving for timeless themes, short but profound, and pertinent to  everyone's experience. Here are a few of his:  </P> <P>  Relations save us lots of grief  </P> <P>  When they make their visits brief.  </P> <P>  Adults can't play on a children's slide,  </P> <P>  It makes them look undignified.  </P> <P>  We know that we are growing old,  </P> <P>  When we start doing what we're told.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Ed Kysar of Reseda offers a tribute to the genre:  </P> <P>  To Parker, Armour, Nash, et al,  </P> <P>  Homage here, abundant,  </P> <P>  From those who wish to let it all  </P> <P>  Hang out, sans the redundant.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Harry Cimring says he published thousands before certain popular magazines  folded and newspaper columnists turned from potpourri columns to the current  theme column. Here's one he wrote, after a weekend in Yosemite, before the word  biodegradable was coined (It was published by Matt Weinstock):  </P> <P>  Swept away by the winds and the rains  </P> <P>  Are the cardboard, paper and other remains;  </P> <P>  But this I note as the scene I scan:  </P> <P>  The indestructibility of the beer can.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Marc Berkov of Culver City titles this one on modern art "Is a Rose Really a  Rose?":  </P> <P>  If anything goes  </P> <P>  In poetry or prose,  </P> <P>  Even three minutes silence  </P> <P>  Of a musical appliance,  </P> <P>  Or two red dots apart  </P> <P>  Considered to be art --  </P> <P>  Don't you find it rather funny  </P> <P>  You can't use abstract money?  </P> <P> </P> <P> Deborah Parducci of Pacific Palisades wrote this one for friends' 25th wedding  anniversary:  </P> <P> Ain't it nifty?  </P> <P>  Try for fifty.  </P> <P>  And also this one:  </P> <P> I wish that it were 1930  </P> <P> So many words would still be dirty  </P> <P>  To which I add one of my own:  </P> <P>  As our 50th grows near,  </P> <P>  We shed a tear;  </P> <P>  It's too much trouble,  </P> <P>  To go for double.  </P> <P> </P></p>

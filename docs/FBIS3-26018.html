The circular said: Recently, some publication units and  individuals have published compilations of taxation laws and  regulations in violation of the State Council's regulations on  the publication of compilations of laws and regulations; or have  published videotapes and books on taxation in the name of  publicizing the new taxation law and with the purpose of seeking  exorbitant profits; or even have held training classes on  taxation issues using the name of the State General  Administration of Taxation. These classes asked for a large fee  and provided low-quality lectures, causing very bad influences.    In response to the aforementioned situations, the State  General Administration of Taxation recently issued a circular  stressing: The right to construe taxation laws belongs to the  Finance Ministry, the State General Administration of Taxation,  or other authorized departments. Without the permission of the  State General Administration of Taxation or other authorized  departments, no publication units are allowed to publish any  compilations of taxation laws. The State General Administration  of Taxation will hand over cases of violation to a publication  administration department or a industry and commerce  administration department for legal action. Taxation organs and  personnel are not allowed to take part in profit-seeking  publication of any kind of videotape or book on taxation, or  take part in any profit-seeking training activities concerning  taxation law. If necessary, taxation organs and personnel may  join concerned departments in banning such publication and  training activities.</p>

			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Paramount calls for Pounds 5.42m Paramount, the public house operator, is raising Pounds 5.42m net of expenses through a 1-for-1 rights issue. Most of the proceeds will be used to buy 28 pubs from Greenalls Group for a total consideration of Pounds 3.27m. The issue of 69.8m shares, priced at 9p each, has been fully underwritten by Meespierson. The company's shares closed up  1/4 p yesterday at 11p. The company also announced it had applied to move from the Unlisted Securities Market to a full listing. The acquisition will increase the number of pubs owned by Paramount to 124. It operates 246 pubs in north-west England and Wales. All its establishments are tenanted. Paramount also intends to use part of the proceeds to make a further investment in Real Inns, a joint venture company owned equally with John Labatt (UK), a subsidiary of Labatt, the Canadian brewer. Real Inns owns 77 pubs. Paramount said it was buying the new pubs as part of its strategy to increase the overall value of its estate and to improve operating margins. 'The additional pubs will give us greater purchasing power with breweries. Our aim is to increase our barrelage through a large estate while keeping our overheads lean,' the company said. Its strategy is to buy smaller value pubs - in the Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 140,000 range - and to develop this niche market. In the six months to November 30 1993 the company reported pre-tax profits just ahead from Pounds 261,000 to Pounds 273,000.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Lottery set in Shanghai share offers SEVEN Shanghai companies will float a total of 7.05m shares this week through a lottery system designed to winnow the city's pool of millions of eager investors, Reuter reports from Beijing. The companies include the state-run Shanghai Special-Shaped Steel-Tubing Plant, Shanghai Jiafeng Cotton Mill and Shanghai United Textile. The shares, with a face value of Y10 each, are to be offered to a group of 217,000 people selected through a lottery that attracted 2.14m applicants. Each of the applicants bought a lottery number for Y30. Numbers are to remain valid for the three to four future lottery drawings that Shanghai plans for this year. The exchange plans to list a total of about 30 companies by the end of the year. Currently 10 companies are listed. The official New China News Agency said the lottery system had been instituted to prevent the chaos surrounding previous issues, when police had to be called out to control crowds of hopeful investors.</p>

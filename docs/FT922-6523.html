			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sale Tilney gives survival warning Sale Tilney, which has food, industrial, insurance and financial services interests, has more than halved its pre-tax loss from Pounds 9.62m to Pounds 4.45m in the year to November 29, writes Peter Pearse. However, Mr Andrew Coppel, group chief executive, said: 'The group's solvency and the seriousness of the group's financial position are the main issue for the board.' During the year that position worsened, leaving net liabilities of Pounds 9.76m. The order books in the industrial companies gave 'cause for concern', said Mr Coppel. 'There remains considerable uncertainty about the overall outcome for 1992.' Debt was reduced to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 27.1m) in the 12 months, shrinking interest payable to Pounds 3.92m (Pounds 5.99m). Exceptional losses, provisions and refinancing expenses were sharply down at Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 8.8m). However, extraordinary charges leapt to Pounds 12.5m (Pounds 143,000), comprising Pounds 5m closure costs and Pounds 7.4m for the transfer of goodwill written off to the merger reserve. Group turnover was down at Pounds 128m (Pounds 153m) and losses per share were 17.9p (36.7p).</p>

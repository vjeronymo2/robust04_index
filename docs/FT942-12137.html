			<p>940430 FT  30 APR 94 / Books: A forestful of fantasies EATING PAVLOVA by DM Thomas Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 231 pages UNDER THE VULCANIA by Maureen Freely Bloomsbury Paperback Pounds 4.99, 139 pages FISHING THE SLOE-BLACK RIVER by Colum McCann Phoenix House Pounds 13.99, 184 pages Sigmund Freud died of cancer of the jaw in Hampstead in 1939. DM Thomas's novel is in the form of a memoir supposedly written and dreamed by Freud in his last morphine clouded days. He was nursed by his daughter Anna, the renowned child psychoanalyst, then in her forties, and much of the book's focus is on Anna, whose life was consumed by her father. This is not the first time Thomas has used Freud in a novel; the 'father of psychoanalysis' checked into the notorious White Hotel. Eating Pavlova will annoy Freudians and confirm others in their prejudices as Thomas, acting the ventriloquist, sits on his knee an old goat dummy whose bleatings put a mediocre gloss on his life and work, and who exhibits a mild fixation on corsets and suspenders. On page one the baby Sigmund/Oedipus watches his parents making love and offers this beatitude: 'Happy is the infant whose father fills him with a passion for forests by coupling with his bride in full view.' Then there is a long section devoted to Freud re-falling in love with his wife Martha in middle age, a period which provides the novelist with a forestful of sexual fantasies, embellishment and lies. Historic figures, including Jung, HD Bryher and Helene Deutsch troop through the narrative and Pavlova dances past in a memory inspired by a dream of her pudding, that confection of meringue and fruit which can so easily collapse into sogginess. The text is interspersed with fictional hindsight and genuine case histories and a story 'written' by Anna, in which she is married to her father. The final scene is touching as Freud, now a guilty ghost, foresees Anna old and alone in the house where she lived on until 1982, and which is now the Freud Museum, but it is tempting to paraphrase another author's title into 'Eating Pavlova is Wrong'. 'What do women want?' asks the ersatz Freud in the course of his adventures. The women in Maureen Freely's Under the Vulcania want diversion from unsatisfactory lives and marriages. The Vulcania is a pleasure dome devoted to fulfilling their wildest fantasies. The Hard-On Cafe and the Merry-Go- Vibrator might promise paradise at first, but Freely introduces subtly the nightmarish potential of her palace of varieties staffed by Californian Chippendales. Much of Freely's work, as novelist and journalist, is concerned with balancing motherhood and sexual fulfilment, and here she juggles desire and danger in a tight, astute, depressing and sometimes very funny narrative. Colum McCann is a young writer who has been hailed as part of the talented new wave coming out of Ireland. Fishing the Sloe-Black River, his first collection of stories, shows a poetic and angry observer taking the well-worn path from Ireland to America. As with some of his compatriots, the cadences of Irish speech and expressions add natural poetry to the prose and these stories of exile and loss may possibly have been influenced by the work of Desmond Hogan. McCann's dispossessed characters, working in mental hospitals, dying of Aids, seeking long lost sisters, are informed by a literariness and myth. The souls of the dead of both sides of the conflict in Ireland turn into swans in Cathal's lake, one of the less successful stories, where an old farmer's rage and pity are patently the author's rather than his own. When McCann eschews magic realism a credible compassion illuminates the squalor, nastiness, brutality and beauty of modern life.</p>

			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOARD QUIETLY ELECTS NRA LEADERS;  </P> <P> CONVENTION: GUN FANCIERS WHO WANTED A LEADERSHIP SHAKEUP TO COUNTER LEGISLATIVE  SETBACKS WERE DISAPPOINTED. THE EMBATTLED CEO WAS REELECTED UNANIMOUSLY.  </P> <P> Despite rumblings of a possible shakeup after one of the worst years in its  history, the National Rifle Assn.'s board of directors offered no surprises  Monday in its annual leadership elections as the gun lobby's convention here  neared its end.  </P> <P> Among those supported by the board was J. Warren Cassidy, the embattled chief  executive officer who has been blamed by some among the NRA rank and file for  the group's recent string of legislative losses at the state and federal  levels.  </P> <P> At a raucous general membership meeting here Saturday attended by about 1,000  members, several vocal critics called for Cassidy's firing, claiming that he  has helped turn the NRA into a "paper tiger."  </P> <P> Internal critics charged that Cassidy has been too willing to appease  gun-control activists and to compromise gun owners' rights. And the full body  passed a non-binding resolution seeking to effectively shift power from Cassidy  to the head of the NRA's lobbying arm.  </P> <P> But at Monday's meeting of the 75-member board, which sets NRA policy,  directors reappointed Cassidy by a unanimous voice vote as their executive vice  president and top staff officer, a post he has held since 1986. There was no  discussion.  </P> <P> "That's precisely what we were afraid of," complained Manuel Fernandez of  Sepulveda, one of the internal NRA critics. "We wanted a new person with a less  compromising position, but (the board) is an old boys' club."  </P> <P> Indeed, the board members adopted a business-as-usual demeanor Monday, with  virtually none of the hostilities that marked the weekend meeting of the full  NRA. The board concludes its two days of meetings today, winding down a six-day  convention that drew an estimated 20,000 gun enthusiasts into Anaheim for a gun  show, seminars and rallies.  </P> <P> Directors discussed ways of getting more women and minorities into their ranks  after a membership drop of 250,000 in the last four years, as well as trying to  win over law-enforcement leaders who have become their chief foes on  gun-control issues.  </P> <P> But the NRA leaders signaled no dramatic changes in policy or strategies --  with the exception of a private satellite network that they are planning to use  to link NRA members around the country.  </P> <P> As expected, first vice president Richard Riley of New Hampshire ascended to  the presidency of the 2.8-million-member group without opposition. In the view  of some members, Riley offers the prospect of more aggressive leadership and a  renewed attention to legislative lobbying -- once the strong suit of the NRA  but now threatened by the recent losses.  </P> <P> There have, in fact, been concerns among some NRA members that Riley might  devote too much attention to battling gun-control legislation at the expense of  other group interests, such as the hunting, gun safety and shooting programs.  Riley confronted that concern in his acceptance speech Monday, saying: "I  assure you that nothing could be further from the truth."  </P> <P> Riley replaces outgoing president Joe Foss, a war hero, former governor of  South Dakota and commissioner of the old American Football League, who finished  a two-year term.  </P> <P> A colorful and popular figure, the 75-year-old Foss pledged to continue to  spread the "doctrine" of the NRA as a director.  </P> <P> Pointing to an unprecedented series of legislative efforts around the nation to  ban certain weapons and place other restrictions on gun owners, Foss said: "I  am still going to be battling the anti-gun people. . . . I love all guns, and  I'll be fighting the anti-gun people as long as I breathe."  </P></p>

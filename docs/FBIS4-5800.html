			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 14 KYODO -- Liberal Democratic Party  (LDP) Secretary General Yoshiro Mori said Thursday [14 April]  that party members appear to support President Yohei Kono as  candidate for the next premier, and suggested former Foreign  Minister Michio Watanabe give up his bid.    Speaking to a luncheon of business executives at a Tokyo  hotel, Mori also said passage of the fiscal 1994 budget, which  includes public works spending and a tax reduction to stimulate  the economy, could be delayed until July.    The business community has expressed concern that squabbling  over finding a replacement for Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa  could further postpone the budget, and put a damper on an  emerging economic recovery.    The opposition leader said the LDP does not want to see two  of its members vie for the premiership, and party consensus is a  prerequisite if the LDP is to back Watanabe instead of LDP  President Yohei Kono.    Kono said Tuesday he plans to run in the Diet race, and  there  apparently is only minor opposition within the LDP to his  candidacy, Mori said.    On Thursday, however, Watanabe collected some 50 signatures  from LDP legislators in the House of Representatives supporting  his bid.    Mori voiced strong displeasure that Watanabe may be in  communication with Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party] and the  buddhist-backed Komeito over forming a new conservative grouping.    He said the LDP could not cooperate with a Watanabe  administration supported by such a coalition because of  objections from religious groups that support the LDP. Mori  suggested that Kono and Watanabe meet to agree on a single LDP  candidate.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Issues Not Addressed in the Notice <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Ownership Interests in a Broker/Dealer <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentators asked for advice on when passive investors who are limited partners, equity owners or subordinated lenders of a broker/dealer would be construed as associated persons under the Interpretation. In other words, what ownership or contribution percentage would trigger associated person status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that if the person owns or has contributed 10% or less to the firm's capital, does not receive hot issues from the member in which he has the interest, and that member is not in a position to direct hot issues to the investor, then the NASD should not construe the investor to be an associated person solely by virtue of the investment in the broker/dealer. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Category 4 Restricted Persons <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentators asked whether managers/advisors of hedge funds, investment partnerships or of other similar entities would be construed as a restricted person under Paragraph four of the Interpretation (sales to the senior officer of a bank, investment company or other institutional type account). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that managers of investment partnerships or corporations, hedge funds, and other similar accounts are clearly involved with the buying or selling of securities for an institutional type account and, as such, are restricted under Paragraph four of the Interpretation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Private Placements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentators sought advice on how the Interpretation should be applied to members who receive securities of an issuer in a private placement. The definition of ``public offering'' as currently set forth in the Interpretation is comprehensive. The definition includes all distributions ``*&blank;*&blank;* of securities whether underwritten or not; whether registered, unregistered or exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, and whether they are primary or secondary distributions, including intrastate distributions and Regulation A issues, which sell at an immediate premium, in the secondary market.'' As such, the definition by its terms covers these private placements. Such distributions may involve securities which are either registered or unregistered. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD believes that the definition of public offering is unnecessarily broad and does not believe that the Interpretation should cover traditional ``private placements'' of unregistered securities. Thus, the NASD has proposed a definition of a public offering consistent with the definition provided in Schedule E to the Association's By-Laws. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Issuer Directed Exemption <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Several commentators requested that employees of an issuer or the issuer's parent who are restricted persons be exempt from the Interpretation when purchasing shares of their employer or its parent. Currently, such exemptions can only be granted on a case-by-case basis by the NASD Board of Governors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The NASD agrees that the issuer directed share exemption should be modified to allow restricted employees to purchase under the same terms and conditions as employees of member firms do under Schedule E of the By-Laws, thereby eliminating the need for applications to the NASD. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Change and Timing for Commission Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Within 35 days of the date of publication of this notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or within such longer period (i) as the Commission may designate up to 90 days of such date if it finds such longer period to be appropriate and publishes its reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which the self-regulatory organization consents, the Commission will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. By order approve such proposed rule change, or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. Institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

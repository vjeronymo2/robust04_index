			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Despatches: Tourists forsake the beaches and choose to go slumming instead - Rio de Janeiro 'WE'RE GOING to see something very special today,' enthuses Leny, the buxom tour guide. 'We're going to see a slum.' A ripple of guilty excitement runs through the tour bus, like a Women's Institute group watching the curtain go up on a naughty movie. Forget the golden beaches, the beautiful women, the Sugarloaf mountain. Rio's latest tourist attraction is its favelas, the teeming shanty towns clinging to the hills. A slum may not seem the most obvious place of interest for anyone visiting Latin America's top resort. Rio's favelas are renowned for violence rather than scenic beauty. They are mostly controlled by drug traffickers and are hideouts for kidnap gangs and death squads. They hit the news with the periodic discoveries of clandestine graveyards, or during raids when the Brazilian police burst in firing, or when mudslides caused by heavy rains result in the collapse of the poorly-built houses, killing hundreds. But they are home to a third of Rio's 9.6m population, and are impossible to ignore in their prime positions on the hills, overlooking the city's five star hotels and luxury apartments. And, apparently, they are what tourists really want to see. A survey by a group of travel agents found that 80 per cent of tourists in Rio listed favelas among the places they would most like to visit. The first group to try the experience sets off from Copacabana amid great excitement, still slightly hungover from the previous night's samba show. They begin to look more hungover and less convinced about the wisdom of the idea as the tour bus climbs a narrow, cobbled street along which the buildings become progressively more decrepit. Eventually, it halts at the foot of a stairway leading to Morro da Providencia, overlooking the centre of the city. Literally 'Providence Hill', this is Rio's oldest favela and has its origins as a military watchpost built in 1830. Tourists of all ages from Australia, Canada, Argentina and the US pile out of the bus trying to look cool but speaking just a shade too loudly, and glancing around furtively for weapons and kidnappers. An Australian housewife endeavours to hide her pallor under her tan as a local reporter tells her that Rio averages 25 murders a day and that this favela is one of the most violent. 'This is the reality of Rio,' yells the irrepressible Leny as she leads her flock through rubbish piles, stepping over sewage pipes and cockroaches and trying not to fall over the women washing clothes or men skinning fish on the path. Cameras click as future Peles perform impossible feats with footballs. Young boys beat drums while girls in skin-tight dresses show off their prowess at samba and that sexy hip-sway with which Brazilian women apparently are born. On the steps, a group of unshaven men old beyond their years drink neat cachaca, a pure sugar cane spirit, and blink bloodshot eyes at the new arrivals. Morro da Providencia is in good condition as favelas go, but its foreign visitors cannot help wrinkling their noses as they enter the shack-like houses. Most of the 80,000 inhabitants are marginals from Brazil's poverty-stricken north-east, forced by hunger to migrate but finding little better in the big city. Many of the tourists are involved in social work and are keen to see the conditions. Denis, a huge black American over from New York for carnival, drawls: 'This is nothing, man - I work in Hell's Kitchen every day.' Philosophising, he muses: 'Poverty is poverty, man, whether in New York or Rio.' Manoel, president of the residents' association, has done a sound job in convincing his members that the tour is a good thing. The idea came to him on Copacabana beach while talking to a group of Argentinian visitors who told him of their desire to see the 'other side' of Rio. After agreeing security with police and drug traffickers, he contacted travel agents and Favela Tours was born. Tourists pay Dollars 25 (Pounds 14.10) each for the privilege and Manoel plans two tours a day. Part of the profits will go to the association to build a creche and supply food for the needy, together with other facilities that the government fails to provide. 'All the government gives us is police,' notes Manoel. The tour is shepherded by local teenagers wearing white T-shirts stamped 'Favela tours.' Solicitous in the extreme, they are there to hold Doreen's elbow as she just avoids falling into one of many holes, and to prevent Brian stepping too close to the edge while admiring the view of the city. The idea is that locals, most of whom are unemployed, will abandon crime and instead make money selling Favela Souvenirs such as key rings and T-shirts emblazoned with the inevitable slogan: 'I visited Rio's oldest slum.' As Leny hands out T-shirts in return for a 'donation,' she coos to her charges: 'Did you enjoy it?' 'Yes,' comes the resounding chorus, many scarcely masking their relief at not having been shot or kidnapped. Gilles Moreau, a chartered accountant from Canada, says with a grin: 'My holiday snaps will not be what people were expecting at all.'</p>

As used in this paragraph,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> unusual circumstances <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  means that there is a need to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Search for and collect records from archives; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Consult with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request, or consult with various OGE components that have substantial subject matter interest in the records requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> Subpart D_Exemptions under FOIA <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2604.401 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Policy. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Policy on application of exemptions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 552(b) of the Freedom of Information Act contains nine exemptions to the mandatory disclosure of records. A requested record will not be withheld from inspection or copying unless it comes within one of the classes of records exempted by 5 U.S.C. 552. In making its determination on withholding, OGE will consider whether another statute, Executive order or regulation prohibits release or, if not, whether there is a need in the public interest to withhold material which is otherwise exempt under FOIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Pledge of confidentiality. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Information obtained from any individual or organization, furnished in reliance on a provision for confidentiality authorized by applicable statute, Executive order or regulation, will not be disclosed to the extent it can be withheld under one of the exemptions. However, this paragraph does not itself authorized the giving of any pledge of confidentiality by any officer or employee of the Office of Government Ethics. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Exception for law enforcement information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Office may treat records compiled for law enforcement purposes as not subject to the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act when: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) The investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) There is reason to believe that the subject of the investigation or proceeding is unaware of its pendency; and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) The disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably by expected to interfere with the enforcement proceedings. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Partial application of exemptions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Any reasonably segregable portion of a record will be provided to any person requesting the record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subpart. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;2604.402 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Business information. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> In general. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Business information provided to the Office of Government Ethics by a submitter will not be disclosed pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request except in accordance with this section. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Designation of business information. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Submitters of business information should use good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, those portions of their submissions which they deem to be protected under Exemption 4 of the FOIA.

Such statement shall specify all the grounds for withholding any of the information under any exemption of the FOIA and, in the case of Exemption 4, shall demonstrate why the information is deemed to be a trade secret or commercial or financial information that is privileged or confidential. Information provided by a submitter pursuant to this paragraph may itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Notice of intent to disclose. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The General Counsel will consider all objections raised by a submitter and specific grounds for nondisclosure prior to determining whether to disclose business information. Whenever the General Counsel decides to disclose business information over the objection of a submitter, he will send the submitter a written notice at least 10 working days before the date of disclosure containing: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY EARNINGS: DICEON LOSES $1.4 MILLION  </P> <P> Diceon Electronics, the Irvine circuit board manufacturer, lost $1.4 million  for its 1990 fiscal second quarter, down from the $1.3 million it lost for the  quarter a year ago. Sales for the quarter ended March 31 were $32.7 million,  11% over the $29.5 million for the period the year before.  </P> <P> Its loss for the first half was $2.6 million; it was $1 million for the first  six months last year. Revenue declined slightly, to $59.4 million from $60.2  million.  </P> <P> The company said it has been affected by an inability to raise prices because  of the overcapacity in the industry caused by increases in offshore  competition, a slowing in the information systems industry, and an effort by  electronic equipment manufacturers to reduce components.  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NAMES IN THE NEWS;  </P> <P> ANNE ON 3RD VISIT TO N. IRELAND  </P> <P> Princess Anne cut the ceremonial ribbon to open a new cosmetics factory today  near Belfast during her third visit to Northern Ireland this year.  </P> <P> Security was tight as Queen Elizabeth II's only daughter opened the plant, then  met management and the factory's staff. Her visit was not announced until she  arrived in the province for fear the Irish Republican Army would disrupt it.  </P> <P> In 1977, Anne became the first member of Britain's Royal Family to visit the  province after sectarian and political strife erupted in 1969. The IRA is  fighting to oust Britain from the predominantly Protestant province and unite  it with the Roman Catholic Republic of Ireland.  </P></p>

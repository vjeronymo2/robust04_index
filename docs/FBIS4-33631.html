			<p>BFN     [Text] Managua, 8 Jun (ACAN-EFE) -- The seizure of the  Venezuelan Embassy in Managua, with five diplomats inside, by 23  former Sandinist military ended today following 11 hours of  tension and negotiations as the Nicaraguan Government pledged to  discuss the occupiers' petitions for compensation.    Another group of at least 20 former military, who also  demanded compensation for being discharged in the past four  years, also ended the takeover of the Managua Cathedral. The  seizure of the cathedral occurred almost at the same time and  was also peaceful.    Diogenes Silva, assigned to the embassy's military attache  office, confirmed that the former military had left and said  that "control of the diplomatic office" had been regained.  Ambassador Juan Jose Monsant and four other diplomats remained  inside the embassy, which is located on the outskirts of Managua.    Moments later, Donald Flores -- one of the former military  who seized the cathedral and led a similar action in 1993 --  also confirmed his partners had left the church.    Kidder Salazar, first secretary of the Venezuelan Embassy,  told ACAN-EFE during the occupation that he and the other  diplomats did not stay there as hostages, but to protect the  embassy. The former military -- who were unarmed -- released  two employees who were also at the embassy after several hours.    Also on Tuesday, other former military seized and occupied  the Italian Embassy in Managua and the UN building for several  hours.    Following the civil war and the demobilization of thousands  of combatants, there were two simultaneous abductions of  political leaders and high-ranking officials in Nicaragua last  year. Former contras were responsible for one of the abductions  in northern Nicaraguan while Sandinists were responsible for the  other abduction in the capital. In 1993, another heavily armed  anti-Sandinist command seized and occupied the Nicaraguan  Embassy in Costa Rica for two weeks.    Today's occupation was solved around midnight, local time  (0600 GMT), after Vilma Nunez, director of the Nicaraguan Center  for Human Rights, and Monsignor Eddy Montenegro, of the Managua  Archbishopric, mediated the conflict. Both assured that the  government had agreed to begin conversations within two days  with the former military, thereby allowing the solution of the  cathedral's occupation.    A letter from Alfredo Mendieta, justice minister, to Nunez  and Montenegro, announced that the government accepted the  negotiation and in addition would release seven former military  who had been arrested. In exchange, however, the minister  demanded that the military leave "immediately the embassy and  the cathedral."    In the negotiations it was agreed to create a commission to  discuss the retired military's claims. The commission will have  two representatives of the "Movement for a Fair and Honorable  Compensation," Eduardo Hernandez and Adrian Calero. According  to the government commitment, compensation will be negotiated  for an unspecified number of retired military based on the  October 1993 agreements. At that time the cathedral was also  occupied by discontented former Sandinist military. Vilma Nunez  and Monsignor Montenegro will act as mediators again in the  negotiations. The government also accepted the diplomatic  mission occupants' demand that no reprisals would be taken  against members of the movement.    Donald Flores, leader of the former military, declared that  he hoped that the "actions aimed at a peaceful solution" of  their demands for compensation for their years of service, had  concluded.    Nevertheless, Frank Cesar, deputy government minister, said  before the agreement was reached, that they have no right to any  compensation and that some of the former military "had been  involved in criminal actions," while others already had  collected their compensation and continue to work in government  institutions. The official assured that the previous Sandinist  regime had fired hundreds of military who served in the former  Interior Ministry; the majority now are demanding compensation  to which they have no right. He explained that in February, 785  persons received their compensation although it appears that  1,000 were demobilized from the Interior Ministry, the majority  before April 1990 when Violeta Chamorro took office.</p>

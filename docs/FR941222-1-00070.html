			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Specific Approaches to Waste Minimization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency can and has used different regulatory mechanisms  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to promote waste minimization in the listing program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion below will describe several options the Agency has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified as an approach to tailoring listings that encourages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generators to use waste minimization practices. This approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could apply to any listing determination. Also included in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussion are specific references to today's proposed listing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination for dyes and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Quantity-Based Listings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A potential method of structuring a waste listing to promote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste minimization would be to establish a quantity-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemption for the wastes listed. Under such an approach, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> listing of a specific wastestream would be accompanied by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity-based exemption for the specific wastestream involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Quantity can refer to either a concentration of constituents in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste (measured or calculated) or the mass of constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> released to the environment. The Agency believes that this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach would encourage waste minimization because a facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have to meet a risk-based quantitation target for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream in order to qualify for the exemption, thereby  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requiring reductions in the mass or concentration (or both) of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the constituents of concern. In reducing mass loading or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentration (or both) of the wastes, the Agency's waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimization goals are achieved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A concentration basis is easier to measure and track than a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limit based on loading or mass. Setting a limit based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loadings or mass addresses total loadings to the environment and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recognizes waste minimization efforts that result in reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in both mass of pollutant and volume of total wastestream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, a mass loading approach poses significantly more burden  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in terms of monitoring and compliance and may not take into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> account concentrations of constituents in a waste. The Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comment on the use of production or mass-based limits,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and on possible monitoring approaches.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A variation on this approach is an adaptation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``headworks rule'' (40 CFR 261.3(a)(2)(iv)(A)&hyph;(E)) to a listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The original rule, promulgated on November 17, 1981 (46 FR 56582)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> allows for calculated amounts of certain spent solvents,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial chemical products, petroleum refining wastes, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> laboratory residuals to be sent to a facility's wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment plant, and for the wastewaters and sludges (beyond the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headworks) to be exempted from the mixture rule. The Agency also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed in the March 1, 1994 carbamates listing proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (59 FR 9808&hyph;9864) to provide a similar exemption to a wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed for listing in the same notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under the ``headworks'' exemption approach ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 261.3(a)(2)(iv)(H)), the wastewaters and treatment sludges would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be exempt from the listing as long as the industry could show  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the total quantity of hazardous constituents that pose risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in a wastestream, divided by the undiluted wastewater flow for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters on an average weekly basis from the particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> product process subject to the listing was less than a calculated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity. The calculated quantity would be based on a risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency would have to be able to determine the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship between the amount of raw material used and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presence of particular constituents in the wastestream. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Agency requests comment on whether determining such a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> relationship is feasible for the dye and pigment industries. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualify for such an exemption, the facility would have to use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> existing inventory records of raw materials that go into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process. The facility can subtract the quantity of materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that, in fact, do not go into the wastewater treatment system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either by chemical reaction or material recovery techniques  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> distillation, reuse, reverse osmosis, etc.). The facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may not subtract any quantity assumed to volatilize. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> quantity of material left then would be converted to resulting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels of constituents expected to be generated based on quantity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of raw material used. The levels of constituents then would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided by the average weekly flow of the wastewaters into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> headworks of the wastewater treatment system at the time the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process is being run to determine total concentrations of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents in wastewater. If the total concentration of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents of concern is less than the amount calculated based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the risk assessment, the wastewaters and treatment sludges  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would qualify for the exemption. This approach has the advantage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of determining concentrations in a mathematical, rather than an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analytical way. The disadvantage is that it requires collection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of process flow data and specific plant chemistry information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Agency realizes that constituent loading into the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewater treatment system may have to be reduced significantly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (up to two to three orders of magnitude in many cases) in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to qualify for an exemption of this sort. Therefore, the Agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> solicits comment on whether such levels are achievable, and what  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> other calculation methods may exist (such as one based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> production mass).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Such an exemption would apply only after the wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have arrived at the headworks of a facility's wastewater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> treatment system. The Agency would not allow it to apply to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters before they reach the headworks. Generators who wish  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to qualify for such an exemption would be required to use flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> statistics for the period in which the processes generating the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters are being run. Finally, such an exemption would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> apply only to wastewater flow for that wastestream, not to flow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> figures from unrelated processes that serve only to dilute the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, generators would be required to keep records of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average weekly flow in the production processes, especially when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the processes generating the listed wastewaters are run. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> land disposal restrictions are applied to a waste subject to such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> an exemption, generators would need to comply with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 40 CFR 268.7(a)(6), which states that the generator who has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produced a waste subject to an exemption in 40 CFR 261.2&hyph;261.6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must keep a notification in the facility's file stating that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a waste has been generated, the fact that it is restricted, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the disposition of the waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=25 g=1 f=1 --> (3) Simultaneous multiple round auctions <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (b) The Commission may use combinatorial bidding, which would allow bidders to submit all or nothing bids on combinations of licenses, in addition to bids on individual licenses. The Commission may require that to be declared the high bid, a combinatorial bid must exceed the sum of the individual bids by a specified amount. Combinatorial bidding may be used with any type of auction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) The Commission may use single combined auctions, which combine bidding for two or more substitutable licenses and award licenses to the highest bidders until the available licenses are exhausted. This technique may be used in conjunction with any type of auction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.2104 Competitive Bidding Mechanisms <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Sequencing.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission will establish the sequence in which multiple licenses will be auctioned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Grouping.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In the event the Commission uses either a simultaneous multiple round competitive bidding design or combinatorial bidding, the Commission will determine which licenses will be auctioned simultaneously or in combination. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Reservation Price.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission may establish a reservation price, either disclosed or undisclosed, below which a license subject to auction will not be awarded. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Minimum Bid Increments.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission may, by announcement before or during an auction, require minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms. The Commission may also establish suggested minimum opening bids on a service-specific basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Stopping Rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission may establish stopping rules before or during multiple round auctions in order to terminate the auctions within a reasonable time. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Activity Rules.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission may establish activity rules which require a minimum amount of bidding activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Withdrawal, Default and Disqualification Penalties.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As specified below, when the Commission conducts a simultaneous multiple round auction pursuant to &sect;1.2103, the Commission will impose penalties on bidders who withdraw high bids during the course of an auction, or who default on payments due after an auction closes or who are disqualified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Bid withdrawal prior to close of auction. A bidder who withdraws a high bid during the course of an auction will be subject to a penalty equal to the difference between the amount bid and the amount of the winning bid the next time the license is offered by the Commission. No withdrawal penalty would be assessed if the subsequent winning bid exceeds the withdrawn bid. This penalty amount will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the withdrawing bidder has deposited with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Default or disqualification after close of auction. If a high bidder defaults or is disqualified after the close of such an auction, the defaulting bidder will be subject to the penalty in subsection (1) plus an additional penalty equal to 3 percent of the subsequent winning bid. If the subsequent winning bid exceeds the defaulting bidder's bid amount, the 3 percent penalty will be calculated based on the defaulting bidder's bid amount. These amounts will be deducted from any upfront payments or down payments that the defaulting or disqualified bidder has deposited with the Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When the Commission conducts single round sealed bid auctions or sequential oral auctions, the Commission may modify the penalties to be paid in the event of bid withdrawal, default or disqualification; provided, however, that such penalties shall not exceed the penalties specified above. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) The Commission will generally release information concerning the identities of bidders before each auction but may choose, on an auction-by-auction basis, to withhold the identity of the bidders associated with bidder identification numbers. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) The Commission may delay, suspend, or cancel an auction in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, evidence of security breach, unlawful bidding activity, administrative necessity, or for any other reason that affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission also has the authority, at its sole discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=73 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.2105 Bidding Application and Certification Procedures; Prohibition of Collusion <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> Submission of Short Form Application (FCC Form 175).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In order to be eligible to bid, an applicant must timely submit a short-form application (FCC Form 175), together with any appropriate filing fee set forth by Public Notice. Unless otherwise provided by Public Notice, the Form 175 need not be accompanied by an upfront payment ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Section 1.2106 of this part). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) All Form 175s will be due: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) On the date(s) specified by Public Notice; or <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) In the case of application filing dates which occur automatically by operation of law ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> see, e.g.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 47 CFR Section 22.902), on a date specified by Public Notice after the Commission has reviewed the applications that have been filed on those dates and determined that mutual exclusivity exists. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

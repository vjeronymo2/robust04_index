While Iran a few days ago concluded the largest naval-air  maneuvers of their kind in the Strait of Hormuz, it was  announced yesterday that Pakistan is in the process of  purchasing a very modern assaultsubmarine from Sweden costing  $700 million.    Kuwait too has announced that it is currently engaged in  negotiations to purchase three frigates from France. Even Iraq,  which has almost nothing, has announced the formation of a  high-level committee to redirect its strategy toward "the Gulf  and beyond."    Sources in Washington say that Ukraine has contacted a  number  of states in the region, offering to sell them a substantial  part of its share of the former Soviet Navy, especially assault  ships [sufun hujumiyah], destroyers, speed boats, and minelayers.    Ukraine is also said to have contacted Iran and offered to  sell it one Kilo submarine instead of the third submarine Iran  was supposed to purchase from Moscow before the latter changed  its position.    Until the end of the sixties most states in the region had  focused on developing their ground forces, basing their  strategies on huge tank battles along the lines of the World War  II model. But after that all of them turned to the acquisition  of modern aircraft, especially after the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.    The new focus on the naval force is linked to the growing  capability to launch missiles from ships against targets deep in  others' territory. Western experts have accused Pakistan, Iran,  and Iraq of trying to develop chemical and nuclear weapons that  can be carried as warheads on medium- and long-range missiles.    A team of U.S. experts which will visit Islamabad soon is  expected to raise this issue with the Pakistani Government. The  United States wants Pakistan to cancel the deal concerning the  development of missiles with China and to also sign the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. Prime Minister Bhutto has indicated  that she may agree to that in return for Washington's help to  build her Navy.</p>

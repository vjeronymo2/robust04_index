The  minister of law and order, Mr. Hernus Kriel, said this step had  been taken to prevent the possible spread of violence from  Bophuthatswana to South Africa. The areas include virtually all  towns and cities in the PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand,  Vereeniging] area, as well as large parts of the western  Transvaal, the northern Transvaal the [Orange] Free State, and  northern Cape.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / Survey of Kuwait (2): Shopping spree curtailed - Trade and Industry STRIP a country of its valuables and the chances are it will go on a shopping spree at the earliest opportunity to restock. This is what has happened in Kuwait, but the spree has been less than frenetic. Several factors have prevented the spending boom that western exporters had hoped for and the government's policy of trying to make Kuwait truly Kuwaiti, as it sees it, has reduced the population. About 400,000 Palestinians, many of whom earned relatively high wages in professional and technical positions, are no longer there. Kuwait's overall market is barely two-thirds of its pre-war size. The Kuwaitis and expatriates who have returned since the war have been less inclined, and less able, to spend than before, mainly because of their reduced means and reduced creditworthiness. Individual country's exports to Kuwait are either little changed from pre-war levels or they are dramatically lower. US companies have maintained or increased their sales to Kuwait by taking a bigger slice of a smaller cake. They have lifted sales largely at the expense of Japanese exporters and, to a lesser extent, the Germans. US sales have been helped by the Kuwaiti 'thank you' factor since the war. The government has favoured goods from those countries that took part in the allied war effort against Iraq, in particular the US. Certain items have enjoyed a one-off replacement surge, but the rest of the market is flat. Where sales have boomed, the boom has been shorter and less intense than exporters had hoped. An immediate post-war jump in sales of cars, electrical goods and food is levelling off. Aside from spending still to come on reconstruction, the boom, such as it was, is petering out. Restocking in the cars sector was underway within weeks of the Iraqi departure last February. More than half the country's 560,000 cars, trucks and buses were stolen or destroyed. Government ministries, shops and offices were virtually stripped. The Iraqis left with cars, computers, industrial machinery, food and an array of spare parts. American exports, dominated by car and truck sales, stood at Dollars 748m up to September last year and could be close to Dollars 1bn for the whole year, according to US officials in Kuwait. This compares with sales of about Dollars 800m in 1989. By contrast, Japanese exports to Kuwait, mainly cars and electrical goods, were only a fraction of 1989 sales, at Dollars 180m by October last year. Sales in 1989 were around Dollars 670m. Japan, whose important trading partners in the Gulf are Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, has taken a much lower profile since the war. German sales, consisting mainly of cars, machinery and electrical goods, were just over Dollars 93m up to October compared with about Dollars 400m in 1989. British sales to Kuwait, dominated by machinery and food, were Dollars 180m for the whole of last year, about 80 per cent of 1989 exports. The main exporting countries have arranged with export credit guarantee packages, including Dollars 2bn by the US Ex-im bank (confined to public sector projects), Dollars 700m by the UK authorities, Dollars 1bn by the Japanese and Dollars 550m by France. Kuwait's roads, which were mercifully quiet for a brief period after the war, are again crammed with foreign cars. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler of the US are, predictably, selling more strongly than the big Japanese operators, Nissan and Toyota. US officials say this is also because American companies were quicker to get started on spare parts and financing than their rivals. In addition to US and Japanese models that still dominate the roads, Land Rovers now occupy a tiny niche - the British manufacturer has sold about 550 since the war ended. The Al Mulla group, one of Kuwait's big family trading companies, imports a vast range of goods, including vehicles from Chrysler, Mitsubishi and John Deere and computers, office equipment, and white goods from IBM, Zenith, Zanussi, General Electric, Minolta, Groupe Bull and Sharpe. The group's office equipment section says it has been selling between 40 and 60 machines a month over the past year; sales worth about Dollars 4m. But demand is slowing across the board. 'Sales peaked by about November, says Mr Aranasalam Narenthiran, Al Mulla's deputy managing director. 'The market has not exactly dried up but it is levelling off.' Showrooms and warehouses are bulging. Agents and their supply companies abroad had banked on a longer boom and many traders have overstocked as a result. 'There's nothing we can do except monitor our stocks very carefully to try to make sure we aren't left with big stocks on our hands and a dead market,' says the sales manager of one Kuwaiti trading company. Al-Sayer, Toyota's agent in Kuwait, lost 1,500 new cars and 850 used cars during the occupation. It was five months before Toyota was shipping enough cars to meet demand immediately after the war. Since then, Toyota has shipped in 9,145 cars, but sales have tailed off and it has sold only 5,800. Annual sales before the war were around 12,000. Toyota says it is now looking to consolidate sales at between 9,000 and 10,000 a year. While the big family traders have been able to gain credit, restock and sell, conditions for the country's thousands of small and medium-sized businesses, most of them already in debt, have been extremely difficult. Without the backing of big exporting companies, many have been unable to get started again and face collapse in the months ahead. 'The difficulty for smaller traders is that they can't get credit from the banks whereas the larger businesses can,' says Mr Hilal Al Mutairi, director-general of the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce and Industry, representing the country's 18,000 businesses. 'We are hoping the government goes ahead with a proposed programme to buy up all the debts,' says Mr Al Mutairi. The debts would then be rescheduled over 20 years at low or zero interest rates. This would enable businesses to negotiate fresh credit with the banks and restart. The government is itself burdened with the costs of war and reconstruction although it may have to come up with some sort of commercial write-off. Any such package may come too late for the hundreds of businesses that have missed the shopping spree and are still struggling to reopen.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Liberal Party leader Bengt Westerber by </F> Ragnar Roos; place and date not given: "Farther and Farther  Apart"]    [Text] The political signals from Liberal Party leader  Bengt Westerberg during the past week make future government  cooperation with the Social Democrats appear more and more  realistic. However the question is whether the rest of the party  will go along with him.    It is true that Westerberg says the main goal is a  nonsocialist majority government. At the same time he rejects a  continued four-party coalition government with support from the  New Democracy Party. If the Social Democrats and the Left Party  do not win a majority either, he wants to try a bloc-spanning  government.    It is clear that Westerberg now feels there is less  ideological distance to the Social Democrats than to the  moderates. He designates the question of whether or not Sweden  will uphold the welfare state as the most important ideological  issue today. Now that he has stepped out as the champion of the  current model of the welfare system there is almost no common  ground for continuing to rule with the moderates during the next  four years.    The situation was different at the time of the  liberal-moderate program, "A New Start for Sweden," in the  spring of 1991. There was no mass unemployment, no waiting  period for benefits and no reduced compensation level for social  insurance. Most of the program has now been implemented. And  that marks the end of Westerberg's participation when it comes  to cuts in the public sector.    It is different for the moderates. They want to keep going  where Westerberg calls a halt. SVENSKA DAGBLADET's editor in  chief, Mats Svegfors, has chosen him as the number one defender  of the system, a more ardent proponent of today's welfare state  than the Social Democrats themselves.    But the Moderates, the young conservatives and the Timbro  intellectuals are not the only ones the Liberal Party leader is  at odds with. He accuses practically the entire corps of Swedish  economists of having a simplified view of taxes and the public  sector. This means he is also attacking a number of liberal  economists whose political home is in his own party.    In some respects Westerberg goes farther than right-wing  Social Democrats. Among other things he thinks Sweden must  safeguard a large public sector. The current size is good when  it comes to activity and employment, but expansion is said to be  impossible due to financing problems. He flatly dismisses the  theory that a public sector as large as the one we have now  hampers growth.    Westerberg also defends the general welfare policy and  rejects any ideas about basic coverage.    But what about the runaway budget deficit? That will be  cleared up if unemployment is cut in half and the government's  reorganization program is implemented. According to Westerberg  the OECD economists are quite wrong when they maintain that the  savings goal must be doubled from 80 to 160 billion kronor to  achieve stable economic growth.    Nor does the Liberal Party leader accept the economists'  solution to mass unemployment--opening up low-paying jobs in the  private service sector. He feels that if we maintain the public  sector and concentrate on industries that are research- and  development-intensive, a labor market B team will not be  necessary. And, finally, he flatly rejects the domestic-servant  deduction.    The current refrain may seem a long way from the early  1980's  when Westerberg launched the "Market Economy Alternative." He  himself claims that he has had the same assessments all along.  It is the debate that has changed and with it his emphasis on  different aspects of social liberalism.    But at the moment his leftist-liberal side seems to have the  upper hand. There is great affinity with the Social Democrats  and the women associated with the Women's List with regard to  the public sector, family policy ,and equality. With his present  political course Westerberg should be able to appeal especially  to employees in the public sector who are frustrated by the cuts  in recent years. Westerberg stands up for a group that  undoubtedly feels mistreated and tired of concepts like the  "draining sector."    Two-thirds of all public employees are women. Westerberg's  strong involvement in equality issues and his flirtation with  the Women's List make the target orientation even more obvious.    However the question is whether the right wing of the  Liberal  Party will go along with him in a possible alliance with the  Social Democrats. Leading "socialist eaters" like Anne Wibble  and Birgit Friggebo have previously blocked such ventures. There  is always a risk that ordinary nonsocialist voters will issue a  harsh verdict.    With today's low poll figures, the Wibble-Friggebo wing can  strengthen its position and once again change the party's course.  <H5>  Westerberg: `Maria-Pia Close to Us' </H5>   Bengt Westerberg is not giving an inch. Despite a sharp drop  in the polls he maintains the line that he has now made the  Liberal Party's: the public sector must not be trimmed, the big  savings have already been made and he is open to cooperation  with the Social Democrats.    He also praises Maria-Pia Boethius, the initiator of the  Women's List.    [Roos] You have said there is no possibility that the  Liberal  Party will be part of a nonsocialist minority government again  after the election. If the nonsocialists do not win a majority  would you then recommend a Social Democratic-Liberal government?    [Westerberg] I think it is urgent that the present  government  remain in office, but it must win its own majority. If it does  not achieve this and neither do the Social Democrats and the  Left Party combined, I think a bloc-spanning government should  be tried. But it is too early to say which parties should be  included.    [Roos] You are said to have written the following in an  internal memo dated 12 March 1990: "In my opinion the liberals  are closer to the Social Democrats (than to the moderates)  ideologically and programmatically, provided that the Social  Democrats do not renew their socialist demands." Does that still  apply?    [Westerberg] There must have been a longer train of  reasoning  behind that statement. But there is no doubt that the decisive  difference between the Social Democrats and the liberals has  been how we view the market economy. If the Social Democrats  gradually abandon their demand for a planned economy...    [Roos] But haven't they already done so?    [Westerberg] Yes...then it would make cooperation easier in  the future.    [Roos] Haven't you now moved quite a long way from the  ideological tone that characterized the liberal-moderate  program, "A New Start for Sweden," in the spring of 1991?    [Westerberg] No, as members of the government we have  implemented most of what stood there. But the debate is somewhat  different today. Now a lot of debaters have entered the arena  demanding that we scale down the welfare state. I think the  general welfare policy with the income loss principle and  inexpensive social services for those who are in need is good.    [Roos] In other words, the public sector does not need  further trimming.    [Westerberg] No, not as far as its activity and employment  are concerned. In this respect we support a large public sector.  Then of course we would like spending pressures to diminish, but  they will when the economy improves and unemployment declines.    [Roos] Many economists maintain that the present size of the  public sector and the accompanying tax burden hamper growth. You  don't think so?    [Westerberg] No, the economists who say that it will provide  more jobs if we shrink the public sector and replace it with  private activity are wrong. I am more inclined to think that it  will have the opposite effect, that there will be fewer jobs.  Many economists have a simplified view of how the economy  functions. They do not give enough consideration to the social  effects.    [Roos] And you don't think it is necessary to open up  low-paying jobs in the service sector?    [Westerberg] No, I think the economists are greatly  influenced by the current situation in their analyses. I think  they underestimate the dynamics once the economy gets going.    [Roos] Have the big structural savings already been made?    [Westerberg] Yes, but part of the reorganization program we  approved remains to be implemented.    [Roos] And that will also be enough to overcome the budget  deficit?    [Westerberg] The most important contribution will be to  bring  unemployment down. In combination with the budget-strengthening  measures I think it will be enough.    [Roos] You have said that many of your basic assessments are  very close to those of Maria-Pia Boethius. Is she a liberal  politician?    [Westerberg] I will say that in many respects she stands  very  close to the Liberal Party, for example where equality is  concerned.    [Roos] But what has become of the market liberal Westerberg  of the early 1980's?    [Westerberg] My basic assessments are the same today as they  were then. It is the debate that has changed. Then it was about  wage-earner funds. Today it concerns whether or not we will  uphold the welfare state.</p>

			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries strengthen on decline in GDP growth US Treasury prices firmed across the board yesterday on news of a decline in gross domestic product growth. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 103 1/16 yielding 6.878 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was also firmer, up  5/32 at 100 5/32 , to yield 3.777 per cent. Market sentiment was lifted by the Commerce department's announcement that GDP rose by only 1.8 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Although the figure was expected to come in below the 4.7 per cent growth recorded in the previous three months, it was also below analysts' forecasts. At first, dealers and investors hesitated to buy on the news because they were worried that the 3.3 per cent increase in the implicit price deflator, published along with the GDP numbers, suggested that inflation was picking up pace. However, analysts judged that the rise in the price deflator would be temporary, and by mid-morning bond prices were firmly in positive territory as investors focused on some of the other details in the GDP data, notably a 0.3 per drop in final sales and a 7.1 per cent decline in exports. Prices gained further ground later in the day, helped by the successful auction of Dollars 14.3bn of 52-week bills. THE UK government bond market continued to slide yesterday in the wake of Wednesday's disappointing gilt auction and amid general European bearishness. The new partly-paid 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998 fell by more than half a point to 49 7/8 . One view of the auction was that the yield ended up being too low after too heady a rally in advance. The slide was more accentuated at the longer end with falls of over a point in bonds with more than a 10-year maturity. After the futures contract's key 104.31 support level was breached, chartists were pointing to about 102.20 as the next stopping point. By yesterday, a decline of about 4 points had been registered since a high of 107.16 at the start of April. The decline followed a change in perception about the rate of recovery in the UK economy. Most indicators over the past fortnight have pointed to a stronger pick-up than anticipated. Another factor affecting all the European markets yesterday was switching into US Treasuries. AFTER the mid-week good news on German interest rates, with the repo rate cut by 34 basis points to 7.75 per cent, the government bond market was in decline yesterday, particularly at the long end. Profit-taking was part of the reason and, as with gilts, the futures contract breached its technical support level of 94.91. The June bund contract opened at 95.13 and fell to 94.60, with the low coming close to the next support level of 94.53. Volume was again heavy with more than 100,000 contracts traded. Factors weighing on the market include the queue of impending bond issues to fund swelling public debt and a strike vote by the IG Metall union over wages in the former East Germany. CONCERNS about the German outlook seem to have outstripped those on post-election France. The yield spread on French 10-year bonds over German ones has reached a historically tight landmark of about 40 basis points. Only a month ago, the spread was well over 60 and it was about 86 at the end of 1992. With the French inflation rate of 2.2 per cent about half that of Germany and French public borrowing growing less quickly - albeit from a higher base  -perceptions have changed. The Bank of France's   1/4 point cut in its two leading interest rates yesterday had been discounted, and with the franc buoyant in spite of the cut, the currency risk is seen as diminishing. IN Spain, a Pta700bn government bond auction, the second biggest for more than a year, attracted only weak foreign interest. This was reflected in the low allocation of 10-year bonds - about Pta100bn compared with Pta300bn each for the three and five-year stock - which was unhelpful to the Spanish government's drive to lengthen its debt maturity. THE Italian market's long rally skidded into reverse yesterday as profits were taken. High expectations of Mr Carlo Ciampi, the new prime minister, were tempered by a realisation of the practical problems he faces.</p>

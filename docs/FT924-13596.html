			<p>921014 FT  14 OCT 92 / People: Grice leaves Dales for Wace Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group rocked by the departure of its managing director John Clegg in January, has, after an eight-month search, found a new chief executive in Trevor Grice, who resigned from engineering group Renold earlier this year. Frans ten Bos, chairman, describes it as a 'critical' appointment for Wace. 'It was hard for the City and others to perceive Wace without John Clegg. John Clegg was a high profile young star.' Grice, by contrast, is 'someone with different skills and attitudes in a different economic climate. He is very sparky and shrewd.' Ten Bos, who was non-exec-utive chairman when Clegg resigned and 'had no option but to agree to fill in (by taking executive responsibilities) while the company tried to sort itself out' will return to his non-executive position when Grice comes aboard in the second week of November. Since Clegg's departure, the DTI has been investigating share dealings in the names of some of Clegg's relatives. But ten Bos stresses that 'it is not Wace that is being investigated. I have no concerns whatsoever about the outcome', adding that he understands the investigation is coming to an end. Echoing ten Bos's confidence, Grice contends: 'It is nothing to do with the company; I don't regard it as an issue.' Grice, 51, has 14 years' experience of the printing industry under his belt with lithographic plate-maker Frank Horsell, where he was managing director between 1978 and 1986. After Horsell was acquired by the Cookson Group, Grice moved over to Renold, embarking on a five-year plus restructuring exercise. Despite recent losses stemming from an order book badly dented by the recession, Grice was confident he had completed his brief and stepped down from Renold at the end of March - thereby ridding himself of a 140-mile commute across the Pennines. He has spent the intervening period on a management consultancy project for his family telephone sales business. He says he was not actively looking for another job when he was approached by Wace. After his wife agreed to move to London from the Yorkshire Dales, he accepted the assignment.</p>

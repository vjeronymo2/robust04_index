			<p>BFN     [Text] Ankara--President Suleyman Demirel, who met with  pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP) Deputy Chairman Remzi Kartal  within the framework of his talks with political party leaders,  reportedly told Kartal on Wednesday [4 May] that bloodshed  should be stopped immediately for the solution of the Kurdish  issue.    Kartal said he told Demirel that the problems which Turkey  was experiencing were political and would increase. Kartal said  that the lawsuit against five DEP deputies and an independent  deputy who were under arrest had not yet been opened, that he  had mentioned that issue to Demirel and that Demirel was  disturbed and told him that he would discuss this with Justice  Minister Seyfi Oktay and take the necessary initiatives.    Kartal, who is a deputy from Van, said he told Demirel that  the Kurdish issue was the source of all the crises in Turkey,  that Turkey's current crisis was political and would continue to  escalate, that he and his colleagues had earlier expressed that  opinion and that the matter should be solved from legal,  administrative and constitutional aspects.    Kartal said he also told Demirel: ``Our party is facing the  danger of closure. We can solve the matter. We are ready to  assume all kinds of responsibility. Our party is a chance if  the country intends to solve the Kurdish matter.    ``Closure of the party will block the democratic path. Legal  changes are needed to be made for the removal of barriers in  front of freedom of expression and politics.    ``This matter cannot be solved with blood; the state cannot  solve it with arms. They are also the people of this country  like the policemen or soldiers who are being killed. An unarmed  and bloodless solution should certainly be put into force.''    Kartal added that he received the impression that at present  the higher echelons of the state were not taking any action  regarding the solution of the Kurdish issue.</p>

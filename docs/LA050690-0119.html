			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> YES, WEST VIRGINIA, THERE'S STILL A JAILHOUSE WITH HOME COOKING  </P> <P> At Lee and Terri Frederick's place, guests enjoy old-fashioned home cooking and  are greeted at breakfast with a friendly "Good morning."  </P> <P> They can watch television, play table tennis in the recreation room, use the  telephone or entertain visitors in the family garage.  </P> <P> Don't pack your bags for a weekend in the mountains yet. The Fredericks' place  is the Gilmer County Jail, one of the last of the "mom and pop" lockups.  </P> <P> It is an arrangement closer to "Mayberry R.F.D." than to Attica or San Quentin.  </P> <P> While the inmates dine on Terri Frederick's pasta, pizza or a meat entree in  their cells upstairs, the family is having the same downstairs.  </P> <P> "I just make extra for the guys upstairs," Terri Frederick said.  </P> <P> Every other Thursday, the couple pulls their 1986 Chrysler out of the garage  and sets up folding chairs so the inmates can entertain visitors.  </P> <P> The Fredericks' house rules are posted in the jail recreation room:  </P> <P> "Golden Rules: If you open it, close it. If you take it out, lock it up. If it  will brighten someone's day, SAY IT!"  </P> <P> The couple and their sons, Joey, 6, and Lynn, 2, live in the two-story,  three-bedroom brick house where the county has placed its detainees for 50  years. The house is atop a hill between the county courthouse and a Glenville  State College dormitory.  </P> <P> The rest of the neighborhood is made up of modest, single-family houses that  look a lot like the Fredericks' place, except they have no bars on the windows.  </P> <P> Lee Frederick, 29, is a former truck driver who took the job of jailer a year  ago. Terri, 27, lived in the house as a child while her parents ran the jail.  She does the cooking and cleaning.  </P> <P> In her spare time, she works as a dispatcher of sheriff's deputies, police,  ambulances and rescue crews. The living room also is the terminus of alarms  connected to Glenville's two banks.  </P> <P> Until recently, when a night jailer was hired, one of the Fredericks was always  on duty from 7 a.m. until midnight. After that, prisoners could summon Lee by  pushing a button on the elevator.  </P> <P> Wall-mounted loudspeakers allow Terri to hear calls when she is working in the  kitchen.  </P> <P> It's easy to know what's happening among the inmates because "we can hear them  right through the ceiling," she said.  </P> <P> Frederick said his sons are not allowed to go upstairs no matter how curious  they get.  </P> <P> "They'll find out about this stuff soon enough anyway," he said.  </P> <P> On an average day, the jail houses about nine people. The most common reasons  are drunk driving, destruction of property or game-law violations.  </P> <P> In the evenings, prisoners play table tennis or watch television in the  family-size recreation room. They have access to the telephone every night, but  long-distance calls are not allowed.  </P> <P> The homey touches aren't lost on the inmates.  </P> <P> "Lee treats me OK, and the food's all right, but I just don't like being in  jail," said Carson Yeager, 45, who described himself as a "chronic alcoholic."  </P> <P> Yeager is one of the Fredericks' regulars.  </P> <P> "The majority of ours are not hardened criminals," Frederick said. "They don't  need to be exposed to that type of people."  </P> <P> Some former inmates have even come back to say hello. A 21-year-old man now  incarcerated elsewhere has written the couple four letters in the last two  months.  </P> <P> Such rural "mom and pop" jails increasingly are being phased out because of  generally substandard conditions, high maintenance costs and a move toward  regional jails.  </P> <P> "They are a rapidly dying breed," said Michael O'Toole, chief of the jails  division of the National Institute of Corrections.  </P> <P> More than 19 million people spend time in one of 3,300 county jails each year,  according to U.S. Justice Department statistics.  </P> <P> "Small jails are not cost-effective," O'Toole said. "Although a lot are  well-meaning and well-intentioned, the conditions of confinement aren't what  they should be. A lot are just incapable of being up to standards.  </P> <P> "The operation rises and falls on the integrity of the operator. For each  example where somebody is fulfilling their responsibility, you can look at  another side of the ledger and see someone who shouldn't have any authority  over anybody in custody whatsoever."  </P> <P> Recently, the state Facilities Review Panel warned that it would shut down the  Fredericks' jail unless Gilmer County expanded its staff.  </P> <P> So Sheriff Kenneth Smith Jr. hired a jailer for the night shift and beefed up  the part-time staff so the Fredericks would not have to work more than 40 hours  a week. But that's not entirely good news for the family.  </P> <P> "It's cramped our personal lives a little bit, sure," Frederick said.  </P></p>

			<p>930104 FT  04 JAN 93 / International Company News: Several parties interested in Savoy stake - Negotiations expected to resume this week for 4.3% holding THE RECEIVERS handling the sale of a 4.3 per cent share in the Savoy Hotel group said yesterday that they had been approached by several interested parties and expected to resume negotiations this week. The sale of the shares, which belonged to the St Anselm Development Company, has added further spice to the future ownership of the Savoy group. Just over a month ago, the death of Sir Hugh Wontner, the group's president, sent Savoy shares sharply higher as speculation that the bitter courtship by the Forte group could be resumed. Sir Hugh had been vociferous in defence of a Forte takeover. Forte holds 69 per cent of Savoy's equity and 42.5 per cent of its voting shares. Under a 1989 peace accord, Forte agreed not to purchase any more shares until the end of 1994, and has repeatedly said it intends to stand by the deal, despite Sir Hugh's death and the St Anselm receiver-ship. A spokesman for Cork Gully, who were appointed receivers on Christmas Eve, said: 'We can confirm that the stake is available at the right price and that several parties have already expressed an interest.' At current market prices, the share package would fetch around Pounds 11m. Mr Giles Shepard, the Savoy's managing director, denied yesterday that he had been approached by any of the prospective purchasers. Weekend press speculation suggested contact had been made with the private financiers David and Frederick Barclay. But Mr Shepard said: 'The last time we spoke to them was 11 years ago when they offered to sell us the Howard hotel.' He added that he would be contacting the receivers this week to discuss the fate of the St Anselm stake. Sources close to the negotiations suggested that the National Westminster Bank, which holds the shares as security against loans made to St Anselm, may wish to sit on its stake in the hope of making money from any bid by Forte after 1994.</p>

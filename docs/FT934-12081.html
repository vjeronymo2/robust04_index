			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Letters to the Editor: The challenge of orderly decline Sir, Chris Lorenz, 'Struggling with the curse of success' (October 22), implies a company losing market position to an innovator has failed: companies should be nimble or iconoclastic enough to respond to new developments in their market place. I suggest that in some situations orderly decline is more appropriate than attempts to beat off an innovator. Take the development of the word processor. Should typewriter manufacturers have been nimble enough to compete in the word processor market? No. Their mechanical manufacturing skills were not suited to the electronic world. Orderly decline was the best strategy. The issue is not how to become nimble enough to respond to all innovations. It is judging which developments require nimbleness and which orderly decline - a judgment facing IBM's mainframe business today.

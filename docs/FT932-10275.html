			<p>930510 FT  10 MAY 93 / People: Academic to steer strategy for Clydesdale Bank Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based clearing bank which belongs to National Australia Bank, is bringing in outside blood and, it expects, new ideas with two appointments. They follow the arrival as ceo last year of Charles Love, formerly director of branch banking with TSB and ceo of TSB Bank Scotland. Catherine Smith, an academic authority on banking, has been appointed to the newly created post of head of strategic development, joining the executive management committee and reporting directly to Love. Holding a doctorate in economics from Glasgow University, she has been a consultant and conference speaker, advising clients in financial services in Europe and North America on strategy. Her reputation grew from a big study of computerisation in the Scottish clearing banks, followed up by a series of management books on banking technology and strategy, of which the most recent is entitled 'Tomorrow's success - profitable strategies from the finance industry'. Clydesdale hopes she will help it to become 'a little more visionary, not looking only at the day-to-day'. The bank has also appointed a new general manager of its finance division. He is Peter Aslett, who joins from British Petroleum where he was vice-president for finance and chief financial officer with Tex/Con Oil &amp; Gas in Houston Texas. Before that he worked for ICI both in the UK and the US. He succeeds the long serving Jim McNeillage who has left the bank, 'taking with him our very best wishes'.</p>

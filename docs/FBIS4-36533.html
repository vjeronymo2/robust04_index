			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres by </F> moderator Shlomo Ganor and political correspondent Eli Nisan on  9 June; on the weekly "Encounter" program -- recorded, in Hebrew  with Arabic subtitles; translated from the Hebrew]    [Text] [Ganor] Good evening, Mr. Minister. Mr. Peres,  upon the completion of the withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho,  would it be correct to say that we are at a crossroads in the  political process? How should we proceed and what path should we  take?    [Peres] I would only like to remind you that about nine or  10 months ago nobody believed that the Gaza-Jericho matter would  become a reality so quickly. After we reached the Oslo accord  it was stated that the accord would be very difficult to  implement in the area. We now have an agreement which was  implemented in the area. So far -- God willing, as they say --  matters are working better than what we thought.    [Ganor] Where do we stand?    [Peres] We should continue now. We have four arenas: the  Palestinian one--we should decide how to proceed on it; the  Jordanian; the Syrian; and the entire Middle East. I know I  have not mentioned Lebanon, but this is because I believe  Lebanon can be discussed in the Syrian context only.    [Nisan] Mr. Peres, has the performance of the Palestinian  Authority met the expectations from it so far?    [Peres] There were various expectations, but the majority  thought it would not work at all. Yesterday I saw people who  went through Jericho and said they simply could not believe  their eyes. The police were there and order prevailed, and the  same applies in Gaza. In my opinion, the main problem is an  economic one. If the laborers from the territories are prepared  to come here for work and knives are used for cutting bread  rather than stabbing people, the situation in Gaza and Jericho  can change at once.    [Ganor] This is in line with the World Bank demand that  Israel lift the closure and enable the laborers to come to  Israel for work, thus alleviating the economic distress. The  question is whether you will recommend to the government that  the closure be lifted.    [Peres] The closure is being lifted gradually and carefully.  After all, the closure is not an Israeli caprice. This is a  measure aimed at preventing the murder of people by laborers,  including those who have worked at the same work place for  years. If we realize that the opening of all gates to work does  not involve danger, they will certainly be opened wide.    [Nisan] Mr. Peres, you noted the economic problem. The  donor countries which pledged funds to the Palestinian Authority  are not funneling them. The question is what role Israel plays  here. Will Israel be willing to extend general and financial  aid to this authority?    [Peres] Not only will Israel will be willing to do so, but  it is doing so already. In fact, we paid about 20,000 wages in  May in Gaza, and reference is not only to Civil Administration  workers, but also to other work places, in order to relieve the  distress caused by unemployment. This month we supplied  medication for another three months. Licenses were issued to  more than 10,000 laborers to come work in Israel. If all the  other countries somewhat advance the implementation of their  cash commitments, Israel will do the same.    [Nisan] Is Israel exercising its influence and moral power  to get the European countries and international bodies to aid  the Palestinian Authority?    [Peres] Absolutely. Participating in the discussions by the  donor countries are the director general of the Foreign Ministry  together with the person in charge of the territories. We will  surely tell the donor countries what the practical needs are,  and why it is important to act quickly and not leave a vacuum  which can definitely endanger the implementation of the accord.    [Ganor] Mr. Peres, at a Labor faction meeting this week you  warned that if the momentum in the negotiations with the  Palestinians does not continue, the intifadah may erupt anew.  When do you intend to start the negotiations on early  empowerment for the Palestinians in Judaea and Samaria?    [Peres] I think all parties want to rest a little,  particularly from unnecessary speeches. Look, there were two  processes here. There was a practical process of introducing  basic changes on the ground, and a verbal process which angered  the entire world. We need the clouds of verbosity to disperse  so that the change in the area can be observed, at which time I  believe we will be able to resume the negotiations with the  Palestinians.    [Ganor] The clouds of verbosity come from the other party:  'Arafat's statements, for instance.    [Peres] Yes. He simply may not be aware of all the facts  or, alternatively, he made totally unnecessary remarks. In  Johannesburg he said, for example: Look, I am hesitant about  signing. I hesitated because I was not prepared to sign before  I received a letter on the Jerusalem issue. In Cairo he was not  given any letter on the Jerusalem issue. Our denial was true  and genuine. No negotiations over this took place in Cairo. We  did not know then that he was referring to Holst's letter.  Holst's letter was written much earlier. Cairo was not  necessary for that.    [Ganor] However, for all practical purposes, Mr. Peres,  you are already starting the Jerusalem segment of our program.  What is the attitude of Israeli officials in Jerusalem toward  the Palestinian declarations that East Jerusalem will ultimately  become the capital of the Palestinian state?    [Peres] We regard this as mere dreaming, not reality. Look,  we cannot forbid people to dream, we cannot stop people from  talking. However, in my opinion -- and we have also told the  Palestinians this -- we are very adamant about our position.  Jerusalem will not be redivided. It will not be a Berlin. We  shall establish neither barriers nor walls there. A city can  only be the capital of one country. One cannot have two  capitals in one city because that would mean a division of  Jerusalem. It is the historical capital of Israel and Israel's  capital today. We added that we have no intention of harming  the Palestinian residents of Jerusalem or their existing  institutions. In summation, I would say that in the political  sense, the issue of Jerusalem is closed and it will remain the  united capital of Israel, whereas from the religious aspect it  will remain an open, spiritual center for the three monotheistic  religions.    [Ganor] What should the Palestinians watching our program  understand from your reply?    [Peres] That everything is open from the religious aspect.  We will respect every sentiment, every prayer, and every  religious need. We will not sacrifice Jerusalem to radical  political plans. One should recall that throughout all of  history, Jerusalem was never an Arab capital and one should also  recall that the Jewish people never had any other capital but  Jerusalem.    [Ganor] Mr. Peres, which steps does the Israeli Government  intend to take in order to maintain the current status quo in  East Jerusalem and prevent it from being undermined by the other  side?    [Peres] We have made ourselves very clear. The Palestinian  Authority must handle autonomy-related affairs from Jericho. We  will not countenance any transfer of institutions from Jericho  to Jerusalem. This violates the agreement and the nature of  Jerusalem.    [Ganor] Are we talking about legislative steps, orders, or  limitations on some people who are members of the Palestinian  Authority in order to prevent them from establishing  representations in Jerusalem?    [Peres] If people uphold the law, then no other laws will be  necessary. The existing laws are sufficient. First, we expect  them to uphold the existing laws. For example, there is no room  for Palestinian police in East Jerusalem. There is only one  police force, one army, and one government. Educational,  religious, and medical institutions, on the other hand, could  definitely be permitted.    [Ganor] But these were not the institutions the government  was referring to when it said it would enact legislation to  prevent any changes to the status quo in East Jerusalem.    [Peres] We are now looking into the issue. If the status  quo has been broken, which is apparently the case here and  there, we will examine whether these breaches can be rectified  through existing laws or whether additional legislation is  called for. The issue is still not clear. It may very well be  that any deviations from the law may be rectified through the  use of existing legislation and no new laws are necessary.    [Ganor] Mr. Peres, the issue of Jerusalem, at least  according to the reports, was the main bone of contention. Two  days before the signing of the Oslo agreement, 'Arafat almost  refused to sign.    [Peres] One day before, yes.    [Ganor] A day before. What happened? How was 'Arafat  persuaded that he could concede on the issue of Jerusalem?    [Peres] Look, from the very beginning we said that we were  offering the Gaza Strip plus Jericho. This, in order to  establish the administrative institutions of the Palestinian  autonomy in Jericho. We said that on no account would we ever  agree to the establishment of these institutions in Jerusalem.  On that dramatic night in Stockholm when we were constantly on  the telephone with Tunisia, I explained very forcefully to them  that it was either Jericho or no agreement. That was their  choice. On the other hand, we stated what I am saying now as  well. All the existing insitutions in Jerusalem will be  preserved. We have no intention of harming people or  institutions. We do not wish to offend their dignity or  sensitivities either. I made a clear promise to that effect.    [Ganor] Does raising the Jerusalem issue at this stage not  expedite the discussion of the permanent arrangement?    [Peres] No, not at all. Whoever proposes discussing the  permanent arrangement now is actually perpetualizing the  conflict. Let us say we start discussions on the permanent  arrangement and they raise the issue of Jerusalem. I cannot see  where an agreement can provide a solution with regard to the  issue of Jerusalem, certainly not today. If you want to  highlight the fact that we cannot reach agreement then this is  possible. But what is the point? I would like to say that  today the problem is more one of relations than borders. Some  people think that if we demarcate borders then relations will  improve. I think that if we establish a new relationship then  we will be able to demarcate the future borders. Let us take  the example of Hebron. There are 120,000 Arabs and 500 Jews in  Hebron. Would this be a problem if relations were good? In  Ma'alot Tarshiha there are both Jewish and Arab communities. Is  there any problem there? Are there any problems in Yafo or in  Haifa? Arabs and Jews can therefore live together when they  have a different relationship. What we all should be doing now  is improving relations so that neither side is afraid of the  other. Therefore, we should also watch what we are saying.  Today, people want barriers and barbed wire fences. That is no  way to live or to maintain peace. We need understandings and we  need to prove that human beings can live together even if they  belong to different peoples.    [Ganor] Mr. Peres, with regard to your letter to the  Norwegian foreign minister, some people say that the very fact  that a letter was sent to the PLO grants the PLO a position of  patronage and preeminence in East Jerusalem at the expense of  other Islamic and Christian elements.    [Peres] First, the PLO is not mentioned in my letter. The  word PLO is not mentioned. That is the reason I wrote it to the  late Norwegian Foreign Minister Holst and not to 'Arafat,  although the contents of the letter are not secret and can be  made known to everyone. This is to demonstrate that the  Jerusalem issue had not been decided, let us say, in favor of  'Arafat. Nothing of the sort was decided. We know that the  Jordanians are sensitive about the Waqf. We will not take any  religious authorities from Jordan and give them to another  party. We have no intention of changing the status quo to the  benefit or the detriment of anybody. We will neither intervene  nor meddle in inter-Arab relations.    [Ganor] In order to end the chapter on Jerusalem, which will  certainly be discussed further in the future, let me ask you if  the Israeli Government will accede to Yasir 'Arafat's request to  visit Jerusalem if he indeed submits such a request?    [Peres] Leave something for a future interview. Why should  we answer all the questions now? No such request has been  submitted and I therefore cannot give you an answer.    [Ganor] But in principle?    [Peres] We will discuss the matter in principle when it is  put to the test.    [Ganor] With your permission sir, let us move on to Jordan,  the second topic of discussion we posited at the beginning of  our program. Can the understandings reached during this week's  talks in Washington between Jordan and Israel be viewed as an  opening toward the reaching of a peace treaty between the two  countries?    [Peres] Definitely. I think that significant progress has  been made although obstacles can still be raised. After all,  any child can see the necessity of peace with Jordan. The  possibility of reaching this peace is also evident. One does  not need a telescope to see this as well as the fact that the  time has come and that both the Jordanians and the Israelis will  greatly benefit from peace. The entire Syrian-African Rift --  and I keep on saying this -- between Lake Tiberias and Elat,  instead of being a wasteland of hatred and separation can become  a fertile valley supplying jobs to thousands of workers from  both sides of the Jordan River, both Jordanians and Israelis.  We can attract hundreds of millions of dollars in investments  for water desalination plants, tourism ventures, agriculture.  There are extraordinary plans and companies are interested in  investing. I heard the Jordanian information minister say that  Jordan would not miss the train. We feared that the Syrians  were holding them back. If the Syrians do not hold them back  then there are no hindrances to Jordanian-Israeli relations. I  keep on saying this. We told the Jordanians that we can discuss  borders and water issues if they are serious about peace. If  they seriously intend to reach peace then the time has come to  do what is necessary for the benefit of both peoples and peace.    [Ganor] Mr. Peres, in light of your remarks and in light of  the agreements and understandings reached with the Jordanians  this week at the committees and economic talks, do you expect  Jordan and Israel to sign a peace treaty in the coming year?    [Peres] I do not want to commit myself to dates. I do not  expect anything; I merely act. I cannot tell you what will  happen. Things do not happen by themselves. As a representative  of the Israeli public and a cabinet minister, I can state that  we have to act continuously and resolutely to release the  citizens of both Jordan and Israel from this artificial state of  war. There is no need or foundation for this. It is a total  waste of time. The sooner we achieve it, the greater service we  will have done our peoples, and it is a pity that things have  been put off for so long.    [Ganor] If not peace, do you anticipate at least a  normalization in relations with Jordan in the near future?    [Peres] The difference between normal relations and peace is  not great. Peace means normalization. What else is  normalization? But you know, I am a practical man and we must  welcome everything that promotes peace.    [Ganor] What is behind Amman's dramatic change over the last  week? Was it a green light from Damascus?    [Peres] I cannot tell you. I was not at the meeting between  President al-Asad and King Husayn. They may also have concluded  that progress is possible and each party should act  independently. One must also take into account the  implementation of the agreement with the PLO on the Gaza Strip  and Jericho. There is also something that I have been saying  all the time: we are a three-sided triangle. No side should  act against the others. It is better that we work together as a  triangle, at least in the economic sense. On numerous occasions  I proposed that we cooperate together on economic issues in a  Benelux-style arrangement, that is, economic cooperation between  three countries. Politically, we should act as two separate  entities: a Palestinian-Jordanian entity and an Israeli entity.    [Ganor] But Jordan rejected your idea to host an  international economic conference in Amman?    [Peres] Jordan says that it rejected the proposed date, not  the idea itself. Now Jordan has announced that it has adopted  my conference proposal but at a later date. The Jordanians  claimed that if the conference was held before progress in the  negotiations then the world would get the impression that Jordan  could be bought with a conference. Some kind of payoff. I do  not subscribe to this view. I think that this conference was  not held with the intention of buying off anyone but rather to  build things. I think that such a conference would have  facilitated, not held up, the negotiations.    [Ganor] Would it not compete with the conference that you  and King Hassan last Friday agreed to hold in Morocco?    [Peres] Yes, it is now understood that the second  international conference--if such a conference is indeed held in  Jordan--will take place at the beginning of 1995. The  conference in Morocco is scheduled for the end of October or the  beginning of November. After a year, or nine months, it can be  continued in Jordan.    [Ganor] Still, Saudi Arabia is creating obstacles to the  entire issue of lifting the anti-Israel boycott.    [Peres] Saudi Arabia is beginning to be problematic. We  still remember how Saudi Ambassador to the United States Bandar  arrived in New York to meet with Jews, to tell them that Saudi  Arabia is peace-oriented, that if settlements cease and the  Palestinians are recognized, then certain things will follow.  To my great regret, a delay occurred in, say, Saudi support for  peace. At the meeting of the working group in Qatar recently,  on arms control -- on supervising the level of armament and on  disarmament -- the Saudis were totally negative.    [Ganor] Did Israel or the United States chastise the Saudis  about this?    [Peres] What do you mean by chastising? We say this to the  Americans too. The Saudis may be angry at the Gulf emirates  which do not abide by the Arab Peninsula's discipline and the  like, but it is very difficult for us to decipher Saudi Arabia's  conduct. Saudi Arabia needs to decide whether it wants or  opposes peace. If it opposes peace, we will reach our  conclusions. It is not us who threatens Saudi Arabia. Saudi  Arabia knows precisely who threatens it. In general, many Arab  countries know that if there is any threat, it emanates from  Teheran, not from Jerusalem. If Saudi Arabia wants chaos in the  Middle East, of continued wars, of a continued arms race, it can  surely conduct a negative policy, but it is about time it  decides where it is heading.    [Ganor] Mr. Peres, what do you learn from the Syrian  position about its readiness to break the deadlock on the  Israeli-Syrian track? Is there a change in the Syrian position  on the eve of Warren Christopher's possible arrival in the  region this month?    [Peres] I would not say that a breakthrough has been  achieved yet. Look, if Syria truly wants a normalization of  relations, it should start with normalization in contacts.  Again, desiring high-level meetings, of heads of state or  ministers, is not an Israeli caprice. The point is that our  people are very skeptical about what Syria truly wants. Nobody  doubts that Syria wants the Golan Heights back, but is Syria  truly prepared to go for acceptable security arrangements? Is  Syria truly prepared to give peace without tricks, without  additions or deletions? There is a doubt here, and it is  incumbent on the Syrian leaders to appear publicly and openly in  the negotiations with us so as to reach results.    Let me tell you, the negotiations we held with the PLO were  very difficult. They were difficult both for them and for us.  Take that night in Cairo, for example: The Israeli delegation  -- the prime minister, the foreign minister, army people, and  others -- was convened in one room; the 'Arafat-led PLO  delegation sat in a second room; and President Mubarak, 'Amr  Musa, Warren Christopher and his aides, sat in a third room. It  was possible then to move from one room to another and smooth  things out, surmount obstacles, and come up with creative  solutions at moments of crisis, and it was that night which  enabled the negotiations to emerge from their infancy and assume  adulthood. It is impossible to conduct negotiations by  exchanging formal opinions constantly. After all, formally  speaking, we do not have an agreement: We and they want  different things, so how are the differences bridged? They are  first bridged through meetings and negotiations by those who are  allowed to put up the bridge. In my opinion then, there are two  types of discussions. There is a discussion on contents, and  there is a discussion on method [last word in English]. It is  the method at least which should be changed. If one wants a  normalization in relations, one needs a normalization in  contacts, in negotiations.    [Ganor] Over the past two weeks, since the secretary of  State's visit to the region, was there a short circuit between  Jerusalem and Damascus, or has Washington engaged in contacts  through diplomatic channels in an attempt to build the bridge  you are discussing?    [Peres] I believe that Washington constantly tries to  establish a bridgehead, on the Syrian side as well as on ours,  and I think it is this which decides the date of Christopher's  visits to the region. In other words, he wants to come when he  has enough cement in his hand to start building some bridgehead.    [Ganor] Does he have cement in his hand then?    [Peres] Not enough, in my opinion.    [Ganor] Have U.S. proposals been conveyed to both sides over  the last two weeks?    [Peres] No, I do not think so. Nor do I think the Americans  want to act this way. They are very cautious. They do not want  to appear as people who impose their opinion on others.    [Ganor] Do you expect the United States to increase its  involvement, perhaps in the future, if no solution is found on  the Syrian-Israeli track?    [Peres] I believe in the sincerity and seriousness of the  United States. I really believe that just like Israel it seeks  a comprehensive peace in the Middle East. Therefore, Washington  will not cease its efforts. The frequency of these contacts and  of the shuttle diplomacy also depend on the reactions of both  sides.    [Ganor] Are the gaps between the positions of both sides  still large?    [Peres] There is still a gap between the positions of both  sides in all three domains.    [Ganor] Nevertheless, the Jordanian prime minister was this  week quoted as saying that Syria and Israel had reached an  understanding in principle and the only things left open were  the period over which the withdrawal would stretch and the  abrogation of the Golan Law. You know Dr. al-Majali. Are you  prepared to comment on this?    [Peres] Look, it is apparently easier for every prime  minister to be optimistic with regard to other countries. Let  us concentrate on the Jordanian track in the negotiations with  Jordan and on Syria with the Syrians.    [Ganor] What can we expect from the secretary of State's  impending visit?    [Peres] The continuation of the attempts to lay a bridgehead  between the two parties.    [Ganor] You do not like predicting dates, but you always  said that the window of opportunity was either closing or  opening. Can we expect a breakthrough in the negotiations with  Syria in 1994?    [Peres] I said that the window of opportunity was about to  close with regard to the dates. I never gave dates for windows  to open. Let me explain what I mean by this. Elections are  scheduled to be held in Israel in November 1996. One can assume  that the country will be in an uproar one year ahead of that,  primaries and arguments, and the Norwegian Law [reference to a  law stipulating that cabinet ministers lose their Knesset seats  in order to permit their faction to increase its size]. We are  already in the middle of 1994, with the grace of God.  Politically speaking, we have one year or 15 months to operate  at the most. Everyone can see that and that is the window of  opportunity that is closing. The possibility to take political  action without running smack into pre-election turmoil. Now, I  believe that within that period it is possible, but I cannot  promise that it will happen, to move on to a second stage in the  negotiations with the Palestinians and make significant progress  in the negotiations with Jordan, which are crucial in my view.  If there is a breakthrough with Syria, I will be very pleased.    [Ganor] Let us end our program on this optimistic note.  Thank you for being with us, Mr. Foreign Minister.</p>

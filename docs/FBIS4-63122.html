			<p>BFN     [Text] Cheboksary, May 18, RIA -- Russia starts to  dismantle production facilities capable of manufacturing  chemical weapons, said Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets after  visiting the Khimprom amalgamation in Chuvashia formerly  cranking out chemical munitions.    The factory stopped producing chemical weapons in 1987, but  the production facilities stood in place and could be  re-activated when needed.    Oleg Soskovets and Chuvashian President Nikolay Fedorov  decided to compile a schedule, before September 1, 1994, of  phasing out chemical-capable production facilities.</p>

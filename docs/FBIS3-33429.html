Only three  persons survived the 20 February wreck of a ship carrying  between 20 and 40 Haitians, according to U.S. authorities. Five  bodies, including those of a woman and four children, have been  recovered.    In a communique, President Aristide, who is in exile in  Washington, called on the international community once again to  reinforce the sanctions against Haiti to compel the military to  leave power. The sanctions are necessary and should have been  applied a long time ago, the Haitian president wrote. Those who  are supporting democracy in Haiti should show firmness, asserted  President Aristide, adding that the authors of the coup d'etat  must not be rewarded for barbarous actions.</p>

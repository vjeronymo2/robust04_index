This was announced this morning by Argentine Foreign  Minister  Guido Di Tella following the meeting among Presidents Carlos  Menem, Juan Carlos Wasmosy, and Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada in the  Mirador Hotel.    Taking the opportunity of the presence of the Bolivian  president, the Argentine and Paraguayan presidents invited him  to help them find solutions for the Pilcomayo problems.    Di Tella said that these floods cause considerable  ecological  damage. He added that in order to solve these problems the three  countries will seek financing from international financial  institutions.    The Argentine minister said that during 1994 Argentina and  Paraguay will try to solve the problems created by this river  exclusively in their countries, but in 1995 the works and  studies will have to be carried out jointly among the three  countries.    Argentina and Paraguay last year had serious incidents as a  result of the poor construction of two relief channels on both  sides of the river in Formosa Province.    The issue was solved when the two governments decided to  leave aside these faulty channels and to begin new works to  solve the problem of the floods.</p>

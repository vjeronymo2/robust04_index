			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of the Armenian </F> Democratic Liberal Party, by Karen Topchyan in Yerevan; date not  given: "Armenia: Civil War Would Be Catastrophe"]    [Text] Many observers describe the political situation in  Armenia as quite calm. Is that right? Your ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA  correspondent's conversation with Ruben Mirzakhanyan, leader of  one of Armenia's most influential opposition parties,  Ramkavar-Azatakan (the Democratic Liberal Party), began with  this question.    [Mirzakhanyan] I think that it is nonetheless only apparent  calm. But one thing is indisputable: There has been a drastic  decline in protest activity of late.    [Topchyan] The president promised that a new constitution  would be adopted this year.    [Mirzakhanyan] I believe that the country's new fundamental  law will be adopted within the year, and this means new  parliamentary and presidential elections.    [Topchyan] Armenia is virtually the only republic in the  former Union where the parliament has been operating  successfully for four years now and Levon Ter-Petrosyan, who has  been the state's leader for as many years, is clearly not  thinking of retiring.    [Mirzakhanyan] I think that this is due to three factors:  First, the militarily favorable development of events in  Karabakh. Since early 1992 the Armenians have held the  initiative in the Karabakh-Azerbaijani war. Imagine if the  picture had been different. The second factor is that Armenia's  leader, unlike the representatives of the new political wave in  certain other independent states that were once USSR republics,  is more restrained in both domestic and foreign policy. Third,  for various reasons Armenia's parliament has not in its  four-year activity been a major adversary of the executive, the  president included.    [Topchyan] How are events in Russia affecting life in  Armenia?    [Mirzakhanyan] Very directly. That is quite natural, since  we are all heirs to the same political traditions.    [Topchyan] Do you not think it rather phenomenal that  effectively all the political forces in Armenia unequivocally  favor alliance-partnership relations with Russia?    [Mirzakhanyan] It would be incredibly hard for Armenia to  build its future without close partnership relations with Russia.    [Topchyan] What is your forecast regarding the probable  development of political events in Armenia?    [Mirzakhanyan] It depends directly on the changes under way  in Moscow. If there are many unknown quantities in Russia's  future, the same can be said about the future of Armenia.</p>

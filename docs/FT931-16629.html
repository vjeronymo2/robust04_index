			<p>930106 FT  06 JAN 93 / Emu holds key to freedom for central banks MOVES by EC states towards giving independence over monetary policy and the setting of interest rates to their respective central banks are to a large extent governed by their enthusiasm for economic and monetary union (Emu). Under the Maastricht treaty, stage two on the road to a single European currency requires EC members to give monetary independence to their central banks, prior to the establishment of an autonomous European Central Bank at stage three. Prior to the cross-party commitment in France to give monetary autonomy to the Bank of France, Spain was the latest country to make a commitment to give its central bank independence. At the moment, interest rates are fixed by the Bank of Spain on receipt of instructions from the Finance Ministry. However, the Spanish cabinet last week approved a draft statute transferring control of monetary policy to the Bank of Spain. The Spanish government proposal uses the German Bundesbank as a model. Within the EC, only the Bundesbank has its complete independence enshrined in law. Even in the Netherlands, whose central bank is widely regarded as independent, the Ministry of Finance can issue guidance on interest rates to the central bank. Another country which has recently taken steps to increase the power of its central bank is Italy. A year ago the Italian government took the decision to give the central bank powers to set its discount rate, which is the rate charged by the central bank in its dealings with commercial banks and serves as a benchmark of other rates. Meanwhile, Portugal in 1990 gave its central bank the right to collaborate in the setting of monetary policy. Till then, the central bank had been completely submissive to the government's wishes. In a number of countries, the elected governments have little power to set interest rates in practice, even if in theory the power rests with them. These are the countries whose currencies shadow the D-Mark very closely within the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). Thus in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark, interest rates are in effect determined by the Bundesbank, even though in both Belgium and Denmark monetary powers rest explicitly with their respective finance ministries. The one EC country which is now out of step, following France's move, is the UK. The 1946 Bank of England Act gives the UK Treasury the power to issue interest rate directives to the bank. Though the Treasury has never issued a formal directive, the government nonetheless sets UK interest rates, though it consults the bank. The Bank of England has traditionally exercised more or less influence over UK monetary policy depending on the respective personalities of the bank governor and the chancellor of the exchequer and the relationship between the two. Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the current governor due to retire in June, has lobbied vigorously, but in vain, for bank independence. The Bank of England has, however, recently won a new power to criticise the government if it believes it is not taking effective measures to combat inflation. Any move to give the Bank of England full independent monetary powers will probably be deferred till after parliament has voted to ratify the Maastricht treaty.</p>

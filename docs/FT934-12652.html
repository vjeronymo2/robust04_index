			<p>931026 FT  26 OCT 93 / Booker Prize faces union protest TODAY'S Booker Prize ceremony faces a demonstration from several dozen women mushroom pickers, dressed as plantation slaves, who have been dismissed by a Booker subsidiary after a dispute over overtime payments. The women's union, the TGWU general union, hopes to embarrass the company by connecting its treatment of the women in North Yorkshire with its origins in the Caribbean slave trade. Booker yesterday strongly denied the charges and pointed out that the part-time women workers had lost an unfair dismissal case at an industrial tribunal in Leeds and were not appealing against the decision. The dispute began when the company's loss-making Middlebrook Mushrooms subsidiary proposed to reduce overtime pay for weekend working after several supermarket chains said they required permanent seven-day deliveries. Middlebrook reached agreement at all of its farms except Whitley Bridge where, after several months of negotiation, it imposed the new terms and sacked the 89 employees who would not accept them. The union says it was happy to negotiate about reducing the overtime payments but could not accept the breaking of agreements. Booker says the company, facing intense competition, acted to safeguard its future. It says basic wages at Middlebrook are one-third above local rates for similar work. The company feels vulnerable to the adverse publicity associated with the dispute, and last week it offered to donate Pounds 50,000 to the union as a gesture to help alleviate hardship in an area badly hit by the recession. The offer was rejected. The TGWU says two of the six book authors on the Booker short-list have expressed concern about the dispute. The women will hope to add to that number outside London's Guildhall tonight, where they will be handing out copies of Our Bitter Harvest, their book about the dispute.</p>

			<p><P> October 17, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: WOODY WOOING A NEW MUSE WITH 'CRIMES'  </P> <P> The tombstone-style ad Woody Allen has decreed for his new film "Crimes and  Misdemeanors" is startling in its lack of startle. No pulsating quotes, no  searing ad line, no pretty faces, no drawn gun, no bared bosom; just the title  in large letters adrift in a sea of white space, with the cast and crew in much  smaller type and Allen's name nestled inconspicuously among the other players.  </P> <P> A drawn gun and several bared bosoms are implicit although not revealed in the  film's contents, and ad lines of incendiary power would be possible ("When Love  Dies . . . The Hard Way," and so on).  </P> <P> The ad may (or may not) be a distributor's nightmare. Despite his critical  reputation, Allen has never been a consistently big box-office attraction. The  ad can also be variously interpreted as one man's modesty and his earnest  rebellion against customary hype, or it can be viewed as a kind of inverted  arrogance that says Allen's work does not require the hard sell.  </P> <P> The truth is that the ad will probably work as well as and conceivably better  than another kind of ad would have. Word of mouth sells or kills most films,  and Allen has a hard-core following which amplifies word of mouth when Allen is  on form.  </P> <P> And the fact is that "Crimes and Misdemeanors" reaffirms Allen's status as the  most persistently personal, original and provocative of all U.S. film makers.  It is one of his best films.  </P> <P> As has been said about Ken Russell and a few other obstreperously  individualistic creators, Allen's less successful films are more interesting  than most directors' smooth triumphs. "Interiors," "September" and "Another  Woman" may have fizzled at the box office, but in their examination of  characters and relationships and in their capturing of moods and environments  they can't accurately be called failures.  </P> <P> In "Crimes and Misdemeanors," as Michael Wilmington pointed out in an eloquent  review last week, Allen has done what many of his fainter-hearted admirers have  beseeched him to do, which is leaven the serious stuff with a few good jokes.  </P> <P> There is a sizable cargo of laughs in "Crimes and Misdemeanors," some of them  Allen's sardonic one-liners as a failed documentary-maker, scorned husband and  rejected lover. More of them derive from the character Allen created for Alan  Alda to play (dazzlingly well) as a lecherous, overbearing, egocentric producer  of television comedy. Alda will call to mind, at least in the industry, all or  part of several real life models.  </P> <P> What is noteworthy about the humor, which leavens the whole piece, is that it  exists within Allen's darkest film yet.  </P> <P> His pessimism has seemed real enough in several of the films. The characters he  has played have often as not lost the girl. Like Chaplin's Tramp, the  collective Woody has gone on alone, with a wry joke instead of a strut.  </P> <P> The disappointments Allen rendered on Mia Farrow in "Purple Rose of Cairo,"  masked only slightly by his technically ingenious homage to the movies as our  principal source of solace, were bitterly cruel.  </P> <P> Allen's pessimism lifted measurably in "Hannah and Her Sisters," which glowed  with an uncommon family warmth. Yet much of the warmth began, or flowed from,  an acceptance of the world as it is and a setting-aside of the infidelities,  the estrangements, the disappointments and betrayals of the past. Ripeness, and  forgiveness, were all.  </P> <P> In "Crimes and Misdemeanors" -- the echoing parallel to the Ingmar Bergman  title "Cries and Whispers" is intriguingly close -- Allen seems to take the  idea of ripeness, of a philosophical acceptance of reality, even further than  before.  </P> <P> The film maker Allen plays is making a documentary on a German-Jewish  philosopher. With his thick accent, the philosopher can be taken as a parody of  an academic type. He is also a comment on the film maker's unworldliness. On  the evidence, PBS would be hesitant to show the documentary at midnight, even  if they could get it for nothing.  </P> <P> But the philosopher is saying desperately coherent things, depicting the  universe as cold, indifferent and mechanistic, warmed only by such efforts as  human beings make to create warmth within it.  </P> <P> The documentary is left unfinished because the philosopher has evidently found  the efforts to warm the universe unavailing. The documentary sequence is played  off against Allen's growing infatuation with the production assistant played by  Mia Farrow. It is not unlike a magician's use of indirection, making you  realize only later what was really going on.  </P> <P> As reviews have noted, "Crimes and Misdemeanors" is the most melodramatic of  Allen's films: Martin Landau, in another superb performance, conspiring with  his brother Jerry Ohrbach in the murder of a discarded mistress who is making  trouble.  </P> <P> In this movie Allen is wrestling with a lot of major stuff, love and the death  of love, guilt and punishment (if any), and, embracing all else, the question  of the existence and nature of God.  </P> <P> It's hard to think of another film maker who could give us a Seder table  argument about an all-seeing God (insisted upon by Allen's devout father)  against a cynical worldly pragmatism voiced by an atheistic aunt.  </P> <P> Ingmar Bergman has often dealt with faith and the death of faith, the pains of  spiritual aridity, but never a laugh in a carload, though affecting in other  ways.  </P> <P> Allen's film is first and last an entertainment with all the appurtenances  thereof -- humor, suspense, drama, conflict. It also offers reverberations that  won't die down, and speculations about living in a world with and without the  consoling, chiding idea of God.  </P> <P> Allen has come a long way from humor for its own sake to humor as the carrier  of some very somber thoughts.  </P></p>

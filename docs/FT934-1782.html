			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Red tape on sick pay to be studied The government has agreed to examine how it can best reduce the red tape for employers in the administration of the Statutory Sick Pay scheme, Lisa Wood writes. Business organisations including the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors have expressed concern about the proposed cut in statutory sick pay subsidy to employers. The bill passed through its Commons stages on Wednesday. In future large companies, which can now claim back 80 per cent of statutory sick pay after six weeks of employee absence will not be able to do so. Smaller companies which can claim 80 per cent after six weeks will be able to claim 100 per cent after four weeks.</p>

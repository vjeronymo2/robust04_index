			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Gold A true contrarian might buy gold at the moment. The price wanders between its unchanging tramlines, redundancies have carried off nearly all the City's gold analysts and now even an Oppenheimer has admitted that it is, to put it mildly, an uninspiring store of wealth. It is true that Mr Nicholas Oppenheimer's annual Amgold homily finds some comfort in the stability of the Dollars 350 floor. This is about the level where mines would close in large numbers, so the resistance does suggest that hoarded bars are still quite stably held. He also claims that producers have sold forward so heavily in every recent rally that they have no production left to mortgage. But this thought is hardly newly minted, as he implicitly admits when he falls back on the obvious: get people to wear more. Easier said than done. Some mines are already finding that the Dollars 2-an-ounce promotion levy is more than their margins will bear, and the rest are split between a high-class De Beers approach and something nearer the Gerald Ratner style. De Beers achieves class, but Ratner moves the tonnage - sometimes in throwaway form, the miner's real dream.</p>

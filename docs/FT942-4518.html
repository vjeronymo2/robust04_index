			<p>940609 FT  09 JUN 94 / Andersen ascends the UK accountancy ladder: Annual fee income and the rise and rise of a humble junior There is one clear trend that stands out in the annual fee income results of the UK's largest accountancy firms published this week: the ascendancy of Andersen. Two years ago, Andersen - comprising Arthur Andersen and Andersen Consulting  -was a humble junior, a clear number six among the 'Big Six' firms with income of Pounds 331m. In its latest results for the year to March 31 it has jumped to number three at Pounds 434m. The leap up the league table is nothing new. Ten years ago Andersen was merely the ninth largest firm in the UK. While most of its rivals have reported absolute declines or modest growth during the recessionary last three years, it has continued to report double-digit increases. At the other end of the scale, the latest fee income figures do not look impressive for Touche Ross. Ernst &amp; Young was edged down to fourth place by Andersen, in turn pushing down Price Waterhouse to fifth. Both reported modest growth. But Touche did more than simply slide down because of pressure from above. It reported an absolute decline in fee income of 0.8 per cent to Pounds 333m. The result says much about the end of the counter-cyclical income the firms have generated from insolvency work during the recession. In the briefest of the statements from the six firms when they published their results on Monday, Mr John Roques, Touche's senior partner, said simply: 'I am pleased that we have approximately maintained revenues during the last year.' Mr George Westropp, a partner with the firm, says the decline is a readjustment following the enormous growth generated by a number of insolvency assignments: notably the administration of Polly Peck International and the liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International. The big fees on these jobs have now ended, and there is little prospect of anything filling the gaps. 'BCCI was the largest professional assignment anywhere in the world ever,' he says. The most recent report last month showed it had generated Pounds 120m for Touche, much of which was not shown as insolvency income but spread across its accounting and consulting divisions. Of course, what the fee income figures leave unanswered is the underlying profitability of the firms. At a dinner for finance directors hosted by Arthur Andersen last month, one guest got short shrift when he suggested that as a purchaser interested in the health of his suppliers, he should be able to examine the firm's accounts. The response from the Andersen partner - echoed by all his counterparts at the other firms - was that accountancy practices are partnerships, and are therefore not bound by the legal requirements of companies to make this information public. So while Touche Ross may seem to have suffered on its top line, the bottom line may well remain healthy. Certainly the firm has cut overheads substantially, and its revenues per partner place it second in the league after Andersen at Pounds 973,000. 'Profits are consistent,' is all Mr Westropp will say. However, in a profession dominated by firms with their origins in the UK, Andersen has achieved a remarkable feat. It was a usurper, founded in 1913 in Chicago by a former Price Waterhouse trainee. It began from scratch in the UK only in 1956. Much of its more recent growth has been on the back of Andersen Consulting, the firm's computer services and facilities management arm. That has led to sniping from some rival firms, which claim Andersen is in a different market, invalidating comparisons of the figures. 'Methinks they protest too much,' says Mr Keith Burgess, head of Andersen's consulting arm. 'We are in the business of providing professional services to our clients. Anybody who believes that what firms delivered 50 years ago is still right today may help explain one of the reasons for UK's economic decline.' One thing seems certain: Andersen's UK ambitious are not yet complete. The firm is currently in negotiations with most of the regional partnerships within BDO Binder Hamlyn, the eighth largest firm, for a merger to be ratified in July. Adding in that income, Andersen is likely to become number two next year.</p>

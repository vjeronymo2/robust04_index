			<p>930901 FT  01 SEP 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charges behind Bellwinch turnround A Pounds 427,000 cut in interest charges to Pounds 168,000 enabled Bellwinch, the Wembley-based builder, to edge back into the black at the pre-tax level for the year to end-June, writes John Murrell. Profits worked through at Pounds 28,000 and compared with a deficit of Pounds 98,000. The outcome also took account of an exceptional debit of Pounds 133,000 relating to costs of the recent placing and open offer. Turnover fell from Pounds 23m to Pounds 15.7m - the comparative figure included land sales. Earnings per share were unchanged at 0.2p. Since the early part of 1993 directors noted a 'marked improvement' in the number of both site visitors and net reservations. They pointed out, however, that the recovery in the market had 'visibly slowed in recent weeks, with purchaser confidence being eroded by speculation on personal taxation and other economic issues'. Nonetheless, they said there was a 'continuing demand' for new homes and provided there was stability in interest rates and 'clearly defined economic policies' they looked for improvements in both the level of output and margins over the next year or so. It was pointed out that without the benefits of the funds from the placing and open offer, effected in June, borrowings would have been Pounds 900,000, representing gearing of 23 per cent. The inflow from the issue of new shares, which will be used to replenish land stocks and support growth plans, raised the company's net asset base to Pounds 10.5m and created a cash at bank position of Pounds 5.7m at June 30.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The hearing allowed under the proposed rules would provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents with several options in presenting relevant evidence,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited by the authority of the Presiding Officer to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the manner of testimony that is most efficient in resolving an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issue. Written and oral testimony are both acceptable, as well  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as testimony provided by other means. Respondents may offer any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facts, statements, explanations, documents, testimony or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exculpatory evidence that is relevant to issues at the hearing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A right of cross-examination is provided, although EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considering limiting cross-examination to situations determined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate by the Presiding Officer. This form of hearing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clearly meets the requirements of section 113(d)(3), and provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents with a fair opportunity to present evidence and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> argument on relevant issues. Given the simple and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> straightforward nature of the minor violations expected in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program, additional procedures would not significantly reduce the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of an erroneous imposition of a civil penalty. A right to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cross-examine witnesses, as compared to limiting cross  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> examination to situations where deemed appropriate by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer, would allow for additional cross-examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> only where the Presiding Officer, a neutral official, had already  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined it was inappropriate. A right to cross-examination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would increase the accuracy of the hearing only in those limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases where a Presiding Officer had mistakenly denied crossexamination. EPA expects this kind of mistake would occur  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> infrequently, and a right to cross-examine, therefore, would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significantly increase the accuracy of the proceedings in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> great bulk of cases.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Presiding Officer is afforded substantial discretion to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tailor the hearing procedures to the individual facts and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumstances of each case. The Presiding Officer, may, for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> example, hold prehearing conferences, regulate the course of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing, including the form and extent of testimony and crossexamination, take official notice of matters, and request a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> written statement from the parties post-hearing. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> flexibility should increase the accuracy of the proceedings, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduce the value of mandating additional procedures. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Chemical Waste Management, 873 F.2d at 1483.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> After the hearing, parties may submit written statements to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Presiding Officer, such as recommended findings of fact and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conclusions of law, at the discretion of the Presiding Officer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Presiding Officer then prepares and transmits a recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision that is forwarded to the Regional Administrator for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issuance of a final decision. There is no administrative appeal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the Administrator, except the Board may review a decision sua  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sponte. This provides for at least one level of review above the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Presiding Officer, and in some cases a second level of review by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board, establishing a clear mechanism to correct potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> errors in the recommended decision. It should also promote  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consistency within a region, as well as national consistency if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and when issues of national importance arise. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Given the minor nature of the violations at issue, EPA rarely expects review by the Board.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional procedures, such as a right to comment on the recommended decision, would not significantly add to the accuracy of these procedures. Respondents would already have had a full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> opportunity to present their position on the issues at the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hearing, and could submit proposed findings and conclusions at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the request of the Presiding Officer. All of this would be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the administrative record, and available to the Regional  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator. Additional right to comment would not be expected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be of significant benefit, given the minor nature of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factual and legal issues involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The government's primary interest, as previously described,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is to implement an effective citation program without an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unnecessary drain on limited enforcement resources. An effective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program calls for issuance of a citation immediately or shortly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> after detection of a violation, with a final resolution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accomplished shortly after issuance of the citation. This will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximize the deterrent effect of the field citation program, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimize the amount of resources necessary to achieve this goal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed hearing procedures meet these objectives by using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simplified and streamlined procedures, with a relatively limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time needed to complete all procedures necessary to a final  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> decision on assessment of a penalty.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the field citation program fills a gap in EPA's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement program, it is reasonable to expect that a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number of citations will be issued in each region, addressing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> simple, easy to prove violations and assessing small monetary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> penalties. While the nature of the violations and the penalty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should act to limit the number of hearings requested by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respondents, it is reasonable to expect that a significant number  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of hearings may be requested if EPA issues a large number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> citations. In that context, any additional procedures run the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk of significantly increasing the administrative burden and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> length of field citation proceedings. This could quickly make  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the program inefficient and a drain on government resources,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> given the small potential penalties and the limited environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns involved for most minor violations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Wages 'rising faster than reported' Real wages are rising much faster than employers or the government are acknowledging, according to an analysis of the latest pay and inflation figures by Mr Chris Trinder of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. Mr Trinder said yesterday that real wage growth averaged 1.4 per cent in 1993-94 but could be as high as 2.5 per cent in 1994-95. 'When inflation rose from 1.4 per cent in November 1993 to 2.6 per cent in June 1994, earnings also increased from 3 per cent to 3.75 per cent. Now, despite inflation falling by 0.3 per cent in the third quarter of 1994, earnings remain flat and recent settlements, for example in the car industry, suggest that they will be higher in the 1994-95 pay round than in 1993-94,' said Mr Trinder. Last week Rover Group announced a pay increase of about 10 per cent over two years for its 33,000 workers. Mr Trinder also claimed that public-sector pay is increasing in line with whole-economy earnings at 3.75 per cent. 'If the public-sector pay bill is frozen for 1994-95 but public-sector earnings are increasing by 3.75 per cent then more than 200,000 jobs will have to be shed,' he said.</p>

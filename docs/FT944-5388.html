			<p>941203 FT  03 DEC 94 / How to Spend It: Craft counsel The Richmond Fellowship for Community Mental Health now has its headquarters at 8 Addison Road, London W14, and this provides an added incentive for visiting its annual Christmas Craft Fair. For many readers, the fair has become part of the ritual of Christmas - it gives them the chance to buy craftwork from a range of workers (everything from pottery to needlework, jewellery, toys, glass and lithographs), see over a fine Edwardian house and know that most of the proceeds goes to aid the fellowship's work with people who have mental health problems. The house, for those who have not seen it, was built in 1906 by Harlsey Ricardo for Sir Ernest Debnham and it has tiles by William de Morgan, a mosaic dome designed by Gaetano Meo as well as, according to John Betjeman, 'mouldings and proportions everywhere (that) make it one of the most distinguished and cheerful and thoughtfully coloured interiors in England'. The fair is open today and tomorrow from 11am to 5pm, admission is Pounds 2.50 for adults, Pounds 1.50 for children, unwaged and OAPs. The address is The Peacock House, 8 Addison Road, London W14 8DL. You hate shopping, you are busy, busy, busy and you are still wondering exactly what to give to whom? Panic not, the Good Present Guide by Michael Dickson will come to the rescue. Not that you will like everything he suggests, but it is a useful starting point and I defy anyone to leaf through the pages without finding something unexpected, useful, original even. For just Pounds 4.99 the book offers suggestions for every age and interest group. Published by Pan Books, it is now available in paperback. Those who live in London or who are thinking of coming to London for Christmas shopping might like to look in on two exhibitions where works of art can be bought at very reasonable prices. At the Hyde Park Gallery, 16 Craven Terrace, London W2 there is now an exhibition of Works on Paper, a selection of etchings, screenprints, lithographs, monoprints and drawings at prices that start at about Pounds 20 and go on up to Pounds 200. Styles range from the experimental and abstract to more traditional, representational works. Look out for some charming small black-and-white etchings by Barbara Webb. The exhibition is on until December 10. The Art Collection at 3-5 Elystan Street, London SW3, which started as a small gallery selling primarily decorative prints and other works of art, is sadly closing down. From now until the end of December, it will be selling all its stock at marked-down prices. For admirers of craft work, the Hackney Contemporaries, a group of talented designer-makers, all of whom live in the borough of Hackney, are opening their studios to the public on the weekend of December 10 and 11. It is a unique chance to see what goes on behind the scenes, to get to know the craftspeople and either to buy or to commission a special piece. You could spend as little as Pounds 15 on a one-off individually made piece of pottery or glass or as much as Pounds 2,000 on something truly special. There are ceramics, glass, hand-made rugs, furniture, textiles. As with the Richmond Fellowship, there is more to do than just buy crafts. Free buses will be running every hour between 12am and 4pm along a designated route, starting at the Geffrye Museum in Kingsland Road, London E2 and taking in the open studios, Burberry's factory shop on Chatham Place, Sutton House and on to Stoke Newington. Maps of the route and the bus timetable as well as other information can be had from the Hackney Tourist Information Centre, Hackney Museum, Central Hall, Mare Street, London E8. (081-985 9055).</p>

(Flowline), the Department of Commerce (the Department) has conducted an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on certain stainless steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings (SSPFs) from Japan. The review covers one manufacturer/exporter, Benkan Corporation (Benkan), and exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period from March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. The review indicates the existence of dumping margins for the period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As a result of the review, the Department has preliminarily determined to assess antidumping duties equal to the difference between the United States price (USP) and foreign market value (FMV). Interested parties are invited to comment on these preliminary results. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  January 6, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  David Genovese or Michael Heaney, Office of Antidumping Compliance, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482&hyph;5254.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 12, 1993, the Department published a notice of ``Opportunity to Request an Administrative Review'' (58 FR 13583) of the antidumping duty order on SSPFs from Japan (53 FR 9787). On March 29, 1993, Flowline requested an administrative review. The Department initiated the review on May 6, 1993 (58 FR 26960), covering the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993. The Department has now conducted this review in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The products covered by this review include certain stainless steel butt-weld pipe and tube fittings. These fittings are used in piping systems for chemical plants, pharmaceutical plants, food processing facilities, waste treatment facilities, semiconductor equipment applications, nuclear power plants, and other areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This merchandise is currently classifiable under the Harmonized Tariff Schedules (HTS) item number 7307.23.0000. The HTS item number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes. The written product description remains dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This review covers sales and entries by Benkan of the subject  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> merchandise during the period March 1, 1992, through February 28, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Such or Similar Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Benkan, pursuant to section 771(16) of the Act, the Department established the following criteria for matching sales in the home and U.S. markets: Type of fitting, seam condition, steel material grade, unit product weight within 10 percent, nominal pipe size, and wall thickness. An identical pipe is one that matches all of these criteria. A similar pipe is one that has one or more differences in these discrete criteria from the U.S. fitting other than the type of fitting, seam condition, and unit product weight within 10 percent. The 10 percent variance in unit product weight reflects our prior practice in this case which was based upon allowable deviations between Japanese and U.S. industry standards. The Department established this hierarchy of criteria after soliciting comments from Flowline and Benkan at the beginning of the 1992&hyph;1993 review period. Both Flowline and Benkan agreed on the criteria and their hierarchy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In calculating USP, the Department used purchase price, as defined in section 772(b) of the Act, because the merchandise was sold to an unrelated purchaser in the United States prior to its importation and exporter's sales price was not indicated by other circumstances. The Department based USP on the packed, delivered price to those unrelated purchasers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department has determined that the date of sale for this merchandise is the invoice date because the invoice always sets forth agreed prices and quantities and represents the first transactional document which systematically records agreed prices. The Department made deductions, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, U.S. inland freight, U.S. duties, U.S. brokerage fees, ocean freight, marine insurance, foreign brokerage fees, and discounts.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 7, 1993, the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul Corporation and The Torrington Company  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> United States, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 (CIT, October 7, 1993), rejected the Department's methodology for calculating an addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act to account for taxes that the exporting country would have assessed on the merchandise had it been sold in the home market. The CIT held that the addition to USP under section 772(d)(1)(C) of the Act should be the result of applying the foreign market tax rate to the price of the United States merchandise at the same point in the chain of commerce that the foreign market tax was applied to the foreign market sales.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Federal-Mogul,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Slip Op. 93&hyph;194 at 12.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

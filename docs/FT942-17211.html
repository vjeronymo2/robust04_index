			<p>940406 FT  06 APR 94 / The Lex Column: Biotechnology It is tempting to see the abrupt departure of Celsis's chief executive, less than a year after flotation, as another set-back for the UK's budding biotechnology sector. The market has already been treated to a profits warning from Drew Scientific only six months after its debut as a public company. The unpredictable nature of the business certainly calls for a wide spread of investments. There is thus a strong logic behind vehicles such as Rothschild's planned biotechnology investment trust. Yet seasoned investors will take such nasty surprises in their stride. Biotechnology companies will increasingly be judged on their ability to strike deals with larger rivals in marketing or development. Whatever the details of the Celsis case, that may require a different management cast. Disappointment on specific products is equally a fact of life in pharmaceuticals research. The betting is that small biotech companies will, in aggregate, discover drugs more cheaply and reliably than the giants of the industry. With more flotations in the wings thanks to the Stock Exchange's decision to relax its listing requirements - and a total equity funding requirement of perhaps Pounds 1bn over the next three years - investors are spoilt for choice. The US biotechnology sector will need an additional Dollars 15bn-Dollars 20bn funding before the products now under development come to fruition. That points to fearsome competition for funds. If UK companies are to capture a slice of the action, they will have to learn to present a very polished public face.</p>

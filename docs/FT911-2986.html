			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (33): The yield is handy, but watch the parabola - Split-capital trusts / A 1960s golden oldie may appeal to seekers of both income and of capital growth - Investment trusts THE SPLIT-capital trust is definitely in vogue. Every other new investment-trust issue seems to have several different classes of shares, and such trusts now make up 10 per cent of the sector. The main reason for the revival - the previous heyday of split capital trusts was in the 1960s - is the ability of managers to structure the trusts in ways that make them attractive to private investors. Income shares, in particular, appeal to the older investor. Allied to a personal equity plan (Pep), such trusts can provide vital tax-free income. Some trust managers have been able to exploit an element of the Pep rules, which allows new issues to be transferred, without charge, into a plan within 42 days of the first day of dealings. The rules allow investors to put the full Pounds 6,000 into a new issue Pep, rather than the normal investment-trust limit of Pounds 3,000. Indeed, trusts launched at the end of last tax year allowed investors to place as much as Pounds 12,000 into two Peps, one for the 1990-91 fiscal year and one for 1991-92. One interesting variant of the income shares was created in the recent launch of the Contra-Cyclical Investment Trust, managed by Rea Brothers. The income shares will pay a very high initial yield, but will only be repaid a penny in the pound when the trust is wound up in 10 years' time. The Contra-Cyclical share thus resembles a temporary annuity - with the advantage that, if the investor dies, his estate will still be able to sell the shares at the market price. With an annuity, death means the loss of the entire investment. The price of most income shares follows a parabola - rising above asset value in the first few years, and then falling back to par as the wind-up of the trust approaches. This can make them dangerous investments for the unwary, who may be attracted by the yield when the price is high, without realising they will face a capital loss. However, this quirk can be used to advantage by investors with a large capital gains tax liability. They can buy income shares at the peak price and create an offsetting capital loss, while enjoying the income. Income is not the only advantage that a split-capital trust can offer the private investor. If all the income is being siphoned off to one class of investor, that leaves all the capital growth to the rest. One class of shares that has become particularly popular in the recent revival is the zero-dividend preference share. As the name suggests, this brings no income but will normally be first to be repaid when the trust is wound up. Barring a disaster, repayment will be at a level which guarantees healthy capital growth. For the small investor who has not used up his capital gains tax allowance, these shares offer an attractive tax-free gain. And even investors who have already used up their Pounds 5,500 CGT limit can use the shares to make tax-free gains via a Pep. Those willing to take larger risks may be interested in the capital shares of split trusts. These promise substantial gains if stock markets, and the managers of the trust, perform well. Capital shares are highly risky. The normal split-capital trust structure means that the capital shares will be worthless unless the assets of the trust grow - and sometimes they need to grow substantially. But modest growth rates in assets - of, say, 7.5 to 10 per cent per annum - can often mean a substantial multiple of the share price. Different trusts use different combinations of these shares, but they normally revolve around the three basics - income, assured capital growth and risky capital growth. The attraction of these share varieties has created substantial demand, with the result that many of the trusts trade at a premium to their net asset value. 'I think the sector will grow, because of demand not only from private investors, but also from institutional clients who want an income stream,' says Lewis Aaron, an analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Mr Aaron expects more trust launches, particularly towards the end of the tax year, and more restructuring of existing trusts into split-capital form, with the aim of attracting institutional interest. However, the continued health of the sector depends on demand being maintained and not swamped by oversupply. It may also depend on the stock markets performing well enough to prevent any disasters, such as capital shareholders recording a total loss. If disasters are avoided, and the managers show continuing creativity in inventing new classes of shares with investor appeal, then the split-capital sector is likely to be an important factor in propelling the investment industry into the next millennium.</p>

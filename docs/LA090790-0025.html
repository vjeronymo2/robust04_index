			<p><P> September 7, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POWER PLANT CRITICS BLAST MEETING SET ON HOLY DAY;  </P> <P> ENERGY: BUT UCLA WON'T AGREE TO A DELAY, SAYING THE PROJECT IS URGENTLY NEEDED.  </P> <P> Opponents of a proposed power plant for the UCLA campus are urging the  University of California regents to reschedule their September meeting now set  for the Jewish high holy day of Rosh Hashanah so that community members who are  Jewish may be heard.  </P> <P> Alternately, members of community groups have called upon UCLA to voluntarily  withdraw the matter from the Sept. 20-21 meeting agenda out of sensitivity to  the community. The meeting will be held at UCLA.  </P> <P> Despite lobbying by state elected officials and two major Jewish organizations,  the Board of Regents and UCLA have so far refused to change the meeting date or  postpone consideration of the giant "chiller-cogenerator."  </P> <P> Allen Solomon, UCLA vice chancellor for administration, said the university is  not willing to delay the matter because of the urgent need to move the proposed  project forward. It was delayed in July in part to allow community input, he  said, adding, "This plant will be built."  </P> <P> He noted that the November regents meeting is set for San Francisco, which also  would diminish participation by Southern Californians.  </P> <P> However, Laura Lake, representing Friends of Westwood and UCLA Watch, said it  will be far easier to get Jewish opponents of the plant to fly to San Francisco  than it will be to get them to a hearing on the high holy day.  </P> <P> Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year, which begins at sundown on Sept. 19 and  continues until sunset Sept. 21. It is marked by daylong religious ceremonies  and many Jews abstain from work and other secular activities.  </P> <P> University officials say the plant, to be fueled by natural gas and landfill  gas, is urgently needed to provide energy for the campus. Opponents of the  project are concerned about its size, the pollution it would generate and its  125-foot smokestacks.  </P> <P> They also allege that UCLA is in a hurry to avoid new air quality guidelines  that will go into effect soon after the meeting.  </P> <P> UCLA's position is that it should not be held responsible for a meeting set by  the regents, however unfortunate the timing. Carlotta Mellon, assistant vice  chancellor for community and governmental relations, said UCLA officials are  "very regretful that the meeting has to occur on Rosh Hashanah. We try to be  sensitive," she said.  </P> <P> According to Solomon, "There are opportunities for people who are not going to  testify in person (because they) . . . to have someone read their statements  into the record."  </P> <P> But state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles) and Assemblyman Tom Hayden  (D-Santa Monica) do not agree that the meeting must be held on the Jewish New  Year.  </P> <P> "They should not be meeting on Rosh Hashanah," Rosenthal said in a telephone  interview. "It's disrespectful."  </P> <P> Hayden wrote to UC President David Gardner and the regents asking them to set a  date on which "no group is forced to disregard its religious creed in order to  attend."  </P> <P> Both the Community Relations Committee of the Jewish Federation Council and the  Anti-Defamation League of B'nai Brith also sent letters asking that the meeting  not conflict with a major Jewish holiday.  </P></p>

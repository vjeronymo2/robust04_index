			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Arts (Openings): Glyndebourne Doors open on the new theatre on Saturday. The award-winning building by Michael Hopkins and Partners offers increased capacity at 1200 seats and is said to have improved sight-lines and acoustics. The first opera to be seen in it will be Mozart's 'Le nozze di Figaro', produced by Stephen Medcalf and conducted by Bernard Haitink, 60 years to the day after the same opera inaugurated the original theatre. At Glyndebourne tradition and enterprise go hand in hand. This year's festival runs from May 28 to August 25.</p>

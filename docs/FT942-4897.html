			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Sara Lee plans job cuts and takes Dollars 495m charge Sara Lee Corporation, the US foods and personal products company, is to take a Dollars 495m after-tax charge against earnings in its fourth quarter to cover its worldwide restructuring. The measures will include shedding more than 8,000 jobs and closing or consolidating hosiery manufacturing plants in the US and Europe. Sara Lee's aim is to improve the performance of its flagging personal products division, which includes the hosiery brands Hanes and L'eggs; the knitwear company Champion; and underwear lines Playtex, Bali, Dim and Kiwi. The charge will cover the cost of cutting Sara Lee's international workforce by about 6 per cent, or 8,280 employees. The company did not give details of which factories it plans to close, or where or when personnel reductions would take place. The company forecasts that the savings in annual operating costs will build up to Dollars 250m by 1998. Ms Ellen Baras, an analyst with Duff and Phelps corporation, said that restructuring had been expected, though not one so deep or extensive as was announced yesterday. 'What this does is to accelerate their plan to get their hosiery operations back on track,' Ms Baras said. Sara Lee's fourth quarter ends in July, with results due on August 8. Analysts expect the company to report flat results, with growth tempered by over-capacity in the hosiery division. Analysts said that the restructuring resembled similar successful efforts by Sara Lee to turn around performance in its bakery and packaged meat operations. 'It's a growth-driven company,' one analyst said. 'The personal products division has been turning around more slowly than they would like.' Mr John Bryan, Sara Lee's chairman, said that while the company was 'on course' and expected to report record sales and earnings for the fiscal year, its ability to 'compete effectively in rapidly changing markets, both today and in the future, requires these actions'. The charge is equal to Dollars 1.03 per share and Dollars 732m before tax.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of Factors Affecting the Species <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 4(a)(1) of the Act (16 U.S.C. 1531  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act set forth the procedures for adding species to the Federal lists. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatened species due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to Saint Francis' satyr ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neonympha mitchellii francisci <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ) are as follows: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of its habitat or range. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Because of its relatively recent discovery, it is impossible to determine what the original range of Saint Francis' satyr might have been. However, based upon its demonstrated dependency on periodic fires and the general trend of fire suppression on private lands, it seems reasonable to assume that it once occupied a more extensive area. As stated by Hall (1993): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> In order for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> francisci <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  to have survived over the past 10,000 years, there must surely have been more populations and greater numbers of individuals than apparently now exist *&blank;*&blank;* As is true for many species that were once widespread in the sandhills, massive habitat alteration must also be a major factor in the diminution of the range of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> francisci <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  *&blank;*&blank;* reductions in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> francisci <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> 's range would have accompanied the extensive loss of wetland habitats in the coastal plain. Again, the draining of swamps, pocosins, Carolina bays, savannas, flatwoods, and bogs for conversion to agriculture and silviculture is well known. In the case of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> francisci <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> , however, the extirpation of beavers from the Carolinas may have been the greatest factor. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Beavers had been virtually eliminated from North Carolina by the turn of the century. Reintroductions began in 1939, but it was several decades before they again became an agent for creation of the sedge meadow habitats favored by Saint Francis' satyr (Hall 1993, Woodward and Hazel 1991). Hall further states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> As the landscape mosaic of open woodlands and wetlands of the coastal plain declined throughout the past two centuries, the range of  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> francisci <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  must have become increasingly fragmented. Although isolated populations may have persisted as long as suitable habitat remained, the structure of their meta-populations would have been destroyed. Opportunistic colonization of newly available habitats as well as the repopulation of sites wiped clean by fire or other catastrophe would have become eventually impossible; one by one, the isolated remnants would have blinked out of existence. Although again speculative, the fracturing of meta-populations has been used to explain the decline of the arogos skipper and a number of butterflies associated with the tall-grass prairies (Panzer, 1988, D. Schweitzer, pers. comm.). That  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> francisci <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  was a relict to begin with only exacerbated this problem; the overall effect was to bring it as close to extinction as any butterfly in the country. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The sole surviving population of this species is now fragmented into less than half a dozen small colonies that occupy a total area no larger than a few square miles. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educational purposes. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Both subspecies of the Saint Francis' satyr are highly prized by collectors, including commercial collectors who often systematically collect every individual available. Several populations of the nominate subspecies are known to have been obliterated by collectors, and others are believed extremely vulnerable to this threat (Refsnider 1991). As mentioned in the ``Background'' section, the single known population of Saint Francis' satyr was so hard-hit by collectors in the 3 years following its initial discovery that it was believed to have been collected to extinction. Subsequent to the emergency listing of the nominate subspecies and prior to the publication of this rule, the North Carolina population was the last where  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Neonympha mitchellii <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  could legally be collected. Following the emergency listing of Mitchell's satyr, the North Carolina Heritage Program received several inquiries from collectors about access to the last available population. Several expressed apprehension about any restriction on collecting of this rare and much-sought-after satyr. Collectors reportedly visited the known site every day throughout the flight periods, taking every adult they saw (Hall 1993). After this first wave of over-collection, many unsuccessful searches for the butterfly were made before it was eventually rediscovered. Numbers of individuals then seen were much lower than those reported by Parshall and Kral (1989), with the highest single count consisting of only 11 butterflies (Hall 1993). Even though part of this population is protected from collectors by virtue of being within dangerous artillery impact areas, intensive collecting from the periphery of these areas could reduce total population numbers below levels needed for long-term survival. Very little is known about this species' life history and ecological requirements, but it appears to be a more vagile species than its northern relative. It may well be dependent upon a large meta-population structure in order to colonize new sites or recolonize those from which it has been extirpated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Disease or predation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This butterfly, like others, is undoubtedly consumed by predators, but there is no evidence that predation is a threat to the species at this point. Disease is not known to be a factor in its decline. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> D.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Insects are not protected from collection under North Carolina law. There are also no Department of Defense regulations that would restrict collecting of Saint Francis' satyr in North Carolina. Federal listing of this species will provide legal protection against indiscriminate taking and illegal trade. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / Letter: Central Europe in need of confidence, not handouts Sir, David Marsh's article, 'Caught out by a turning tide' (April 8) brilliantly highlights the EC's self-inflicted agonies. One has to bear in mind that the EC is a cold war structure meant to keep Europe divided. For this reason, central European nations share the wish of most Britons in seeing the Maastricht process fail. The central European nations are not as poor and backward as commonly assumed, and are in fact significant markets. The purchasing power of the populations of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary at the current exchange rate is about twice that of Russia; and Poland's is five times as great. What these nations really need is a boost to their confidence, not cash or expertise. The foreign press can help in this. Finally, if Nato becomes more efficient in keeping Russian expansionism at bay, central Europe will not need to tie itself to the west so desperately. The anticipated handouts by the Group of Seven nations to Yeltsin are certain to end up with the Red Army and entail another cold war.

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / As They Say in Europe: Environmentally unsound news A French holiday has revealed a flaw in this column. It is based on reading newspapers in an environment for which they were not designed: a bit like drinking Swiss wine in Swindon. This problem may seem obvious to a non-journalist, but those in the trade would not laugh at those reading Sud-Ouest in London rather than the Lot. Over the past three weeks it emerged that Le Figaro makes far more sense over a dish of saucisse-frites, at a lay-by on the RN20 outside Chateauroux, than it ever did on the 8.20am into Waterloo. There are its marvellous weather reports. There is news of the rich pickings to be found in new discoveries about the work of the poet Arthur Rimbaud. At such times the actual opinions of the newspaper in question are irrelevant. The views of Sud-Ouest on Bosnia seem neither notably exotic nor especially banal over a kir on the terrasse of one's gite. It is one's own newspapers that suddenly seem odd or absurd. The Daily Mail stood out on the news-stand with a lead story about a French air traffic controllers' strike. An excited headline writer, dipping deep into his treasure chest of original thought, shrieked: 'Britons in holiday flight misery.' One wonders what is most unattractive about this summary: is it the concentration on one insular aspect of the affair, the use of the word 'Britons,' or the overtones of paranoia and chauvinism in the suggestion that it was all a foreign plot aimed at the island race? It aroused the feeling you get when catching sight of drunken fellow-countrymen in the corner of some foreign bar that is forever England. In France the papers seemed, by comparison, phlegmatic and reasonable. Perhaps it was just because it was August and everyone was away, but even the provocation of a commentary in the American magazine Forbes advising its readers, composed exclusively of rich businessmen, to pull their money out of France aroused little passion in the newspapers. (It did cause a bit of a stir in financial circles, though.) One of the writers of the column was Steve Hahnke, an American academic, the other Sir Alan Walters, economic adviser to Margaret Thatcher when she was prime minister. He continually upset Nigel Lawson, then chancellor, around the turn of the decade. Lawson believed his position was being undermined by the advice given by Sir Alan. In a typically British solution, both resigned. The issue was the European exchange rate mechanism, which Sir Alan deplored. He said Britain should have no truck with it. He is now attacking the French for sticking to an overvalued exchange rate against the D-Mark even though the ERM itself has been shattered. In his column in Forbes he told the French government it was 'too clever by half' - just one more reason to avoid investing in the country. The others were a rigid labour market, slow growth, which allegedly made official forecasts a joke, and corruption. Whether by accident or design, Le Monde juxtaposed its report of the attack with a long piece on the marvellous performance of French exports as reflected in the latest trade figures. Many innocents might conclude that if France suffers any economic problems an overvalued currency is not one of them. Britain's pound has fallen in line with Sir Alan's recommendations and yet delivers endless large trade deficits and inadequate investment. A business daily, La Tribune, seemed to find the attack a bit of a joke. 'The impression grows: we upset our American friends.' It then referred to a Newsweek report on 'France's faded glory' last May and the Wall Street Journal's scarifying account of domestic corruption. 'In brief it seems our beautiful country is at the edge of suffocation and American pension funds would do better to go and have a look elsewhere . . . In Balladurian France, where courtesy reigns, we have lost the habit of those lively anti-government criticisms which flourished when the Socialists were in charge.' It then argued that American attacks were acceptable when they concerned 'socialist-communist power' but were out of place when targeted at a 'free market power practising a rather orthodox monetary policy and showing considerable calm in the face of social malaise.' It is nice to think of the Forbes' columnists as a pair of lefties, unwilling to support a government that puts anti-inflationary orthodoxy at the top of the economic agenda. Misunderstandings abound, cross-border dialogue seems impossible, yet it all goes down very well after a light lunch of confit de canard, cassoulet and a bottle of rose. But the implications are frightful: does it mean that one has to go to Frankfurt to appreciate its Allgemeine Zeitung? James Morgan is economics correspondent of BBC World Service.</p>

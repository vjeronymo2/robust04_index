			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Exclusive" interview with Defense Minister Reynaldo Andino </F> Flores by Rodolfo Valladares and Danilo Izaguirre on 27 April;  place not given -- recorded]    [Text] [Valladares] We are talking with Defense Minister  Andino. General, what do you have to say to the Honduran people  after listening to President Reina's message tonight?    [Andino] Please excuse my sore throat and hoarse voice.  Regarding your question, we have said over and over that the  Armed Forces is a serious, professional, obedient,  nondeliberative institution. The president made a promise  during his campaign. The Armed Forces cannot leave the  president in a predicament. We must support him.    But this doesn't mean that we are in complete agreement with  the concept of volunteer military service, not for personal  reasons or for a lack of understanding, but because we have many  doubts about the benefits that volunteer military service would  have for the national interest.    I would like to reiterate that the Armed Forces has always  supported the president. We will accept the proposal because we  are subordinates and have no reason to dispute the president's  opinions or decisions. Nevertheless, we believe it is important  that it be clearly understood that we do not completely agree  with volunteer military service. We say this not as military  officers but as Hondurans.    [Valladares] General, this means you accept the idea but do  not completely agree.    [Andino] We hope we are wrong, but we have reservations  about  the impact of volunteer military service. We agree that  existing recruiting measures are not the best, but we think the  military service law by itself is good and thorough enough for  us. The law separates the issue of military service from  recruiting measures. The fact that part of the law -- in this  case the part on recruiting -- isn't properly implemented does  not mean the law is bad. Only some aspects of it would have to  be changed or improved.    May I reiterate: This is the president's decision. As  subordinates, we gladly support his decision and will do  everything possible to ensure that volunteer military service  produces the best possible results.    [Valladares] This station has learned that some have said a  volunteer military service would be enormously expensive,  costing nearly twice what the Armed Forces has in its current  budget. This has all been discussed; you confirmed it tonight.  The Armed Forces accept this proposal because President Reina  is the commander in cheif of the Armed Forces, but you have  expressed disagreement.    [Andino] Right now we have three lempiras allocated to feed  one soldier each day. One of the main incentives for volunteer  military service is a more balanced diet. These days, when  prices of basic goods have skyrocketed, three lempiras could  hardly buy an attractive meal for a young man willing to enroll  in the Army. And this would have to come hand-in-hand with the  correction of all criticisms and defects. We will try to live  within our allotment. Let's see what happens.    I reiterate. I hope that I'm wrong and that volunteer  military service will have the expected results. Nevertheless,  there are several factors that could have some effects in the  long term. Consider that only three countries in the world have  volunteer military service, all of them developed countries. No  country in the Second or Third World has this type of military  service.    But I hope this idea can prosper. We hope the real winners  will be the people. In this kind of military service, one  enrolls voluntarily and leaves when one desires. But some  people might stay with the added attraction of a higher salary.  Others would do stay for personal reasons. And this sounds a  little bit more like a mercenary service.    [Valladares] General, you explained all this to President  Reina. I feel there is pessimism among the Armed Forces and  that action was taken hastily so as to keep a campaign promise  and because of the protests and criticism by some sectors. Has  this been done in haste?    [Andino] We are members of the military; we are obedient; we  are nondeliberative, and apolitical. We would not like to  express an opinion on political topics. What I repeat is that  we are going to obey, with good faith and goodwill, so that the  volunteer military service will produce the expected results.  We are here to follow orders.    [Valladares] General, at this time, taking advanatage of the  opportunity you have given us, Danilo Izaguirre wants to ask you  something about the educational military service [servicio  militar educativo]. Go ahead Danilo, Gen. Reynaldo Andino  Flores is listening:    [Izaguirre] Thanks, Raul. General, good evening. How true or  false is the following? A group of deputies is going to talk to  you to find out whether the government pressured you into  remaining silent on the issue of abolishing what the  Constitution says on compulsory military service. This group  says that if you have indeed been pressured to approve this in  haste, it will take measures in the National Congress. Go  ahead, General:    [Andino] The sovereign National Congress will know what it  has to do in this situation and at this time of historic  decisions. I think they have enough experience, maturity, and  knowledge to know what role the National Congress should play.  We will support whatever Congress decides and whatever the  president has decided. We will second him the best way possible  and with the best intentions.    [Valladares] What has Gen. Discua, commander of the Armed  Forces, told you about all this? There was a feeling that the  military did not agree. Tonight you have confirmed to this  station that they are going to obey, and that hopefully this  educational military service will be successful, but that only  three countries have it, and, with the country's economic and  social problems, there is some uncertainty about this  educational military service.    [Andino] I think the talks that have been held have been  very  positive. The problem has been analyzed in a climate of great  cordiality and understanding on the part of the people appointed  by the president. There has been a great desire to find the  best solution. I think the alternative that was found...  [pauses] We think the reform, as proposed in the new  constitutional article, could help resolve the situation because  several circumstances are foreseen in the event that the  volunteer military service does not work. There are some  aspects there which take into account the possibility of a  problem with regard to calling on volunteers.    [Valladares] There is talk about disbanding nearly four  battalions, about questions from the U.S. Government on  reductions in the Honduran Army, and about U.S. aid to our  country being linked to that. As defense minister, what can you  tell our listeners about the situation?    [Andino] If we are not in fact independent, at least we  should try to be independent. In the Armed Forces, the  reduction process has been under way for the past three or four  years. In the recent past, a field artillery brigade, an  anti-aircraft battalion, and units of the territorial forces  were deactivated.    We in the Armed Forces are preparing to present to the  president a plan for reducing the Armed Forces that includes  cutting back several units and merging others. All of this will  be proposed not because of any internal or external pressure or  because anyone has threatened to go on a hunger strike or  anything like that. It is simply because the military is aware  of national realities. We live in Honduras, and we have always  lived here. As the saying goes: We were born here, we live  here, and this is where we're staying. We have spent our entire  lives here, and we are aware of the country's problems. We are  quite aware of the nation's reality.    Considering the 10 percent budget cut implemented during the  past administration and the current 10 percent cut, these alone  are a 20 percent cut in the Armed Forces' budget. The fact that  funds earmarked for the Armed Forces remained unchanged for  approximately a decade can be viewed as a form of reduction.  And considering the 20 percent I just mentioned, in addition to  increases in the cost of living and the currency devaluation, we  are talking about a nearly 50 percent cut in the Armed Forces'  budget.    Taking all this into consideration, we definitely cannot  continue with the same structures we have had in the past  decade. Independent of what takes place on the financial side,  we are aware that some of the original reasons for increasing  the size of the Armed Forces no longer exist. But this doesn't  mean that because the Cold War is over, we now must get rid of  the Armed Forces.    In neighboring Guatemala, right next to us, there are no  ideological or Cold War problems. Despite this, you are all  aware of the problems Guatemala is going through. Guatemala has  no border problems with any other country, yet there is no talk  there about cutting the Armed Forces. They are confronting  internal problems which hopefully we will never have to face.  The problems over there are caused by menaces like poverty,  injustice, and corruption.    [Valladares] Two final questions, General, before you send  your message to the Honduran people. Tonight, President Carlos  Roberto Reina said that these reforms will mark a turning point  in relations between civilians and the military. Or will they  mark differences with Gen. Reynaldo Andino Flores?    [Andino] No, I don't believe this will create any  differences. I believe this marks a historic turning point in  the sense that the Armed Forces will once again prove that it is  sensitive to national problems. The institution will also prove  its subordination to the civilian government. I believe this is  the most important thing -- independent of the question of  whether the measures are indeed positive -- the Armed Forces  will obey. The president, as head of the Republic and commander  in chief, commands the Armed Forces. We are a responsible,  permanent, and credible institution, subordinate to a policy of  obedience and nondeliberation.    [Valladares] General, what do you have to say to the  Honduran  people who are listening to you on HRN? Following this  interesting conversation, what do you have to say to those  listeners who have tuned in to this HRN broadcast? Gen.  Reynaldo Andino Flores, as the Honduran defense minister, what  do you have to say now that President Reina has pointed out that  military service will be volunteer, educational, social,  humanist, democratic, and intended to encourage the younger  generation to fulfill their aspirations?    [Andino] Well, my message is that we should have faith,  hope,  and trust that everything will turn out well. The president is  a man of experience. He is a national leader. He is our  president and the top authority in the country. He knows what  he is doing. We hope God will enlighten him in everything he  does and decides. We, I repeat, are an institution that is at  the service of the nation. The president has been elected by a  system established by our laws, and we can do nothing but obey  him.    I only want to reiterate, once again, that we, the Armed  Forces, do not believe volunteer military service is a good  idea. We do not agree, not because we are conservative or  reactionaries, but because we, as professional military men,  know a bit more about military issues and believe there are more  disadvantages than advantages in this idea. If this measure is  going to be implemented only to satisfy personal interests and  not national interests, we are doing the wrong thing. It is, of  course, easier to do what we want and what interests us than to  do what the country needs. If we are truly going to take this  path, I cannot say how appropriate it will be to have a  volunteer military service.    I repeat, I hope we are wrong and that God has enlightened  the [words indistinct] of the president and is enlightening all  of the Honduran people. We hope this new measure will help  Honduras to increasingly become a better and more prosperous  country with better chances for an auspicious future.</p>

			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / GUS extends voting rights beyond 2% of shareholders GREAT Universal Stores, a Pounds 4.7bn retail, property and finance company controlled by only 2.2 per cent of its shareholders, is to join the modern corporate world. GUS said yesterday it would give votes to the 97.8 per cent of shareholders who do not have them under its two-tier capital structure. The move will end the Wolfson family's effective control over the company, which owns Burberrys, The Scotch House and the Kays mail order catalogue. Half the voting shares are held by the Wolfson family, the Wolfson Foundation and other connected charitable trusts. GUS's chairman is Lord Wolfson of Marylebone, the son of Sir Isaac Wolfson who took control of the company in the 1930s. GUS also appointed four new non-executive directors in a step designed to bring it closer in line with the recommendations of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance. One banker said the combination of the enfranchisement and the appointments would 'put GUS more on a par with modern companies'. He described the present share structure as 'extraordinary'. With Savoy Hotel, GUS has been perhaps the most famous example of a large UK quoted company maintaining non-voting shares. Investors generally shun non-voting or limited voting shares, and although the GUS shares receive the same dividends, the share prices of the two classes have diverged widely. Mr Richard Pugh, deputy chairman of GUS, said the company had been thinking about enfranchisement for a long time and there was 'no significance as such' in the timing of the news. 'We always had the intention to do it sometime,' he said. Holders of the voting shares will be compensated with extra shares. Anticipation of the announcement had already driven both classes of shares higher. Yesterday the price of voting shares rose 100p to Pounds 34.38p and non-voting shares rose 110p to Pounds 18.75p. One of the four new non-executives is Mr Jonathan Charkham, who was a member of the Cadbury committee. Another is Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale, who was a director of GUS in the 1970s and is the chairman of Next, the retail group. He is a first cousin of Lord Wolfson of Marylebone. GUS also announced that pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 443.6m to Pounds 475m in the year to March 31, its 45th consecutive year of profits growth.

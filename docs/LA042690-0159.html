			<p><P> April 26, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> FUND REFUSAL COULD HURT YOUTH PROGRAM  </P> <P> Advocates of a highly touted program for juvenile offenders warned the County  Board of Supervisors Wednesday that an advisory panel's refusal to fund the  project could prevent it from being extended to more Latino youths.  </P> <P> "We've exceeded all of our expectations with this program," said Kathy Bonner,  program director of Shortstop, a juvenile diversion program that has won high  marks from area judges and lawmakers.  </P> <P> "Now we need the county's help."  </P> <P> The Shortstop Program takes juvenile offenders convicted of minor crimes and  exposes them to a shock session that includes locking the youngsters in holding  cells and briefing them on the life they would face if convicted of a serious  crime. The program has operated for several years, and now the Orange County  Bar Foundation hopes to add a Spanish-language version to reach Latino youths  not proficient in English.  </P> <P> To do that, the program requested $40,000, but it was denied funding by the  County Justice System Advisory Group, which makes recommendations for  distributing more than $5 million in state crime-prevention funds.  </P> <P> "It was a matter of priorities, nothing else," said John Peshkoff, chairman of  the advisory group and director of the county Education Department's juvenile  court schools. "We feel it's an extremely worthwhile program."  </P> <P> A final vote on the funding requests is not scheduled until May 1, and  supervisors did not indicate how they plan to vote. Supervisors Gaddi H.  Vasquez and Don R. Roth appeared sympathetic to the program's appeal, however,  and Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said later that while he respects the  recommendations of the advisory panel, he remains open to amending the grant  proposal so that Shortstop can be funded.  </P> <P> "I'm willing to look at what the other possibilities are," he said, adding that  he has instructed his staff to explore other funding options.JIM NEWTON  </P></p>

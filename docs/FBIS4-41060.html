			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Mironov report under the "Parliamentary Chronicles" </F> rubric: "Grachev Will Carry Out the Order"]    [Text] Federation Council deputies arriving for the  seventh session [21 June] were greeted by pickets from the  military-industrial complex demanding "Provide state orders for  the defense industry," "Conversion, not convulsion for the  military-industrial complex!"    This lent the discussions of items on the agenda a  corresponding tone. "The state budget is the most important  document we will be adopting," Vladimir Shumeyko, chairman of  the upper chamber of parliament, stressed. He had a brief but  pithy conversation with the pickets following which he proposed  that the deputies hear a report on this matter from the  Federation Council budget committee. In his words, their State  Duma counterparts had adopted the draft budget on its first and  second reading with unbelievable ease, without considering the  252 amendments formulated by the Federation Council deputies.  "The Duma people are about to approve it on the third reading  now, so we, too, have got to step on it," Shumeyko remarked.    The centerpiece yesterday was of course the president's  edict  on the possibility of employing the Russian Federation Armed  Forces in a peacekeeping operation in the Georgia-Abkhazia  conflict zone. A report on this problem was provided by Defense  Minister Pavel Grachev behind closed doors, unfortunately.    However, the sending of Russian troops into the  Georgia-Abkhazia conflict zone has been approved in principle.  "In a matter of literally two or three days, when they report  to me that the Abkhazia territory has been cleared of mines, we  shall press ahead directly with the peacekeeping mission,"  Russian Federation Defense Minister Pavel Grachev stated after  this question had been discussed in the upper chamber of  parliament. According to him, an efficient group has been  created of five battalions up to 3,000 men strong and it is on  full combat alert. A question was raised on financing this  action other than from Defense Ministry appropriations. The  Defense Ministry, in particular, asked for 10 to 11 billion  rubles until the year's end but the positive decision was  yesterday short of a few votes.</p>

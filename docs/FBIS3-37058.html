			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ivan Ivanov] </F>   [Text] Moscow February 11 TASS -- "The present situation in  the Russian economy is difficult but not disastrous," Premier  Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday at a meeting with Siberian  trade union activists and workers who intended to inform the  cabinet head of the deplorable situation in industry and low  living standards in Siberia.    Chernomyrdin promised them to take into account all their  requirements concerning the social and economic situation in  Siberia when finalising the federal budget for 1994, the main  parameters of which will be made public in the Russian  president's message to parliament on February 18.    The premier said that the draft provides for a big federal  budget deficit which, in his opinion, was caused above all by  the continued industrial slump in Russia. To prevent the  acceleration of the slump and inflation, Chernomyrdin said that  it was necessary to conclude an agreement between producers,  trade unions and consumers on fixing prices, tariffs and wages.  The premier sees a non-monetary approach of pulling the country  out of the crisis in such an agreement.    Representatives of Siberian unions and workers squarely put  the question of settling, at long last, the problems of debts to  enterprises, timely payments of wages to civil servants,  legislative guarantees of the general tariff agreement, changes  of the taxation system in the country and payments of debts to  peasants.    The prime minister promised that all proposals on state  financing will be undoubtedly taken into account when finalising  the federal budget for 1994. As for debts for agricultural  products purchased by the state from peasants last autumn,  totalling some 1,000 billion roubles, payments will start  literally in the next few days, the premier assured. At the  same time, he warned that the state will not fully pay all debts  at once.    The prime minister stressed that the government intends, in  future too, to take utmost efforts for social maintenance of  poor segments of population and civil servants as well as to  examine closely possibilities of creating new jobs. He also  spoke against holding strikes at this difficult time for the  country.</p>

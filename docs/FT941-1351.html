			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / EU averts crisis over steel cuts An end to the crisis in the European Union steel industry was in sight last night after the European Commission agreed to give private sector steelmakers more time to finalise cuts in capacity. The agreement, between industry chiefs and Mr Martin Bangemann, industry commissioner, averts a collapse in relations between the Commission and unsubsidised EU steel producers. These companies have been reluctant to offer capacity cuts, which are vital to the future of the industry, because they do not believe the Commission has taken a tough enough line on curbing subsidies to some producers, mainly in Germany, Italy and Spain. The plan, agreed on Wednesday night, is expected to result in total cuts of about 19m tonnes of hot-rolled product capacity in the industry. Last month the industry indicated the maximum cuts it could offer would be 17m tonnes, compared with cuts of between 19m and 25m tonnes demanded by the Commission. But offers of reductions in the Italian private sector, including the Bresciani steel mills, and proposed mergers would increase these cuts by several million tonnes, the Commission said. In exchange, Mr Bangemann has backed down from a threat to halt an Ecu240m (Pounds 181m) aid package offered to the industry, to help with the restructuring and capacity cuts being demanded. Last month he threatened to block this aid, along with monitoring of imports from eastern Europe, if the industry did not provide a viable restructuring plan before a meeting of the EU industry council on April 22. The industry has now persuaded the Commission to delay a decision on the proposed aid package until November, to give the industry more time to develop a restructuring plan and allow the Italian government to introduce the legislation needed to carry out cuts. At the same time, it was unlikely that the German government would be able to approve proposed mergers in the German industry before the autumn, the Commission said. Brussels refused to specify the precise level of the proposed cuts, admitting that final details remained uncertain. But 'even if 70 per cent of the cuts occurred' this would result in a reduction of more than 19m tonnes, it said. The new reductions on offer appear to be little more than a cosmetic juggling of previous commitments. Eurofer, the European steel confederation, insisted that the final figure for reductions was still likely to be 'slightly less than 19m tonnes'. 'The figures are not that different, but the big difference is that . . . the process cannot occur in a short time,' it said. Brussels' fraud hotline, Page 2</p>

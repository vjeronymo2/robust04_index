			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 20--The imminent induction of 71  frontline and nuclear-capable F-16 fighters by Pakistan, loaded  with a variety of electronic countermeasures, poses a threat to  India's security and will tilt the air strike power in  Islamabad's favour, defence analysts say, reports PTI.    At a time when the Indian Air Force is facing a serious  resource crunch with no major expansion plans in the offing, the  induction of fighters of such magnitude by Pakistan, which has  admitted that it had acquired a "certain capability" in the  nuclear field, would force the Indian defence planners to  re-think its defence policy, they said.    Apart from the F-16 fighter, another threat to India may  come  in the form of at least three U.S.-made P3C Orion maritime  surveillance aircraft which are capable of attacking India's  maritime and sea coast assets. These aircraft, built and kept in  hangars in the United States, could also be delivered to  Pakistan using the same loophole in the Pressler Amendment,  analysts say.    Even though the IAF [Indian Air Force] can boast of being a  top class Air Force in the world, with over 700 combat aircraft  and a well-trained force, the fact remains that over 50 percent  of its aircraft of Russian origin are in a "bad shape" and  requires urgent overhauling upgradation and replacement,  analysts at the IDSA [Institute of Defense Studies and Analysis]  said.    If the U.S. Government goes ahead with the deal, India has  no  other option but to go shopping for fighters to correct the  "asymmetry," the analysts say. However, they said India had only  limited options on this front.    While the cost of frontliner fighters has shot up, the  United  States may put pressure on countries like Russia, France and the  U.K. which are willing to sell fighters to India, they felt.  Further, the disintegration of the Soviet Union has left India  in deep trouble for the spares of the existing Soviet origin  fighter plane.    The analysts at the IDSA said the addition of 71 warplanes  to  Pakistan would mean that it would have 108 F-16A/B aircraft,  with a range of nearly 1,400 km. This would tilt the balance in  Pakistan's favour since India had only about 45 Mirage-2000  fighters, which can match the capability of the U.S. fighter.    Another point to be noted here was the availability of AWACS  [Airborne Warning and Control System], a force multiplier to  Pakistan from Saudi Arabia, a close ally, in case of a conflict.  The total effect of a combination of F-16s and AWACS would be  "deadly," they said.    However, the reported statement of the Prime Minister, who  said that any U.S. attempt to modify the Pressler Amendment to  renew aid to Pakistan would "force India to reassess its defence  policy," was a welcome sign, they said.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Kragujevac, 22 May -- Borislav Mikelic, prime  minister of the Republic of Serb Krajina, told Kragujevac Radio  today that Croatian President Franjo Tudjman "has become  nervous," about the internal problems in his party and that  "there is nothing else for him to do but to take up the war  option."    Commenting on Tudjman's threat that "he will use all  available means to reintegrate the rebel Serbs into Croatia,"  Mikelic said that the Republic of Serb Krajina would also use  all of its available resources to defend all things Serbian and  which have been Serbian for centuries. Adding that the defense  of the republic of Serb Krajina "is not what it was when  Miljevci plateau and Divoselo were attacked," and that Serbs  would no longer lodge complaints with the UNPROFOR [UN  Protection Force] if Croats attack any of their villages,  Mikelic said: "Our strength is now tenfold compared to earlier  years."    Dwelling on the statements from Croatia that it would not  extend UNPROFOR's mandate, Mikelic said the territory in  question did not belong to Croatia but to the republic of Serb  Krajina and that the international forces could stay there for  two years because the Serbs want peace. "Croatia's behavior as a  whole best illustrates why Serbs cannot and do not want to live  with the Croats any longer," he said.</p>

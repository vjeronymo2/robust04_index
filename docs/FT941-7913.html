			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Aid for Arctic region agreed: Marathon negotiating session this weekend on EU enlargement European Union foreign ministers yesterday made a breakthrough in membership talks for Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway with agreement on a regional aid programme for the Arctic regions of the Nordic countries. Austria warned, however, that the negotiations could collapse unless its concerns were met on lorry traffic through its Alpine passes. Switzerland decided last weekend to phase out truck transit rights through its own Alps. Because of diverted traffic, Austria wants the EU transit restrictions it negotiated with the Union to extend until 2005. The EU is offering 1997. As both sides drew up positions for what is supposed to be the final ministerial negotiation between next Friday evening and midnight next Monday, there were still seemingly unbridgeable wide gaps. Leading EU negotiators were predicting crisis. The focal points of disagreement have been: how to cut Nordic and Alpine farm prices to EU levels and who should compensate the farmers; how much the newcomers should pay into the EU budget; Norwegian fish; and EU transit rights through Austria's Alps. Regional aid could now be resolved. The Nordic countries reacted favourably yesterday to the new Arctic regime, offering funding only 10 per cent less favourable than that for the EU's poorest regions (which will still be offered to Burgenland on Austria's border with Hungary). By yesterday Finland had cleared most of its negotiating hurdles except agriculture, and Sweden would be in sight of the finishing line but for its insistence on a three-year rebate from the EU budget. Austria also wants to phase in its budget contributions. Money will overshadow much of next weekend's marathon talks. On agriculture, for example, the Twelve want instant food price cuts to EU levels, with the applicant countries paying the difference to their farmers. Austria and Norway want transitions to EU price levels, with border rebates to iron out the differences. This is regarded as an unacceptable threat to the border-free single market by all in the EU except Britain and fundamentalists in the Brussels agriculture directorate. At Spain's insistence, the EU was last night set to demand modest access to Norway's fisheries resources in exchange for free entry of Norwegian fish into the single market - still being resisted by France and Ireland. Norway's last membership attempt in 1972 was scuppered by the fish controversy, and Oslo has promised not to surrender a single fish to the EU. Mr Carlos Westendorp, Spain's European affairs minister, said Madrid was willing to negotiate, but if the Norwegians 'stick to that zero quota to the end, I foresee a catastrophe'. As the EU finalised its common view on fish last night, a senior Commission official predicted that 'any likely position we reach is going to be so far from the Norwegians as to make it impossible.'</p>

			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Observer: Eau de hype Nestle may be the world's largest producer of mineral waters, but it's imbibing too much carbonated water for its own good - its pronouncements are getting a little windy. It trumpeted yesterday the establishing of the Institut de l'Eau Vittel-Perrier, to carry out research in all matters pertaining to its wondrous products. Ramon Masip, a colourful Catalan who heads Nestle's food businesses, managed to keep a straight face when explaining the sorts of things this cutting-edge institution would investigate; the effects of various minerals on health and digestion; the influence of various containers on the taste and shelf life of mineral waters; and improved drilling techniques to prevent impurities leaking into underground pools. Oh yes, he added, it would also be good for publicity.</p>

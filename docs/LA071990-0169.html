			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO DISCOVERY: MORE VIDEOS:  </P> <P> "The Third Man" (1949), directed by Carol Reed. 100 minutes. No rating. An  American comes to post-war Vienna to discover that a friend has been murdered  and winds up learning a little about love and loyalty -- too late, alas, to  help himself. With Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, a script by Graham Greene that  is a marvel of wit and intelligence, and some great zither music. M. FLAGG  </P></p>

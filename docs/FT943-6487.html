			<p>940829 FT  29 AUG 94 / Company News (This Week): T&amp;N - Other companies The upturn in European vehicle sales and signs of recovery in the US automotive industry should lift first-half profits by about 30 per cent at the motor components and engineering group. Interim pre-tax profits - due on Thursday - are expected to reach Pounds 51m (Pounds 39.4m) as the group enjoys higher volumes and the benefits of previous reorganisation. Analysts have warned, however, that investors would be seeking a 'significant payback' following Pounds 263m of capital expenditure in the past three years and a 92 per increase in shares in issue since 1989.</p>

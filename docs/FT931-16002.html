			<p>930109 FT  09 JAN 93 / Letter: Space travellers for whom time just 'slips' by Sir, Charles Taylor's lacey, crinkly ruff model to explain the missing mass in the universe (Letters, January 6) is supported by the idea developed by my children (then aged 13 and 15) a few years ago. This is the 'isochronous universe' - a universe awash with 'isobars' of equal time. If the technology could be developed, so the idea goes, to find and use such isochrones, a traveller could simply slip along them (rather than across them, the normal way we experience time) and could traverse vast interstellar distances essentially 'instantaneously'. I agree with Mr Taylor that it is unthinkable that we should not be able to explore the whole of creation, and not just this tiny earth-speck. The isochrone traveller may well one day easily manage it. Stephen Castell, Computer and Systems Telecommunications, 20 Grange Road, Wickham Bishops, Witham, Essex CM8 3LT</p>

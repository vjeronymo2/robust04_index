			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon to raise Pounds 30m Baillie Gifford Shin Nippon has became the third investment trust this week to launch a substantial conversion share issue. Following TR European Growth and Shirescot, which are to raise Pounds 38m and Pounds 24m respectively, the trust aims to raise approximately Pounds 30.2m, net of expenses, through a placing and open offer. It is currently capitalised at just under Pounds 32m. SG Warburg, acting as sponsors and stockbrokers to the issue, have placed some 21m C shares with existing and new investors and a further 10m are available at 100p apiece to existing shareholders and warrantholders. The trust stressed that the amount of shares being offered had been set deliberately high to minimise the possibility of applications being scaled down. The C shares will be converted into ordinaries by October 31, or when 85 per cent of the new funds have been invested. New warrants will be issued with the new ordinary shares on a 1-for-5 basis.</p>

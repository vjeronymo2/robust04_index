No vehicles were available at the station.    Finol said the situation was due in part to a lack of police  support from state authorities, because if the Mayoralty's buses  had begun operating in the early morning hours, "we could have  broken the transportation strike in the city."    However, Finol confirmed that seven routes were covered by  Consolidated Transportation buses, which began offering their  services after noon, and by 50 vans belonging to various  municipal institutes.    Jose Sarmiento, president of the Single Transportation  Workers' Union and representative of the Central-Western  Transportation Association, who drove through the city in a  brand-new private vehicle with a cellular phone to assess the  strike, concluded that it was a success in 17 municipalities of  Zulia State. Upon the conclusion of the transportation strike,  Manuel Finol denounced the destruction of 11 vehicles on Aticos  Avenue, south of the city. The vehicles belonged to the  Maracaibo mayor's office. A driver identified as Alvin Pirela  was injured in the incident, which prompted IMTCUMA to suspend  its contingency plan for providing transportation to the  population through special means.    Barquisimeto -- The Lara Drivers' Union decided to suspend  mass transit to Lara and other cities in the remaining eight  autonomous municipalities, thus forcing residents to cope with  the situation in order to get to their homes, schools, and  places of employment.    Driver's Union President Deputy Erik Zuleta said the measure  was implemented in accordance with instructions issued by the  Transportation Federation as an action against the  Transportation and Communications Ministry for not resolving the  proposals made by that organization in October 1993. The  Transportation Federation made proposals regarding increases in  urban and rural fares in the countryside and the effects of the  half-fare paid by students, which drivers hope the government  will cancel.    The measure, which proved wholly successful in paralyzing  the  transportation sector in 11 states on 25 January, was also to  protest the implementation of the value-added tax, which the  Transportation Federation believes should be definitively  eliminated.    Hundreds of people formed long lines to wait hopelessly for  buses. Meanwhile, the Mayoralty and the Council made desperate  attempts to contact private vehicle owners to authorize them to  cover the various routes. In addition, cooperation from the  National Guard and Army was being demanded to get the buses out  on the streets. The lack of transportation prevented workers  and students from getting anywhere all day yesterday.    Merida -- The driver's union strike virtually paralyzed the  principal cities in the Andean region yesterday despite efforts  by the authorities to help people reach their various workplaces.    There were no reports of violent incidents.</p>

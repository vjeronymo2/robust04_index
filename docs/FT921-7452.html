			<p>920222 FT  22 FEB 92 / Positive French market 'WE HAVE been very positive about the French market for some time, but even we were surprised by the way it has taken off in the past week,' says Mr David Harrington, French general market analyst for James Capel in Paris. Good US news has helped, he says. 'The dollar has strengthened so much that, this time, we really do seem to have reached the bottom. That has weakened the D-Mark and taken pressure off the franc. It has been good news for any French company with a US earnings stream.' Mr Harrington says the market is 'probably now in the first phase' of its 1992 rally. 'The second phase will come when official interest rates fall and that won't happen until after the Germans move in the third quarter.' The prospect of lower interest rates and French government plans for pension reform make equities look a good investment, while bonds should perform reasonably well, he says. 'But investors won't see such good returns on cash which has been the investment in France for the past few years.'</p>

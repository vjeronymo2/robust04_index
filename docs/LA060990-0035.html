			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BEANBALL WARS STILL NOT THE RIGHT THING  </P> <P> It is impossible not to be disgusted by the completely unsportsmanlike and  dangerous behavior exhibited by any team that supports or engages in the  intentional act of throwing a baseball at a batter. Worse yet is the farcical  defense given by perpetrators of "retribution" or "pay back."  </P> <P> First of all, a ball thrown at 90 m.p.h. is not the baseball equivalent of an  in-your-face slam dunk, a clean trap block or a hard body check against the  boards, but rather the same as an elbow to the throat, an intentional face-mask  penalty or a slash across the eyes.  </P> <P> Second, if the players believe so strongly in retaliation and justice, why do  the pitchers inevitably end up throwing at the first convenient opposing  player, who probably wasn't even the one who committed the instigating offense?  I suppose I should apply this same logic to my neighbor, who breaks my window,  by punching his wife when I see her step outside for the morning paper.  </P> <P> To those who say it's all part of the game, so is clean play, sportsmanship and  self-control.  </P> <P> JAY LINDSEY, Newport Beach  </P></p>

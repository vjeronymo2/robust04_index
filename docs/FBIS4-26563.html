			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung and Linda Choy] </F>   [Text] China is prepared to accept government borrowing  "far above" the $5 billion ceiling stipulated in the 1991  Sino-British Agreement in an effort to strike an early deal on  Hong Kong's new airport, according to a senior Chinese official.  Lu Ping struck yet another positive note on the stalled airport  talks just two days before the Airport Committee starts another  round of negotiation on Chek Lap Kok's financial package.    Speaking in the Legislative Council, Financial Secretary Sir  Hamish Macleod said the Government hoped good progress would be  made at the talks tomorrow.    Mr Lu, director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao  Affairs Office, said he hoped a decision on the airport would be  reached by the end of next week. But that would only be  possible if Britain co-operated, he said in an interview with  the ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL published yesterday.    Under the latest financial package, the Government will put  $60.3 billion into the Mass Transit Railway Corporation and the  Provisional Airport Authority. The amount of borrowing,  however, would still be around $20 billion. .    Under the 1991 deal or Memorandum of Understanding, the  government can only proceed with borrowing in excess of $5  billion if China agrees. Mr Lu said China was prepared to  accept a debt ceiling substantially above $5 billion but  declined to give a figure. "It's still far above five... Yes,  I have said we are very flexible," he said.    Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten said Mr Lu's remarks were  "positive and constructive." "I very much hope that we'll see  an increasingly good and cooperative relationship with China and  it's obviously in the interests of Hong Kong. I hope that both  of us will be able to see the words we used about cooperation  turned into real practical successes in the work of the Joint  Liaison Group and elsewhere too. I think people in Hong Kong  want to see actions as well as hear words," he said.    Mr Patten said he would like to see a decisive breakthrough  at the meeting of the Airport Committee tomorrow, adding that no  one should "count the eggs before they are hatched".    An overall financing agreement would speed up the  construction of the airport, he said.</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / Political Notebook: Heroic assumptions and political realities THE public spending round to accompany the introduction of next month's unified Budget is nearly complete. After two months of wrangling the full cabinet will today begin taking some real decisions. There are one or two more rows to come. Under the new system the important players around the cabinet table are unwilling to settle their budgets until the last moment. The neat theory that the creation of a cabinet committee - the so-called EDX  -to thrash out the government's priorities would speed up the process has proved to be wishful thinking. Collective decision-making has its price. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, will be at the head of a queue arguing that big spending cuts must fall elsewhere. He will be carrying with him, of course, the letter to Mr John Major from 14 Tory MPs threatening a backbench rebellion if the Treasury gets its way. Mr Peter Lilley, Mr David Hunt, Mrs Virginia Bottomley and Mr John MacGregor will be among others appealing to the collective good sense of their colleagues. Even the urbane Mr Douglas Hurd wants a full hearing. But if not today, then by next week the cabinet will agree a set of figures which will meet the remit set in July for public spending to be more or less frozen in real terms for the next three years. To do anything else would be to undermine fatally the notion that Mr Kenneth Clarke is serious about tackling the public sector borrowing requirement. And whatever the success of last minute appeals to the full cabinet, it is clear just where the axe will cut most deeply. The Treasury has already announced that all Whitehall budgets will be fixed on the heroic assumption that public-sector pay will not rise at all in cash terms next year. Teachers, nurses, policeman and civil servants are thus expected to take a cut in living standards. In reality ministers know that most of them will get a pay increase - at the expense of higher public-sector unemployment. But the ministers who joined Mr Clarke in the deliberations of EDX decided at the outset they had no other choice. Without a pay freeze the numbers would not add up. One participant was reminded of the hoary joke about the economist stranded on a desert island with cases and cases of food but nothing to open them with. The economist 'assumed' a can-opener. Other assumptions made when the process started back in June have disappeared already in harsh political realities. EDX, it was said, would get to grips with the inexorable rise in the Pounds 80bn social security budget - representing nearly a third of all public spending. Instead social security will emerge as one of the biggest 'winners' of the negotiations. True, Mr Lilley will be taking some harsh measures to curb the growth of invalidity benefit payments. There may also be a fierce clampdown on fraud and, probably, new restrictions on benefit payments to cover mortgage interest. But the combination of a precarious Commons majority and a series of manifesto pledges has allowed the rightwing social security security to defend most of his programmes. The Treasury cannot count the number of times Mr Lilley has responded to a demand for the means-testing of child benefit or cuts in unemployment benefit with: 'It would never get through the Commons'. So the social security budget - along with those for legal aid and agricultural support payments - will continue to rise in real terms. So too will those of health and education - though at a slower rate and at the cost of accepting a few more heroic assumptions about efficiency gains. Health is protected by a manifesto pledge, education because it was once Mr Major's big idea. Instead the main victims of EDX have been the traditional 'soft' targets for all governments: capital spending on housing and roads, the local authority grant settlement, inner city regeneration schemes and, for all Mr Rifkind's protests, defence. The participants have also discovered something else. The term unified budget is a misnomer. For all the talk of bringing together spending and revenue decisions, the Treasury has not allowed any discussion of the trade-off between the two sides of the balance sheet. It is perhaps not surprising that some ministers believe the whole concept of a unified budget will not long outlive its creator, Mr Norman Lamont.</p>

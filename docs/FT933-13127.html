			<p>930721 FT  21 JUL 93 / Services in London will rapicly decline without investment say MPs THE COMMONS transport committee yesterday warned that underground and rail services in London would rapidly decline without a big increase in investment, Richard Tomkins writes. MPs said they had received clear evidence from both Network SouthEast and London Underground that the present levels of investment were insufficient to maintain or improve the capital's transport system. Their report calls for a government commitment to a sustained and higher level of investment.</p>

			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> RITES ARE TODAY FOR USD PROFESSOR  </P> <P> A memorial Mass will be said today for Joanne Dempsey, professor of English at  the University of San Diego, who died of heart failure Thursday at her Mission  Hills home. She was 44.  </P> <P> Ms. Dempsey joined the USD faculty to teach English Renaissance literature in  1980, a year before she was awarded her doctorate in English from Harvard  University.  </P> <P> "In many ways, she represented this university at its best -- a person of  character, faith and intelligence," said Patrick Drinan, dean of USD's College  of Arts and Sciences. "Dr. Dempsey was a Renaissance scholar and was held in  deep affection by her students and colleagues."  </P> <P> Ms. Dempsey, a native of Mineola, N.Y., attended Newton College of the Sacred  Heart in Massachusetts, where she won a two-year scholarship to Sophia  University in Tokyo to study Western culture. Ms. Dempsey, who was fluent in  four languages, also studied at the British Museum and Warburg Institute in  London and at the American Academy in Rome.  </P> <P> Ms. Dempsey was devoted to the arts and was a patron of the Old Globe Theatre.  </P> <P> She is survived by her parents, retired Judge and Mrs. William J. Dempsey Sr.  of Mineola, and a brother, William J. Dempsey Jr., who is with the district  attorney's office in Nassau County, N.Y.  </P> <P> The Mass will begin at 11:15 a.m. at USD Founders Chapel.  </P></p>

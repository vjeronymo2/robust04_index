			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report]  <H6>  THE STAR </H6>   ANC, Government in Bid To Accommodate Freedom Alliance --  Johannesburg THE STAR in English on 18 February in a page-12  editorial believes the government and the African National  Congress (ANC) "have made a determined bid to accommodate the  Freedom Alliance [FA]." Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader  Mangosuthu Buthelezi has "wasted little time in rejecting" the  ANC concessions. "Buthelezi's stance, which contrasts with the  more judicious and open-ended reaction of FA chairman Rowan  Cronje, raises an important question: what concessions has the  IFP made in the interests of reaching an inclusive settlement?"  <H6>  BUSINESS DAY </H6>   Buthelezi Urged To Show Good Faith -- Whatever Buthelezi  says, the ANC's latest compromise offer "is a major advance on  its previous position in one crucial respect: the acceptance  that regional powers and functions embodied in the interim  constituion may not be `substantially diminished' by the  constitutional assembly when it conducts its work after April  28," declares a page-8 editorial in Johannesburg BUSINESS DAY in  English on 18 February. "Less clear" is what the ANC's proposal  means in respect of "the powers of regions, both exclusive and  concurrent, including their powers or rights regarding taxation.  The ANC is vague on what, if any, further concessions it is  willing to make on the detail of these provisions, beyond that  which is already on the table. In this respect, Buthelezi is  entitled to complain that ANC talk of concessions may be a  mirage. But it would demonstrate some good faith if he were to  sit down--either personally or through his senior lieutenants  and advisers--and begin negotiating that detail."  <H6>  SOWETAN </H6>   ANC Constitutional Proposals--Referring to the  constitutional  proposals of the ANC, Johannesburg SOWETAN in English on 18  February in a page-8 editorial says: "We have doubts whether  the various component parts of the Freedom Alliance are willing  to subject themselves to the will of the electorate. It seems  it will be easier to negotiate a deal with the white  rightwingers than homeland leaders who fear their total demise."  If the latest initiatives fail it is important that leaders and  the government "spell out to the country precisely what to  expect and what contingency measures are to counter rightwing  violence and the `resistance politics' of the IFP."  <H6>  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN </H6>   Warnings Signals on Irish Takeover of Argus Newspapers --  "There has been great joy in the media about the purchase of  Argus Newspapers by the Irish-American soup, bean and newspaper  man, Tony O'Reilly," notes a page-16 editorial in Johannesburg  WEEKLY MAIL &amp; GUARDIAN in English for 18-24 February. "It's  not  all that surprising, since most of those commentators are now  employed by the man." "There are some warning signals that  should, nevertheless, be sounded by those who don't work for  him. The first is that press reports have repeatedly cited his  reputation for non-interference in editorial decisions -- except  where it involves the IRA. We have heard that before, haven't  we?" Secondly, "based on the experience of Tiny Rowland and  Robert Maxwell, we should be wary of newspaper tycoons who  befriend political. The test will come if O'Reilly's newspapers  embarrass his powerful friends and endanger his business  interests. We can't wait for the test!"  <H6>  BEELD </H6>   Intimidation Must Be Stopped -- Johannesburg BEELD in  Afrikaans on 15 February says in a page-8 editorial:  "Intimidation fever is rising. At first it was only words and  incitement. Now the emotional statements are becoming deeds.  It is especially prevalent where politcal groups become  frustrated in fear of change, and where there are no attainable  alternatives to change." As examples, BEELD refers to the  Afrikaner National Front's threat to put pressure on the  election. This could include "`a little bit of violence' in  self-defense against the ANC. They will not allow the  constitution to come into operation. Then the ANC's Mr. Tokyo  Sexwale warned the Freedom Alliance to be careful of their next  step, adding that `in the past, we died for freedom and the  liberation of our country. We will not hesitate to do so  again.' And Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi openly threatened that  those who ignore the demands of Inkatha must bear the  consequences." "But the most despicable form of intimidation is  the cowardly, anonymous right-wing threats to kidnap President  F. W. de Klerk's 4-year-old grandson in protest over the manner  in which the National party is leading the country towards a new  dispensation." This "goes beyond the bounds of election fun.  Every leader has a great responsibility to encourage his  followers to exercise calm and tolerance. Offenders must be  thoroughly disciplined."    Zulu Demands -- "Logic and the government dictate that King  Goodwill Zwelithini's demands can be dealt with inside a federal  system and the interim constitution; but emotions point to a  force which is increasingly threatening the unity of South  Africa," says an editorial on page-8 of the Johannesburg BEELD  in Afrikaans of 16 February. "It is difficult to imagine how an  independent, sovereigh Zulu kingdom will be accomdated without  drastic changes to the present constitutional system. One gets  the impression that the Zulus, under their king and Chief  Minister Buthelezi (or is it the other way around?) will not be  satisfied with any formula which will make them subjects. Their  statements smack of cessation, even though they have not yet  used the word."</p>

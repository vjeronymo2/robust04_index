			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS;  </P> <P> BILLY HARPER QUINTET  </P> <P> Billy Harper, the Texas-born tenor saxophonist who opened Tuesday at Catalina  Bar and Grill in Hollywood, is a powerful, hard-driving performer whose quintet  places an almost unrelenting accent on energy and high tension.  </P> <P> Well known for his work with Gil Evans and Art Blakey, Harper is said to have  been inspired by Sonny Rollins. However, it was the image of John Coltrane that  hung over the group as it made its way through a series of modally inclined  original compositions. Although the thematic statements were brief, the  extended solos seemed to indicate that such words as succinct and terse are not  in these artists' vocabulary. By the time the third tune ended a full hour had  elapsed.  </P> <P> Harper's control of the horn is impressive, but when playing as many as a dozen  notes per second, it is no easy task to relate any of them to the beat of the  rhythm section. Thus swinging in the normal sense becomes impractical.  </P> <P> Eddie Henderson's trumpet, Clarence Seay's bass and the powerhouse drumming of  Newman Taylor Baker make up a unit well geared to Harper's requirement. The  group closes Sunday. LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

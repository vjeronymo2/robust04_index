			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Observer: Not out Tut, tut. Top woman gives up Pounds 100,000 job to spend more time with her family. It sounds a plausible tale in these stressful times and makes a good headline. But in the case of Diana Cornish, the 49-year-old managing director of the Brook Street Bureau recruitment agency, it is not accurate. Having risen to the top of the employment business - she was involved with Blue Arrow long before Tony Berry arrived - she wants a new challenge. 'Women don't get many chances at the top,' says Cornish, who makes it clear that after a well-earned holiday, she will be looking around for gainful employment again. If plans for a management buy-out of Brook Street had not collapsed 15 months ago, she might have hung around a little longer. But after 18 years in the same business she wants to prove that she can do something other than run an employment agency. A businesswoman worth watching.</p>

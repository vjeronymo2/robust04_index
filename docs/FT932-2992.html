			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Growth found in its customers' footsteps - The strategy of Tibbett &amp; Britten SOUTH AFRICA, Canada and Portugal might seem an eclectic group of countries for a UK distribution and warehousing specialist to choose for its overseas expansion plans. However, these varied territories are the focus for the rapidly growing international activities of Tibbett &amp; Britten Group, the company previously best known for distributing garments in the UK for Marks and Spencer. The common theme is Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group which sold its stake in Tibbett to a management buy-out in 1984. The distributor has maintained a close relationship with its former parent, and Tibbett's businesses in the three countries all have their origins in that connection. Mr John Harvey, Tibbett's chairman, said the overseas moves were in line with his group's strategy of following its multinational customers and then developing related business around these core contracts. Mr Harvey was the director of Unilever who initiated the multinational's investment in Tibbett and led the management buy-out. He said: 'We've got lots of buddies in Unilever and have always kept in touch.' The connection was underlined this month when Tibbett appointed Mr Michael Johnson, 59, as non-executive director. He had retired as head of information technology for Unilever in January, after 30 years. For the last three years he had been responsible for Unilever's information technology policies, designed to take advantage of the capability of open systems. By maintaining Unilever-type reporting systems and financial disciplines, Tibbett has found it easy to do business with other multinationals. This policy of establishing bridgeheads was clearly demonstrated in South Africa. Last June Tibbett paid Unilever Pounds 2m for SA Warehousing Services, which distributes throughout South Africa for Unilever and others. In November the total food distribution operation of Woolworth (South Africa) was acquired. Tibbett's market capitalisation has grown tenfold since it came to the market in 1986, and has almost doubled since 1990. Last year it made a Pounds 31m rights issue to fund the acquisition of Silcock Express, a private company which distributes motor vehicles in the UK, France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal. The deal added motors to the group's four existing distribution specialities in fast-moving consumer goods, which include clothing and textiles, toiletries and cosmetics, groceries and DIY and electrical products. Tibbett now operates in eight countries. Last year, the UK generated more than 90 per cent of group sales, but by the end of this year overseas operations should account for more than 25 per cent. Despite this rapid spurt of growth Tibbett has made relatively few acquisitions. Its previous important deal was the purchase of Lowfield, the grocery distributor, in 1989 for Pounds 12.5m. Mr Harvey said he preferred to grow business, rather than make acquisitions. His priority was now to infill in Europe behind the Silcock openings, particularly in France, Spain and Portugal. There were obvious gaps in Silcock's network, such as Germany and Italy. The group also intends to reinforce its investment in Canada and South Africa. Mr Harvey said there were plenty of opportunities in North America, but he intended to stick to Canada until they had built a significant regional base. On South Africa, he conceded: 'It is an unstable area, there's obviously some risk. But if you're taking a medium to long-term view, places like South Africa and China must be considered.' Tibbett has moved substantially away from its dependence on Marks and Spencer, which generated 60 per cent of turnover at the 1986 flotation. Although the M&amp;S business has since grown three-fold, it currently accounts for only 11 per cent of group sales. Concern about preserving M&amp;S's commercial confidentiality has prevented Tibbett from giving a detailed breakdown of its results by division, but it seems likely that it will in future. Despite what it described as 'difficult trading conditions everywhere', Tibbett's sales rose 28 per cent to Pounds 231.8m last year. The group said 69 per cent of its growth was generated organically while 80 per cent of revenue was contractually based. Development was particularly strong in the consumer and personal products divisions. Although trading continues to be depressed in the clothing and textiles division, Mr Harvey said he was happy to keep the Fashion Logistics network, the biggest single specialised clothing distributor in Europe, which supplies 35 per cent of UK market outside the big chains. The Marks and Spencer business evolved out of the network, and it remains a potential source of separate dedicated distribution operations. Clothing and motors offer the best hope of recovery and growth in the medium term. The group cites market research last year which forecast a 30 per cent increase in total new car and light vehicle registrations between 1992 and 1996 in the five countries where Silcock operates, with growth particularly in the UK, Spain and Portugal. Mr Harvey is anxious not to raise expectations too much, but seems quietly confident about winning new business: 'We have never been busier quoting.'</p>

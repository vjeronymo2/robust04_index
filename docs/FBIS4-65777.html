			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Investments in East Europe Growing </F> Fast -- Netherlands Fifth Investor]    [Excerpt] Netherlands investments in Central and East  Europe are growing rapidly. In 1993, Netherlands companies  invested a record amount of $754 million in the former east bloc  countries. That is twice as much as in 1992 ($373 million) and  substantially more than was invested in 1991 ($155 million) and  1990 ($7 million).    These figures were released on Thursday [19 May] by  accountants and consultants in Amsterdam. They were contained  in a study carried out by KPMG Corporate Finance and its  European desk regarding the attractiveness of Central and East  Europe for Netherlands companies.    Now, together with France, Netherlands is the fifth-ranking  investor in the area. In all, Netherlands companies invested  $1.3 billion in East Europe during the period 1990-1993. The  biggest investor during this period was the United States, with  $7.8 billion, followed by Germany ($7.2 billion), Italy ($3.4  billion), the United Kingdom ($1.9 billion), and both France and  the Netherlands ($1.3 billion each). Together, over the period  1990-1993, foreign companies invested $26 billion in the East  European countries.    The lion's share of Netherlands investments was made by  multinationals headquartered in the Netherlands. According to  J.A.W.M. van Rooijen of KPMG Corporate Finance, their investment  behaviour was shaped primarily by the race to beat the  competition and profit from the low production costs and the new  sales possibilities. For companies like Heineken, Unilever, and  various supermarket chains, it was the latter argument that was  decisive, van Rooijen believes. "Moreover, the study shows that  consolidating market share was considered to be more important  than generating quick profits," he said.    Netherlands companies appear to have invested for the most  part in Hungary and the Czech Republic. Of the total amount of  $1.3 billion invested since 1990, $449 million was invested in  the Czech Republic (and Slovakia, which until recently was  united with it), and $317 million was pumped into Hungary.  During the same period, Netherlanders invested $183 million in  Poland and $340 million in the other East European countries,  including Russia and Kazakhstan. [passage omitted]</p>

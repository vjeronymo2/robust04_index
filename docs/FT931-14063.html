			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / International Capital Markets: Sanyo to reduce workforce by one-third SANYO Securities, one of Japan's troubled second-tier brokers, yesterday said its workforce would be cut by about one-third this year, and may be further reduced if the stock market does not recover. The confirmation by Sanyo of a continued restructuring highlights the extreme pressure on the 10 second-tier brokers, which have all reported losses for the first half to September and are generally expected to report larger losses for the full year. The Nikkei stock average in Tokyo lost 26.4 per cent of its value last year, while the daily average volume on the first section was 264.9m shares, the lowest since the 239m shares of 1977 and a quarter that of 1988. Prices and turnover have remain weak on the Tokyo market in recent weeks, and Sanyo is aiming to reduce its workforce, which was 4,270 last April, to 3,000 by March 1994. Another 150 administrative staff will be transferred to the sales division in coming months. 'We are asking for the continuing support of our three main banks, Bank of Tokyo, Daiwa Bank, and Nippon Credit Bank,' a Sanyo spokesman said. 'We don't want to sack people. The reductions will be done through attrition,' he added. Sanyo lost Y29.6bn (Dollars 235.5m) last year, and Japanese financial industry analysts estimate that the broker will lose about Y40bn this year, prompting expectations of more severe cuts in the workforce and in its branch network later this year. The broker has come in for particular attention because it christened the world's largest securities trading room during the so-called 'bubble' years of the late 1980s, and saw itself as challenging the big four brokers, Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko and Yamaichi, for market share.</p>

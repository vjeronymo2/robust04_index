			<p><P> April 7, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FILM REVIEW;  </P> <P> BARBARIAN BROTHERS BACK IN 'THINK BIG'  </P> <P> Those identical twin bodybuilders Peter and David Paul, who call themselves the  Barbarian Brothers, are back in "Think Big" (citywide), a movie as slight as  they are bulky. Fortunately, it is as amiable as they are.  </P> <P> The Barbarians are cast as a pair of good-natured giants, truck-driver  brothers, who will receive the money they need for their final payment on their  gleaming 18-wheeler once they deliver barrels of toxic waste from a small town  in Montana to Long Beach. The toxic wastes are from TechStar, a remote think  tank run by a greedy Martin Mull, who holds a clutch of young geniuses as  virtual prisoners. Trying to escape is a pretty 16-year-old, Holly (Ari  Meyers), who has invented a remote-control device capable of switching off any  electronic switch within its proximity.  </P> <P> In short order, we're into a typical chase comedy with Holly latching on to the  kindly Barbarians and not only Mull and huge henchman Richard Kiel in hot  pursuit but also David Carradine's sly redneck repo man, eager to get his hands  on the truck.  </P> <P> There's not much here for post-adolescent audiences -- the rating is a rather  severe PG-13 -- but feature debuting director Jon Turteltaub (who also had a  hand in the script) has a good sense of pace and a nice way with actors. Under  his direction the entire cast, including the Barbarian Brothers themselves, are  relaxed and amusing, and Mull and especially Carradine work up some funny  characterizations.

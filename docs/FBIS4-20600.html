			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aerodynamic section, HOPE Team, National </F> Aerospace Laboratory]    [Text] To confirm the practicality of a multi-truncated  pyramid base pitot tube that was being developed through  co-research with the Tokyo Aircraft Instruments Company, the  pitot tube was attached to the tip of the nose boom of the Queen  Air B-65, an aircraft used to conduct experiments, for a flight  test. The pitot tube is to be mounted on the space plane (HOPE)  and the HOPE small-scale experimental landing aircraft. As of 9  September, there have been three modification inspection flights  and five data collection flights, and good data was collected  without any special breakdowns. Through the use of heads up  display, flight tests were carried out with precision and  efficiency and equipment for the STOL (short takeoff and  landing) experimental aircraft was used for on-board and ground  data collection.    The multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube can measure air  speed amount and direction simultaneously while fixed to the  aircraft. Moreover, it is a type of 5-hole tube that was  developed as an air current sensor that does not have the  problems of movable sections or complex correction procedures,  and based on the 5 pressures, it can find angle of incidence,  angle of side-slip speed, altitude, etc.    With flight tests, it is difficult to test precision, but  data concerning the precision of the pitot tube already had been  collected in wind tunnel tests. In these tests, therefore,  emphasis was placed on functions, dynamic characteristics, the  effects of vibration, temperature and air pressure changes,  practicality and reliability.    Pressure signals from the multi-truncated pyramid base pitot  tube are converted by the speed vector processing unit attached  to the instrument rack in the aircraft cabin into angle of  incidence, angle of side-slip, speed, altitude, etc., and is  output at the rate of 16 times per second by the ARINC429 bus.  This output is displayed and recorded by an on-board PC monitor  and also is combined with other measurement signals by the  ARINC-PCM multiplexer. Data was collected on speed and altitude  for the purpose of data comparison by diverging the pressure  from a conventional pitot tube for cockpit instrument use and  from the static pressure hole and using a speed and altitude  transducer. A vane was attached to the boom tip on the right  wing end, and angle of incidence and angle of side-slip were  used as reference data. Aircraft attitude angle, acceleration,  path angle, etc., were measured with inertial navigation  equipment (IRU). Data recorders were not mounted on the aircraft  because all data was transmitted to the ground by telemetry.    The following were the results of the flight tests:    (1) While on the ground, equipment ceased to function due to  momentary power loss on the aircraft, but there was no abnormal  shutdown of equipment during flight.    (2) During horizontal, regular flight, speed and altitude  data from conventional instruments and from the multi-truncated  pyramid base pitot tube were compared, and it was confirmed that  the output was adequate. Figure 1 is a sample from an altitude  of about 2,400 meters (8,000 feet). The error slope for speed is  the effect of position error.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-48A>      Figure 1:  Altitude, Speed Signal Comparison </FIG>     (3) Data on angle of incidence and angle of side-slip  collected during horizontal regular flight by three methods --  vane, IRU and multi-truncated pyramid base pitot tube system --  were compared. Absolute values differed because the wing tip  section and nose section were under separate local flow  conditions, but they all displayed essentially the same  behavior. Figure 2 is a sample from an altitude of about 3,000 m  (10,000 ft).   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-49A>      Figure 2:  Angle of Incidence Signal Comparison </FIG>     (4) There was no difference between cases when a pitot  heater  was used and when it was not.    (5) Angle of incidence and angle of side-slip response  characteristics resulting from vertical short-term movement  caused by sudden elevator manipulation and from Dutch roll  resulting from sudden rudder manipulation were studied. Figure 3  shows response time samples at about 2,400 m (8,00 ft) altitude  and about 50 m/s (100 kt) speed.   <FIG ID=JPRS-JST-012L-50A>      Figure 3: Angle of Incidence Response Times </FIG>     (6) Angle of incidence sweep tests were conducted and angle  of incidence data was collected from 0 to 21.    (7) Angle of side-slip sweep tests were conducted and angle  of side-slip data was collected from -13 to +14.    (8) Visual inspection after landing did not turn up any  clogging of holes due to insects, dust, etc.    These flight tests confirmed that this pitot tube can stand  up to use as air flow sensors for use in flight tests, but since  some software problems were revealed, modifications are  scheduled to be made before the next experiment. Additionally,  since the minimum external air temperature was 8C at 3,000  m (10,000 ft) altitude, there was no problem with moisture  adhesion, but that effect is scheduled to be investigated  through experiments during the winter.</p>

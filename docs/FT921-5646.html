			<p>920303 FT  03 MAR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading NEWS of the proposed placing of a sizeable chunk of Wellcome shares in the market cast a shadow over trading in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo. March went into retreat shortly after its opening at 2,567 and was pushed lower by a big seller around 10am, causing the contract to fall to 2,556. Buyers, mainly looking for protection against further falls in the pharmaceutical sector, were however seen at the lower levels helping steady trading in the index. Dealers concentrated on spread trading in the early to mid-afternoon before a big buyer of a 150 lots triggered a squeeze late in the session sending March forward. A firm firm opening on Wall Street was also said to have helped the advance. March closed at 2,569 around 11 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 6 points. Turnover was a poor 4,686. In traded options, turnover improved to reach 29,978 contracts, with the FT-SE 100 index option accounting for 10,778 lots. Midland Bank was the busiest stock option. It traded 1,536 lots, followed by Hanson with 1,339 lots dealt. British Gas, Wellcome and Lonrho were also busy.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Honda plans 50% rise in sales to European markets HONDA, the Japanese carmaker, is seeking to increase its sales in Europe by more than 50 per cent in the next three years to around 270,000 in 1995 from 180,000 last year. Mr Yuji Saito, Honda Europe car sales director, said the higher sales would be driven by rising production from Honda's first European car plant, at Swindon in the UK. The expansion of production in Europe by Honda and other Japanese carmakers, including Nissan and Toyota, is facing mounting resistance from established carmakers in Europe in the face of steeply falling demand in the west European new car market. The established carmakers are calling for a sharper cut in direct vehicle imports from Japan. Honda's Pounds 300m car plant, which has been added to the group's Pounds 70m car engine facility at the same site, began production last October and is due to reach its planned capacity of 100,000 cars a year in 1995. Mr Saito said that by the mid-1990s Honda planned to export around 150,000 cars a year to Europe from Japan. UK production would total around 100,000 a year and 20,000 cars a year would be exported to Europe from Honda plants in North America. By 1995 the plant will be able to produce 200,000 engines a year. Some 75,687 engines were produced last year. Some 32,400 Honda Concerto cars were produced in the UK last year under contract at Rover's assembly plant at Longbridge, Birmingham, but production will be switched to Honda's Swindon plant from late 1994, with the launch of a new generation Concerto. Honda sales were planned to reach 250,000 a year in west Europe and 20,000 a year in east Europe by 1995, said Mr Saito. Honda is in fourth place among the Japanese carmakers in Europe, with a 1.3 per cent share of the west European car market in 1992. The Honda distribution network in Europe is being expanded to cope with the planned sales growth, with the number of dealers rising to 2,000 by 1995 from 1,750 at present, said Mr Saito. In addition Honda is seeking to establish a 200-strong dealer network in east Europe by the mid-1990s. Honda is investing Pounds 300m in its UK car plant and Pounds 70m in its associated engine plant and vehicle inspection facilities. Local content of the UK-produced Honda Accord at Swindon, now more than 60 per cent, is to rise to 80 per cent next year.</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. PROBES PLAN TO TURN CONDOS INTO APARTMENTS  </P> <P> Los Angeles city officials are investigating whether the developer of a luxury  condominium complex being built in Warner Center can legally rent the units as  apartments instead of selling them.  </P> <P> Officials of the city's Planning, Transportation and Building and Safety  departments said they are evaluating the altered status of the 760-unit Summit  project in Woodland Hills after complaints from Councilwoman Joy Picus and  nearby homeowners, who said their property values will drop if the units are  rented.  </P> <P> In a letter to the three city departments, Picus said that the project had been  approved as a condominium project and that the change in status raised  questions about whether the project's approval should be withdrawn.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Right to Alter Project  </P> <P> Picus asked the departments whether the developer, G. H. Palmer Associates,  could legally alter the project from condominiums to apartments. She also asked  whether the firm had addressed traffic and parking impacts and other issues,  such as providing adequate access to the handicapped, before allowing the  project to go forward.  </P> <P> Picus also asked whether the development's zoning restrictions are being  observed.  </P> <P> "This has understandably raised a great deal of concern in the community and  raised a number of very legitimate questions," Picus wrote.  </P> <P> City officials said no determination on the project would be made for at least  a week.  </P> <P> Ray Willbaum, a Los Angeles city transportation engineer, said apartments would  generate more traffic than condominiums.  </P> <P> He said 339 vehicular trips an hour would be generated by the project between 7  and 9 a.m. if the units were condominiums, contrasted with 405 vehicular trips  an hour during the same period if the units were apartments.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Vehicular Trips  </P> <P> In addition, Willbaum said, 405 vehicular trips an hour would be generated  between 4 and 6 p.m. if the units were condominiums, as opposed to 512 for  apartments.  </P> <P> G. H. Palmer representatives were unavailable for comment.  </P> <P> Area homeowners said more apartments near the Woodland Hills complex will  reduce property values and generate more noise and traffic. They said the  developer had deceived them.  </P> <P> Palmer announced two weeks ago that economics and an analysis of real estate  conditions indicated that it was impractical to sell the units, even though  they had been advertised for sale as luxury townhouses. Palmer spokesmen said  the firm had never promised to sell the units.  </P> <P> Zoning for the property allows condominiums and apartments.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Chris Yeung] </F>   [Text] Shenzhen cadres could lose their jobs if they fail  to overcome bureaucratic delays which are hampering  entrepreneurs. Mayor Li Youwei has warned cadres their jobs  could be in jeopardy unless they transform their thought and  eliminate unnecessary bureaucracy. His comments came after  scathing criticism of the authorities by entrepreneurs. Mr Li  also urged enterprises to exercise self-discipline and not to  "take improper means" to get things done, apparently referring  to giving bribes to officials. Mr Li was speaking at a  symposium attended by heads of major enterprises and government  officials in Shenzhen last week.    General Manager of the Shenzhen Nanhai Company Liao Hanbiao  criticised the failure of the municipal Government to make good  its promise to grant autonomous powers to enterprises. "Those  powers which have been delegated or should be delegated to  enterprises have been taken back," he said in a Shenzhen Special  Zone Daily report. The newspaper quoted Mr Li as saying that  government organs should listen to the aspirations of  enterprises and help solve their problems. "Without  enterprises, the existence of many government departments  becomes unnecessary," he said.    Powers to have been delegated include the recruitment of  cadres and workers, and approval of projects. "Some  administrative departments have grasped the powers firmly in  their hands and often interfere with the normal activities of  enterprises," Mr Li said.    A spokesman for Dongbu Group pointed to the work-style of  some officials, charging them with low efficiency and excessive  control and interference. "(They) are creating problems for  enterprises," the spokesman said.    Mr Li accused some departments of putting personal  connections and emotions in doing business above rules and laws.  He called on colleagues to report any malpractices or abuse of  power. Any cadres who traded power for money should be  criticised and re-educated, Mr Li said. "(Those who) failed to  correct their thoughts and work- style should be removed from  their posts."    Mr Li said the municipal Government would take effective  measures to enliven the property and stock market, which has  become sluggish in recent months. He said the Government would  increase the number of flats for sale to people outside China,  and reduce the cost of land and mortgages.    Mr Li said the local Government had told the central  Government of its concern at the sluggish stock market and asked  for more flexibility in dealing with problems. But he stressed  that enterprises should "correct their thoughts" and should not  merely count on the pooling of funds from the public. "They  (enterprises) should make more efforts to enhance the efficiency  of enterprises and be accountable to share-holders and  investors," he said.</p>

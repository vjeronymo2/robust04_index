			<p>941104 FT  04 NOV 94 / World Trade News: Protectionist pressures worry Brittan The European Union must press more vigorously for liberalisation of world trade, Sir Leon Brittan, trade commissioner, said yesterday, or face mounting internal pressure from 'demagogues' who favoured protectionism. In his first important speech since losing responsibility for eastern Europe in last weekend's European Commission reshuffle, he promised that EU trade policy would give higher priority both to the interests of consumers and to combating other countries' unfair trade practices. Sir Leon said it would be 'disastrous' for Europe to lapse into complacency after completion of the Uruguay Round trade deal. It had to increase its efforts to improve its economic competitiveness and to open international markets. The collapse of communism had robbed western Europe's leaders of an important challenge, he told the Chartered Institute of Marketing in London, creating uncertainty and diverting attention from important new issues. 'If it is persists, this malaise can spell drift and decline,' he said. 'Put simply, the challenge for our continent-wide culture and economy is to survive.' Free trade was not a free-for-all, and world trade rules entitled the EU to act against dumped and subsidised products and import surges which threatened sensitive industries. 'These are simple truths, but they are hard to get across in a world where demagogues can be elected to national parliaments and to the European parliament, and receive substantial public subsidy for their pernicious charge that open trade offers the European economy to foreigners on a plate,' he said. Setting a world trade agenda after the Uruguay Round would be difficult, because it involved dealing with domestic policies and sensitive issues such as the environment, competition policy and labour laws. But countries had to talk about these questions. 'If we do not, we lay ourselves open to further demagogy, with Europeans alleging that other countries seek to exploit child labour in order to increase European unemployment. Such arguments are plainly nonsense.' He indicated that persuading developing countries to relax controls on inward investment would be an important EU priority in the new World Trade Organisation. Sir Leon said the 'illicit practices regulation' recently proposed by the Commission would enable the EU to press other countries more effectively to open their markets and trade fairly. However, he said the regulation was different from the US section 301 trade instrument, because it did not seek to make unilateral determinations against foreign trade barriers and would focus only on other countries' breaches of agreed international rules. He said the EU had to try harder to complete dumping and subsidy investigations rapidly, and to ensure that its trade policy reflected the views of importers, retailers and consumers, as well as of producers.</p>

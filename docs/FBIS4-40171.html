			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Vesti" newscast] </F>   [Text] At the Diplomatic Academy in Moscow today, the first  roundtable was held under the aegis of the Russian Unity and  Accord party. Participating were representatives of the  administrations of the CIS countries, politicians, and  diplomats. The prospects for Eurasian integration were the  subject of discussion.    Speaking at the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Sergey  Shakhray stressed that the time had come to think about making  the CIS into a confederation of an EEC type. That would not  mean the reinstatement of the former USSR. In the EAU--short  for Euro-Asian union--every state will be sovereign and  independent. However, there is an obstacle in the way, Shakhray  said; this is the continuing rise of nationalism in the  countries of the CIS, including Great Russian nationalism. He  said the key to solving the problem is the establishment of  genuine federalism and local self-administration.    Marat Shizhirin, deputy head of the Kazakh president's  administration, spoke about the mechanisms for the formation of  the EAU today. In order to enter the EAU, it will be necessary  to hold a referendum or to adopt a decision at the level of a  country's parliament. At the same time, the alliance will not  allow associate membership. The observation of interstate  agreements will be an absolute part of the EAU code. The  territorial integrity of the member states of the alliance will  be rigidly observed. The main condition for membership in the  EAU is the halting of combat actions. All this will create a  new impetus for rapprochement of the former USSR's republics,  both from a political and economic point of view, the speakers  said.</p>

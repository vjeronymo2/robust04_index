During the current  provincial meeting on economic work, a reporter from this news  service interviewed Zhang Zhiping, the director of the  provincial commission for restructuring economic systems. The  reporter asked him about the guiding idea behind economic  structural reform in our province this year.    He said: This year, the guiding idea behind economic  structural reform in our province has three special  characteristics. First, we are to break away from the old  structure and embrace a new one. Second, we are to change from  the past tactic of striving for breakthroughs in individual  areas to a new tactic, launching a coordinated reform package in  various fields. Third, we no longer rely on policies but laws  in order to expedite reform.    This year we will be shouldering a very heavy reform  workload, as the scale, intensify, and degree of difficulty of  the reforms will all increase.    In discussing the focal points of this year's reform,  Director Zhang Zhiping said: First, we are to concentrate our  efforts on introducing innovative enterprise systems and  actively exploring effective way to establish a modern  enterprise system while transforming enterprise operational  mechanisms. Second, we will speed up the reform of the finance  and taxation, banking, planning, and investment sectors and will  make a major stride toward establishing a macroeconomic  regulation and control system at the provincial level. By  centering around these two focal points, we will work to develop  a market system with the market of production elements as the  core, will step up the reform of the social security and housing  systems, and will deepen reform in such fields as external  trade, education, and science and technology in rural areas.    After summing up the experience offered by the pilot  projects  conducted by 60 enterprises -- including Anyang Iron and Steel  Company -- with the aim of taking stock of assets and  establishing join ventures, we will speed up our pace in taking  stock of the assets of all public-owned enterprises in the  province, will verify the real value of the assets of  enterprises and other legal entities, and will work harder to  find out ways and measures to solve various historical issues  that have been disturbing state-owned enterprises, thus paving  the way for them to plunge into the market.    This year, 100 industrial and commercial enterprises covered  by the state budget in this province will be selected to launch  pilot projects for establishing the modern enterprise system,  and our aim is to have 25 percent of such enterprises in the  province, thus accomplishing the reform of introducing the  company system by the end of the year. As for basic trades  which have an important bearing on the national economy, the  state's role as capital owner will fade out this year. In this  connection, three to five enterprises will be selected to issue  shares for sale on the stock market, and five to eight  enterprises will be selected to become listed companies in major  national stock exchanges. Meanwhile, those enterprises which  are undertaking the pilot joint stock system projects are  required to take stock of their assets according to the company  law.</p>

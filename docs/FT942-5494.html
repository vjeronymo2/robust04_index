			<p>940604 FT  04 JUN 94 / IRA outdone by tragedy: Helicopter deaths leave hole in intelligence operations In human terms the helicopter crash on the Mull of Kintyre was a bigger blow to Northern Ireland's security forces than any single terrorist act since the Troubles began 25 years ago. Beyond the grieving, a complex debate was under way about the precise implications that such a loss would have on Britain's ability to deal effectively with the IRA. With the exception of the four RAF crew, all the victims were in important positions in intelligence - the most crucial area of counter-terrorist operations. They included 10 members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch, nine army officers linked to military intelligence and six members of the Northern Ireland Office, among them representatives of MI5. The most senior of the named victims was the RUC's assistant chief constable Brian Fitzsimons. As head of the RUC's 'E' Department, Mr Fitz-simons was responsible for co-ordinating intelligence gathering with other agencies and police units. His department controls specialist SAS-trained surveillance units and runs undercover agents. Also killed was Det Chief Supt Maurice Neilly, head of Special Branch (Northern Region) which covers one of the traditional republican strongholds in the Londonderry area. Other regional middle-ranking special branch officers were killed. Combating the loss caused by the crash will be high on the agenda at the next meeting of the low-profile Province Executive Committee, the body in charge of day-to day operation of anti-terrorist activity. The committee comprises the RUC deputy chief constable (operations), the army commander of land forces and high-ranking intelligence officers. It emerged last night that Mr Fitzsimons served on the committee. One senior RUC source spoke yesterday of the 'tragic act of God' which 'had done what the IRA had failed to do for 25 years'. This view was echoed by Mr Jeremy Hanley, armed forces minister, who said: 'They are going to be very difficult to replace.' Other senior anti-terrorist sources were more measured in their assessment of the longer-term implications of the crash. One insisted that all the information known to the victims was 'fully documented and computerised'. Mr Fitzsimons was due to leave the RUC shortly to take up a post as chief of security for Ulster Bank. His deputy - who was not involved in the crash - and other officers of similar grade are understood to have been briefed about some key Special Branch operations. Many senior RUC officers have specialist anti-terrorist expertise. As one anti-terrorist source said yesterday: 'There will be a slight hiccup, but otherwise people should be able to rearrange their desks fairly smoothly.' Within the army, Northern Ireland operations have for years involved relatively short-term postings for intelligence personnel. Replacement of those killed is also likely to involve minimum disruption. At MI5's London headquarters replacements would have been lined up by as soon as last night. In the coming days one of the top priorities for people such as Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, and Sir Hugh Annesley, chief constable of the RUC - who both said the deaths had been a shattering blow - will be to regain the propaganda initiative from the IRA as the peace process enters a potentially crucial stage. The crash was not the result of sabotage, and no security was breached by the terrorists. But security sources fully expect that IRA leaders will now test the operational resilience of the counter-terrorist effort as it comes to terms with the tragic human loss.</p>

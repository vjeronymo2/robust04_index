			<p><P> September 20, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> $5.4 BILLION IN ROAD, RAIL PROJECTS OKD;  </P> <P> TRANSPORTATION: SAN DIEGO COUNTY WINS APPROVAL FOR $365 MILLION IN RAIL AND  TROLLEY SERVICES AND $90 MILLION FOR HIGHWAY PROJECTS.  </P> <P> Doling out the rewards of an increased gasoline tax, the California  Transportation Commission on Wednesday approved $5.4 billion in new road and  rail projects designed to unclog streets and freeways and nudge motorists out  of their cars and into mass transit.  </P> <P> With few exceptions, the gubernatorial commission followed the recommendations  of its staff in voting to give the bulk of the money to projects in urban areas  like Los Angeles and San Diego counties.  </P> <P> In the state's population centers, the commission allotted as much money for  commuter, urban and intercity rail projects as it did for road programs. Los  Angeles County alone was slated to get $1.4 billion in rail projects. "This  year's program is a very heavy rail program. We've never had anything like it  before," said Peter Hathaway, the commission's deputy director for finance and  highways.  </P> <P> San Diego County fared nearly as well, winning approval for $40 million to set  up commuter rail service between Oceanside and San Diego, and $325 million for  extensions and improvements to the San Diego Trolley.  </P> <P> The only highway projects approved in San Diego County were a $90-million  project to complete Interstate 15 along 40th Street, and $25 million to help  build the California 125 freeway through Lemon Grove. However, the commission  rejected $35 million to extend Route 125 north of La Mesa.  </P> <P> It also denied $120 million for a controversial interchange linking Interstates  5 and 805 to a new east-west Route 56, which is a proposed freeway connecting  Interstate 15 to I-5. The 5-805-56 interchange was also designed to widen the  congested intersection of 5 and 805 to 24 lanes. It was approved by the  California Coastal Commission just last week.  </P> <P> The Oceanside rail link that did win funding is expected to have diesel-powered  engines pulling at least 2,000 passengers daily aboard double-decker rail cars  beginning in November, 1992.  </P> <P> Future improvements to the San Diego Trolley line include expanding the East  Line from El Cajon to Santee, and the North Line from the Santa Fe Depot to Old  Town.  </P> <P> Other rail projects funded by the commission Wednesday included $500 million to  help extend Metro Rail from the North Hollywood station to Sepulveda Boulevard  in Van Nuys and $123 million for computer rail improvements for lines from Los  Angeles to San Bernardino, Los Angeles to Ventura and from Fullerton to Redondo  Junction. Another $105 million was alloted for construction of a light rail  line from Norwalk-El Segundo to Westchester via Los Angeles International  Airport and $350 million to construct a 13.6 mile light rail line from Sierra  Madre Villa in eastern Pasadenea to Union Station.  </P> <P> Both road and rail projects were spread out over seven years in a State  Transportation Improvement Program, which set a tentative date for construction  to begin and the total amount the state was willing to devote to each project.  Even though the dollars for each project stacked up into the millions, few were  given full funding. In most cases, commissioners expect local officials either  to come back in later years for more money or to match the state dollars with  local dollars.  </P> <P> While money for the projects came from a variety of revenue sources, a gasoline  tax increase and a $1 billion bond issue for rail transit approved by the  voters in June enabled the commissioners to endorse hundreds of projects that  had been delayed for years because of lack of funds. Motorists began paying a  five-cent per gallon gasoline tax increase Aug 1. The tax will go up another  penny each January for the next four years.  </P> <P> "This is a milestone State Transportation Improvement Program because there is  finally some money," said Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the  Senate Transportation Committee.  </P> <P> Commissioners offered one note of caution, however, pointing out that their  funding program counted on voters approving two more $1 billion bond issues for  rail transit. If the two issues are either voted down or withdrawn from the  ballot, Hathaway said there would have to be drastic cuts in the rail transit  program.  </P> <P> While projects costing hundreds of millions of dollars easily won commission  approval, it was one of the smallest projects -- $5 million to begin purchasing  right-of-way for closing the gap in the Long Beach Freeway -- that drew the  most controversy. Although the money moves the project forward, no specific  route has been designated. That awaits an environmental impact study.  </P> <P> For decades South Pasadena officials have objected to the construction of a  freeway through their city.  </P> <P> The commission will take a final vote on the transportation improvement program  today, but it is not expected to change its position on any of the projects  approved Wednesday.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Linda Monroe in San Diego contributed to this story.  </P> <P> </P> <P> ROAD AND RAIL PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA  </P> <P>  Following are road and rail projects tentatively decided by the California  Transportation Commission.

			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILLSIDE PLAN GETS TENTATIVE OK  </P> <P> After a year of study, the La Canada Flintridge City Council this week approved  in concept strict new rules on hillside development that would require new or  remodeled residences to be designed to blend in with the size and character of  housing in the neighborhood.  </P> <P> The regulations also would preserve the wooded, natural terrain in the hills by  limiting grading and preserving prominent land forms, such as ridges, knolls,  valleys and creeks.  </P> <P> Council members asked Monday for some modifications in the language of the  proposed ordinance, which is expected to be formally introduced Jan. 7 and  adopted Jan. 28, said Craig Ewing, community development director. It would go  into effect 30 days later.  </P> <P> The council also extended for three months a moratorium on hillside development  imposed a year ago in order to block new construction until rules are adopted.  </P></p>

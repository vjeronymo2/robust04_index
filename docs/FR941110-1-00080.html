			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=4 --> _the type of machine used to recover and/or recycle the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> material,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the name of the facility and/or the name of the equipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> employed to reclaim a previously used substance, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _a chain of ownership of the substance from recovery to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> final import,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _a certification from the foreign seller that the substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is previously used,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _a chemical test of used imports where the quantity of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import exceeds some specified weight (e.g., 10,000 pounds).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is aware that the importer may not always know if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported substance was in fact previously used. In the absence  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of information requirements such as those noted above, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer might be forced to rely solely on the statements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exporters from other countries_individuals about whom the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer may know little or nothing. The types of information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> noted above are designed to provide an opportunity for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent verification of the nature of the substance being  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> imported (both from the U.S., and by the exporting country  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> government).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As an alternative, or in addition to requiring import  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information such as that noted above, EPA proposes that it be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> able to request post-import information designed to ensure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the product is treated in a manner consistent with the claimed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> import status. Importers of used material that was not reclaimed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may be asked to provide information on the facilities that they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will use for reclaiming the used substances once imported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Information that EPA may require could include, where applicable: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=4 --> _the name of the reclamation facility that will clean a used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or a recycled substance to the specified ARI&hyph;700 Standard,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _information demonstrating that such cleaning will take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> place, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _the bills of sale from the exporter to the actual purchaser  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the substance (not necessarily the importer). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA requests comment on the above-noted list of potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information requirements, and requests comment on alternative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information requirements that can reasonably be expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in an accurate determination of whether the substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being imported is in fact used.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 2. Certification by the Country of Export  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> In future meetings, the Parties to the Protocol may decide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to require the government of the country of origin of a material  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to certify its status as used prior to export. While this might  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obviate the need for some of the information listed in paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.1. above, it would also require EPA to establish a program to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify any U.S. exports of used controlled substances. EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> already has a limited certification program for certain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reclamation facilities. Under this program, reclamation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities must be able to ensure that previously used substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be reclaimed to a level of purity called for by the ARI&hyph;700  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard. With regard to exports of used substances, with such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Protocol changes, U.S. exporters could be required to certify to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA that the ``used'' substance that it wishes to export was indeed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> taken from a use system. The exporter could also be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> keep records on selected items under paragraph B.1. above, to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilitate future verification. EPA requests comments on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach to certify that the used and recycled class I substances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being exported are being recovered from use systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Creation of a Permit Program for the Importation of Used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Materials  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is considering the use of a permit system for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importation of used controlled substances. In addition to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> measures discussed in paragraphs B.1. and B.2. above, EPA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes a permit system may deter fraudulent import of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mislabelled controlled substances, and may provide greater  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> control over the entry of used controlled substances into United  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States jurisdiction. The European Union requires importers to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have permits to control the import of mislabelled ozone-depleting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances that are used. EPA believes that adoption of a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar system of permits for the importation of used controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances may increase the effectiveness of enforcement actions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against the illegal importation of used substances into the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA seeks comments on the potential effectiveness of a permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system in controlling the import of mislabelled used controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances, in general, and the specific permit systems described  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> below. Under all options being considered, an importer would not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be able to import until a permit was granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, EPA receives a monthly list of importers of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances from U.S. Customs. With a permit system,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA would collect information from importers of used controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances and could match persons on the monthly U.S. Customs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list with the list of persons who have permits to import used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substances. A person appearing on the U.S. Customs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list who does not have a permit would be in potential violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the regulation. A permit system would also enable compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and enforcement staff to link suspicious imports by permitted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> importer to a specific person, i.e., the name and address of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> company. Importers would also be aware that EPA held information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on each import, providing a disincentive for fraudulent activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One option EPA is considering would require individuals to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> obtain a permit from EPA prior to each proposed import of a used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlled substance. EPA would require the person to submit an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> application for a permit 15 days before the import is due to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enter U.S. jurisdiction. EPA would then have 5 days in which to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grant the permit. If EPA does not act within 5 days, the permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be granted automatically. EPA would review the information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to determine if the information is sufficient and verify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accuracy of the claims. If the application is denied, the person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may appeal within 5 days. EPA would then have 5 days in which to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> review the appeal and deny or grant the permit. If EPA does not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> make a determination on the appeal within 5 days, the permit  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be granted automatically.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The application for an import permit for a particular  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> shipment of used controlled substances would need to include the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> name and address of the importer, their importer identification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> number, and the quantity of controlled substance that the person  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> intends to import. In addition, the individual would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to furnish information such as that outlined under paragraph  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B.1., ``Information Requirements,'' that ensures the substance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being imported is in fact ``used.'' EPA is requesting comment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a list of information requirements in paragraph B.1. to identify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> those which might best verify that a controlled substance is in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fact ``used.'' In addition, importers of used controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substances may be asked to provide information on the reclamation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility they will use once the substance is imported, in order  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to bring the contaminated material to chemical and physical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifications for sale in the United States. EPA is considering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this option because it would provide detailed, timely information  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on each shipment and allow more accurate compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determinations. However, EPA is seeking comments on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potential constraints on trade that a shipment by shipment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> permitting system might impose.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Guerrilla groups spurn Najibullah offer to resign PAKISTAN yesterday welcomed an offer by Afghanistan's President Najibullah to step down in favour of an interim government proposed by the United Nations, but the offer was dismissed by the guerrilla groups in exile in Pakistan, agencies report from Islamabad. Mr Mohammed Siddique Khan Kanju, Pakistan's minister of state for foreign affairs, said Mr Najibullah's announcement would ease plans for an Afghan assembly representing all sides. The UN plans to convene the assembly in late April in Vienna or Geneva as a prelude to the interim government. 'We view this development positively and believe that it will greatly facilitate the UN process aimed at the transfer of power to an Islamic interim government,' Mr Kanju said. Mr Najibullah, after talks with Mr Benon Sevan, a UN special envoy, offered to step down as soon as the interim government was formed as part of a UN peace plan to end 13 years of civil war. The UN plan is backed by moderate guerrilla groups as well as Pakistan and Iran, which between them play host to more than 5m Afghan refugees and the guerrilla groups. It envisages a ceasefire and elections. Pakistan has served as the main conduit for western arms previously supplied to guerrillas. It is now keen to use the Afghan land route to establish commercial links with the Moslem-dominated former Soviet republics in Central Asia. Radical mujahideen guerrilla groups, who reject the UN plan as a conspiracy to deprive them of power, said Mr Najibullah should resign at once. Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, a hardline guerrilla leader, said: 'Najibullah has no option but to resign because he is quickly losing control over the situation.' Mr Hekmatyar said power must be transferred to an interim government 'which comprises good Moslems and is acceptable to all sides'. That should be followed by a ceasefire and elections within one year of the power transfer, he said. Mr Burhanuddin Rabbani, the Jamiat-i-Islami guerrilla party leader, who has refrained from outrightly rejecting the UN plan like other radicals, called Mr Najibullah's offer a move forward but said it was not enough. He proposed that the mujahideen create an interim administration of their own to provide security in 'liberated areas'.</p>

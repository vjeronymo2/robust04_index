			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / DTI clampdown on 'pyramid' schemes The Department of Trade and Industry is clamping down on 'pyramid' companies supposedly structured in a way to generate money-for-nothing for their investors. In an indication that pyramid schemes are not just a feature of economies where capitalism is a novelty - such as the collapsed MMM in Russia and Caritas in Romania - the department said it had wound up four such companies in the past month. Pyramid schemes operate by recruiting new subscribers in order to provide the money required to pay off existing investors. The schemes are ultimately flawed because they require the generation of an infinite number of new investors. A team of department investigators has been scrutinising a number of such companies recently and is believed to be considering further closures. After a High Court petition on 'public interest' grounds, the official receiver was yesterday appointed provisional liquidator to Quillpunch, a company trading as the Alchemy Foundation. Quillpunch had been created using assets and subscribers transferred from Alchemy Marketing and Alchemy (UK), two other companies wound up by the DTI late last month. They had traded as Alchemy UK. The scheme had approximately 8,000 subscribers. Last month, the department wound up a similar company called 3T Publications, which offered a scheme known as FPW or Frequency Programming World. Customers were asked to send up to Pounds 70 a month to the company, which said it would redistribute the money between existing subscribers. A consultative document on reforms to the law dealing with pyramid schemes is being drawn up by the department. This is likely to be issued by December. The department said it was responding to complaints about such organisations, many of which operate under legal loopholes. 'It's a matter of people's judgment whether to join these schemes,' the department added. It highlighted a recent ruling from Mr Justice Chadwick that such schemes 'are bound to fail'.</p>

			<p><P> December 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DIALECT COACH FINDS HIS ROLE PUTTING AN ACCENT ON THE STARS;  </P> <P> MOVIES: THE MAN WHO HELPED SOME CAST MEMBERS OF 'STEEL MAGNOLIAS' ACHIEVE A  RANGE OF SOUTHERN SPEECH ALSO HELPS IMMIGRANTS AND EXECUTIVES SHED THEIR  DIALECTS.  </P> <P> Dolly Parton needed a dialect coach for "Steel Magnolias" as much as she needed  a few more rhinestones.  </P> <P> The actress-singer from Locust Ridge, Tenn., already has a genuine Southern  accent, thank you.  </P> <P> But the characteristic sounds of the South did not come naturally to all the  members of the new movie's cast, and so David Alan Stern was called in by  casting director Hank McCann.  </P> <P> Stern, 43, who lives in Park Labrea, is a dialect coach, a person who helps  actors achieve aural authenticity. (In addition to teaching accents, he also  guides immigrants, would-be anchors, executives and others in losing them.) For  "Steel Magnolias," a film about six strong-willed women in rural Louisiana,  Stern helped perfect the Southern accents of actresses Olympia Dukakis and  Darryl Hannah.  </P> <P> Stern, who spent a week on the set in Natchitoches, La., recalls being teased  by Parton. "Where's this little boy from Brooklyn who's supposed to teach us  little gals to sound Southern?" she asked.  </P> <P> As Stern points out, there are really many Southern accents, not just one. For  "Steel Magnolias," he taught very different styles of Southern speech to  Dukakis and Hannah.  </P> <P> "We were trying to create two different worlds with speech patterns," he said,  explaining that director Herbert Ross wanted the women's accents to reflect  their differing socioeconomic levels. Dukakis, who plays the widow of the  town's mayor, "was to have a very aristocratic Southern accent." Stern calls it  "plantation style."  </P> <P> "I've heard people joke that you have to learn to talk that way to graduate  from Duke Law School," he said.  </P> <P> Hannah, who plays a plain young woman hired to work in the beauty parlor owned  by Parton's character, was to have a rural Southern accent much like her movie  boss's.  </P> <P> Stern, who has a doctorate in speech communication from Temple University in  Philadelphia, has what he describes as "a completely non-traditional way of  looking at accents and dialects."  </P> <P> As he explains: "Most people look at accents in terms of pronunciation  differences. What really creates the essence of, say, a New York sound, even  more than the pronunciation -- what causes many of the differences in  pronunciation -- is that the muscles of the mouth are moving in a different  way."  </P> <P> Shifting from his upscale, non-regional accent to a stereotyped "New Yawk"  accent, Stern demonstrated that the latter is visibly different. A New York  accent "muscularizes" his lower lip and chin.  </P> <P> Stern teaches that different accents focus the sound at different points in the  speaker's mouth. Plantation Southern is focused farther back in the mouth than  rural Southern. The r sound is also very different in the two styles, he said.  Genteel Southerners drop the r after vowels, while rural Southerners have hard,  tight r's. Plantation Southern is characterized by certain rounded vowels.  Rural Southern has a more twangy sound. Stern also teaches his students the  lilt that characterizes Southern speech.  </P> <P> Stern, who started out to become an actor, says his aim in coaching actors is  to help them perfect an accent so they can forget it and get on with acting.  "You want them to be able to become a character who expresses herself that  way," he said.  </P> <P> Asked how he got into the accent business, Stern joked: "Doesn't everyone wake  up when they are 10 years old and decide to become an accent and dialect coach  for the movies?" In fact, he said, he knew he had a gift for mimicking accents  when he was about 10 and his father brought home the cast album of "My Fair  Lady," the world's only hit musical about dialect coaching. Stern effortlessly  reproduced all the accents on the record. "That," he said, "was when I realized  I was a parrot."  </P> <P> Stern made the transition from parrot to teacher of parrots when he was on the  speech faculty at Wichita State University and was asked by members of the  drama department to coach student actors. "Out there in the Midwest, where  everybody was twanging away, the theater faculty asked me if I could teach  accents to others," he recalled. He found that he could, and continued to coach  after he moved to Pennsylvania State University.  </P> <P> In 1980, "tired of academic poverty and academic politics," he moved to Los  Angeles and began seeking clients. "I was able to place very large ads in the  trade papers," he recalled. His industry clients have included Lynn Redgrave,  whom he coaches when she has to sound American, Michael York and Bronson  Pinchot, "a very quick study with dialects."  </P> <P> Stern found that he began to see more and more non-theatrical clients who  wanted help losing an accent, not acquiring one. "When I came out to Hollywood,  I was operating on the assumption that 99% of my work would be teaching English  speakers to put on accents for the movies. From the very beginning it was 50-50  and now sometimes 25-75 on the accent-reduction side."  </P> <P> Stern's accent-reduction clients have included actor Edward James Olmos.  </P> <P> Stern discovered that he could apply the same principles he uses with his  Hollywood clientele to non-actors. As a general rule, Stern said, non-regional  English is spoken farther back in the mouth than most other languages,  including Spanish, and involves less movement of the lips and the rest of the  face. Many non-English speakers have to learn how to use more of their tongue  when they speak, and so the first step in the process is doing calisthenics of  the mouth.  </P> <P> Stern never promises clients that they will be able to pass as native English  speakers, although some can, he said. Nor does he think everyone with an accent  should lose it. "People who do accent reduction often get accused of wanting to  homogenize the world, but I've spent hours on the phone talking people out of  it," he said. "I feel it's only necessary when the accent is interfering with  some professional or social goal the person has."  </P> <P> Sometimes the goal is greater intelligibility. Remarkably often, Stern said,  the client is simply sick to death of being asked, "Where are you from?"  Sometimes, the client realizes that his or her speech is making a false,  negative impression. Stern recalls working with a Moroccan client whose  monotone speech was routinely interpreted as unfriendly. Stern taught the  client the varied intonation pattern he says is associated with expressive  English (Stern calls it "jump up and step down").  </P> <P> Stern says he is increasingly called upon to teach accent reduction to speech  pathologists, teachers of English as a second language and others working with  California's flood of non-English-speaking newcomers.  </P> <P> The movies may be sexier, but accent reduction is, by far, the more satisfying  aspect of his work, Stern said.  </P> <P> The process of losing an accent can be very stressful, Stern said. "The hardest  part is coming to grips with the emotional impact of using a new style of  speech." However motivated to lose the accent, the client often ends up  thinking: "This doesn't sound like me. This isn't what talking has felt like  all my life."  </P> <P> "That's scary," Stern said.  </P> <P> Stern has enormous empathy for such students. After all, he says, using the  non-regional dialect he speaks so well, "most of my professional life is spent  speaking a dialect that is not my own."  </P> <P> Stern says he starts every day sounding like a television broadcaster. "But if  my wife and I have a couple of glasses of wine, I begin to sound like Brooklyn,  and she begins to sound like Texas."  </P></p>

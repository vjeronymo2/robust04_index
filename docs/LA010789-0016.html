			<p><P> January 7, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BAN AGAINST AMERICAN BEEF IN EUROPE  </P> <P> European countries care enough about good health to ban hormone-treated beef.  No one knows how rising U.S. rates for cancer and other illnesses are affected  by a lifetime diet of beef and chicken treated with hormones and antibiotics.  </P> <P> Meantime, small businesses specializing in imports must now close up shop,  thanks to new U.S. tariffs.  </P> <P> Why build up all this ill will?  </P> <P> Our government should immediately ban hormones and antibiotics added to meats  -- a gesture of good will to our own people and to Europe.  </P> <P> RUTH LORING  </P> <P> Calabasas  </P></p>

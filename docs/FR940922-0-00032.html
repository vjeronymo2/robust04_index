			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Amendments Made by Interim Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Single Family Property Disposition (24 CFR Part 291)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. The purpose of the disposition program was changed to place greater emphasis on homeownership and improvement of neighborhoods, by providing that the primary objective of the program is to reduce the inventory of acquired properties in a manner that expands homeownership opportunities, strengthens neighborhoods and communities, and ensures a maximum return to the mortgage insurance fund. (24 CFR 291.1(a).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. A definition of ``revitalization areas'' was added, which defined the term as urban neighborhoods that are targeted by a city for coordinating affordable housing programs and enhanced supportive services, and where a significant number of HUD-owned properties have been in inventory at least six months. (24 CFR 291.5.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Purchase money mortgages (PMMs) in revitalization areas were made available for 85 percent of the purchase price, at current market interest rates, for a period not to exceed five years for direct sale purchasers ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations) meeting FHA mortgage credit standards and purchasing properties for ultimate resale to owner-occupant purchasers at or below 115 percent of median income. (24 CFR 291.100(d).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The definition of owner-occupant purchaser was amended to limit it to purchasers who intend to occupy the property as their primary residence. (The rule had previously included governmental entities and private nonprofit organizations as owner-occupant purchasers.) (24 CFR 291.5.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Owner-occupant purchasers were given a priority in the competitive bid sales method. In revitalization areas, the priority was made available for up to 30 days and only for properties offered with FHA mortgage insurance. In all other areas, the priority was made available for all properties for a period of time to be set by the field office, depending on local circumstances. (24 CFR 291.105(a).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The limitation on the amount of financing and closing costs that HUD pays was removed, and the rule was amended to provide that HUD will determine the maximum limit appropriate for the area. (24 CFR 291.105(b).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. The discount available on direct sale purchases was changed from 10 percent to an amount to be determined appropriate by HUD, but not less than 10 percent, depending on the location of the property or the number of properties purchased in a single transaction. (24 CFR 291.110 (a) and (b).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 8. The procedure by which potential purchasers under the direct sales program are notified of eligible properties was amended. (24 CFR 291.110(a).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. A provision was added to allow for a direct sale to an individual or other entity not otherwise specified in the rule where a finding is made, in writing, that such a sale would further the goals of the National Housing Act and would be in the best interests of the Secretary. (24 CFR 291.110(g).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The rule was amended to permit initial 15-day extensions for closing at no cost to owner-occupant purchasers where documentation indicates that (1) proper and timely loan application was made, (2) the delay is not the fault of the buyer, and (3) mortgage approval is imminent. A further amendment allowed extensions at no cost, at any time and to any purchaser, where the delay is the fault of HUD or a direct endorsement lender. (24 CFR 291.130(b).)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. An amendment was made to provide that, in the case of an uninsured sale, 100 percent of an earnest money deposit made by an owner-occupant purchaser will be returned where the purchaser is pre-approved for mortgage financing in an appropriate amount by a recognized mortgage lender and, despite good faith efforts, is unable to obtain mortgage financing; and, where an owner-occupant purchaser has not been preapproved and despite good faith efforts cannot obtain mortgage financing, 50 percent of the earnest money deposit will be returned. (24 CFR 291.135.) A definition of ``pre-approved'' was added to mean that a commitment has been obtained from a recognized mortgage lender for mortgage financing in a specified dollar amount sufficient to purchase the property. (24 CFR 291.5.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

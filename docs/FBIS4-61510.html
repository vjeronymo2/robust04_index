			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, 5 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Alarming reports are  coming in from Yemen about an escalation of military actions  between northern and southern Yemeni military formations, which  have spread to various areas of the country. Government  establishments in Saana and some other parts of the country were  subjected to bomb strikes, and clashes are occurring in the Aden  area. Large-scale forces are involved in the fighting, and  tanks, artillery, and aircraft are being employed. This is  stated in a Russian Federation Foreign Ministry statement which  has been received by ITAR-TASS.    "These developments to all intents and purposes nullify the  efforts that have been undertaken recently by many countries,  including Russia, with a view to averting an escalation of the  conflict between the northerners and southerners, and to  inducing the Yemenis to seek mutually acceptable solutions and  the preservation of the country's unity. In effect, the threat  has arisen of the conflict escalating into civil war, which will  inevitably bring the Yemeni people fresh suffering, large-scale  casualties, and political chaos.    Stemming from its traditional friendly relations with the  Yemeni people -- in both the north and the south of the country  -- Russia urgently calls on the opposing sides to cease  hostilities immediately and to find within themselves the  courage to settle their differences peacefully. Moscow  considers that, whatever the reasons motivating those involved  in the conflict, nothing can justify the killing of people,  bloodshed, and destruction.    Despite the depth of the internal differences in Yemen,  Moscow believes in the political wisdom of its leaders, who have  in the past shown their ability to tackle the most complex  problems on the basis of the interests and aspirations of the  Yemeni people," the Russian Foreign Ministry statement says.</p>

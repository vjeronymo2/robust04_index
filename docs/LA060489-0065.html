			<p><P> June 4, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COMMERCIAL SCENE: ASAHI JOINS CUSHMAN IN LONG BEACH PROJECT  </P> <P> A February, 1991, completion date is projected for the $100-million, 26-story  Landmark Square in Long Beach, the first co-development in the United States by  Tokyo-based Asahi Development (USA) Corp.  </P> <P> Cushman Investment &amp; Development Corp. is the general partner and Asahi  Development is the limited partner of the 436,000-square-foot building under  construction in the block bounded by Pacific Avenue, 1st Street, Pine Avenue  and Ocean Boulevard in Long Beach's downtown redevelopment area. John C.  Cushman III of Cushman Investment &amp; Development said that such partnerships  are the latest stage in Japanese development in this country.  </P> <P> "Traditionally, Japanese investors purchased trophy properties --  high-visibility, institutional-quality buildings -- in major downtown financial  centers," he said. "Due to a shortage of these buildings and -- more  importantly -- an increasing awareness by Japanese investors of U.S. real  estate practices, they are joining hands with established companies and  developing real estate."  </P> <P> Long Beach is the fifth largest city in California, but it is fourth in  Japanese real estate investment in the entire nation, behind Honolulu, New York  and Los Angeles, according to David J. Churton, director of marketing and  leasing at Cushman.  </P> <P> "Japanese investors consider Long Beach, with its huge port complex, new World  Trade Center, Long Beach Convention Center and world-class hotels, to be a  major gateway to the Pacific Rim," Churton said. "They also like Long Beach  because it is virtually the only pro-growth city in the Southland."  </P> <P> Designed by the Landau Partnership, Santa Monica, Landmark Square will be clad  with red and salmon granite, along with light-blue reflective glass, outlined  with gray granite. Turner Construction Co. is the general contractor.  Construction financing is by Bank of America and BOT Leasing America Inc.  </P> <P> The building will have 23,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor,  with typical office floors averaging 18,500 square feet with eight corner  offices and column-free space. Churton said the project will have 1,373 parking  spaces in four underground levels and five above-ground ones.  </P></p>

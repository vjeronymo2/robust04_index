			<p>940530 FT  30 MAY 94 / UK Company News: NA Life buys Sun Alliance offshoot Sun Alliance, the life and general insurance group, has agreed to sell its Canadian subsidiary to North American Life Assurance Company for CDollars 22m (Pounds 10.6m). The move follows the sale of its general insurance business in Canada, announced last October. Sun Alliance sold that operation to Royal Insurance in Canada, at the same time as it bought Royal Insurance's non-life business in New Zealand, as the two British groups rationalised their overseas businesses. Sun Alliance is no longer actively seeking any new business in Canada, though a small operation to look after the multi-national interests of existing clients remains. Sun Alliance set up its life company in Canada in 1962. It did 'quite well', but once it became clear that with the disposal of the non-life business there was no scope for sharing costs or customers, the group decided it would be sensible to be 'open to offers'. North American, a mutual life company which is based in Toronto, is the largest direct marketer of life insurance in Canada.</p>

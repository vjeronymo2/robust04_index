			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Panorama" program] </F>   [Text] We are going to talk about Army problems. The point  is that figures from secret Defense Ministry documents,  published by the press in Moscow recently, have made us focus on  all these issues again.    Let me recall some of these data: only 51 percent of the  Armed Forces personnel and only one division in each military  district are capable of waging combat operations. Only 20  percent of tanks currently at the army's disposal can be  regarded as combat-ready and there are only a few Navy warships  that are capable of complying with the Navy regulations  governing the procedure of putting a warship in a state of full  combat readiness.    Replying to Mayak correspondent Yuriy Selivanov's questions,  Lieutenant General Aleksandr Lebed, commander of the 14th  Russian Army, deployed in the Dniester region, confirmed these  depressing data in a short interview.    [Begin recording] [Selivanov] The first question for  Aleksandr Ivanovich is connected with his appraisal of the  current state of the Russian Armed Forces and the military  reform under way in these forces.    [Lebed] The Army has been pushed up a blind alley, carved  up, and had mud flung at it, and this was a lengthy and  systematic process. At long last it is as though they saw the  light, not completely, but, nevertheless, they did see the light  and it is as though they started to be more receptive to the  Army and its problems; pay was raised and some half-hearted  attempts to build housing got off the ground. As for the  breakup, they did it fast, but to restore all this and put  things to rights, well, time is needed here.    [Selivanov] The second question: Independent states have  existed on the former USSR's territory for two years and they  have been setting up their own armies for two years. If at all  possible, could you sum up the results of these military  developments in the independent CIS states?    [Lebed] I would not like them to take offense at what I say,  but this signifies the Army's collapse: They destroyed what did  exist and proved incapable themselves of preserving what existed  before, with all the shortcomings -- and shortcomings did exist,  I am not saying they did not. They did not do anything  positive, just put the finishing touches to the process of  destruction and went about it with joy, as it were, getting rid  of Russians, getting rid of all those who dared to think  differently. This is a state of collapse -- there is no army.  What does exist are these decrepit forces of these apanage  principalities, equipped with rusty tanks and combat vehicles,  weapons that are not ready to do battle and so on. Well, this  is my view now. [end recording]    Despite this whole unpropitious climate that now prevails,  Russia has gained almost as many generals as was the case in the  entire and huge Soviet Union, in all its 15 republics. However,  if today's article in KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA is anything to go by,  it is the Russian Ministry of Defense -- Minister Pavel Grachev  and his retinue -- that need to be blamed here. Quite a few  pages would be needed to list this retinue.    Reading the service records of the closest bigwigs, some  people get indignant and angry, while others simply laugh  loudly. However, an ever more serious irritation at the  minister's personnel policy is coming to a head, if one takes  the officer corps of the Ministry of Defense as a whole.  Photocopies of biographies of generals from Pavel Grachev's  entourage, generals who, as far as the army is concerned,  climbed the service ladder unusually fast, have recently been  circulated and are being circulated in the Russian Defense  Ministry's and the General Staff's directorates and departments.  However, KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA says that what is really alarming  is the fact that, having encountered instances such as these,  more and more military professionals are beginning not to give a  damn about anything and are leaving the Army altogether.    Thus, the Army is being deprived of the main thing -- the  military intellect which, despite the not entirely unjustified  jokes among the public, did, nevertheless, exist in it.</p>

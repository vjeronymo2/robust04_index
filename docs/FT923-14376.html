			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / International Company News: Safeway earnings fall 6.5% to Dollars 33.3m SAFEWAY, the California-based supermarket group, yesterday reported a 6.5 per cent decline in second-quarter net earnings, reflecting the tough competition in US food retailing and the pressures of a sluggish economy. Net income in the three months to June 13 was Dollars 33.3m, or 28 cents a share, against Dollars 35.6m, or 31 cents, in the same period of 1991. Sales slid 2 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 3.5bn, while same-store sales were 3.1 per cent below 1991 levels. The company, which was subject to a Dollars 4.2bn leveraged buy-out in 1986, reduced its interest expense in the latest quarter to Dollars 67.5m from Dollars 84.8m a year earlier. The improvement was attributed to a decline in short-term interest rates and the refinancing of high-interest-rate debt taken on during the 1986 buy-out. Safeway's second quarter operating profits fell 13.7 per cent to Dollars 120.5m from Dollars 139.7m. The company blamed the weak comparison on a strong 1991 second quarter before recessionary sales trends had fully emerged in many of its markets. For the first six months net income dropped to Dollars 28.4m, or 24 cents, compared with Dollars 62.3m, or 57 cents, the previous year. The 1992 figures, however, include a one-time charge of Dollars 27.8m, or 23 cents, related to the early retirement of debt. Safeway said its operating results were also hurt by the low level of food price inflation. Sales in the first half of 1992 were Dollars 6.85bn, against Dollars 6.92bn a year earlier. Chase Manhattan Bank, a subsidiary of Chase Manhattan Corp, said it has formed a new group within its North America corporate finance sector by combining the project finance and public utilities divisions, Reuter reports from New York. The company said it had named Mr William Rockford to head the new group. Mr Rockford joined Chase in 1972 and has held positions covering utility companies in the US.</p>

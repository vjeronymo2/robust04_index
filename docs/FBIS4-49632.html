			<p>BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, May 6 (XINHUA) -- The basic policies  taken by the Chinese Government towards the Hong Kong issue are  not the result of the Sino-British talks, said a senior Chinese  official here today.    "They were, as a matter of fact, laid on the negotiating  table by the Chinese Government right from the beginning," the  official said.    Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office  of the State Council, made these remarks in a speech delivered  here today at a luncheon given in his honor by several local  organizations.    He said that before the Sino-British negotiation on the Hong  Kong issue, the Chinese Government had worked out a 12-point  policy regarding the Hong Kong issue under the instructions of  the then top Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping.    The 12-point policy, which was later laid down in the  Sino-British joint declaration and in the Basic Law, is the  basic policy of the Chinese Government regarding Hong Kong, he  said.    According to Lu, before the Sino-British negotiation on the  Hong Kong issue, Deng Xiaoping personally held talks with people  from Hong Kong and sent people to Hong Kong for many times to  make field studies.    A special team was then set up to look into this question,  said Lu Ping.    As a member of the team himself, Lu said that the team first  analysed the factors leading to the economic success in Hong  Kong and the conditions under which they were formed.    He said that the 12-point policy was formulated following  the  positive answer that the team had got after studying whether  these factors could continue after 1997.    Lu Ping quoted Deng Xiaoping's speech in 1984 while meeting  with the then British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe as  saying that "Hong Kong's prosperity and stability cannot be  maintained without a guarantee on its continued capitalist  system."    "I am confident that the principle of `one country, two  systems' is workable," Deng Xiaoping was quoted as saying.</p>

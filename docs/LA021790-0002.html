			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ONLY IN L.A. / STEVE HARVEY  </P> <P> Jim Purol's ambition is to sit in the Rose Bowl.  </P> <P> In every seat.  </P> <P> All 104,091 of them -- one after another.  </P> <P> He estimates it would take him about 100 hours, including a 10-minute break  every hour.  </P> <P> Purol, a 38-year-old comic, wants to break the old mark he set -- or sat --  when he plopped down 101,701 times in Michigan Stadium (and went through four  pairs of blue jeans).  </P> <P> And he hopes to raise $40,000 for charity in the process.  </P> <P> The city of Pasadena isn't sure whether to let him attempt the giant sit-in.  </P> <P> When he appeared before the city's Board of Directors (equivalent to a City  Council), one member called his proposal "stupid." But the directors agreed to  let him talk to Rose Bowl management, which wants security and liability  guarantees as well as a detailed fund-raising plan before it will consider the  stunt.  </P> <P> Purol, who is searching for sponsors, says he's willing to comply. And he  guarantees a professional performance.  </P> <P> "I start at the top and go all the way around, row by row," he said. "I don't  slide, either. I lift my butt off every (seat) number."  </P> <P> Has all this talk of a new ethics law made local officeholders nervous?  </P> <P> A few minutes after reporters were ushered out of a press conference in  Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky's office Friday, a Times reporter discovered that  she had left her tape recorder inside. And it was running.  </P> <P> When she returned to retrieve it, Yaroslavsky refused to release it, telling  her in a joking, but firm manner: "Wait a minute! That's a good trick. I don't  know what we said (after the reporters left)."  </P> <P> The councilman then rewound the tape to the point where the conference ended  and erased everything that followed.  </P> <P> Then he handed the machine back, with a smile.  </P> <P> Here's one that probably won't be condensed in Reader's Digest: The 36-page  "Official Earthquake Preparedness Guide," which consists of one sentence  repeated 36 times.  </P> <P> Naturally, a project of this dimension required two writers, Garrett Nelson and  Eddie Braun of Encino.  </P> <P> In this era when professional athletes sell their signatures, John Stallworth  of Pico Rivera -- and not of the Pittsburgh Steelers -- saw an old-fashioned  scene at the recent Greater L.A. Auto Show. One of the guest stars, Olympic  swimming champ Mark Spitz, signed autographs for free -- and kept on signing  when his scheduled three-hour stint was over because two dozen people were  still in line.  </P> <P> It's more than a month before the City of Industry's Great Snail Festival, but  we're in for some big excitement before then: A destruction derby next Friday  at the Indio Date Festival. This isn't just any destruction derby.  </P> <P> "Making a special appearance," a festival press release says, "will be a  12-foot high 'monster' tank that will crush cars like date pits." Let's hope  they warn the drivers' pit crews.  </P></p>

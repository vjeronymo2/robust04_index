			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Plea over closure of creamery DAIRY CREST, the Milk Marketing Board subsidiary, is coming under pressure to justify its decision to close its creamery at Hawes, North Yorkshire, the only Wensleydale cheese-making plant left in Wensleydale. The closure, costing 59 jobs, has been described by local businesspeople and councillors as a catastrophe for the area. Richmondshire District Council is calling for an urgent meeting with Mr John Houliston, Dairy Crest chief executive, to find out the reasons behind the closure, which was announced last Friday. However, the company said yesterday that the decision to cease production at the end of this month and transfer Wensleydale cheese-making to Longridge, Lancashire, was necessary for economic reasons. The company said the Hawes creamery needed investment running into six figures to comply with the 1990 Food Safety Act, whereas Longridge had modern facilities and spare capacity. It appears unlikely that Mr Houliston will agree to meet the council.</p>

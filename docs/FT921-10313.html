			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / International Company News: Berlusconi advances La Cinq bid MR Silvio Berlusconi, the controversial Italian media mogul, yesterday cleared the first hurdle in his campaign to take charge of La Cinq, the bankrupt French television channel, when his FFr1.5bn (Dollars 270m) rescue plan was referred by La Cinq's judicial administrator to the Paris commercial court. The Berlusconi rescue package involves injecting FFr1.5bn of new capital into the station, which filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, in two tranches of FFr700m and FFr800m. Mr Berlusconi, who currently owns 25 per cent of La Cinq, then intends to cut costs - by reducing the workforce from 910 to 613 - in an attempt to make the channel profitable. Mr Hubert Lafont, La Cinq's administrator, has been studying the Berlusconi bid since Monday. The proposals from two other would-be white knights - Vogue, the French record company, and an unknown individual - were rejected as unsuitable. However, the Berlusconi rescue still faces a number of obstacles. First, the Tribunal de Commerce, the Paris commercial court, will study it to see whether it is financially viable. Second, the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the body that regulates the French broadcasting system, must decide whether it will enable La Cinq to fulfil its remit. Meanwhile, the Berlusconi camp must press ahead with the financial arrangements for the proposed recapitalisation. A general assembly of La Cinq's shareholders will be held in two weeks to vote on the first capital increase with the second recapitalisation following two months later. Mr Berlusconi has said that Fininvest, the company through which he holds his La Cinq stake, is committed to reinvesting in La Cinq.</p>

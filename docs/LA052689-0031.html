			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: 3 SOVIET STARS ARE FREE TO PLAY FOR NHL CLUBS  </P> <P> Soviet hockey stars Vyacheslav Fetisov, Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov will  be allowed to play in the National Hockey League, the Soviet official news  agency Tass reported Thursday.  </P> <P> The announcement that the three were released from the Red Army -- whose hockey  team they represent in the Soviet league -- was made Wednesday and ended months  of speculation. All were members of the team that won the World Championships  in Stockholm this month.  </P> <P> Tass did not refer to the disputes in its terse announcement that the three  were let go "owing to reduction of staff" in the Red Army and "are now free to  sign contracts with NHL or any other foreign clubs."  </P> <P> Last year Larionov spoke out against the methods of national team coach Viktor  Tikhonov.  </P> <P> And Fetisov quit after an argument with Tikhonov over the treatment of players.  The two patched up their differences before the World Championships.  </P> <P> The New Jersey Devils have contract rights to Fetisov, the Vancouver Canucks to  Larionov and the Calgary Flames to Makarov.  </P></p>

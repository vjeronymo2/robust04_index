			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / International Company News: Westpac halves its prospectus payout forecasts WESTPAC Banking Corp-oration, a leading Australian bank, has been forced to halve prospectus forecasts for its final dividend because of an unanticipated tax charge of about ADollars 115m in its US operations which will reduce second-half operating profit. News yesterday of the dividend downgrade, from 12 cents to 6 cents a share, continued the crisis which has dogged the bank since it shocked financial markets in May with a ADollars 2.32bn (USDollars 1.65bn) pre-tax loss for the March half. This forced the bank into a ADollars 1.2bn share issue which was heavily undersubscribed, culminating in the resignation in October of five Westpac directors. The prospectus for that share issue made the 12 cents-a-share final dividend forecast which has now been revised. Yesterday's downgrade also claimed yet another Westpac executive, with Mr Anthony Walton, chief general manager with responsibility for the Americas and Europe, offering his resignation. Westpac said yesterday Mr Walton had informed the board he had relied on 'assurances from his senior management that all tax matters had or were being addressed'. He also said 'if the board wished, he would offer to leave'. 'The board has asked Mr Walton to continue in his executive position into the first quarter of 1993 to work out an orderly transition. It has also accepted his resignation as a director and acknowledged his outstanding contribution to the bank.' Westpac directors said they regretted that the final dividend rate previously forecast was no longer possible. 'The tax charge (which is still subject to final audit) follows recognition of a liability for additional US income taxes and related penalties and interest of the order of ADollars 115m related to third party interest rate and currency swap contracts and forward currency contracts assigned between's Westpac's New York branch and certain non-US branches in 1991 and 1992,' they said. 'The value of potential tax benefit carried forward that could partly offset the ADollars 115m liability is ADollars 40m. This would only be realised to the extent that profits would be recorded on future interbranch transactions. The extent, if any, to which this deduction would be realised cannot be predicted.' Westpac said the underlying performance of the bank had remained steady in the September half. Operating profit after tax was 'in line with earlier expectations' even though it 'absorbed further write-downs in the value of listed shares and adverse movement in the actuarial value of staff superannuation fund surpluses'.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Technology: Design tools a maturing market - An industry widens its range The development of many consumer and industrial products depends upon the design of sophisticated electronic devices and systems, and the speed at which new products can be brought to market is often critical for competitive success. However, for the electronics engineer, grappling with ever greater levels of complexity, the design process itself can be an increasingly difficult and time-consuming task. Without help, productivity quickly declines and development times stretch out. Electronic design automation (EDA) software gives the engineer a set of 'tools' that help rapidly turn concepts into products. Using design automation software not only speeds up the process - for example by providing libraries of commonly used components - but can also enable the engineer to check complex designs by simulation. As a 'top-down' design methodology, EDA allows designers to focus on the overall architecture and behaviour of a component or system, rather than being forced to deal with details at the structural level. Engineers can concentrate on what they want the product to do, rather than on how it will do it. The worldwide market for design automation software has grown to around Dollars 1.6bn, fuelled by the demands of the semiconductor, computer and electronics industries. Meanwhile, suppliers know how it feels to have been at the sharp end of a young and fast-moving industry - one which has undergone a substantial restructuring. 'If you go back 10 years, all the players that were key players then, are out of the market now,' says Joseph Costello, president and chief executive of Cadence Design Systems. Among the casualties have been once high-flying companies such as Daisy Systems - acquired by Intergraph - and Valid Logic Systems - which was 'merged' into Cadence at the end of last year. Aided by a string of acquisitions and mergers, California-based Cadence has now caught up with Mentor Graphics, its arch rival, and reported EDA software revenues last year of Dollars 392m. But both Cadence and Mentor reported losses in 1991, reflecting the tough market conditions. Many of the industry's corporate pioneers faltered - or are still struggling  -because they failed to anticipate the move from proprietary minicomputers to general purpose workstations, and then because they tried unsuccessfully to bundle hardware with software into turnkey packages. They also failed to spot the trend in the mid-1980s towards 'open' systems hardware and software. Customers wanted to be able to 'mix and match' EDA tools, and Cadence exploited this in 1985 by pioneering the design framework concept - an open systems platform for applications software that enables tools to be plugged together easily. However, there are now signs that the EDA industry is beginning to mature. Industry growth rates are slowing, and stable hardware and software platforms have emerged. After a wave of consolidation culminating in the Cadence-Valid merger, there are now only a handful of big suppliers. Aside from Cadence, which made a Dollars 21.7m loss in 1991, and Mentor, which lost Dollars 61m on sales of Dollars 400m last year, these include Racal-Redac in the UK, which managed to reduce its losses last year to less than Pounds 5m, and Japan's Zuken group. But several fast-growing smaller companies, such as US-based Viewlogic Systems and Synopsis, have also emerged to exploit market niches or new software ideas. Viewlogic, for example, pioneered EDA software which allows customers to make use of field-programmable gate arrays - devices that can be electronically tailored to fit specific applications. However, the Massachusetts-based company, which went public in December, has recently launched a broader package of 'next generation' design automation tools called PowerView. Indeed, EDA customers have generally demanded that vendors supply broader product ranges. It was the need to serve this wider marketplace which led to the merger in 1988 of two Silicon Valley start-ups called ECAD and SDA Systems and the creation of Cadence. SDA had focused on integrated circuit (IC) design automation tools, but recognised that it also needed to be able to provide the software used to design whole systems. Nevertheless Costello, SDA's chief operating officer at the time, admits it was only after the merger with Valid that Cadence could rank with Mentor as full range EDA supplier. Costello insists there is still 'a tremendous amount of growth' in the EDA market, particularly for simulation software. 'If you're not simulating you are really not designing on the computer,' he says. But not everyone is convinced. Some, like Charles Foundyller, an analyst with Massachussets-based Daratech, believe the industry's recent relatively lacklustre performance may indicate that the market for EDA software is nearing saturation. He is also reserving judgment on whether Cadence can produce substantial organic growth. 'Cadence has done a good job of hiding its problems by acquisitions,' he says. Not surprisingly, Costello rejects such criticism, arguing that, excluding last year, the company has had a compound annual growth rate on top of mergers in the past few years of over 50 per cent and that, in some product areas, for example analogue tools, Cadence has built up a Dollars 50m business from scratch. He is also confident that customers - who, he says, consistently identify as a key issue the need to reduce the time taken to market and master design complexity - will continue to turn to EDA for solutions. The only way to tackle these design issues, he believes, is to change the process or automate. Either way, he says, the EDA vendors should gain - through higher levels of expenditure on design automation software, or by providing consultancy services. Selling customers design expertise, as well as software, is an increasingly important source of new revenues for the EDA vendors. For example, earlier this year Cadence signed a three-year EDA consulting agreement with Japan's Sony electronics group. In five years time, Costello forecasts, consultancy could represent a quarter of Cadence's business. If he is right, the distinctions between software vendors, systems houses, consultancy firms and hardware vendors may be erased.</p>

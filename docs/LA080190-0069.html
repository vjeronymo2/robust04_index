			<p><P> August 1, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CARLSBAD TO APPLY FOR LATINO LIBRARY AID GRANT, WITH 1 CONDITION  </P> <P> Under pressure from Latinos, the Carlsbad City Council voted unanimously  Tuesday night to make a last-minute application for a $157,000 federal grant to  provide Spanish-speaking residents with special library service.  </P> <P> The council's action appears to have mended fences after a city official's  earlier refusal to put the grant application on the council agenda had angered  some Latino activists.  </P> <P> Still, the 5-0 decision to apply for the grant by today's deadline includes a  condition. The council, worried that the city will be stuck with paying for the  library program after the first year, won't accept the grant until its  potential fiscal impact is studied.  </P> <P> Some residents of Carlsbad's downtown barrio of 9,000 Latinos urged the council  to give them a place to learn American laws, where to find tax information and  how to seek a driver's license.  </P> <P> "We Hispanics are willing to obey all the rules of this country," said Luis  Maldonado, who spoke through an interpreter. "But a lot of times we don't do it  because we don't know the process."  </P> <P> He said many Latinos "don't even know how to use a telephone directory."  </P> <P> "Our knowledge is very limited, we need a trustworthy source of information,"  Maldonado said. "The place where we come from, there are not too many  libraries."  </P> <P> Clifford Lange, the city library director, told the council he has long been  concerned with serving the city's Latino population. But he said a survey  revealed that "the library is perceived as an Anglo institution largely  irrelevant to Hispanic lives."  </P> <P> Although the city's main library at the Civic Center is less than a mile from  the barrio, Lange said, "the psychological difference between the library and  the neighborhood is immense."  </P> <P> As Lang envisions a temporary, "transitional" information and referral center  to serve Latinos by, among other things, helping them get tax aid, find English  classes and provide a children's library.  </P> <P> It would have a bilingual staff consisting of a manager, an assistant and three  part-time clerks. Lang believes a state grant will "lay the groundwork" leading  to a permanent program funded by the library when the grant runs out.  </P> <P> The grant became controversial last week when Assistant City Manager Frank  Mannen, believing the grant's financial impact on the city wasn't fully known,  didn't put the matter on the council agenda in time for the grant application  deadline.  </P> <P> Gloria Valencia-Cothran and other local activists called Mannen's decision a  "slap" at the Latino community that showed how little regard City Hall has for  Latino needs.  </P> <P> Mayor Bud Lewis called a special meeting to consider the application, and  council members, after asking a few questions, voted without comment. The  action soothed injured feelings.  </P> <P> Valencia-Cothran thanked the council and said, "We see this as an opportunity  for these young families in the barrio to participate in their children's  education."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Habib Tarabulsi] </F>   [Text] Dubai, June 28 (AFP) -- Rival northern and southern  Yemeni forces are using fatwas or religious decrees, issued by  Muslim leaders of both parties, to justify continued fighting in  their bloody civil war.    In the north, the powerful Islamic movement al-Islah, which  backs President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, sees the conflict as a  "jihad" or holy war against the "atheists" of the Yemen  Socialist Party (YSP) in the south.    Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar, al-Islah leader, told  journalists recently that the war between north and south was "a  holy war that must not be stopped, even if it costs a million  lives."    Al-Ahmar, also speaker in the northern-dominated parliament,  repeated in his name a fatwa issued previously by 'Abd-al-Wahhab  al-Daylami, another al-Islah leader.    Sanaa radio broadcast the fatwa, which declared that "a  ceasefire in the war against the atheists is against the Islamic  Shariah (law)."    Al-Daylami, a professor at Sanaa university, advocated "the  continuation of the jihad against the secessionists, including  women and children."    His appeal was repeated by imams, or prayer leaders, in  Sanaa  mosques during Friday prayers.    But southern mullahs -- Muslim scholars -- close to the YSP  immediately condemned the northern fatwa as "heresy."    Southern mullah Sa'id 'Ali Nur responded with another  televised fatwa, calling on Yemenis to "put an end to this  fratricidal war" and reminding them that the Koran forbids  "brother Muslims" to kill each other.    However, other mullahs in the southern Hadhramaut province  issued a statement calling on southerners to "use their  legitimate right of self-defence" to "push back the (northern)  invaders."    The statement, broadcast on Radio Aden, added: "Our  religious  and national duty tells us to carry out a just fight against the  forces of evil, who plunder our wealth and attack our honour."    'Abd-al-Rahman al-Jifri, appointed vice president of the  breakaway southern state, used Friday prayers in Aden's  principal mosque to condemn "the call to murder innocent women  and children."    But al-Jifri, head of the moderate Islamic party League of  the Sons of Yemen, called for calm from the faithful who  demanded revenge attacks on northern residential areas.    He said al-Islah was "regressive." YSP leaders have accused  the movement of protecting members of the shadowy fundamentalist  group Jihad, which has carried out attacks on southern targets.    Al-Jifri also challenged northerner Shaykh 'Abd-al Majid  Zindani to a televised debate on the war of the fatwas.    Al-Zindani is a member of the presidential council at Sanaa,  as well as being the leading theorist of al-Islah and a declared  enemy of southern "atheists."    Al-Jifri said the TV debate would be refereed by the  principal theological authority for Sunni Muslims -- Shaykh Jad  al-Haqq 'Ali Jad al-Haqq, vice chancellor of Al-Azhar university  in Cairo.    Al-Zindani has not yet risen to the challenge.    In the meantime Shaykh 'Abd-al-Aziz Bin-'Abdallah Bin-Baz,  head of the highest religious authority in neighbouring Saudi  Arabia, sent an "urgent appeal" to Yemeni leaders for an  "immediate halt to this fratricidal war."    War broke out between Salih's forces and those of his  southern rival 'Ali Salim al-Bid on May 5.    The south declared the breakaway Yemen Democratic Republic  on  May 21, ending four years of uneasy unity since former  conservative North Yemen merged with the Marxist South.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Hong Kong, February 15 (XINHUA) -- The Vietnamese  boat people held protest demonstrations and hunger strikes here  today in response to the repatriation proposals endorsed at a  multi-national meeting being held in Geneva.    About 400 Vietnamese boat people staged a mass demonstration  at Tai A Chau Detention Center against the new repatriation  measures which order all the 52,000 Vietnamese asylum-seekers in  camps of Asian countries to return to their homes by the end of  next year.    Tension mounted in the detention camps Monday [14 February]  when detainees awaited the outcome of the Geneva meeting which  agreed to speed up the repatriation by returning all those who  did not actively object to returning.    Camp protests swelled across the detention centers in Hong  Kong. Some 90 people, including a few of pregnant women, staged  a hunger strike at Kai Tak Transit Center Monday, shouting  slogans in protest against the Hong Kong Government's screening  policy to determine refugee status.    However, the overall atmosphere in the camps had become calm  and peaceful although a number of peaceful demonstrations in  various detention centers took place coinciding with the Geneva  meeting, local acting secretary for security announced at a  press conference held here today.    Of all the 52,000 Vietnamese asylum-seekers in Asian camps,  about half, or 25,660 Vietnamese boat people, are staying in  Hong Kong. The majority of them have been screened out and the  rest are awaiting for screening, according to the latest  government figures.    Hong Kong Acting Secretary for Security Ken Woodhouse said  today that he welcomed the U.N. new decision on repatriation.    "While voluntary repatriation remains our preferred option  for securing the return of the Vietnamese to Vietnam, there is a  need to speed up the process of repatriation to meet the  internationally agreed two-year timetable," he said at a press  conference held here today.    The Vietnamese boat people have been a heavy burden for Hong  Kong in the past 18 years and the recent decision will send a  clear message to the camp population that their future lies in  Vietnam not in camps in Hong Kong, he added.    It was reported Hong Kong may offer three options to  detainees: the existing voluntary repatriation program, a forced  repatriation program and the non-objectors program for those who  do not volunteer to return.    "We will begin to work out the details for the non-objectors  scheme with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees as  soon as practicable," Woodhouse said.</p>

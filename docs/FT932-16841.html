			<p>930403 FT  03 APR 93 / UK Company News: Provisions take toll as Evered Bardon attempts to consolidate EVERED BARDON cut its divi-dend yesterday and announced a Pounds 57.6m provision arising from expansion in the eighties which has left the building materials group heavily geared. Pre-tax profits for 1992 fell from Pounds 26.9m to Pounds 18.2m, but these were wiped out by the exceptional item, which covered losses on disposals, investments and property. The exceptional included Pounds 30.3m of goodwill which had previously been written off. Under FRS 3, the new accounting standard, the group would have made a pre-tax loss Pounds 40.3m and losses per share of 13p. By sticking with the old convention, the group reported earnings per share of 2.9p (5.1p), but cut its final dividend to 1.2p (3.66p), giving a total of 2p (5.595p). Mr Peter Tom, chief executive, said: 'The extraordinary provisions made are a necessary part of the process of consolidation after the rapid expansion of earlier years.' In spite of making disposals worth Pounds 34m during the year, exchange rate movements added Pounds 64m to group debt, which is all dollar-denominated. Net debt rose from Pounds 261m to Pounds 307m, and gearing increased from 70 to 90 per cent. Since the year-end, the group has raised Pounds 24m by selling a half-share of part of its US operations, but gearing remains in the mid-80s. The company's extraordinary provision will cover the planned disposal of its UK concrete businesses and a quarry operation in North Carolina, but these will have a negligible effect on gearing. Mr Tom said he was considering a range of options to improve the finances - including further disposals, joint ventures or some sort of refinancing. Sales were flat at Pounds 336m (Pounds 334m) but operating profits fell from Pounds 45m to Pounds 32.7m. COMMENT Evered Bardon faces a long and rocky road for the forseeable future, with no obvious way round its debt mountain. Further disposals are likely to dilute earnings, and a rights issue is not a realistic option given the depressed share price, unchanged yesterday at 37p. The trading performance was in line with expectations, but analysts were surprised by the size of the provisions. There was an element of kitchen-sinking by the new finance director, who is confident that the group will be at worst cash neutral next year. Offering European competitors access to the UK through a joint venture might be one way of bolstering the balance sheet. Forecast earnings of Pounds 15m put the shares on a multiple of 18.5 - high enough until the way ahead becomes clearer.</p>

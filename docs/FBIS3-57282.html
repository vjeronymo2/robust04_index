Britain and Germany have already overtaken Russia in terms of  the quantity of resources invested in the republic's economy.    The former communists headed by Algirdas Brazauskas  abandoned  their former dogmas, renamed a section of the Communist Party of  Lithuania the Democratic Labor Party, and won back the people's  trust. At the 1992 elections they won a majority in the new  parliament, known here as the Seimas. In February 1993 their  leader became president. Our conversation with A. Brazauskas  began with his heavy burden and the prospects facing the  republic on its difficult road.    [Stroganov] Mr. President, in a public opinion poll  conducted in Lithuania at the end of 1993 you were voted "man of  the year," with opposition leader Vytautas Landsbergis, your  perpetual adversary, a long way behind. Why was that?    [Brazauskas] Presumably it was because of our party's  political line, which is to do everything to ensure that the  predominant factor in society is stability based on mutual  understanding and respect for different opinions. And second,  to carry out reforms at the least possible cost. It seems that  people find this line acceptable.    [Stroganov] Is your workload as president different from  that which you bore prior to the proclamation of independence,  when you were head of what was then still the Lithuanian Soviet  parliament and the Communist Party?    [Brazauskas] On 25 February, incidentally, it will be one  year to the day since I entered office as president. The result  of that year is this: Lithuania is living according to the  Constitution adopted by universal suffrage. Almost all the  institutions of power have been created according to the  fundamental law: The Constitutional Court, the Seimas, and the  government are functioning and there is now a new institution  which did not exist a year ago -- the President's Service.    It goes without saying that the president's workload is  considerably different from my past work. Because you bear the  responsibility not for such matters as the construction  industry, for example, or the whole economy, but rather you feel  responsible for the prosperity and the future of all Lithuania's  citizens, all the republic's population. The people's trust  cannot be compared with the trust of the party Central Committee.    [Stroganov] One of the main arguments used by the opposition  as it increases the pressure on the republic's authorities is  that in the past year Lithuania's economic situation has not  only not improved but has actually continued to worsen. Is that  so?    [Brazauskas] Let us compare the figures. During 1993, when  the government was being formed, the president was elected, and  the Seimas began to operate, we managed to stop the national  economy moving toward catastrophe. In the second half of 1993  signs of stabilization appeared. Income rose at approximately  the same rate as expenditure. The rate of inflation slowed  sharply. Recently it was in the range of 1-7 percent a month.  Wages and pensions have risen monthly. The national currency  has stabilized: A steady rate is being maintained.    Of course we have many problems. Take agriculture, for  example. We did not have time to create an alternative to the  former collective farm system. Everyone voted and we are voting  for individual farming and the return of property. But this  property must be used in such a way as to guarantee people  incomes and the state a product. Unfortunately this has not  been achieved yet. We have made some adjustments to the  agricultural reform as it was previously conceived, but  unfortunately this was late.    [Stroganov] On the subject of agriculture, a republic  farmers' strike is being prepared. What is the background to  this: Is it political or economic?    [Brazauskas] The opposition is demanding early elections.  The Constitution and other laws do not rule out that  possibility. However, I personally do not see any need for that.  And I doubt that the people will support the idea of early  elections.    However, the strike's organizers are trying to show the  people that such questions are not being resolved and are  arousing interest in fresh elections. A strike will not help  matters, rather it will aggravate the situation for people in  the countryside.    [Stroganov] Mr. President, in your view what is the present  state of Russian-Lithuanian relations? How can they be  developed further, in your opinion?    [Brazauskas] I regard our relations with Russia as normal.  Agreements were signed on a whole series of questions, economic  questions first of all, when Mr. Chernomyrdin visited Lithuania  in mid-November. These agreements form the basis for the  further development of relations. We are ready to deepen and  improve those relations, bearing in mind that there is a  situation here which does not exist in any of Russia's former  Soviet republic neighbors. I mean the matter of Kaliningrad  Oblast. I believe that the questions which the Russian  Government is raising about ensuring the oblast's vital activity  will be resolved and that talks will continue. This question is  important both to Russia and to us -- for our normal relations.    [Stroganov] Russia is first in terms of the number of joint  ventures in Lithuania -- there are almost 900 of them. But in  terms of investments Russia is only in third place. This means  that there are lots of small enterprises. I know that there are  plans for the creation of large-scale joint ventures. But at  the same time the Lithuanian opposition is actively working  against them because it is afraid of the powerful influence of  the Russian economy on the republic. What course will your  government opt for?    [Brazauskas] The opposition's reacts touchily to this  problem because it thinks that we are going to "sell Lithuania  off lock, stock, and barrel." But I think that partnership in  the economy and the development of economic ties with Russia  will continue. We do not intend to discriminate against it in  the process of the flotation of enterprises either. The more  foreign capital from different countries of the world that there  is in Lithuania and the more economic and other ties there are  with other states, the stronger it will be economically and the  more guarantees of the country's independence there will be.    [Stroganov] In your letter to NATO Secretary General Manfred  Woerner you expressed Lithuania's will to join that  organization. What do you think about Russia's reaction to that?    [Brazauskas] We expected such a reaction from Russia.  However, I certainly do not believe that this reaction will  change the good mutual relations between Lithuania and Russia.    I want to reiterate what I said in my statement on 4  January.  Lithuania's position toward NATO is not directed against  neighboring countries or any other states in Europe. We believe  that both the character and the aims of NATO have changed since  the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist. In addition, Lithuania does  not seek isolation from its eastern neighbors and neither  expresses nor encourages the psychology of bloc thinking. We  believe that the more countries there are under the umbrella of  European collective security the more calmly we shall enter the  21st century.    [Stroganov] Do you link Lithuania's destiny with Russia's?    [Brazauskas] You know that one can talk about shared  destinies only in the sense of the extent to which our countries  use mutually beneficial ties to enable them both to emerge from  the economic crisis as quickly as possible.    I would like to recall here the Lithuanian Republic's  constitutional act of 8 June 1992, which says that we will  develop mutually beneficial ties with each state which used to  belong to the USSR. However, we will never enter into any kind  of new political, military, economic, or other state unions or  commonwealths created on the basis of the former USSR.    I should like to wish Russia's citizens fortitude on their  path toward prosperity: May the strengthening of democracy and  the creation of the market economy bring real benefit as quickly  as possible.</p>

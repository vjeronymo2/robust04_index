			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / Lib Dems aiming for council gains THE Liberal Democrat party yesterday launched its campaign for the local council elections, hoping to capitalise on its success at Bath in the general election, where Mr Chris Patten, the Tory party chairman, was unseated. Senior party officials predicted significant gains in next Thursday's contest, particularly among what they perceived as hesitant Tory voters in the general election who were likely to switch sides. Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, said the government had benefited from 'people with their coat collars turned up furtively voting Conservative' in the general election. The Liberal Democrats would build on their successes in last year's local elections, he said. Mr Simon Hughes, environment spokesman, said: 'Some people who possibly feel a bit guilty about voting Conservative at the general election will try to reverse that at the local elections.' The Liberal Democrats are defending several council seats it won in 1988  - a bad year for the party which was suffering from the disruption caused by the merger of the former Alliance parties. Although the number of council seats up for election is relatively small, party strategists are looking to increase the number of Liberal Democrat councillors from 3,750 to more than 3,800. Other target areas for the party include Colchester, Harrogate, and Winchester. Mr Ashdown said the general election had shown that 'Liberal Democrats are on a rising curve, Labour are on a falling curve.' The party's local-election manifesto stresses the Liberal Democrats' commitment to providing efficient local services and improving local democracy and accounta-bility. It pledges that Liberal Democrat councils would listen to the views of local people through surveys and public question times. The manifesto also pledges that proportional representation would be introduced for elections in the control of local authorities. Council nominations to outside bodies would be in pro-portion to local political strength.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Central People's Broadcasting Station reporter Li Tao </F> (2621 3447) and Jiang Qianfeng (3068 6929 1496)]    [Text] Beijing, 28 Jan (XINHUA) -- Yesterday and today, Li  Lanqing, vice premier of the State Council, inspected education  programs for adults and teachers in Beijing. He also held  discussion meetings with some teachers' representatives on  reforming and developing education programs for adults and  teachers.    Li Lanqing inspected the new premises of the Beijing  Municipal Adult Education College, teachers' families, the  Beijing Radio and Television University, and the Beijing  Teachers' University. He visited administrative and teaching  personnel and examinees writing admission examinations for  graduate programs. Li Lanqing extended his hope that the broad  masses of administrative and teaching personnel will achieve  better results and maintain good health in the new year, and  wished them, in advance, a happy spring festival.    After ending discussion meetings with teachers'  representatives, Li Lanqing said: Adult education is a very  important component of China's educational undertakings. At  present, only a small number of people are able to receive  higher education. Yet China's current national situation  dictates that our society needs professionals of various skills.  Therefore, we should strive to develop vocational and adult  education programs, including radio and television education  programs. The road to become a professional should not be  limited to the "difficult path" of passing through an  institution of higher education. We should, however, construct  more "open roads" that will enable people to become  professionals through various channels. We should gradually  strive to realize the objective whereby willing students will be  able to attend school. Consequently, after completing compulsory  education, as many people as possible may have the chance for  further studies by attending various education programs  including vocational, adult, and radio and television education  programs. Only if we provide many avenues to train  professionals can we avoid the situation whereby once children  enter primary schools, they begin to prepare for college  matriculation examinations and thousands of applicants try to  squeeze through a "single-plank bridge." Only then can we avoid  cultivating and developing so many "narrow-minded and  nearsighted" students so that secondary and primary school  students will truly develop morally, intellectually, and  physically. Therefore, the issue currently facing China's adult  education programs, including radio and television education  programs, is not that we should weaken these programs; on the  contrary, we should continually strive to develop them.    Li Lanqing said: When reforming and developing higher  education in China, we should learn from and apply certain  experiences in the operation of adult education programs  including the latter's operating system, format, and methods. A  program of higher education is not the ultimate objective. Even  if we have a university degree, we should not regard it as the  end of our educational progress in life. Higher education only  provides the student with a relatively solid foundation of basic  knowledge. Adult education programs will be mainly responsible  for imparting special technical knowledge and for renewing an  old knowledge base once a person joins the work force. We  should pay attention to avoiding adult education program models  that are "small but complete" and narrow-minded.    He said: Adult education programs have played an important  role in history by supplying educational opportunities to a  generation of people who missed their studies because they had  been transferred to remote mountains or rural areas. China is  establishing a socialist market economy which involves economic  and industrial restructuring which, in turn, leads to  corresponding restructuring in China's old macroscopic education  formats and content. Consequently, adult education programs  will play increasingly important roles because more people need  to renew and supplement their existing knowledge base. When  evaluating whether a certain education system is doing a good  job, we should use the most basic criteria to determine whether  the education system can cultivate and produce various  professionals for society who are needed both now and in the  long run.    Li Lanqing said: How to properly conduct socialist  educational undertakings with Chinese characteristics is a new  topic. As China has its own national conditions, we may refer  to foreign countries' experiences in operating various  educational programs, but we cannot copy them without  reservations. We should strive to explore specific ways to  reform and develop our educational programs in accordance with  the requirements of "China's Program for Reforming and  Developing its Educational Undertakings." He stressed: Leading  cadres at various levels must change their concepts, must pay  attention to education and truly grant it strategic importance  so that it will receive top priority for development, and must  respect teachers and attach importance to education. He  reiterated: Any city or county that fails to properly operate  its basic education programs or settle wages owed to teachers  shall not be allowed to buy sedan cars or construct buildings of  two or more storeys. Furthermore, leading cadres there shall be  barred from going overseas.    When discussing higher education, Li Lanqing said: At  present, in addition to gradually solving the problem of  investment in education, institutions of higher education should  devote their primary efforts to further raising teaching quality  and to increasing the benefits that they bring to society; they  should also promote educational development through working out  reform measures. He pointed out: As the "211 Project" is a  project in process, it is necessary to gradually bring it to  fruition in line with stipulated standards. In addition, those  colleges and universities which stubbornly refuse to work out  reform measures should be barred from joining the "211 Project."  Institutions of higher education are encouraged to help  promote the "211 Project" through cooperating with one another,  compensating for each other's deficiencies, and bringing their  respective advantages into play. Colleges and universities  should not be allowed to join the "211 Project" if the regions  where they are situated are found to have poorly managed basic  education. To help increase academic exchanges, further bring  into play teachers' potential, and increase the benefits that  schools bring to society, institutions of higher education  should allow teachers to give lectures outside of their own  schools on the premise that they fulfil their own teaching  duties.    Li Lanqing spoke of the need to improve moral education  [deyu  jiaoju 1795 5148 2403 5148]. Regarding conducting education on  national conditions, he suggested relying on and using more  "current events" to carry out such education and called on  leaders at all levels to enhance education on the current  situation among faculty and students. As comrade Deng  Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with Chinese  characteristics is the Marxism that integrates with the reality  of contemporary China [shi jiehe dangdai zhongguo shiji di  makesi zhuyi 2508 4814 0678 3981 0108 0022 0948 1395 7139 4104  7456 0344 1835 0031 5030], we should earnestly study it. When  conducting moral education, it is necessary to adopt different  content and methods for different age groups. We should guard  against "insipid" and stereotyped presentation when conducting  moral education. Efforts shoud be made to enhance art education  and attention paid to nurturing youngsters' noble spirit. We  should extract the cream of 5,000 years of tradition and  incorporate it into the spirit of the times. It is necessary to  adopt various ways to extensively spread, popularize, and  develop the excellent traditions of the Chinese nation.  Accompanying Li Lanqing during the inspection were Zhang Xiaowen  and Zhang Tianbao, vice ministers of the State Education  Commission; Li Qiyan and Hu Zhaoguang, mayor and vice mayor of  Beijing Municipality; and Chen Dabai, vice chairman of the  Beijing Municipal CPPCC [Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference].</p>

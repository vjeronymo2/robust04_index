			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Igor Ivantsov, ITAR-TASS, special for </F> ROSSIYSKAYA GAZETA, under the rubric "Electric Power Sector":  "On the Verge of Instability"]    [Text] The stable operation of the Russian electric  power sector has long become a customary and even mandatory  feature of everyday life and the regular functioning of the  economy. The sector did not forsake its main feature,  reliability, in the past year, which was very difficult for  power industry personnel.    Professor Anatoliy Dyakov, the head of the new power company  "YeES [Unified Energy System of Russia], called last year a  peculiar test of maturity for the company. Having converted the  enterprises of the sector to joint-stock operations, the new  company restructured the system of management in the electric  power sector of Russia while preserving in the process its main  advantage--the unity of the power system. It is precisely owing  to this that, in the environment of an economic crisis, the  generation of electricity fell by as little as 5.5 percent last  year.    However, difficulties entailed by changes in the system of  management have become secondary compared to daily concerns.  Nonpayments by consumers of electricity have exceeded the 4  trillion-ruble mark and have in essence left the industry  without the funds to develop, despite it being necessary for the  electric power industry to commission 8-9 million kilowatts of  capacity annually in order to replace worn-out generators. It is  fitting to recall that in one-half of the power stations of  Russia the service life of the equipment has ended completely.    Financial difficulties were exacerbated by problems in  supplying the thermal stations with fuel, in particular coal.  Thus, at a number of stations in the Urals region fuel reserves  came to just over 60 percent of the 1992 level, and at power  stations of the Far East--just 30 percent.    The plan for 1994 is to reduce coal production by 50-60  million tonnes, which will primarily deal a painful blow  specifically to the electric power sector. After all, most of  Russia's 600 thermal stations use coal as their primary fuel.    The absence or clearly inadequate reserves of fuel pose the  threat of stoppages at quite a number of nuclear power stations.    In addition to the startup of new power units at the Pskov,  Nizhnevartovsk, St. Petersburg, and a number of power plants in  the Far East, the plan is to partially offset the potential loss  in electricity generation by using more advanced technologies  for fuel combustion and better energy-saving measures. For  example, the use of more up-to-date installations for gas  combustion will make it possible to boost electricity production  by 10-15 percent, with the volume of fuel used remaining the  same.    Nonetheless, Anatoliy Dyakov believes that the electric  power  sector has now approached the danger line beyond which its  stable operation may be disrupted. A tangle of nonpayments and  the absence of internal funds rob the power industry personnel  of the opportunity to acquire even the most necessary items for  repairs: metal, wire, and welding electrodes. In the opinion of  the representatives of regional power associations, this year's  repair campaign is in jeopardy. This is fraught with the danger  of consumers failing to receive the necessary quantities of heat  and light.    A way out of this complex situation is found in a search for  a mechanism to eliminate consumer nonpayments. Part of the  outline for solving this difficult problem has already emerged.  In particular, it is proposed to switch to a system of bills of  exchange for mutual settlements between the consumers and  producers of electricity. A draft for using bank bills of  exchange as payment documents has already been developed by the  Russian joint-stock company YeES of Russia together with an  underwriting syndicate and the Russian Brokerage House. A  mechanism for solving the nonpayments problem on a broad scale  may come along if the project is successfully carried out.</p>

			<p>920709 FT  09 JUL 92 / Voters likely to give Miyazawa a rough passage: Ruling party faces uphill battle to make gains in elections to the upper house MR Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, faces a tough time when he gets back to Tokyo from the Munich summit. He will start a gruelling round of electoral meetings in a national campaign for half the seats in the Diet's upper house. Yesterday was the official start of a two-week campaign leading to polling on July 26. It will be Mr Miyazawa's first national election since he took office last November. The prime minister is closely identified with the issue which is expected to dominate the campaign - the newly-passed controversial law to allow Japanese troops to serve on United Nations peacekeeping forces. Japan appears to be equally divided between those who support the law for its effort to increase Japan's role in international affairs, and those who are opposed because it might revive the role of the Japanese military. Mr Miyazawa said that Japan had to assume international responsibilities because the country's fate was common with the rest of the world's. He felt at the summit how much other countries expected of Japan, he said. Mr Miyazawa will be under pressure to explain his plans to boost the economy, which is suffering its most serious slowdown since the oil shocks of the 1970s. Leaders of the ruling Liberal Democratic party have proposed a public spending increase of Y6,000bn (Pounds 25bn) to Y7,000bn but the plan has yet to be adopted by the government. Voters are also angry about repeated involvement of politicians in financial scandals. Half the seats in the upper house are contested every three years. The ruling party, which has controlled the Diet's lower house since the 1950s, lost its majority in the upper house in the last election in 1989 at the height of the Recruit bribery scandal. It stands little chance of recovering that majority because it is defending seats last contested in 1986, at the peak of the popularity of Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, former prime minister. The LDP is defending 75 of the 127 seats at stake. Party officials believe they might secure 64, although analysts think it could be below 60. Either way, the party will need to rely on centrist parties to secure passage of bills through the upper house. Until now, the ruling party with 114 seats and the Komei party, its chief ally, which has 20 seats, have managed a majority of 134 in the 252-seat upper house. The loss of just 10 LDP seats would rob the allies of their majority and force the LDP to seek other partners, such as the small Democratic Socialist party, which has co-operated before with the ruling party. But the LDP's clout in inter-party negotiations declines as it loses seats. Fortunately for the ruling party, the main opposition Social Democratic party has annoyed voters for attempts to filibuster the peacekeeping forces bill. The ox-walk, a slow-voting technique, was widely seen as a waste of time and of taxpayers' money. The Japanese often use upper house elections to lodge protest votes, so support could swing to smaller opposition parties, including Rengo no kai, a party sponsored by Japan's trade union confederation, with 22 candidates, and the New Japan party, which is contesting 16 seats. The New Japan party was founded this year by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, a former LDP member and prefectural governor. Mr Hosokawa, revelling in his image as political renegade, is campaigning on a ticket of radical political reform. He is courting publicity by naming some high-profile candidates including Mr Yoshi Terasawa, former chief of the New York office of Nomura Securities, the broking company. Of the 127 seats being contested, 77 are decided in 47 prefectural districts where voters choose candidates by name. The remaining 50 are allotted by means of proportional representation, where voters cast ballots by party. With 38 parties fielding candidates, voters are spoilt for choice. Those disinclined to vote for the main parties can opt instead for the UFO (Unidentified Flying Object) party and the health-conscious Vinegar-Loving party.</p>

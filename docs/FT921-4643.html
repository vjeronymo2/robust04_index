			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / High street tax offices planned modelled on building society branches - will offer taxpayers a 'one-stop' point of contact for dealing with their tax affairs under plans for a fundamental reorganisation of the Inland Revenue published yesterday. The shake-up - which has been endorsed by ministers  - could reduce the Revenue's workforce of 67,000 by as many as 10,000 over 10 years. Unions representing tax staff fear that thousands more jobs could be at risk through the contracting out of routine clerical work. Revenue managers have commissioned feasibility studies into contracting out 30 per cent of jobs as part of the government's 'Competing for quality' programme. Under the plans, routine Revenue work will be concentrated in a limited number of large 'service centres' - perhaps as few as 20. These centres will handle routine clerical and administrative work such as the issue of tax assessments and the processing of tax returns. Greater use of new technology is planned, including optical character recognition equipment to read tax returns. Pilot service centres are to be launched later this year in Birkenhead, Leeds, Norwich and Walsall. Individual taxpayers will be able to discuss all aspects of their tax affairs through town centre 'taxpayer assistance offices'. Senior Revenue managers see such offices as 'welcoming but not lavish', using on-line computer links to access the computers which store tax data. The review says that tax staff in such offices should be given 'the information, the technology and the authority to respond to taxpayers' inquiries quickly and accurately; and, where appropriate, the authority and capacity to make decisions and amend records'. 'This is the new Inland Revenue,' said Sir Anthony Battishill, chairman of the Inland Revenue Board. 'Our vision is a department in which for all routine tax matters taxpayers have to deal with only one Revenue office and preferably a named person.' A network of specialist offices would deal with the more complicated tax affairs of the self-employed. They would also be responsible for chasing up non-payers and investigating tax evasion. Among the options under consideration for simplifying tax assessment and collection is an extension to the self-employed of the 'pay and file' system used for corporation tax. Self-employed taxpayers would have to submit their own assessment of what they owe together with payment of tax, for subsequent scrutiny by tax inspectors. Another option would be to end the practice whereby an employee's PAYE tax affairs are handled by the tax office which deals with the employer.</p>

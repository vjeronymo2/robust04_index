			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / US politics and the Chicago float factor IT IS perfectly clear who could win the Democratic party's presidential primary in Illinois tomorrow. His name is Pat O'Connor, he comes from Chicago's 40th ward and he would win, if he were running, because he had easily the largest float in Saturday's St Patrick's Day parade through the middle of the windy, frozen city and over a bright green river. National politicians are not really welcome at this public, but essentially private, celebration of Irishness by Chicago's policemen, plumbers, pipefitters and social club members. The three Democratic candidates stayed away, and not only because none can afford pneumonia at this stage. Pat Buchanan, whose name fits, was going to appear but spent the morning with Ukrainians instead. Most, however, put in time at informal neighbourhood parades yesterday. Their supporters were out working the crowds, though hopelessly outnumbered by those running for local office. By virtue of the number of placards seen and leaflets collected, Bill Clinton will beat Paul Tsongas here easily, with Jerry Brown nowhere, but this is hardly a scientific measurement.

Mr Clinton's pollster added that he thought Mr Brown was rising so fast that he could relegate Mr Tsongas into third place in the state. Mrs Nikki Tsongas, encountered at a Greek restaurant in Chicago on Saturday night, would have none of this gloomy prognosis. The big industrial cities of Illinois and Michigan have long been known for their political machines, many union-based. Certainly Mr Clinton has been picking up far more formal endorsements than his opponents, but there is doubt these days as to how valuable these really are. The Chicago Tribune reckoned yesterday that of the city's 50 wards, only about eight have machines consistently capable of delivering the Continued on Page 18</p>

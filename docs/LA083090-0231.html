			<p><P> August 30, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> THE HIGH SCHOOLS: CITY SECTION;  </P> <P> NORTHWEST VALLEY CONFERENCE;  </P> <P> NORTH VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Cleveland  </P> <P> COACH: Steve Landress, 6th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 4-6; 2nd in West Valley League, 3-4  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Canoga Park transfer Dave Erhardt gives Landress a pure  passer at quarterback for the first time in years. In a conference stocked with  marquee skill-position players, Landress said he "wouldn't trade him right now  for anybody." Erhardt (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) was a two-year starter at Canoga  Park and Landress said he expects to maximize the senior's talents by employing  multiple offensive sets. The running backs, dubbed the Bash Brothers, are  untested juniors Manny Valenzuela (5-11, 205) and Ray Haney (5-10, 200).  Returning linemen Mike Wamsganz (6-2, 235), Justin Hladky (6-2, 230) and John  Palacio (5-10, 205) will protect the backfield trio. Erhardt's targets include  returning lettermen Lance Johnson (6-2, 215) and Brian Griggs (6-1, 220) at  tight end and Robert Holquin (5-11, 170) at receiver. Johnson and Griggs also  will start at linebacker. Nicknames abound in Landress' defense, which includes  linemen Talon (The Viking) Sorensen and Min Tran (5-5, 185), who bench-presses  370 pounds and has been tabbed "Baby Arnold" by teammates. Lettermen John  McDonald (5-8, 165) and Delvon McDaniels (6-0, 190) will start in the  secondary.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Landress said that if Erhardt has the kind of year of which he is  capable, Cleveland will turn some heads. "I think he can probably roll up a  combined 2,000 yards with his running and passing," Landress said.  </P> <P> Kennedy  </P> <P> COACH: Bob Francola, 5th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 5-7; 3rd in North Valley League, 3-4  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: A quarterback battle seems likely between pocket passer Mike  McMullen (6-5, 185) and scrambler Tavarus Logi (5-9, 170). Whoever earns the  starting nod -- and Francola says he might alternate the two -- will spend most  of his time trying to get the ball to senior tailback Ontiwaun Carter. A  three-year starter, the cat-quick Carter (5-10, 175) rushed for 1,563 yards in  1989, best among area City players. Eight starters return on defense, which  improved toward the end of the season. Returning in the secondary are Billy  Sanders (6-0, 160), Anthony Jones (6-1, 180) and Frank Conley (5-7, 155). Damon  Tice (6-0, 215) and Alex Sawatzke (6-0, 200) return at linebacker. Jess  Rodriguez (6-1, 245), the team leader in sacks, starts at defensive tackle. The  offensive line is young and is led by returning starting guards Craig Gardner  (6-1 1/2, 255) and Troy Bregel (6-1 1/2, 210), both juniors. Juniors Danny  Milliken (6-3, 225) and Brian Meza (5-10, 245) will start at tackle. Three-year  starter and All-City soccer player Keith West (6-0, 175) will be the lone  two-way starter and then some; he plays at receiver, safety, punter and kicker.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: If the young offensive line holds, Carter again should lead area City  players in rushing. But that might be only half the story; Francola also plans  to throw more often to Carter out of the backfield. Francola believes that last  season's youth movement -- he started six sophomores -- could give Kennedy an  edge. "I think it should be between (San) Fernando and us, with Cleveland  deserving a good look."  </P> <P> Reseda  </P> <P> COACH: Joel Schaeffer, 13th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 5-3-2; 2nd in Mid-Valley League, 4-2-1  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Forgive Schaeffer if he feels singled out, but for the first  time in memory, he believes he does not have an NCAA Division I prospect on the  team. Not exactly a good time to be moved from the 3-A Division to 4-A. Reseda  might field one of its smallest teams in several years. As many as eight  starters might play both ways. Maurice Stepter (5-9, 165), who played fullback  last season and opened the way for 1990 graduate Joe Tushnet, moves to tailback  and also will start in the secondary. Juniors Dion Edwards (5-9, 170) and Jeff  Kent (6-3, 190) are battling for the nod at quarterback. Reseda's strength is  its offensive line with three-year starters Edgar Fernandez (5-10, 195) and  Mike Green (5-10, 195), both of whom also start at linebacker. Alex Mekari  (6-0, 200) and Mike Johnston (5-11, 200) are returning starters at defensive  tackle. Tim Schaeffer (5-10, 175), son of the coach, will play tight end and  outside linebacker. Ricky Ray (5-10, 185), who will play at fullback and in the  secondary, is considered one of the team's best defensive players. Sophomore  Gerald Cohl (5-8, 165) made 21 of 22 point-after touchdowns and six field goals  last season on the B team.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Schaeffer pulls no punches in regard to his chances in the 4-A  Division. He simply is not sure if he has the horses. "I feel like the cowboy  riding into the canyon," he said. "You don't know if you're going to get  ambushed or not." Then again, coaches in the conference have not gone up  against Schaeffer, either. He says they won't see anything that is too  startling. "I haven't done anything different for 20 years," he said. "I may  have a few little surprises, but what we've been using seems to work pretty  well, so why not stick with it?"  </P> <P> San Fernando  </P> <P> COACH: Tom Hernandez, 9th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 5-6; 2nd in North Valley League, 5-2  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Call it a study in relativity. Included in San Fernando's  reinstituted wishbone backfield are brothers Leonice and Johnny Brown, the  uncles of former Crespi standout Russell White. Leonice (6-2, 185) rushed for  1,097 yards as a junior at Crespi last season before transferring. Johnny, a  sophomore, is 5-10, 160. Mighty-mite tailback LaKarlos Townsend (5-8, 165)  rushed for 464 yards and averaged 7.1 yards a carry as a sophomore last year  and will start in the secondary. Senior Cruz Trevino (5-10, 170) will start at  quarterback. Tony Brown (5-11, 170) is a sophomore who also will play  cornerback. Only one starter returns at the same position on defense, safety  Keith Woods (5-11, 175). Keith's brother, James Woods (5-11, 185), will start  at linebacker. Will Taylor (5-11, 180) moves from safety to linebacker and also  will play running back. Mike Garcia (5-11, 190) moves from outside to inside  linebacker. Sophomore Ernie Salazar (6-1, 200), a fourth cousin of the late  Ritchie Valens, will start at linebacker.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: San Fernando was bombed in nonleague losses to Fontana, Crespi and St.  Paul to open the 1989 season before rallying in conference play. Things should  go smoother this time, with Fremont, Van Nuys and Dorsey on the nonleague  schedule. The best news? Granada Hills, which has won or shared four  consecutive North Valley titles, has moved to the West Valley League.  </P> <P> </P> <P> WEST VALLEY LEAGUE  </P> <P> Chatsworth  </P> <P> COACH: Myron Gibford, 11th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 3-5-1; 4th in North Valley League, 2-5  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The offensive backfield is stocked with talented senior  running backs, but a key to Chatsworth's success might be in how well its  untested offensive line performs. A trio of potential game-breakers will split  time at running back and also will play in the secondary. Rayna Stewart  (5-foot-10, 175 pounds) rushed for 159 yards in 21 carries last season, Mukasa  Crowe (5-10, 160) gained 123 in 18 attempts and Joynier Lockett (5-10, 175) has  regained his academic eligibility. All are seniors. "They are all very, very  good," Gibford said. "Each is an outstanding football player." Senior Brandon  Reudy (6-0, 190) returns at quarterback but is being pressed by Brian Comer  (5-10, 150), who led the B team to a league title as a junior last year.  Offensive tackle Rob Lurie (5-10, 215) is the only returning starter on the  offensive line, however. Delvon Hardaway (6-0, 165), a three-year starter, will  play at receiver and cornerback. Montay Hardison (5-9, 180) returns at inside  linebacker. Chatsworth allowed just 120 points in nine games last year, and  defense again will be a strength. "With the guys we have in the secondary, we  should be as good or better defensively," Gibford said.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The defense allowed an average of 211 yards a game in 1989, but the  offense averaged just 143. With increased offensive production, the Chancellors  could shadow the leaders of the pack. "I think it's the best football team  we've had in the last three years," Gibford said. "I don't know if we're ready  to play with the big boys yet, but it's a good group."  </P> <P> El Camino Real  </P> <P> COACH: Mike Maio and Ralph Stam, 3rd season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 6-6; 2nd in West Valley League, 3-4  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Last season's playoff upset of unbeaten and top-seeded  Granada Hills might have marked the return of the Conquistadores, a team that  was the pride of the Valley in the late 1970s but hit the skids from 1986-88.  The Conquistadores beat the Highlanders up front with superior defensive  linemen and linebackers, and although there are several holes to fill, this  area again will be a team strength. "We don't have that kind of quickness and  size," Maio said. "But we have some experience there." Troy Snider, an  all-league selection last year as a junior, returns. Snyder (6-1, 215) and  Chris Griggs (5-10, 170), another starter last season, anchor the linebacking  corps. The secondary will be patrolled by hard-hitting safeties Sean Boldt  (6-2, 175) and Ryan Marine (5-10, 170). Boldt is one of three candidates for  the quarterback position, a group that includes Evan Howland and Terry Morrow.  All three will play baseball for Maio in the spring. Marine is a likely starter  at running back. Jeff Sardell (6-3, 240) and Juan Hernandez (5-10, 185) will  play on the offensive and defensive lines. Kicker Joe La Firenza returns.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The Conquistadores admittedly were a one-dimensional team last season,  with running back Jamal Anderson -- who rushed for a school-record 1,153 yards  -- accounting for more than half of the team's total of 2,006 yards. El Camino  Real passed for a mere 257 yards. "We're planning on opening it up a little bit  more," Maio said. "At least, we'd like to pass the ball more often." While El  Camino Real might not duplicate last season's success, the Conquistadores are  again competitive, something that could not be said a few years ago.  </P> <P> Granada Hills  </P> <P> COACH: Darryl Stroh and Tom Harp, 6th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 10-1; 1st in North Valley League, 7-0  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: The nucleus returns, forming the Valley's most atomic  offensive threat. Brett Washington, The Times' Valley lineman of the year as a  junior, is ready to again dish it out and take it as a linebacker and running  back. Washington (5-11, 225) rushed for 1,156 yards and 12 touchdowns in '89.  Senior quarterback Bryan Martin (6-2, 180) passed for 1,414 yards and 15  touchdowns and ranked among the area's best punters last year. Senior safety  Derrick Stewart (5-11, 185) will play at tailback as well as strong safety. All  three are considered NCAA Division I prospects. Senior Robert Haywood (6-0,  190), another three-year starter, will play tight end and defensive back.  Granada Hills' offensive line, a problem area at times last year, is more  mature. Starting linemen David Villa (5-11, 205) and Jordan Fisher (5-11, 200)  return and reserves Greg King (6-2, 230) and Ralph Courtney (6-2, 215) also  lettered last season. "It's one of our biggest lines ever," Harp said. Eric  Moss (5-10, 170) and Alonzo Finney (6-0, 175) will start at receiver, with Moss  also scheduled to play at his all-league position in the secondary. Returning  starter Rob Kalinowski (6-0, 225) will anchor the defensive line. Washington,  Finney and Curt Hulshizer (5-11, 185) will start at linebacker.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: Granada Hills, which last season raced to a school-record 10-0 start  before dropping its first-round playoff game to El Camino Real, was 24-2 in  recent summer passing-league competition. Expect the Highlanders to come out  firing, especially Martin, who won't be distracted by splitting time at  quarterback, as he did in 1989. "The whole team is ahead of where we were last  year," Harp said. "We have experience. Everyone started at a higher level."  </P> <P> Taft  </P> <P> COACH: Tom Stevenson, 6th season  </P> <P> LAST SEASON: 5-5; 1st in West Valley League, 4-3  </P> <P> PLAYERS TO WATCH: Long a run-oriented team, the Toreadors might finally have  the tools to open up the offense. "We've got great skill people," Stevenson  said. "This is probably the best group we've had." Behind junior quarterback  Karlon Mack (6-3, 190), Taft will have the ability to successfully try the  airwaves, Stevenson believes. "He's got a very good (arm) and he can really  run," Stevenson said of Mack, who was ineligible last season. Returning  starters Vance Swendell (5-9, 175) and Darnell Hendricks (6-3, 190) will play  at running back. Hendricks played last year at tight end and safety, a position  at which some consider him a can't-miss NCAA Division I prospect. Daryl (Happy)  Cash (5-11, 180) returns at linebacker and receiver, and Tekro Blade (6-3, 205)  is back at tight end and linebacker. Other returning starters include defensive  lineman Willie Jackson (6-3, 225), two-way lineman Mario Alvarado (6-1, 245)  and offensive guard Greg Levy (6-0, 175). Jackson reportedly bench-presses 450  pounds and runs the 40-yard dash in 4.8 seconds. Sam Hardy (6-4, 245) will  start at middle linebacker and is "potentially the best player we've ever had  there," Stevenson said. Receiver-safety Ruben Benitez (5-10, 165) can cover  some ground -- he was seventh in the state in the 400 meters last season in  47.89.  </P> <P> OUTLOOK: The Toreadors will be entertaining to watch and could pose some  problems for league favorite Granada Hills. Avoiding injuries could be a key.  "This is a very good first group of kids," Stevenson said. "But after that,  we're bad. I guess our best are better and our worse are worser."  </P></p>

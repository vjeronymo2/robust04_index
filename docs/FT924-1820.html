			<p>921216 FT  16 DEC 92 / Arts: Sad goodbye to long term survivors - Television Television has come to the end of an era. In the past week two of its greatest stalwarts died: Dan Maskell and This Week. Both were significant not only as long term survivors, but as symbols of what British television has been in its first age: by and large a public service broadcasting system with good intentions and high ideals, dedicated to all the varied interests of its audience, and not obsessed with maximising either its ratings or its profits. Maskell spent his entire broadcasting career with the BBC. He began his television commentaries from Wimbledon in 1951, the year when Philip Harben presented a cookery series called Country Dish to mark the Festival of Britain, and the BBC's pin-up announcers were McDonald Hobley and Sylvia Peters. Television was still a gee-whizz gimmick and the senior service was BBC Radio with its Light Programme and Home Service. Maskell started as he was to go on for 41 years until his retirement earlier this year at the age of 84, speaking only when he had something useful to say, never using an unkind word, invariably courteous and urbane, always knowledgeable and audible. When he started there was no commercial broadcasting in Britain. This Week, on the other hand, was born into the commercial system in 1956 shortly after the creation of ITV. It was only three years after Richard Dimbleby had launched Panorama at the BBC and the idea at Associated Rediffusion (Thames Television's predecessor) was to offer a weekly current affairs magazine with journalism as good as the BBC's but a more 'grabby' approach. To achieve a high standard of journalism they made This Week a reporter-led programme and over the years employed James Cameron, Robin Day, Alastair Burnet, Peter Williams, Robert Kee, Llew Gardner, Jonathan Dimbleby, Peter Taylor, Denis Tuohy and many more. As to the 'grabbiness', having recently searched through many of the programme's 1,500 editions in order to present a retrospective on ITV tomorrow, I have been vividly reminded of what this meant. In the early days it meant stopping the ex-servicemen's busking band, The Happy Wanderers, in Oxford Street, whipping out a truncheon-sized microphone from your inside pocket (presumably with a hefty cable trailing down the inside of your trouser leg) and interviewing the band amid a huge crowd of onlookers. Later it meant building a full size replica of a Cruise missile on a lorry and trucking it around the home counties to investigate public reaction. Last week in a final edition that typified the programme's traditions - social concern and a determination to disclose - it meant taking your cameras out on the streets of London to show how life expectancy for those sleeping rough is 47 years. We are unlikely to see the likes of This Week or Maskell again. British television is now well on the way to becoming an Eastern Atlantic version of American television. Several of Britain's satellite channels, including Sky One, already consist almost entirely of American programmes. The commentaries on the satellite sports channels stand at the opposite side of the spectrum from Maskell's: these men, usually Americans, cannot shut up, they seem to believe that silence will be interpreted by the audience as death. The BBC with its recent timid decision to plan for a major reduction in its audience share appears to be opting voluntarily for a position similar to that of the marginalised public service broadcasting system in the US. And all the signs are that the new ITV companies coming into operation on January 1, after succeeding in the Government's new auction process, designed to bring even more vigorous market competition into broadcasting, will act more than ever like their American counterparts. Several, including London's Carlton, will buy all their programmes from independent producers rather than support their own centres of programme-making excellence. This Week is dying because Thames TV failed to keep its licence during the auction, and although Thames will continue in business as a major independent (they plan to go on producing The Bill, This Is Your Life and so on) it seems that neither Carlton nor the ITV network as a whole has any intention of running anything like This Week. There will still be current affairs, but the top ranked programme in Carlton's listing of 'Factual Programmes' is The Good Sex Guide, and in the first few months of 1993 the weekly slot currently occupied by This Week will be taken over partly by the independent company 20 20 Vision and partly by the foot-in-the-door Cook Report. Each outfit has produced interesting material in the past, but nobody is pretending that either will be supporting six programme teams as This Week has, ensuring that, at any time, a crew could be on the next flight out of Heathrow to cover any trouble spot in the world. That, say the people at Carlton, has become the prerogative of the news programmes. So what of ITV's main news programme? Sure enough News At 10 has just been modified to bring it more closely into line with the American model. There is nothing new about this; British news programmes on both ITV and BBC have been imitating their American counterparts for decades. When Huntley and Brinkley wowed the Americans the British switched to two-handed presentation. Now the three major US networks have reverted to the lone presenter: Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and Peter Jennings compete in trying to combine charisma and authority with down-home folksiness and through-the-screen acceptability (I do not invent these phrases, I assure you). So ITN has taken Trevor McDonald and promoted him to the single-seat role. Given the colour of Mr McDonald's skin and the terrifying enthusiasm with which Enoch Powell's pronouncements upon race were once greeted in this country - an enthusiasm which no one suggests has subsequently abated - this was a brave and admirable thing to do, but scarcely a move designed to boost the ratings, despite Mr McDonald's splendid professionalism. In the process they effectively demoted the excellent Alastair Stewart, who promptly left, and limited poor Julia Somerville to an 'Over to you Hugh' role. The second half of the programme, which has trouble holding its audience (people tend to zap away the moment the commercials start and then stay away) now contains a 'Focus' spot which does, indeed, look like a mini current affairs programme and sometimes contains good material. For instance the recent item following up newspaper campaigns on the appalling effect of EC regulations on abattoirs and scrap metal yards was strong, vivid, and important. However, if little bits of work like that are henceforth to be seen as ITV's contribution to current affairs then we are right indeed to mourn the passing of an era. To me 'news' still means the difference between the world yesterday and the world today, and the job of current affairs - however much the technology and the journalistic techniques may change - should be to explain the how and the why of those differences. Watching a reporter being kicked up the backside by an irate double glazing salesman, the sort of thing that happens in the Cook Report, has more to do with the Jeremy Beadle school of embarrassment television than with current affairs. So it is 'Goodbye Dan Maskell, goodbye This Week, and hello America'.</p>

			<p><P> July 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ACQUIRING MINDS;  </P> <P> A LOOK THE MEN WHO HAVE ENGINEERED THE DEALS THAT HAVE HELPED SHAPE THE DODGERS  AND ANGELS;  </P> <P> PORT FAVORS CAUTION IN BELIEF CHANGE IS RARELY FOR BETTER  </P> <P> Mike Port can coexist with the concept of free agency, and he can buy the farm,  but after five years on the job, the Angels' general manager remains  uncomfortable with one aspect of his trade: Trades.  </P> <P> "I know there are some people who are inclined, by nature or personality or  whatever, to wheel and deal," Port says. "But with all due respect, Mike Port  is not the story. If we could go all year without one mention of Mike Port in  the papers, and without us making one deal, and then have us come away with the  world's championship, that would be the ideal situation."  </P> <P> Port also says: "Your first priority is to put the best club you can on the  field. If we could do that through our developmental system only, we would  stick with that."  </P> <P> And: "We will not make trades for the sake of making trades."  </P> <P> And: "We don't get 10 runs' credit for making a deal."  </P> <P> This would help to explain a lot.  </P> <P> For instance, why Port refused to make an in-season trade during 1988 and '89  and attempted to patch gaping holes with organizational tape named Junior  Noboa, Chico Walker, Jack Lazorko and Terry Clark.  </P> <P> Or why Port remained on the sidelines in the middle of a tight American League  West race while the Oakland Athletics seized the moment and Rickey Henderson.  </P> <P> Or why Port backed off potential deals for Tim Raines, Lenny Dykstra and Ellis  Burks, and settled on Luis Polonia as the man who would bat leadoff.  </P> <P> Or why Port has refused to break up the Dick Schofield-Jack Howell-Devon White  axis and why he held on to Gary Pettis and Mike Witt long after their market  values peaked.  </P> <P> Let's make a deal? Given a choice, Port would rather not. To make a trade is to  engage a risk -- and Port has never been big on the unknown. Back him into a  corner, leave him with no other options, and Port will deal. But usually as a  last resort, generally for limited stakes and always after he has consulted his  manager, his assistant general manager, his advance scout, his scouting  director, his minor league director, Baseball America, the Sporting News and  the Solunar Tables.  </P> <P> "He is meticulous," says Bill Bavasi, the Angels' director of minor league  operations. "He's a detail guy. . . .  </P> <P> "I know he's got the reputation for being cautious, but I don't think it's  caution as much as it's the aggressiveness to make the right trade. 'Don't hurt  the club, do what's right for the club.' With Mike there's a certain  aggressiveness to always make, if not the perfect deal, then the right deal."  </P> <P> This makes any analysis of Port's trademanship difficult. Does Port make bad  trades? It depends on your definition. Port's trades almost never hurt the  Angels. Because he operates in low-risk territory -- little ventured, little  gained -- his maneuvers usually show a profit. He acquires Bert Blyleven for  three minor leaguers. He picks up Johnny Ray for two minor leaguers. He gets  Polonia for Claudell Washington and Rich Monteleone.  </P> <P> But does Port make impact trades? Or enough of them? Look at the American  League West standings.  </P> <P> Since replacing Buzzie Bavasi as Angel general manager after the 1984 season,  Port has made one trade that involved a member of his starting lineup -- Gary  Pettis, after the 1987 season. He has not traded away a starting pitcher,  unless you count John Candelaria, who took himself out of the rotation in 1987  and then burned the bridge.  </P> <P> Port deals with what he calls "developmental surplus" -- utility infielders,  long relievers, marginal minor leaguers, Angels on the fringe. That can bring  in Lance Parrish and Dan Petry, but it won't get you Rickey Henderson or Joe  Carter.  </P> <P> Port's most significant player moves and free-agent signings have included:  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1985  </P> <P> Signed Donnie Moore as a free agent. Port had barely settled into the chair  behind Buzzie Bavasi's old desk when relief ace Don Aase and outfielder Fred  Lynn announced they were both jumping to Baltimore. All Port was left with was  a selection in the pre-1985 compensation draft, which he used to pluck Moore  off the Atlanta Braves' roster.  </P> <P> Forget Dave Henderson and the disintegration that followed. For two seasons,  Moore set new standards in Angel relief pitching -- saving a club-record 31  games in 1985 and 21 in '86, including the AL West championship clincher.  </P> <P> If only the book had shut then. Grade: A-  </P> <P> Signed Ruppert Jones as a free agent. A spare part on the 1984 World Series  champion Detroit Tigers, Jones was the $330,000 solution to Lynn's departure.  Jones lived life on his own private space shuttle -- and in his orange  jumpsuits and tinted goggles, he was dressed for the part -- but during those  occasional earthbound stretches, he could be a productive player. Jones hit 21  home runs in 1985 and added 17 in a platoon shift with George Hendrick in '86.  Grade: B  </P> <P> Traded Mike Brown, Pat Clements and Bob Kipper to Pittsburgh for John  Candelaria, George Hendrick and Al Holland. Port's first trade was also his  biggest, which illustrates just how badly he wanted Candelaria in August of  1985.  </P> <P> Ink on paper says this was a three-for-three deal. Reality pegs it closer to  five-for-one. Not only did Port have to part with three prospects to get his  man, he had to agree to absorb the bloated contracts of Holland and Hendrick,  which was Pittsburgh's main incentive for making the trade.  </P> <P> Candelaria paid off with a divisional title in 1986, Holland lasted barely two  months, and Hendrick played out the remainder of his contract with the Angels  -- three long, expensive and exasperating seasons. Joggin' George, you could've  been someone, but hustling was just too uncool.  </P> <P> Of the players Pittsburgh obtained, only Kipper remains in the major leagues.  Grade: B+  </P> <P> Traded Jerome Nelson to Oakland for Don Sutton and Robert Sharpnack. If the  Angels don't develop Hall of Famers, they do a pretty fair job of renting them.  Rod Carew got his 3,000th hit as an Angel. Reggie Jackson hit his 500th home  run as an Angel. And Don Sutton became a 300-game winner as an Angel, 10 months  after this trade with Oakland.  </P> <P> For the price of a Class A outfielder, the Angels bought Sutton's last good  season -- he was 15-11 in 1986 -- which proved instrumental in the Angels' last  division championship. It also bought new secrets into the world of baseball  arts and crafts. Angel pitchers never knew sandpaper could be so versatile.  Grade: A  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1986  </P> <P> Traded Luis Sanchez to Montreal for Gary Lucas. Two sour footnotes from Angel  playoff history: Sanchez served up Cecil Cooper's pennant-winning single in  Game 5 of the 1982 playoffs, and Lucas had to pick Game 5 of the 1986 playoffs  to hit his first batter in more than 400 innings. That was Rich Gedman. The  next batter was Dave Henderson.  </P> <P> Angel timing, in a nutshell.  </P> <P> Lucas played two seasons with the Angels, spending nearly as much time on the  disabled list as on the mound. But the Angels did get five victories and five  saves from him. Sanchez gave the Expos nothing. He took a left turn at  Montreal, landed in Japan, played a season and was never heard from again.  Grade: B  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1987  </P> <P> Traded Bill Merrifield and Miguel Garcia to Pittsburgh for Johnny Ray. Mark  McLemore casts a dissenting vote, but this ranks among Port's finest moves.  Merrifield, an infielder of limited skills, wasn't going anywhere in the Angel  organization, and Garcia was at best a long-range pitching prospect. In return,  the Angels acquired their 1988 co-MVP and their first .300-hitting regular  since Carew.  </P> <P> But the deal is docked half a grade for those times Ray is forced to wear a  fielder's glove. Grade: A-  </P> <P> Traded John Candelaria to the New York Mets for Shane Young and Jeff  Richardson. When Port dumps a player, watch out below. Candelaria's act pushed  Port to the brink in 1987 -- the pitcher was arrested twice on suspicion of  driving while intoxicated, spent a month in a substance-abuse clinic and was  poison in the clubhouse. He had to go, but Port could have received something  in return. Young is no longer in the Angel organization, Richardson remains  mired in the minors and Candelaria, having bounced from the Mets to the Yankees  to the Expos, has resurfaced in Minnesota, startling even the Twins with his  7-1 start. Grade: C-  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1988  </P> <P> Traded Gary Pettis to Detroit for Dan Petry. Another dumping. Pettis' 1987  season was a 133-game horror -- 17 runs batted in, 124 strikeouts and a .208  batting average in 394 at-bats. Pettis blamed a bad hand; the Angels blamed a  hard-headed hitting approach. Either way, this relationship was a goner, and  Port was so eager to unload Pettis, he settled for damaged goods in return.  Coming off arm surgery, Petry wrenched his back in spring training, missed two  months of the regular season because of a sprained ankle and finished 3-9.  Banished to long relief in 1989, Petry was released at season's end and then  re-upped with Detroit, where he is starting -- and winning -- again. Grade: C  </P> <P> Signed Chili Davis as a free agent. Enough outfield jokes. Name the most  productive hitter in the Angel lineup since 1988. Name the only Angel to take  consecutive 90-RBI seasons into 1990. Name the only Angel to take consecutive  20-home run seasons into 1990.  </P> <P> He isn't named Wally. Grade: A-  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1989  </P> <P> Traded David Holdridge to Philadelphia for Lance Parrish. Some potential for  long-term repercussions here. Holdridge was a first-round draft choice in 1987  and, according to Bavasi, "one of the top arms in the organization, certainly."  Parrish was 32 when the trade was made, coming off his poorest (.215) big  league season. And there's always the back.  </P> <P> "You hate to lose a kid like Holdridge, but he was drafted the same year as  John Orton," Bavasi said. "Basically, you could say we drafted both of our  catchers, Lance Parrish and his backup, in the same draft. How often does that  happen? And we didn't have to wait three years to develop Parrish." Grade: B+  </P> <P> Traded Mike Cook, Rob Wassenaar and Paul Sorrento to Minnesota for Bert  Blyleven. Port's finest hour?  </P> <P> Not all the returns are in -- Sorrento is regarded as one of the Twins' top  power-hitting prospects -- but for one season, Angel shoelaces weren't the only  things burned by Blyleven. Besides Sorrento, who had 27 homers and 112 RBIs  with double-A Orlando, Fla., in 1989, the Twins got a fringe major league  reliever in Cook and a marginal pitching prospect in Wassenaar. The Angels  received the American League's comeback player of the year -- 17-5, 2.73 ERA,  five shutouts and some sorely needed clubhouse leadership, to boot.  </P> <P> Until Sorrento pans out, if and when . . . Grade: A-  </P> <P> Lost Bob Boone as a free agent to Kansas City. Port's worst hour, no question.  </P> <P> Two years of protracted contract hassles, followed by the Parrish trade,  alienated Boone to the point of no return. He waited for the first offer to  better his 1988 Angel salary of $883,000, and when Kansas City came in at  $883,001, Boone was gone, without so much as a phone call to Port or Autry.  </P> <P> This public relations disaster, which prompted the reorganization of the Angel  front office and the eventual hiring of Dan O'Brien as Port's assistant, was  salvaged only when Parrish came through with a sound first season as Boone's  successor. Grade: D-  </P> <P> Signed Claudell Washington as a free agent. The Angels approached their 1989  season in need of a right fielder. But Washington? For three years? For $2.65  million?  </P> <P> At 34, Washington was easing into his role as a part-time starter. Too bad the  Angels needed a full-timer. Washington appeared in only 110 games in 1989 and  left the team stranded in early September when he bolted a pivotal East Coast  trip to return home for "personal reasons." (Translation: marital dispute.) The  Angels went 4-11 on the trip and never recovered. Neither did Washington. After  two charges of spousal battery in early 1990, Washington took his problems back  to New York last month. Grade: C-  </P> <P> </P> <P> 1990  </P> <P> Signed Mark Langston as a free agent. He struck out with Nolan Ryan. He struck  out with Bruce Hurst. One winter later, Port was scrambling for a free-agent  score -- and Langston was it, cost be damned.  </P> <P> For $16 million, Port got the best pitcher on the free-agent board. Never mind  Langston's so-so start in 1990; it was the right move at the time. It was  designed to give the Angels the deepest starting rotation in the division and  give Port the wherewithal to swing another deal and correct the club's more  pressing needs on offense.  </P> <P> Well, the rotation still looks good. Grade: A-  </P> <P> Traded Jeff Manto and Colin Charland to Cleveland for Scott Bailes. And for  Port's next trick . . .  </P> <P> This wasn't the move the Angels needed, or expected, after Langston, but it has  helped sustain the bullpen during the disablement of Greg Minton and Bob  McClure. Charland, 5-10 at Edmonton in 1989, never showed much in two trips to  the Angels' spring camp, and Manto, who had 23 homers and nearly as many errors  at Edmonton, was a young designated hitter in a system that has cornered the  market on old ones. Grade: B  </P> <P> Traded Claudell Washington and Rich Monteleone to the New York Yankees for Luis  Polonia. Because Port wouldn't part with Kirk McCaskill -- the reported asking  price for Raines, Dykstra, Burks or Von Hayes -- Polonia became the temporary  solution in the Angels' never-ending search for a leadoff hitter. Polonia is  about as close to Rickey Henderson as the Angels are likely to get; he was one  of the three players Oakland traded to the Yankees for Henderson last June.  Grade: B  </P> <P> Traded Mike Witt to the Yankees for Dave Winfield. Looking better each day Witt  spends on the disabled list, but this may be the ultimate case of too little  too late. By the time Winfield became an Angel, he was 38, recovering from back  surgery and no longer an All-Star force in the lineup.  </P> <P> Port had to wait six extra days before Winfield agreed to the deal, resulting  in Port's recent filing of a grievance over the Yankees' alleged mishandling of  the transaction. Among George Steinbrenner's reported sins: Trying to talk Port  out of Winfield and into accepting Roberto Kelly instead.  </P> <P> So what's wrong with Roberto Kelly? Grade: B  </P> <P> And from Port, a self-assessment:  </P> <P> "I don't regret any of them," he said. "I believe each of them was the right  thing to do at the time, for the good of the California Angel organization. I  think we came out with a fair return on every trade we made. . . .  </P> <P> "And I submit that the scorecard would read much differently if we hadn't taken  as much care and just started casting names about. I could have made 110 deals.  But when you proceed at too great a speed, accidents happen."  </P> <P> And when you proceed too slowly, you get passed by Oakland.  </P> <P> In the game of body bartering, a game Port does not enjoy, he has played it  safe. He has played not to lose, and at that he has succeeded. Seldom does Port  hurt the Angels when he makes a trade. Sometimes, he even helps them.  </P> <P> Port's overall grade is a B.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Mainz SAT-1 Television Network in  German at 2005 GMT on 22 June carries a recorded 55-minute  interview with FRG Chancellor Helmut Kohl entitled "Let's Get  Down to Business, Chancellor." Guests in the SAT-1 studio in  Mainz and people in the main square of Castrop-Rauxel in North  Rhine-Westphalia, who are also participating live in the  program, ask the chancellor questions.    In answer to a question from SAT-1 moderator Heinz Klaus  Mertes about the current election campaign, Kohl says that he  and Social Democratic Party of Germany [SPD] Chairman Scharping  will compete with each other "for the best way for Germany's  future." He hopes that this will be done in a reasonable form.  The Party of Democratic Socialism [PDS] is not his problem, but  a problem of the Social Democrats. The PDS is, for him, "the  successor party of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany [SED]."  He has no sympathy with it.    Charts demonstrating the economic upswing and the parallel  increase in Kohl's popularity are presented. Kohl does not  accept that "politics and the chancellor are alone responsible  for good and bad economic developments." "The economy in  Germany -- this is all of us." In his opinion, "there is a  great chance to make further progress" and to achieve more than  a 1.5-percent increase in the GNP this year because exports are  flourishing. However, "the improvement in the past few months  has something to do with trade unions and employers." He pays  tribute to the "wise and reasonable collective agreements."  Many people have a share in the present upswing.    A shop steward from Teltow in the studio comments on  increasing unemployment and poverty in his region. He doubts  the economic upswing. Kohl says that "there is a tendency  toward an upswing." Nobody said that "the upswing would take  place everywhere in Germany at the same time." "There are also  great differences in the new laender." He makes a point of  stating that he "did not cause the breakdown" in the past. He  knows, however, that "things do not happen quickly enough, but  they are in progress."    In the main square of Castrop-Rauxel, people complain about  unemployment. Kohl points out that "many new jobs have been  created, for example in Dortmund." There is also a chance for  medium-size enterprises in this region.    In answer to a question read by the moderator, Kohl says  that  he is not of the opinion of Hans Peter Stihl, president of the  German Industrial and Trade Association, who called for further  social cuts, despite the economic upswing. He rejects, however,  social benefits "according to the pork-barrel principle" and  calls for the elimination of abuse. Money should be given to  those who really need it.    In the studio, a shop steward from Dresden raises the topic  of part-time work. Kohl says that it would be an "illusion" to  eliminate the problem of 4 million unemployed by part-time work,  but many who are unemployed would like to do a part-time job.  However, "nobody must be forced to do it." Part-time jobs  might be transformed into full-time jobs later. It is better if  apprentices who have concluded their training have a part-time  job than none at all. "The main problem is that the economic  recovery cannot immediately be translated into jobs."    A Bavarian director in the studio refers to a complaint from  an east German, who is allegedly not paid by the Trust Agency  and said that the chancellor did not keep his promises. Kohl  said that he had promised "flourishing landscapes in four to  five years." In many fields, they are currently developing.    Being confronted with a chart on the opinion of the  adherents  of the individual parties on the economic upswing, Kohl says  that it is clear the SPD adherents have a more negative opinion  on it.    Clips of participants in the SPD congress who ask Kohl  questions are shown. He defends Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of  the Christian Democratic Union/Christian Social Union [CDU/CSU]  Bundestag Group, against criticism that he is against the  emancipation of women. A lot has been done for sports in  eastern Germany. He denies that the situation in Halle is bad.  Unemployment has to be gradually reduced as quickly as  possible. However, there will always be a basic stock of  unemployed, which is cause for "concern in the future."    In answer to questions from people in Castrop-Rauxel, Kohl  says that North Rhine-Westphalia, above all the Ruhr area, is  the best location for Europe, which is growing together. The  December summit of the European Union will be held in Essen, so  that a landscape can be presented that has chances in the future.    Germany's debts must not increase further. "Enormous  financial transfers" to the new laender are necessary. This  year it will be 160 billion German marks, including private  investment. But "this is solidarity with our neighbors, our  compatriots." "We who have lived in western Germany for 40  years" have to understand that "priority is now to be given to  our compatriots in the new laender."    In response to questions from people in the studio, Kohl  says  that those who do something without being paid for it have to be  especially respected. A "flourishing economy is needed because  of jobs, but, at the same time, we have a profound moral  commitment to their creation."    A man in Castrop-Rauxel says that the upswing can be  perceived in the east, but not in the Ruhr area. Kohl asks him  to compare the life of the people in the east with his own life.  The people in the former GDR [German Democratic Republic] also  worked hard. He rejects prejudice and asks for solidarity.    In the studio, a young entrepreneur from Chemnitz complains  about insufficient support from banks. Kohl is in favor of more  help for young entrepreneurs. One should wait and see whether  the investment allowance will really expire at the end of 1994.    Confronted with an Allensbach survey showing that a majority  calls, above all, for tax cuts and a question from an EU  official in the studio, Kohl agrees that "our tax burden is too  great" and "the state quota is too high." However, money is  needed for investments in the east. The stability of the German  mark cannot be maintained with debts. "The stability of the  currency must be my most important objective."    Asked by a circus director in the studio why there is no  culture minister in Germany, Kohl says that there are culture  ministers in the laender. He supports the decentralization of  culture.    The moderator presents a survey showing that both east and  west Germans give priority to leisure time over work.    The final question is asked by an employee in the studio who  wants to know how peace in Europe can be ensured if the  preconditions for it are not given in Germany. Kohl is sure  that "we will be able to solve the problems arising regarding  questions of internal security." However, several things have  to be changed. He thinks that the quarrels about the law on  combating crime are absurd. "We want a liberal rule-of-law  state, not an authoritarian state and least of all a police  state. However, a change in one's way of thinking is also  required here." Kohl gives the example of the murder of a  police officer by a Red Army Faction terrorist, who was also  killed. For several days, the German public did not deal with  the murdered officer, but with the terrorist.    Kohl points out that "foreigners are always welcome."  "Xenophobia is always a disgrace for our country, but no  foreigner has the right to block the exits and entries of  superhighways because of political reasons in his homeland."  Therefore, he does not understand discussions on the  deportation of people who have broken the law.    He calls for a "new way of thinking in Europe in combating  crime." "Most of our police do a good job." He "passionately  called for the establishment of a European task force" when the  Maastricht Treaty was concluded. The important thing for the  citizen is that he gets help. "This is our joint objective."</p>

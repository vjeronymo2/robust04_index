			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From "The News" newscast] </F>   [Text] Just as we reported earlier, FOGADE [Deposit  Guarantee and Banking Protection Fund] President Esperanza  Martino tendered her resignation before Congress President  Eduardo Gomez Tamayo. In a communique, the FOGADE president said  she does not want to become a negative factor within the  Venezuelan financial and political systems. She adds she has a  clear conscience because she fulfilled her duties.    [Begin Martino recording] Quite frankly, I feel very  disappointed that having succeeded in obtaining financial aid  that had practically reached 1 billion bolivares, last night it  topped 8 billion bolivares. [sentence as heard] Does this help  at all? This proves that this week's events have been a  determining factor in once again creating a climate of upheaval  among depositors.    I am not blaming the Venezuelan Central Bank [BCV]. During  my  interpellation yesterday, at no time did I say the BCV was  responsible. In this case, all of the authorities are  responsible, and I assume full responsibility in my capacity as  FOGADE president and as president of the FOGADE Board of  Directors.    All of this financial assistance was granted with the  approval of both boards. Were we wrong? No! At this stage I  cannot say that I was wrong; on the contrary, I believe it has  been done very well and I believe a financial crash has been  prevented, and this is important for the country.

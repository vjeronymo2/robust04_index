			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE  </P> <P> NEWS 'N' NOTES: Live Aid spearhead Bob Geldof pumps irony with "The Great Song  of Indifference," the first single from his upcoming "Vegetarians of Love"  album, which will be released by Atlantic on Aug. 21. The former Boomtown Rat  is slated to start a 13-city U.S. club tour on Aug. 17 in Atlanta, with a Sept.  4 date planned for the Roxy in Hollywood. . . .  </P> <P> M. C. Hammer's hourlong video "Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" is due in the  stores on Tuesday.  </P> <P> Rather than the conventional compilation of clips, this is a real story --  conceived, written and starring Hammer, and set in his hometown of Oakland. He  plays the dual roles of himself and the comically loquacious Rev. Pressure. The  latter is a real hoot.  </P></p>

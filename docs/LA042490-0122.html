			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SOCKERS BRING IN HATTRUP OF AISA FOR TRYOUT  </P> <P> Peter Hattrup, a 26-year-old forward who recently finished a season with the  Atlanta Attack of the American Indoor Soccer Assn., will try out with the  Sockers today.  </P> <P> Because forward Steve Zungul (arthritic hips) and defender Don Cogsville (knee  surgery) were placed on the disabled list Friday, Major Indoor Soccer League  rules allow the Sockers to sign one field player to a 15-day contract.  </P> <P> Socker President Ron Cady said Hattrup would have to be obtained on loan since  he is still under contract with Atlanta. Hattrup will be given a physical and  then will practice with the Sockers for the remainder of the week. Coach Ron  Newman said Hattrup would be signed in the event of further injuries.  </P> <P> "We're just protecting ourselves," Newman said. "It's a security move."  </P> <P> Hattrup, one of the AISA's leading scorers, caught Newman's eye while trying  out in the preseason for the Tacoma Stars, who eventually cut him.  </P> <P> "I was quite impressed with the lad," Newman said. "I was a little surprised  Tacoma cut him. I thought I'd keep track of his progress."  </P> <P> Hattrup, Newman said, is quick, has an accurate shot and good touch with the  ball. He scored one goal in 11 games with Tacoma during his only MISL seasons,  1986-87 and 1987-88.  </P> <P> Cady said the Sockers may give tryouts to two more AISA players later this  week.

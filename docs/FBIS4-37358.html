			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Palestinian Police Commander in Gaza </F> Tells AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT: I Have Not Misused Police Funds or  Violated 'Arafat Instructions"]    [Text] Tunis, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- Major General Nasr  Yusuf, commander of the Palestinian police forces in Gaza, has  strongly denied what some quarters said recently, namely that he  has misused the funds allocated for Palestinian policemen's  salaries, and that he has violated the instructions conveyed to  him by Palestinian ambassador to Cairo Zuhdi al-Qidrah in this  connection.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf, who met in Tunis yesterday with Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat, who had summoned him to Tunis, stressed  to AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT that 'Arafat was keen to pay the policemen  their allowances to face the high cost of living and the  difficult economic conditions in Gaza and Jericho.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf, who was accompanied to Tunis by his  assistant Brigadier Ziyad al-Atrash, added that he submitted to  President 'Arafat, with whom he met yesterday separately, a  comprehensive assessment of the previous stage and the present  security conditions in the National Authority area.    He stressed that "we are going to adopt a new approach for  the next stage." He declined to give any details about the  nature of this approach.    Maj. Gen. Yusuf expressed his utmost discontent at and  regret  for the accusations made recently by prominent figures like  Faysal al-Husayni and Jamil al-Tarifi with regard to what they  termed a "Gaza-Jericho agreement for detainees." He described  these claims as "absolutely untrue." He added: "We regret that  some of the brothers who participated in all stages of the  negotiations, and who have full knowledge of the details, are  ignoring this reality and accusing us of concluding agreements  with Israel which are not final."    He said that he and Ziyad al-Atrash had not signed a single  letter with Israel, and that what some quarters have said is  untrue. He said: "We are implementing an agreement, not  conducting negotiations. We are liaison committees tasked with  implementing an agreement signed by the Palestinian and Israeli  leaderships. We are eager to secure credibility for the  leadership by implementing what has been signed."    Maj. Gen. Yusuf stressed that he had not signed any  documents  regarding detainees, and that the clauses concerning detainees  are stipulated in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement signed on 4  May in Cairo. So "we have not signed any agreement on the  detainees, nor have we been dragged into any negotiations with  Israel in this connection. If that had been the case, we would  have asked the leadership to do that. But we are field officers  whose work is based on the field implementation of the agreement  on the ground."    Concluding his statement, Maj. Gen. Yusuf stressed that he  is  going to return to his work in Gaza and Jericho in the next two  days, refuting the rumors circulating in Tunis to the effect  that 'Arafat is going to replace the police forces commander.</p>

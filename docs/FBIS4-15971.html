			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Roundup by Pavel Anokhin of remarks by State Duma members: </F> "Only a Madman Would Come Out Against Accord Today"]    [Text] The draft memorandum "On Achieving Civil Accord in  Russia" which has been made public remains at the center of  attention in the country's political life. The deputies have  begun to study it in their parliamentary factions. We here  present to readers the opinion of certain legislators from the  State Duma.    Valentin Tatarchuk, executive secretary of the "Russia's  Choice" bloc deputies' faction: "You certainly cannot harness a  horse and a timid doe in the same yoke. The ideological  differences based on political forces' differing interpretations  of the processes taking place in Russia are not likely to be  reconciled quickly. This is a long and complex process. But  there is one thing that should be accepted by everyone and  should be incorporated in the document -- namely, a written  agreement by political and social forces to pursue their  activities and resolve their differences within the framework of  the Constitution. We have no alternative today: Either we  agree to resolve all our problems constitutionally and thereby  preserve civil peace, or, if no such document is adopted, we as  a people embark on a path of self-destruction, and things will  be worse here than in Yugoslavia."    Pavel Burdukov, member of the Agrarian Party of Russia  deputies' faction: "Only a madman would come out against accord  in Russia today. The question is, how can accord be achieved  between someone living in semi-starvation and someone gorging on  caviar, between a person walking along the street barefoot and  the Mercedes owner who spatters him with street dirt?    "The proposed draft prompts many urgent questions. If the  agreement is to take the form of a social contract, then  everyone should bear the burden equally -- government  structures, public movements, trade unions. A degree of  one-sidedness can be sensed in the present document. For  instance, the sides pledge not to use power structures to  resolve conflicts. But which sides? Does the Agrarian Party  have any power structures? It should be expressed like this:  The president and the government pledge not to use the Army,  the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], or state security in  resolving political disputes. Or take a second point, where it  is stated that the trade unions are not to put forward economic  or political demands. In that case the other side, having, for  instance, stipulated the present standard of living, should  pledge at least to maintain that standard. In that case the  trade unions' pledge will be appropriate and justified. Certain  points which are clearly impossible to fulfill also cause  concern. Among them are the promise to lower the level of  inflation by the end of the year and eliminate the decline in  production.    "In my view, the form of the agreement should be sought more  in the economic sphere, alleviating the life of particularly  vulnerable population strata."    Aleksey Mitrofanov, one of the leaders of the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia and its deputies' faction: "The  document is very serious, and our group is studying it  carefully. We do not regard this draft as final, and we realize  that adopting an `Agreement' will not solve the problems.  Nonetheless the Russian president's initiative creates a  favorable moral and political atmosphere in the country. The  draft enshrines a degree of accord between political forces on  their standards of behavior, or rather, creates a code of  conduct, and that is important.    "A number of positions incorporated in the proposed draft  correspond in some respects to ours. For instance, it contains  a provision on the need to strip any deputy violating the  document, once signed, of his powers as a deputy. We advocate  the imperative mandate, that is, the right of a faction to  exclude renegades from the deputies' list. You will agree that  otherwise the question arises: How can violators of the  agreement be expelled from the 'body of deputies,' who can  actually do this, and how?"    Nikolay Travkin, leader of the Democratic Party of Russia  and  its parliamentary faction: "Accord in society today depends more  on the government's actions. You can sign any document you  like, but it is not worth anything unless nonpayments are also  stopped and wages are no longer delayed.    "The proposed draft is an attempt yet again to resolve  problems by way of a `roundtable' -- let's sit down and talk  about it, issue a decree, and all will be well. The document  itself prompts no objections, but it hardly changes anything in  practical terms. There is no need to adopt any agreements to do  that, it is simply necessary for the government to get down to  some real work. But unfortunately the text of the agreement  does not guarantee that the executive will start to move more  energetically."    Natalya Malakhatkina, deputy chairman of the "Women of  Russia" political movement's deputies' faction: "Our faction was  an initiator of a memorandum like this, so we have studied its  content with particular attention. It has a very high status,  and there is a danger that it could come above the country's  Fundamental Law. It duplicates many of the provisions of the  Russian Constitution, and a number of its provisions are  actually in conflict with the Constitution. We undoubtedly have  here a product that is still raw, proposed by five  `roundtables.' But that is why we must do some serious work on  it.    "For instance, I am concerned about the draft's precise  definition of the order in which laws should be adopted. But  what is the point of prescribing which law is to be adopted  first and which second? You cannot do that -- unforeseen  situations may arise, and instead of accord, conflicts that  nobody wants will arise."</p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Ford returns to half-year profit FORD MOTOR yesterday underscored the gradually improving outlook for US car manufacturers when it reported second-quarter earnings of Dollars 502m (Pounds 262.8m), compared with a loss of Dollars 324m a year ago. However, Mr Harold Poling, chairman, said the US economy remained fragile, and those in many main overseas markets, remained fragile. He said it would continue to be difficult to achieve healthy results in the rest of 1992. Ford's profits, on revenues up 13 per cent at Dollars 26.8bn, worked through to earnings of 93 cents a share, against losses of 68 cents in the second quarter of last year. This was lower than Wall Street forecasts of around 99 cents. However, analysts said underperformance was due to a higher-than-expected tax charge, and that on an operating basis the company had done better than predicted. The figures followed higher-than-forecast results from Chrysler on Tuesday. In the US, which has seen improving demand for vehicles after the 1991 recession, Ford's car operations earned Dollars 148m, compared with a loss of Dollars 565m. The main factors in the turnaround were improving sales volumes across the industry, leading to higher factory use and lower discounts to buyers. In addition, Ford improved its share of the car and truck market, thanks largely to its revamped Taurus and Sable mid-sized cars and Explorer four-wheel drive vehicles. It also cut the proportion of its vehicles going to low-margin fleet buyers. Outside the US, the motor business earned Dollars 65m, compared with a loss of Dollars 2m. However, Jaguar, the UK luxury car maker Ford bought in 1989, lost about Dollars 70m, roughly the same as a year ago. The group's overall results were also buoyed up by lower interest rates and record earnings by its financial services business - Dollars 289m, up Dollars 46m from 1991, thanks to lower credit losses and higher net interest margins. Mr David McCammon, Ford's treasurer, said the company expected profits to dip from the second quarter level in the third quarter, due to seasonal factors. For the six months, Ford reported net income of Dollars 840.3m, or Dollars 1.53 a share, compared with losses of Dollars 1.2bn, or Dollars 2.56 a share, a year ago on revenues which rose from Dollars 45.2bn to Dollars 51.4bn.

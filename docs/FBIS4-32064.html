			<p>BFN     [Text] Fierce inter-Muslim fighting is taking place in the  Cazin Krajina. The forces of the Autonomous Province of Western  Bosnia last night fired a number artillery projectiles at the  positions of the 5th Corps of the Muslim army loyal to the  government in Sarajevo. This was reported by Muslim radio in  Sarajevo this morning. Eight soldiers of the 5th Corps were  killed and 12 seriously wounded.    ZBIA Information Agency this morning reported on significant  military successes by the advocates of autonomy, who, as  claimed, have pushed out Izetbegovic's faction from a  significant part of the former Cazin commune.</p>

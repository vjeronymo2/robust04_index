			<p>930909 FT  09 SEP 93 / Market disappointed with P&amp;O PENINSULAR and Oriental Steam Navigation Company yesterday disappointed the market with lower than expected profits before disposals. The shares fell 49p to 619p. Lord Sterling, chairman, said: 'It would have been abundantly clear to anyone who read our annual report that the UK recovery is slower than anticipated. It is a delusion to think we can surge ahead while Germany and France remain deep in recession.' The company almost doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 291.6m, from Pounds 151.2m, on the back of increased sales of businesses in the half year to the end of June. Turnover rose to Pounds 2.7bn (from Pounds 2.5bn). Pre-tax profits before disposals fell 11 per cent to Pounds 80.1m, mainly due to a big fall in profits from container and bulk shipping. Gains from the devaluation of sterling and a strong US dollar were more than offset by difficulties in Asia which were behind shipping's 58 per cent profit fall to Pounds 11m. After the sale of Sutcliffe, the contract caterer, borrowings fell from Pounds 1.89bn at the end of December to Pounds 1.73bn at the end of June. Net interest payable rose to Pounds 66.9m (from Pounds 53.8m). Further disposals are expected to follow yesterday's announcement of the sale of Buck and Hickman, a distributor of engineers' supplies, to Charles Baynes for Pounds 32.5m. A scrip dividend is also offered to preserve cash. Its value of 36p compares with an ordinary dividend of 24p. For each share offered under the issue Barclays de Zoete Wedd is offering cash of 35.28p. If all shareholders take up the scrip dividend alternative the group would retain cash of Pounds 163m, representing a saving on the 1993 dividend of Pounds 128m and a further Pounds 35m of advance corporation tax. Lord Sterling said the total dividend is expected to remain unchanged at 30.5p. The group is considering appealing to the European Commission over the Department of Trade and Industry's refusal to allow it to work with other ferry operators on the Dover-Calais route to head off the competition from Eurotunnel. Lord Sterling said: 'The DTI's decision defies rational explanation.' Earnings per share rose to 40.1p (from 20.9p). Lex, Page 26; Market, Page 46</p>

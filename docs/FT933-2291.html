			<p>930920 FT  20 SEP 93 / Barcelona basks in the glory and business gold: The race for the 2000 Olympic Games will be decided on Thursday / A look at the prizes to be won A DUVET sporting the Olympic colours lay under a spotlight in Barcelona's newly-opened Olympic museum. Just over a year ago, as an emotional Spanish journalist pointed out, it would have covered an athlete who lay dreaming about a gold medal. Next to it nestled an official Olympic pillow. Behind it was a matching tooth mug. Hanging on the back of a door in the display was an official athlete's bathrobe. For Barcelona's city leaders there are loftier mementoes of the 16-day, Dollars 6.7bn bonanza that engulfed them last year. Walking around the city a year later it is hard to escape them. The hill above the city sports a new telephone exchange and sports stadiums. The spruced-up city centre is dotted with sculptures and litter bins. City officials can boast a series of statistics to convince the sceptic of benefits that can be reaped from the spectacle. Unemployment in Barcelona is now 10.5 per cent - less than half the Spanish average. The city has apparently become the seventh most popular conference centre in the world. The logistics of the Olympics has left the city basking in civic pride over its 'project management' skills. According to the city's Olympic museum Barcelona welcomed more than 1m visitors during the games. The Olympic village alone received 88,000 telephone calls and 60 kilos of mail each day. In the athletes' village 7,751 condoms were dispensed, 937 lost objects handed in and Silence of the Lambs was the most popular video. But although the statistics seem impressive enough, it is hard to escape a sense of Spanish melancholy. An official at Barcelona's port said: 'When the Olympics happened everyone was so excited. And then it finished and there was a real downturn. Now everyone asks, 'What now? what was it all for?'' What, in other words, does a city do with all the stadiums, telephone exchanges and paraphernalia when the athletes have gone home? Barcelona's leaders refuse to reconcile themselves to a return to obscurity, and like other Olympic cities before them are trying to turn everything Olympic into something economic. The city's 5,000 new hotel rooms are being advertised to tourists and conference organisers. The stadium that hosted the gymnastics is used for film shows and indoor windsurfing. Accommodation in the Olympic village is being sold as 5,500 flats and the former Olympic harbour is now a marina, with half-built shops and restaurants. Efforts are being made to channel the city's new organisational expertise into service industries and consultancy. Delegations from Barcelona have already travelled to Manchester and other Olympic hopefuls to advise them on how to bid for the games. So far these delegations have tactfully refrained from commenting on which would be best placed to win the games. Mr Pasqual Maragall, city mayor, said: 'Each city must do it their own way. It would be wrong to try to repeat the games as in Barcelona.'</p>

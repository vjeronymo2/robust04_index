			<p>930322 FT  22 MAR 93 / German pay strikes loom THE THREAT of strikes among eastern Germany's engineering, metal, electrical, and steel sectors increased sharply at the weekend after the DGB federation of trade unions said it would organise 'a week of resistance' in support of higher wages in the region. But Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German Industry Federation, said demands for a 26 per cent pay increase on April 1 in the five eastern states was 'a little mad'. The DGB said it wanted to show that it opposed the decision by Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, to renege on a contract made with IG Metall, the engineering union, in March 1991. That contract would have brought eastern German wages up to western German levels by April 1994. The 26 per cent pay rise, due next month for eastern German engineering, metal, electrical and steel employees, was part of that agreement. Both the DGB and IG Metall say the employers want to end the system of collective wage bargaining, which would mean that employers would be free to set their own wages.</p>

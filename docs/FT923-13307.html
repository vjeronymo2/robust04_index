			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Britain to give medical help to Sarajevo BRITAIN will give medical help to, or evacuate, children caught up in fighting in Sarajevo, Mr Major told MPs. The prime minister would also consider providing air cover if a land corridor to the city could be established under United Nations' auspices. He repeated that UK ground troops would not be sent. However, when pressed for a pledge that the Commons would be recalled if further British involvement was envisaged, Mr Major said: 'I would be most unwise to give a blanket assurance to you, and I am unable to do so.' Mr Major expects to meet the UN high commissioner for refugees later this week.</p>

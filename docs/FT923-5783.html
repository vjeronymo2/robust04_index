			<p>920828 FT  28 AUG 92 / Abuses threaten to undermine construction industry: How a proposed review of contract managementmay help improve the sector's image CONSTRUCTION lawyers like to tell stories about builders who come to them seeking loopholes in tender contracts even before they bid for a job. The companies want to know whether the contract has been so poorly worded they will be able to claim extra payments from customers once work is under way. There have been many tales of contractors that bid for contracts at a loss, only to make a profit from claims. Developers anxious to finish projects often find it cheaper to agree claims rather than try to re-let the work. Just as big a problem - particularly in the recession - has been late payment of bills by main contractors, which sub-contractors say has forced many medium-sized and small companies into receivership. It is against this background that the government last week proposed a review of contract arrangements in the construction industry. The independent review, to be financed jointly by the government and the industry, will examine the excessive reliance of companies on claims and other contract abuses which sour the sector's image. The last time the government examined the award and management of construction contracts was in 1962. Three decades later customers are still complaining of a 'claims culture' among contractors and sub-contractors who, they say, use more energy protecting their individual financial and legal positions than working together. The Department of the Environment, which proposed the latest review, says there is profound dissatisfaction with the adversarial nature of contractual relationships on building sites. Olympia &amp; York, when building the failed Canary Wharf in London's Docklands, estimated the cost of construction in the UK was twice that in the US. Mr Richard Griffiths, a senior vice-president at O&amp;Y, blamed this on a confrontational approach adopted by the large numbers of separate, independently controlled contractors that work on large developments. 'If something goes wrong, the first thing you get is a claim rather than an attempt to find a common solution to the problem,' he said. The fragmented nature of construction work involving a range of specialist skills means the industry will always be prone to contract disagreements. The biggest area for claims is design changes, or variation orders, as they are sometimes called. Anybody involved in domestic building work who has asked for a radiator to be moved or a doorway enlarged once plans have been completed will recognise the response: 'It can be done . . . but it will cost you.' Contractors building the Channel tunnel have claimed more than Pounds 1bn in additional payments for fitting out rail tunnels and building passenger terminals at Folkestone in Kent and Sangatte in northern France. Much of the claim is to meet changes in design specifications which contractors say have been made to satisfy improved safety requirements. The review will also consider complaints that main contractors seek to boost their cashflow by delaying payment of bills to sub-contractors who do most of the actual work. In a move to encourage faster payment to sub-contractors, ministers said earlier this year that companies winning government construction contracts would be expected to pay sub-contractors within 30 days of receiving a valid invoice. Sub-contractors say the move so far has received a lukewarm response from main contractors. The British Constructional Steelwork Association says more than 100 members and their subsidiaries have ceased trading since 1989 - some pushed over the brink because main contractors have delayed payments. The association says slow payments have been caused by delays in certifying that work has been completed correctly. Main contractors may also query bills knowing that sub-contractors will accept a lower payment rather than risk long delays and potentially high legal costs pursuing additional money. Serious problems have also arisen over retention money, held back by developers and main contractors under the terms of a contract as insurance against defects emerging after a job has been completed. This money, normally between 3 per cent and 5 per cent of the total contract value, can mean the difference between breaking even and making a loss in the current depressed market. This money should be repaid within 12 months of work finishing but disputes can arise over what constitutes legal completion. Is it, for example, after the last tree has been planted during landscaping? According to the association one structural steel company waited five years after it completed a project for retention money to be released. Retention money technically belongs to the sub-contractor, but it can be lost altogether if a developer or main contractor ceases trading. A number of contractors that worked on Canary Wharf are threatened in this way, including Graham Wood, the structural steel company which recently went into receivership. Practices like these, which have always gone on in the construction industry, tend to get worse in recession. Construction lawyers can expect a lot more work yet.</p>

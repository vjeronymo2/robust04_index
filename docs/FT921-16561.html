			<p>920102 FT  02 JAN 92 / Harrods' tills ring up Pounds 1m an hour HARRODS, the London store, yesterday claimed to have bucked the recession - at least for a day. The store claimed that its much-trumpeted January sale took Pounds 1m an hour on the first day - or Pounds 16,666 a minute - outstripping last year's first-day performance by more than 20 per cent. It was the first time Harrods opened on New Year's Day in its 143-year history. A queue of about 4,000 people had gathered outside the Knightsbridge store before the opening ceremony performed by Ms Diana Ross, the pop singer, who arrived in a horse-drawn carriage. Harrods is donating Pounds 50,000 to the Great Ormond Street Hospital scanner appeal in Ms Ross's name. Mr Michael Cole, for House of Fraser, which owns Harrods, said that since December 27 the 65 UK stores in the group had all recorded takings at least 10 per cent higher than a year earlier. Porcelain was among the best-sellers at the store, with one customer spending Pounds 20,000 on three dinner services. Also selling well yesterday at Harrods were 75 television and radio systems at Pounds 1,895 each and Christmas puddings, 1,000 of which had been sold by noon yesterday.</p>

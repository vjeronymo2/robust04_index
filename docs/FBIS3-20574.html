It will also have to straighten  out the interrelationship between the internal and external  grain systems under the market mechanism to make them more in  keeping with the market operating mechanism, thereby improving  the operating efficiency of the internal and external systems.    The grain market stabilization system involves the  interrelated roles and coordination of numerous stabilization  factors. The application of a single factor will positively not  attain the goal of market stabilization. These stabilization  factors include: a floor price, a ceiling price, cushioning  reserves, a stabilization fund, a futures market, exchange  rates, and grain imports and exports.  <H5>  Setting of the Floor Price </H5>   The level at which the floor price is set affects the  transfer of benefits among the state treasury, the peasants,  consumers, and dealers. If the floor price is set too low,  though government expenditures may be reduced, and though grain  dealers and consumers may also benefit somewhat, the peasants'  interests will not be protected. If set too high, no benefit  will accrue to grain dealers, consumers, and the industrial  sector, and government expenditures will also increase. We  believe the standard for setting the floor price should be 95  percent of the average market price for the previous five years,  this amount serving as the floor price for the coming year.  <H5>  Setting of the Ceiling Price </H5>   On the basis of the experience of developed market economy  countries, stabilization of grain market fluctuations within 15  to 20 percent is deemed a very great success. How to set China's  ceiling price will depend on transportation and marketing system  expenses and profits following grain market deregulation.  Inasmuch as China's treasury is short of funds today, setting  the ceiling price at between 15 and 20 percent of the floor  price will be rather difficult. Our view is a widening to  between 20 and 25 percent.    In addition, grain import and export prices must be taken  into consideration in setting the ceiling and floor prices of  grain. The floor price should not be lower than the grain export  price, and the ceiling price should not be higher than the grain  import price.  <H5>  Cushioning Reserves </H5>   Cushioning reserves are an important tool in government  grain  market stabilization. In bumper harvest years when grain prices  fall, in order to prevent a further slide in grain prices, the  government should buy grain from the peasants at the previously  formulated floor price to produce an upturn in the market grain  price that protects the peasants interests. In lean years when  grain prices rise above the ceiling price, the cushioning  reserves may be used to buy grain to be dumped on the market to  drive down market grain prices thereby protecting the consumers'  interests. The cushioning reserve entails the use of a loading  and unloading mechanism to maintain a floor price and a ceiling  price that stabilizes market grain prices. The practice of  developing countries shows this to be a stabilization method for  which an extremely high price must be paid. During consecutive  bumper harvest years followed by consecutive lean harvest years,  in particular, it becomes extremely difficult to hold down to  the lowest level the quantity of grain in storage and costs.  Therefore, use of the cushioning reserve to stabilize markets  must be applied flexibly in combination with the grain  import-export mechanism. If very ample storage facilities are  available, grain may be imported when the international price is  relatively low rather than when a shortage occurs. When the  world market price rises, grain may be exported. This can reduce  the effect internally of world grain market price fluctuations.  In addition, the profits earned by importing at low prices and  exporting at high prices can be used to pay storage costs.    A cushioning reserve does not necessarily entail losses. If  sufficient difference is allowed between the floor price and the  ceiling price, and management is effective, it is possible to  pay for its entire cost.  <H5>  Stabilization Fund </H5>   A stabilization fund is an important means that government  can use to stabilize grain market prices. It provides financial  support for stabilization of the system. The two main means of  using a stabilization fund to stabilize grain markets that all  countries employ are as follows: First is to apply it in  combination with the cushioning reserve, and have it serve as  financial support for the cushioning reserve. Its main function  is to ensure that government has the funds to purchase the  peasants' grain at the floor price. Its other functions are to  provide peasants loans, to import grain, and for other  government-approved purposes. Second is the use alone of the  stabilization fund to stabilize the market. In a bumper harvest  year when grain prices fall below the floor price, the  stabilization fund is used to subsidize the peasants for the  price difference. In a lean harvest year when grain prices  exceed the ceiling price, grain producers contribute to the  stabilization fund.    The main source of money for the stabilization fund is state  disbursement of public funds. A smaller amount comes from grain  producer payments, and from the profits of grain dealers.  Following deregulation of China's grain markets, the peasants'  "three links" [the linking of parity price sales of fertilizer  and diesel fuel to peasant fulfillment of grain production  quotas] subsidy, the agricultural tax, and the six subsidies to  grain enterprises may be lumped together in the grain  stabilization fund for payment to the State Grain Reserve for  use in purchasing cushioning reserve grain and for grain imports  and exports.  <H5>  Founding of Futures Markets </H5>   Investors futures trading plays an important role in the  stabilization of market grain prices. During a bumper harvest  year when supply is greater than demand and market prices fall,  futures buyers can make large purchases of futures contracts,  thereby increasing grain market demand. This produces a  balancing trend between market grain supply and demand, which  restrains a drop in the grain price. During lean harvest years  when supply is less than demand and grain prices rise, futures  contract sellers can dump large quantities of futures to cause  an increase in market grain supply that eases the grain shortage  and restraints a rise in grain prices. Therefore, by buying when  grain prices fall and selling when grain prices rise, futures  traders produce a trend toward balance in market supply and  demand for grain to attain the goal of stabilizing grain market  prices.</p>

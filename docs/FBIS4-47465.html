			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V. I. Romanov, Applied Geophysics Institute, </F> Moscow; UDC62-756.9.004.6]    [Abstract] It is well known that enterprises of the  chemical industry emit various gases and vapors, many of which  are toxic. In case of an accident the quantity of gaseous  emissions may increase many-fold from run-off or fire. As a  rule, during any significantly large-scale accident, explosion  of a gaseous substance causes formation and dispersion of  particles, splinters, bits, pieces, and fragments of the  substance itself and the ground leading to contamination of the  territory and its surroundings. Furthermore, pieces and  particles exceeding a certain minimum size present a danger on  impact with the personnel of the enterprise and any nearby  inhabitants. It has been observed that during the explosion of  bombs or artillery shells having compressed explosives, the mass  of the fragments is on the order of one gram or less and their  initial velocity is about 10[.sup]3[/] meters per second.  Each particle is irregular in shape and represents a macro- or  micro-structure of the disintegrated material. Many products of  the chemical industry and the storage depots of explosive  materials are located underground. Accidental explosions at  these points could also be sources of harmful mechanical  interaction and pollution. The present work is devoted to an  analysis of certain characteristics of the impact of the solid  phase of explosive emissions where it has been established that  these impacts are one of the most frequently encountered  traumatic factors. It was demonstrated that particles of less  than 5 mm in radius descend at a rate of 40 meters per second  and their maximum energy on colliding with a ground-level object  does not exceed one Joule. Impact of such particles with living  beings is not dangerous. Larger sized particles, however, could  result in trauma of varying severity. Figures 2; references 8: 7  Russian, 1 Western.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brother president Abu-'Ammar [Yasir 'Arafat] this  afternoon received the three ambassadors of the the European  Union -- the troika -- led by the Greek ambassador, Konstandinos  Theodhorakis. During the meeting, they discussed the situation  resulting from the arrival of 13 April without the  implementation of the Declaration of Principles agreement. The  Israeli withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho that was expected to  take place was delayed due to Israeli obstructions and  procrastination.    Brother President Abu-'Ammar explained the importance of the  implementation of Resolution 904 to provide international  protection for our Palestinian people starting with Hebron. He  said: We insist on the presence of the European Union within  international protection, especially since we are dealing with  it on the economic front as the European Union, in addition to  the participation of the two peace conference co-sponsors, the  Scandinavian countries and Egypt.    Brother president Abu-'Ammar thanked friendly Greece for the  financial aid it had presented to the Palestinian police force.  Furthermore, the ambassadors of the European Union stressed the  importance of the European Union's presence as a union among the  international [protection team], and welcomed the participation  of some of the member-countries of the union as a first step in  the international presence. The meeting also reviewed matters  of common concern with the European Union.</p>

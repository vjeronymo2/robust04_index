			<p><P> November 22, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> CARSON TO CLOSE POPULAR LATCHKEY PROGRAM NEXT WEEK  </P> <P> Kids Club, a popular latchkey program run by the Carson Parks and Recreation  Department, is in violation of state licensing regulations and will be closed  Monday, city officials have announced.  </P> <P> Tiny Tots, a day-care program run by the city's community services division, is  also in violation of licensing regulations, but the officials said they hope to  keep it open.  </P> <P> Kathleen Norris, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Social Services,  said the programs, defined by the department as child-care centers, were  operating without licenses.  </P> <P> The Kids Club program provides before- and after-school supervision at each of  the city's 12 parks, according to city officials. Tiny Tots is a preschool  program for 3- to 5-year-old children that is conducted at the park activity  centers and the city's Community Center.  </P> <P> Norris said the social services department's analysts visited one of the parks  on an unannounced inspection Nov. 6 after being tipped off by an anonymous  caller. The city was issued a notice at that time that it had until today to  file an application for a license. The program directors must also be  certified, which requires an academic degree in child development or experience  in a day-care center, or a combination of both.  </P> <P> Scot Yotsuya, deputy city administrator, said the city decided to file an  application to license the Tiny Tots program but not the Kids Club program.  </P> <P> "We believe it would be more difficult to obtain a license for Kids Club, based  upon the requirements," Yotsuya said, adding that city officials believe the  Kids Club service could be provided through Tiny Tots.  </P> <P> City Administrator Jack Smith said about 200 children are involved in the Kids  Club program. They are escorted from school to a neighboring park by a  recreation employee and then take part in various park activities, such as  crafts classes, organized sports and field trips.  </P> <P> Fees for the service range from $15 to $29 a week for each child, depending on  how long or often a youngster is supervised.  </P> <P> Rebecca Perry, a single parent whose two sons are in the latchkey program at  Calas Park, Tuesday night urged the Carson City Council not to close the  program. After a presentation to council members, Perry talked about how  important the program was for her and her sons, Joseph, 9, and Donald, 12. The  boys are at the park from 2:30 p.m. to 6 p.m., five days a week while Perry is  at work.  </P> <P> "I don't want my boys to walk home and stay home for four hours alone," Perry  said, "or hanging around the park for four hours without supervision."  </P> <P> Eva Gatling, a spokeswoman for the city, said the parks would continue to offer  after-school activities but that they would not be part of a formal latchkey  program and that there might not be as much supervision.  </P> <P> Mayor Vera Robles DeWitt said the closing of the Kids Club program was out of  the city's control and stressed that it had nothing to do with current budget  considerations.  </P></p>

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Observer: Very small beer Don't talk about the US federal debt crisis - it's enough to drive you to drink. No sooner said than done. Presidential Bottlers has launched a new beer called Billary, a terrifically subtle combination of the two Clintons' first names. For every case sold, 25 cents goes to the federal Bureau of Public Debt. Sales of Billary have already reduced the debt by Dollars 15,000 so far, a mere drop in the bucket, sure, but Washington is grateful for every drop of aid. President Clinton personally accepted one cheque on behalf of the bureau. All we need now is Bentsen Bourbon.</p>

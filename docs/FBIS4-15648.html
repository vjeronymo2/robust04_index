			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anna Melnikova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 9 (TASS) -- "The accord on civic peace  and concord" should be promulgated into law by the State Duma,  approved as such by a Federation Council and finally signed by  the president," Russian Vice Premier and PRES [Party Russian  Unity and Accord] Leader Sergey Shakhray said at a meeting of  the public chamber under the president in the Kremlin today.    The accord will then facilitate the achievement of peace and  concord in society and provide for a political respite which can  be used to implement economic reforms.    Shakhray called on all leaders of political parties willing  to sign the accord to join in finalizing the draft so as to  avoid any misunderstanding. Some State Duma deputies have  complained that they had taken no part in working out the draft  accord. Shakhray also called for the signing of the accord as  soon as possible. "We have already has a war of laws, then a war  of sovereignties and we must no longer permit yet another war to  break out -- a war of agreements on peace," he said.</p>

			<p><P> February 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WORLD IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> LEBANON;  </P> <P> MUSLIM CLERIC CALLS FOR HOSTAGES' RELEASE  </P> <P> Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, the spiritual mentor of the Iranian-backed  Hezbollah (Party of God), appealed for the release of 17 Western hostages in  Lebanon, saying the West has used their plight to "disfigure the image of Islam  and Muslims." The cleric may have been reacting to an editorial in Iran's  pro-government Tehran Times, which said, "Regardless of the West's propaganda  ploys, Muslim forces out of Islamic and humanitarian considerations should work  to get hostages free with no precondition."  </P></p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / BR braced for further reduction in state funding BRITISH RAIL is braced for fresh cuts in the funding it receives from the government as part of the drive to meet public spending targets for the next three years. BR expects ministers to reduce the external financing limit which fixes the level of funds available to it each year on top of those it generates internally. This is already set to fall from about Pounds 2bn last year to Pounds 960m in 1995-96, even if there are no further cuts. The Department of Transport's Pounds 6.5bn budget has come under the close scrutiny of the cabinet's EDX committee which aims to reach a settlement on spending with all government departments by the end of the month. It is understood that no such settlement on transport spending has yet been reached. But sizeable cuts are widely anticipated, with the roads programme and planned government contributions to large-scale infrastructure projects said to be prime targets, as well as BR. The threat of deeper cuts comes as ministers are pondering how to respond to the prospect of a damaging backbench rebellion over the government's rail privatisation proposals. Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, and Mr Roger Freeman, transport minister, are holding meetings with Tory MPs concerned that BR should be able to bid against the private sector for franchises to operate passenger services. A Lords amendment proposing this was carried in July in spite of being opposed by the government. Mr MacGregor must now decide whether to reject the amendment when the rail privatisation bill returns to the Commons within the next month, risking a demoralising defeat if enough Tory backbenchers defy the government whips by voting with the opposition. Earlier this week, the government used a Lords debate on the bill to introduce a separate amendment in what appeared to be an attempt to stave off the threatened Commons rebellion. The amendment makes it a duty for the government to promote management buyouts of franchises by BR staff. It was agreed without a vote in spite of Labour warnings it could contravene European Community competition rules.</p>

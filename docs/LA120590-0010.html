			<p><P> December 5, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT -- STILL  </P> <P> Drawing the line between the right of society to protect itself from crime and  the right of those accused of crime to defend themselves from the accusations  of the state has never been an easy task and it's not going to get any easier.  The police are increasingly overwhelmed by crime, court dockets clogged with  cases. The role of the court in reviewing criminal convictions must be neither  to nit-pick the police to death nor chisel away at the constitutional rights of  citizens. The job is made even harder when in the particular case under review  the alleged crimes are truly heinous and the police have worked hard to crack  the case.  </P> <P> Take the case of Minnick vs. Mississippi, which was decided Monday by a 6-2  U.S. Supreme Court ruling in favor of a defendant who escaped from jail and  then allegedly shot two men. The Mississippi Supreme Court had ruled that  police acted properly when they resumed questioning after permitting the  defendant, as required by Miranda vs. Arizona (1966), to consult with counsel.  But the high court has now said that police can't question a suspect without an  attorney present when one has been requested.  </P> <P> Although in effect an affirmation of Edwards vs. Arizona (1981), the ruling was  unexpected, because the Supreme Court in recent years has appeared to reflect  in some rulings the view in some circles that Miranda is an impediment to good  law enforcement and the war on crime. The truth is that Miranda has proven not  an impediment but an enhancement: It provides police with clear and reasonable  guidelines for their interrogations. Nothing galls the cops more than to have  all their hard work thrown out on a technical error that could have been  avoided had the ground rules been laid out for them clearly.  </P> <P> The procedures of Miranda in fact were taken from pre-existing FBI  interrogation guidelines; now they are used by state and local law enforcement  throughout the nation. Miranda simply underscores the notion that in the United  States the accused has a vested right to silence unless choosing to speak out  in the "unfettered exercise of his own will." That's a standard all good cops  can live with. It's a standard a free society cannot live without.  </P></p>

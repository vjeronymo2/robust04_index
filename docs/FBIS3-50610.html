Here is another edition  of "Straight Talk" today, Tuesday [21 December], this time from  Santiago de Cuba Province -- specifically, from the Radio  Rebelde studios here in Santiago de Cuba Province.    With us are journalists Dania Sanchez Parra of the National  News Agency [AIN]; Mario Romaguera, a reporter from the SIERRA  MAESTRA newspaper; and Carlos Sanabria Marrero, a Radio Rebelde  journalist here in Santiago de Cuba. The topic: speculation and  the theft of food products. And, like we promised, as of today  we will refer to the letters of several listeners.    We begin with a letter from Ramon Sarmont Martinez who lives  here in Santiago de Cuba. He specifies that the people who steal  big quantities do not do it because they are hungry. They do it  because they want to get their hands on thousands of pesos in  just a few days. He adds: Nor will we side with those who reach  agreements with the people in the small produce markets to later  sell the sacks of potatoes, boniato, or yuca on the black  market. We know that there is a big tangled mess behind all  this. Meanwhile, other small produce markets are empty.    The discussion is now open, here on the Straight Talk  program, in Santiago de Cuba. Carlos Sanabria Marrero.    [Sanabria] Well, I think this listener from Santiago de Cuba  is very correct in what he has said to the Straight Talk  program. I think, Juan Carlos, that indeed the products, mainly  agricultural, are lost and diverted from the very moment they  come out of the fields, off the farm, and during the moving of  the products by the State Collection Enterprise from the fields  to the central warehouse. From that point, there is another  redistribution to the different markets by cart, as it is being  done here in Santiago de Cuba.    During that whole process the products are being diverted.  Logically, one market could be affected more than another, and  then there is this resale at exorbitant prices which hurts and  irritates the population. One could even encounter a situation  where when one gets to the market the staples that correspond to  one's needs are lacking. Where did these products end up? Who  took it? It was not the consumers, but the people involved in  this task and many administrators, as this listener has stated.    [Roque] Listener, Ruben Sarmont Martinez presents a  situation  that could be seen from Santiago de Cuba's particular point of  view. But I must say that is something that happens throughout  the country. It is a situation that repeats itself in the other  provinces. Nevertheless, from this letter, we can see the  problems that exist due to the speculation on and theft of food  products.    Dania Sanchez Parra from AIN is here with us in Santiago de  Cuba Province.    [Sanchez] Yes Roque, I agree with this listener. He said  that  most of these thefts do not respond to a true need of the person  who commits the crime. It is greed and the desire to get rich  quick. I would like to focus on something Sanabria said: This is  a chain. The chain begins from the source of these products or  their arrival at the port, through the distribution network,  until it reaches the market. This greatly damages the economy.  It is a great loss. The losses are not as few as they appear. It  is a chain and each link's role is very important.    [Roque] Analyzing this, we could probably conclude that on  one hand you have theft, but what are the causes? Hunger? There  also is a lack of control. There also is negligence by the  responsible authorities. We are going to continue discussing  this topic here on Straight Talk, directly from Santiago de Cuba.    [Roque] Our guests on this occasion are Dania Sanchez  Parra, from AIN; Mario Romaguera, a reporter from the SIERRA  MAESTRA newspaper; and Carlos Sanabria Marrero, a reporter from  Radio Rebelde here in Santiago de Cuba.    We continue with our debate: Speculation and the theft of  food products. Mario Romaguera.    [Romaguera] I agree with the listener in all his points. I  have experience in this area as a reporter. On several  occasions, I have denounced the sale of food products in  Santiago de Cuba, products that are produced by local  industries, such as bread, sausages, marmalade, and a series of  other products. These activities go on the streets of Santiago  de Cuba in the area of Central Street between Street No. 4 and  the bus station. This area includes two areas with a large flow  of people in addition to people going to the provincial hospital  and the maternity hospital.    [Roque] Carlos Sanabria Marrero, we were analyzing the  causes, but we must also find, as I said, the reason why these  acts take place. Why is there speculation? Is it just because of  necessity?    [Sanabria] I do not think it is just necessity. There are  many people, as the listeners have pointed out, that do not need  to steal or speculate. They do it to get rich and, logically,  because the consumer wants the product.    Everyone knows the situation our country is currently going  through. I reiterate, I believe the main responsibility lies on  those people responsible for making sure these situations do not  occur. These products do not have difficulties while they are in  storage. The difficulties begin once those products leave the  warehouse. We need to make sure those products are reaching  their final destination.    We can see this in the situation of the State Collection  Agency. Since there still is no control, no one can verify that  the products reach their final destination, instead of being  diverted and reaching destinations they should not reach. That  is where these difficulties come from, problems that irritate  the population. When someone tells you that you have to pay 5  pesos for a plantain, which he probably stole from the state,  you will probably buy it because of need, but undoubtedly it  will end up affecting you, your family, and the country's  economy.    [Roque] This is a topic that has many angles. Listener Maria  Geudes Alfonso writes to us: In my opinion, theft and fraud in  the sale of products to the population are not just seen on  streets and on the black market; it originates in the stores,  markets, and restaurants. She adds: I do not wish to be  specific, but I think it is necessary that you analyze and talk  about this topic so that these shameful things that victimize  the consumer and force him to bear and put up with this are  known.    We will hear from Dania Sanchez Parra from AIN.    [Sanchez] Yes, when merchandise arrives at its first  reception point, before reaching the distribution network, it is  already on the black market and there are already possibilities  of obtaining it--before the state has made it available to the  population. Other factors are negligence and lack of control,  evils greatly affecting our economy.    [Roque] How do we combat this? I am sure this is a question  that many listeners are asking. Mario Romaguera.    [Romaguera] Juan Carlos, it is evident that the first thing  we need is a truly serious corps of inspectors. It is clear that  we need a truly serious corps of inspectors.    [Roque] It would be another corps of inspectors, right?    [Romaguera] Yes, another one.    [Roque] When are we going to assign this new group? We have  placed inspectors in different areas of the food industry,  agriculture, the collection area, and the whole system, and we  still do not have the results we want because these products are  still being sold on the black market. This irritates the  population who purchase these products out of need. I think it  is time to take other measures if we see that the current ones  do not have good results.    [Romaguera] Another solution could be the immediate  expulsion of those inspectors who allow this to happen and the  expulsion of those administrators and workers who divert the  goods. I must state that not all workers are bandits who divert  resources. There is a network of workers who commit these  violations. I say violations, to use a kinder word.    [Roque] We must find a solution. It is evident that this  problem cannot continue, especially today when the special  period is sharp, with the situation at the end of the year, and  the situation of the new year. It is very difficult. No one can  make predictions, but we are approaching very difficult times  and we must face this. How can we face this situation? Dania  could you please comment on this.    [Sanchez] I do not think the solution is to create new  mechanisms, because we already have many mechanisms.    [Roque] Too many.    [Sanchez] Yes, many. I would talk about being demanding of  those mechanisms, because as you can see we have too many. We  are talking about administrators and distributors. We are  talking about the role of the inspectors and the receiving  units, and I believe there still is much more to be said. I  would also say that we need more social action. Everyone has a  great responsibility. This task belongs to each member of our  society, and it is important that each link of this chain does  its part harmoniously.    [Roque] This is an important point, because in this struggle  against speculation and theft the people are the main players.  It is the people who must face the situation.    [Romaguera] Juan Carlos, people need support. They must be  helped. I will give you an example. Many times hamburgers are  sold without bread. Then some quack appears on the street --  and this is something I have seen for myself in Calvario in  front of the Santiago de Cuba funeral home -- screaming or  chanting: I have hamburgers with bread. Where did he get the  bread, especially when the bread used for hamburgers is a  special type. How did he get that bread. This is something the  SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper has been denouncing in reports I have  written, as well as by reporters like Rafael Carela and Jose  Ignate. Action needs to be taken in this sense.    [Sanabria] I agree with what you and Dania have stated. I  believe a raid should be carried out block by block, where every  person knows who is who, where the presidents of the Committees  for the Defense of the Revolution [CDR] knows everyone, where  the CDR president's neighbor knows his neighbor. I believe that  if we combat this from the very base, many of these problems  could be eliminated. I believe the battle has to be fought block  by block, because when the people fight the battle we win.    [Roque] Dania, we have 30 seconds left in the program.    [Sanchez] Roque, it is not going to be these actions that  are  going to solve this problem. It will be the systematic efforts  and the awareness that we cannot build socialism that way.    [Roque] This has been Straight Talk from Santiago de Cuba.  The topic has been: speculation and theft of food products. I  thank Dania Sanchez Parra, from AIN; Mario Romaguera, from the  SIERRA MAESTRA newspaper; and our journalist Carlos Sanabria  Marrero, here in the Radio Rebelde studio in Santiago de Cuba.</p>

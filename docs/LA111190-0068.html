			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PARTY'S OVER, SO RESPONSIBLE POLITICS CALLED IT A DAY  </P> <P> The election outcome is well summed up in the sagacious remark attributed to  St. Theresa: "More tears are shed over answered, than unanswered, prayers."  </P> <P> And haven't our political prayers been answered? Isn't this what you really  wanted when you moved to the suburbs, re-registered as an "independent" and  began sending your donations to the single-issue outfits? Isn't it what you  wanted when you said, "I vote for the man, not the party"? Or "Why don't they  cut out the cheap partisanship and just do the right thing"?  </P> <P> Of course it is. And the common denominator was and is hostility to political  parties. The trouble is that parties, messy as they are, are the only  instruments by which a diverse electorate ever managed to hold government  accountable for its acts and policies. At their best, they stood for coherence,  accountability and discipline.  </P> <P> But by now parties consist, pretty much, of offices in Washington. In Congress,  it is everyone for himself. This is no surprise, since parties have less to say  about who runs for what under which label than the press, which has less to say  about it than big donors, public-relations firms and advertising tycoons. All  you need to run today, even for President, is an ample ego, a pollster and a  financial backer or two.  </P> <P> Not everyone who enters this self-initiated process wins. But no one loses or  fails at it because a party disapproves, or because the candidate's opinions  have little to do with the party's historic positions. A Ku Kluxer runs for  senator as a "Republican" in Louisiana, and the party is powerless to stop him.  It cannot even withhold the label. Parties adjust to candidates, not the other  way around.  </P> <P> No wonder Tuesday's election looks to most observers like a "themeless  pudding." It was the latest study in the incoherence of partyless politics.  </P></p>

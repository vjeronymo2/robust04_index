Vural Seker, 22, Iman Seker and Semsettin Yildirim, 31, who  entered France in 1989, were arrested on Monday when they  reported to the local police station after the Interior Ministry  rejected their asylum request. They were put on a plane for  Istanbul on Tuesday.    The committee for the right of aslyum in Annecy condemned  the  deportations as "a veritable denial of human rights" and said  the Kurds had been imprisoned and persecuted in Turkey.    But local authority spokeswoman Patricia Mauroy-Willaert  defended the decision, saying the Kurds were "potential illegal  immigrants" and that if they had been informed of the decision  in advance they would have disappeared.    The Kurds' initial asylum request had been rejected and the  refusal was confirmed on appeal.</p>

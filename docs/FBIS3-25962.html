			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Special article" by reporter Si Liang (1835 5328)] </F>   [Text] Hong Kong, 24 Jan (ZHONGGUO TONGXUN SHE)--Recently,  domestic and overseas mass media often reported about the "tidal  movement of migrant rural laborers" in the Chinese mainland. On  the surface, the "tide" produced quite a few negative effects,  such as traffic jams, population pressure, worsening  law-and-order conditions, and poor public hygiene. However,  behind such superficial problems, there were also many favorable  factors, and its contributions to the national economy must not  be neglected.    The "tide" involving 15 to 20 million migrant laborers from  the countryside is a special socioeconomic phenomenon in the  Chinese mainland. Rural laborers move in large numbers from  poor and backward areas to economically developed areas. This  is not only an major way to shift the surplus rural labor force,  but also an effective way to develop and utilize labor resources  and to promote employment in the countryside. Although movement  of rural laborers in large numbers into cities may cause many  problems for cities and urban communities, most rural laborers  who have come to cities maintain the virtues of working hard,  leading a simple and honest life, and being kindhearted. They  sell their labor and strive to get rich through hard work. They  are willing to undertake all kinds of heavy manual labor. In  particular, such dirty, exhausting, and dangerous jobs of  collecting night soil, removing garbage, dredging sewers, and  moving stones, which few urban residents are wiling to do, are  now mostly undertaken by laborers from the countryside. As some  people said, if all rural laborers leave, some cities may  certainly become paralyzed.    In the mainland, rural laborer have not only contributed  their strength and sweat to urban economic development, but have  also built "roads" and "bridges" for raising the rural people's  living standards to the level of being comparatively better-off.  After working hard in cities a number of years, some rural  laborers master certain market information, production skills,  and management knowledge; at the same time, they also accumulate  some money. Then, they return home and set up shops, plants, or  businesses. They thus become a new force for developing  township and town enterprises and promoting the rural economy.  Many of them play an exemplary role locally in getting rich.  According the data provided by the Rural Enterprise Bureau of  Jiangxi's Ganzhou Prefecture, in the first 10 months of 1993,  laborers returning home from work in cities set up 1,200  factories and business companies in their home areas, and made a  total investment of some 40 million yuan. These institutions  offered 100,000 jobs to local people. As another example, more  than 5 million rural laborers from Anhui Province supported  economic construction in many provinces, and half of them  mastered skills. Skilled rural workers from Anhui's Wuwei County  set up more than 30 enterprises after returning home, and they  all achieved satisfactory business results. Some even export  their products to overseas markets.    In addition to running enterprises after returning home,  many  rural laborers also helped their home areas promote sales of  native products and seek employment channels for the surplus  labor force in their home areas, as they became better informed  and had more knowledge and connections. At the same time, they  also introduced capital, technology, and skilled manpower back  to their home areas. For example, more than 10,000 rural  laborers from Gansu's Zhengning County worked in more than 30  trades in more than 20 provinces and regions throughout the  country. When earning money, they also brought a large quantity  of technical information in the fields of crop farming, animal  husbandry, building materials production, and processing  industry back to their home area. According to incomplete  statistics, between January and November 1993, they brought back  over 1,200 pieces of valuable economic and technical  information. With the help of their information and  connections, the county sold one-third of its farm produce to  other localities, set up 13 shops and plants, dispatched over  1,000 batches of rural laborers, and increased local peasant  income by over 30 million yuan.    When they were working in economically developed cities,  many  rural laborers also received training or studied by themselves,  thus improving their educational and technical conditions. Some  people attended night schools to take secondary-school courses  or even took college courses by means of correspondence and  television. For example, about 600,000 out of the more than 1  million rural laborers from Anhui's Fuyang Prefecture working  outside their home area have taken different forms of vocational  and technical training. A young girl who worked as a household  assistant in Beijing learned medical knowledge and skills from  her employer. In 1988, she returned home and run a factory  producing more than 10 types of medical-related products, which  were sold at home and abroad.    Along with the industrialization and urbanization of the  rural economy in the Chinese mainland, the significance of the  "tide of rural laborers" for the development of urban and rural  economies is getting more and more prominent.</p>

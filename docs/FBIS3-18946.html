That is what Saxony Interior Minister  Eggert, Christian Democratic Union, said in Dresden on Tuesday  [8 March] when he presented the Office for the Protection of the  Constitution report for 1993. According to the report,  functionaries and members of the National Offensive and German  Alternative in the meantime have become members of the DVU and  the NPD. The former functionaries of extreme right-wing parties  also have established links with new circles. An employee of  the Office for the Protection of the Constitution reported on a  meeting in Dresden attended by NPD members and neo-Nazis after  which Republikaner leaflets were distributed.    The number of criminal offenses of an extremist right-wing  nature fell by 60 percent compared to 1992, said Eggert. A  total of 84 crimes of violence and 389 other offenses, mainly  the painting of swastikas, were registered. They were usually  "spontaneous actions," mainly involving skinheads who were not  members of extremist right-wing organizations. As Eggert said,  there are 3,400 right-wing extremists in Saxony, of whom 900 are  considered militant. Approximately 300 people belong to  neo-Nazi organizations.    The Office for the Protection of the Constitution noted that  among the Republikaner, who have 700 members in Saxony, there  are "indications of efforts directed against the basic liberal  democratic order." Leaflets show "that the political ideas of  the party in Saxony are based not on a democratic but on a  nationalist ideology." The DVU is reported to have 1,500  members in Saxony, but is "still not very active" as far as  public events are concerned. The NPD has approximately 250  members. The organizational development of these parties has  still not been completed, but one can expect them to participate  in this year's elections, said Eggert.    Last year, 57 crimes of violence were committed by left-wing  extremists. The militant left-wing extremist "scene" in Saxony  consists of about 500 people. Compared to extremist left-wing  circles in western Germany, the "scene" has developed ideas of  its own. There is little support for "internationalism" or  imprisoned members of the Red Army Faction. Extremist positions  are held on such issues as unemployment, "west German  colonization of the east," and coming to terms with the Stasi  past.    The DKP [German Communist Party] and the KPD [Communist  Party  of Germany] have not been able to develop any organizations in  Saxony so far. On the other hand, the extremist left-wing  Communist Platform (KPF) is trying to increase its influence  within the PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism]. Eggert does not  believe that the activities of the KPF faction within the PDS  justify having the entire party monitored by the Office for the  Protection of the Constitution.</p>

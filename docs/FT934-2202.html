			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / People: Miles to become Barings' joint deputy chairman If you are 57 and have been the Taipan of one of Hong Kong's biggest trading houses, it hardly seems worth starting a second career. But Michael Miles, an executive director of the family-owned John Swire &amp; Sons, obviously feels that the sixth decade of life is ample time for a new start; he is about to become a full-time merchant banker. Miles, who started with Swire in 1958, has spent most of his life in the Pacific basin. He was chairman of John Swire &amp; Sons (HK) between 1984 and 1988 and is also a former chairman of Swire Pacific and Cathay Pacific, Swire's two biggest quoted subsidiaries. Early next year he becomes a joint deputy chairman of Barings, alongside Andrew Tuckey, 50, which means that Miles will be joint number two at Britain's oldest merchant bank. A non-executive director of Barings since 1989, Miles is not a banker but sat on the board of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation during his time as Swire's Taipan. Although he is only six months younger than Baring chairman Peter Baring, who is expected to hand over to Andrew Tuckey in a couple of years time, Miles hopes to be in his new job for 'three to four years'. He will continue as a director of John Swire &amp; Sons and will retain 'certain specific Swire group executive responsibilities'. Barings' decision to add a well-connected outsider to the team of four executive directors running the group underlines its ambitions in an area where old contacts are often just as important as bright ideas. More than a quarter of its 3260 staff are based in the Pacific basin. One rival merchant bank speculated that Miles had been hired as a 'high-powered door opener' rather than for his managerial skills. Barings and Swire appear different but share similar characteristics. Both grew out of firms of family merchants which started trading at the start of the 18th century. Although Barings is better known in the City, the Swire group is much bigger. In its last financial year it made pre-tax profits of over Pounds 600m on turnover of Pounds 3.6bn and along with its associates employs 74,000 people.</p>

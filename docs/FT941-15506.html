			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / LWT in talks with American suitor London Weekend Television is talking to a North American group which proposes to take a stake of slightly less than 30 per cent in the ITV company. LWT is trying to fend off a hostile bid from Granada, the television, rental and leisure group. If the talks lead to a deal, it could transform the battle for control of LWT because senior managers own 10 per cent and have said they will not sell. It is believed the potential North American suitor's plan would be to hold the stock for a relatively short time while other potential international media investors, already lined up, carry out due diligence. All the signs are that LWT is trying to put together an international alternative to its defunct plan for a takeover of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees. Time is short for LWT because Granada has extended its offer of six shares for every five - worth nearly Pounds 700m - to January 26, and is expected to come up with improved terms before the final closing date on February 4. At the moment LWT is appealing to shareholders to reject the Granada offer on the record of its management team, led by Sir Christopher Bland, and a 1993 pre-tax profit estimate of Pounds 43.8m. Support for the LWT management came yesterday from Ms Katherine Pelly, media analyst at stockbrokers Kleinwort Benson, believed to be the first City analyst to say unequivocally that the Granada bid should be rejected. 'The terms of the hostile bid by Granada Group for LWT do not represent the economic and strategic value of LWT to Granada,' she argued in a research note. The widespread view in the City is that Granada will win the tussle, but probably only after the terms are 'sweetened'. The Kleinwort analyst pointed out that the offer, which on January 12 valued LWT at 670p per share, represented an exit price/earnings ratio of 23.5 times, little more than that of Scottish Television which is not facing a bid. 'This suggests that were the Granada bid not to be on the table, LWT shares could be expected to trade at levels not far from the current price,' said Ms Pelly, who added that with a cross-ownership media review under way, LWT was one of the most attractive ITV companies.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Justinian: 'Catch-all' crime to be avoided The two jurors from the Guinness Two and Nottingham Crown Court trials who wrote to this newspaper complaining about the legal profession's apparent disdain for the intelligence of juries in complex fraud trials may nevertheless welcome the authorities' search for a simpler legal process - in particular, the suggestion for a new offence of fraud. A general offence of fraud is unknown to English law. It is being said that it would be helpful if there were such a crime (as there is in Scotland) to help reduce, if not avoid, the ordeal of inordinately long fraud trials that have scarred the criminal justice scene in recent weeks. The idea is not new, only that it is being taken more seriously. In 1986, the Roskill Committee, in its recommendation to substitute a professional tribunal for jury trial in serious fraud cases, added that the issue of a crime of fraud simpliciter should be further examined. Academic writers too have been advocating the introduction of such a crime, either as a widely-conceived residual offence to specific fraudulent offences, or in substitution of the crime of conspiracy to defraud. Conspiracy to defraud comes close to being a general offence of fraud, since the courts have given it an extremely wide scope. The two principal differences are that conspiracy to defraud cannot be committed by a person acting on his or her own. Since a conspiracy is an agreement to do something unlawful, it must not be confused with the means by which it is intended to be carried out. The courts have been chary of defining the offence 'to defraud', which takes its colour from the context in which the phrase is used, and means, ordinarily, to deprive a person dishonestly of something which is his - or of something to which he is, would be or might be entitled, but for the perpetration of the fraud. The Law Commission, in its 1987 review of conspiracy to defraud, rejected the replacement of conspiracy to defraud by a general fraud offence capable of being committed by a single individual, largely on the ground of the scope of such an ill-defined offence. Most commercial activity is carried on with a view to gain for its perpetrators, or financial prejudice to others, so that in practice the offence would depend upon the jury's view of 'dishonesty'. Such an offence would provide insufficient guidance in advance as to what could or could not be lawfully done. Penal sanctions should be imposed only in clear cases. But if a general offence of fraud were introduced simply as a long-stop, to be used in addition to conspiracy to defraud, some of the objections would drop away. If, moreover, the addition of a charge of fraud were controlled by the judge in pre-trial directions, any abuse by presenters of a 'catch-all' crime would be avoided. Whether the general offence of fraud would significantly shorten complex fraud trials is highly problematical. Again, the answer to that question would depend on the definition of the crime. If it were tightly drawn, it might limit the scope of the forensic process, but would hardly do the trick of supplementing the existing law. If it were loosely defined, there would be cries of uncertainty and ambiguity about lawful commercial conduct. Some helpful guidance has just been provided by the Court of Appeal for Jersey, in an impressive judgment under the presidency of Sir Godfray Le Quesne QC, a former chairman of the Monopolies and Merger Commission. A charge of 'fraud, contrary to the common law of Jersey' was upheld, the argument focusing on whether in Jersey criminal law, largely adapted from English statutory law, such an offence ever existed or was extant. The accused, who was a director of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank in Jersey, was alleged to have fraudulently induced his employer to purchase a property in St Helier for Pounds 700,000 by withholding from the bank the facts, known to him, that the property was offered for sale at Pounds 367,500 and could have been bought for Pounds 310,000 or thereabouts. The Court of Appeal came to the conclusion - not without hesitation, it was at pains to observe - that the appellant had committed a misrepresentation, it being that it was necessary to pay Pounds 700,000 in order to obtain the property. It was done fraudulently. By acting fraudulently, the accused caused actual prejudice to the bank, because it paid for the property more than twice the sum for which it could have bought the property, and produced a corresponding benefit to the vendors. Thus the essential features of fraud were present. For good measure, the Court added that the accused's conduct was a breach of trust. The bank was entitled to rely on the accused for information about local conditions affecting a purchase of local property. By the withholding of important information, that trust was flagrantly abused, and it was done in a commercial transaction in the course of the accused's duties as an executive director. The Court's hesitancy in upholding the conviction is expressed in language that should serve as a warning. The Court said: 'We do not consider it acceptable today to have a criminal offence defined in very general and comprehensive terms and to trust that it will be confined within proper limits by the discretion of the prosecuting officers in using it. The citizen is entitled to clearer information than that makes possible of what is criminal and what is innocent.' Just so.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Guatemala City, 4 Apr (ACAN-EFE) -- The Guatemalan  Government announced today that civil rights will not be  suspended in the nation despite the instability created by the  weekend assassination of Constitutionality Court President  Epaminondas Gonzalez. In a State Council meeting held today,  President Ramiro de Leon Carpio and his ministers decided not to  declare a state of exception [estado de excepcion] and to  continue to monitor the situation in upcoming working sessions,  according to government spokesman Felix Loarca.    After the assassination of Gonzalez, 62, some sectors had  asked that civil rights be suspended because of a prevailing  climate of violence. Human rights organizations, however,  rejected a possible suspension of rights, arguing that such a  suspension would pave the way for repression. In addition, the  Army said it would support the measure if it was approved by the  executive.    [In related news, Guatemala City Teleonce Television in  Spanish at 1900 GMT on 4 April, in its "Telepress" newscast,  broadcasts a one-minute recorded interview with Government  Minister Danilo Pariello, who was interviewed on his way to the  State Council meeting called to discuss the possible suspension  of rights in Guatemala. Noting that the session was called "to  assess the serious situation caused by the Constitutionality  Court president's death," Pariello adds that "pertinent measures  have already been taken." Asked whether a "state of exception"  will indeed be declared, he says this "will have to be decided  at the cabinet meeting." He notes that any state of exception  that might be declared would be "one of prevention, and one  which could be declared immediately."]</p>

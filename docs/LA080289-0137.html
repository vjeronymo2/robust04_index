			<p><P> August 2, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BOSTON CELTICS SIGN DINO RADJA  </P> <P> The Boston Celtics, taking the view that 6-foot-10 Dino Radja was an amateur  with his former Yugoslavian basketball club, have signed him to a one-year  contract in the very professional National Basketball Assn.  </P> <P> "I feel very nice now," said Radja after his first official NBA workout with  the Celtics at Brandeis University on Tuesday, but he admitted that he felt bad  that his Yugoslavian team, Jugoplastika, had been unsupportive and  uncooperative in his pursuit of a basketball career in the NBA.  </P> <P> The Yugoslavian club maintains that Radja signed a four-year pact and is  committed to it through 1992.  </P> <P> Celtics General Manager Jan Volk disagrees. "Their contract is an equivalent of  an amateur contract," he said.  </P> <P> Terms of his contract were not made public, but Radja said he feels like "the  richest man in the world."  </P></p>

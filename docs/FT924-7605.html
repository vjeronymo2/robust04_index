			<p>921116 FT  16 NOV 92 / Burgundy prices come down Although Burgundy probably enjoyed the best vintage in France this year, the depressed state of the market at yesterday's Hospices de Beaune auction of its new wine led to a sharp drop in prices for the third year running, writes Edmund Penning-Rowsell in Beaune. Average price on the 567 casks of red wine fell by 21.8 per cent to FFr17,242 (Pounds 2,113), and the 96 casks of white were lower by 25 per cent to FFr21,625 (Pounds 2,650). Prices would have been lower but for the constant intervention of the firm of Patriarche of Beaune which bought 26 of the 81 lots on offer. The only prominent foreign buyers were Japanese; the firm of Katsuski Joyama of Tokyo paid FFr60,000 a cask for the first lot of Pommard Raymond Cyrot.</p>

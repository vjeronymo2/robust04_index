			<p>920801 FT  01 AUG 92 / Brussels backs off in state aid rows THE European Commission yesterday submitted to heavy pressure from governments and companies outside the Community and postponed decisions on two controversial state aid cases. Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, was forced to withdraw proposals to make Asea Brown Boveri, the Swiss-Swedish industrial group, repay illegal state aid of Pta36bn (Pounds 196m) to the Spanish government. The plan is likely to be resubmitted to the Commission in September, although it may have to be substantially reworked to attract enough support from other commissioners, who expressed serious reservations yesterday. They were said to be worried about pending legal action by the Spanish authorities, which disputes Brussels' right to open a state aid investigation. The Spanish authorities wrote off Pta36bn of debts owed to them by CCC, an ailing electricals group which ABB bought in June 1990. CCC would have difficulty repaying the write-off itself. Separately, the Commission decided to delay imposition of a 10 per cent customs duty on Chrysler vans imported into the EC from a new Austrian factory. Brussels alleges that Austria provided excessive subsidies for the factory, breaking the terms of a trade agreement with the EC. Community cannot demand repayment of the aid, because Austria is not an EC member and the European Economic Area is not yet in force. The commissioners decided on further talks with Austria before they submit formal proposals for duties to EC member states. The Commission is to take the Italian government to the European Court for not implementing two 1989 Commission decisions calling for the refund of L875.5bn (Pounds 399m) of state aid. The Commission wants the aid  - L615.1bn from Alfa Romeo and L260.4bn from Lanerossi  - to be repaid to the Italian state rather than to state-owned holding companies. The Alfa Romeo decision has already been upheld once by the European Court.</p>

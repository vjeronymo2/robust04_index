			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUCKEY'S LAWYER SAYS REINER IS SEEKING TO WIN VOTES WITH RETRIAL  </P> <P> Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner was accused by Ray Buckey's lawyer Thursday of  attempting to boost his campaign for state attorney general by ordering a new  trial for the McMartin Pre-School defendant on 13 charges of child molestation  and conspiracy.  </P> <P> "It's an expedient use of (the public's) emotional confusion," Danny Davis said  in an interview the day after Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger Gunson announced  Reiner's decision to retry Buckey.  </P> <P> Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted last month of 52  molestation counts after a 2 1/2-year trial, the longest criminal proceeding in  U.S. history. The jury deadlocked on 13 other counts.  </P> <P> The decision to retry Ray Buckey was "not a political matter, but a matter of  justice," Reiner said Wednesday after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge William  Pounders set the new trial for March 9.  </P> <P> Davis declined to speak to the media after a brief court hearing Thursday, but  in a telephone interview he said Reiner was preying on the public's "emotional  backlash."  </P> <P> The public outcry "could lead a politician to believe that continuing to  prosecute in this case would be consistent with demonstrating that he is  against molestation," Davis said. " . . . For politicians, a large vote for  retrial would also mean a large emotional vote for the person who refiled the  case."  </P> <P> Davis noted that television polls found the public overwhelmingly opposed to  the acquittals.  </P> <P> Reiner, running for attorney general in the June Democractic primary, could not  be reached for comment Thursday. But on Wednesday he said politics was never an  issue during hours of discussions in his office on retrying Buckey. Reiner said  he decided to press the case to resolve the charges more clearly, because of  the "seriousness of the offense" and the "feelings of the families, especially  the children."  </P> <P> The remaining charges involve five children allegedly molested at the McMartin  Pre-School in Manhattan Beach between 1978 and 1984. Jurors in the first trial  said the majority had voted for acquittal on all of the deadlocked counts.  </P> <P> Davis said the jury had more trouble deciding the 13 charges because it heard  less evidence on those counts than on the 52 others. He said the prosecution at  retrial will face the same problem it had in the first trial -- proving that  children were not prompted by parents, police or the social workers who  interviewed them.  </P> <P> "I never felt any of these witnesses were appropriate for a criminal trial,"  Davis said. "Their stories were too mixed with contamination and the unreal."  The defense attorney had told Pounders on Wednesday that he needed to clear "a  number of obstacles" before retrying the case. But he said Thursday that he has  no doubt that he will represent Buckey.  </P> <P> Reiner said late Thursday that Buckey could be retried on just five molestation  charges. In remarks during taping of KNBC-TV's weekend "News Conference" show,  Reiner said only two of the remaining five alleged molestation victims have  made strong commitments to testify at the retrial. He said a third alleged  victim will not testify, and prosecutors will dismiss three molestation counts  relating to her. He said it is doubtful a fourth alleged victim will testify.  </P> <P> Afterward, Reiner said prosecutors do not intend to call the fifth alleged  victim, a boy whose mother triggered the case in 1983. If only two testify,  Buckey would be retried on five counts, he said.  </P></p>

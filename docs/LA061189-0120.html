			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SALKELD TO TEST LEGION BATTERS AS PRO CONTRACT TALKS CONTINUE  </P> <P> San Fernando's American Legion team absorbed a District 20 forfeit Saturday at  the hands of Newhall-Saugus (Santa Clarita), but it could have been much more  painful.  </P> <P> For instance, San Fernando might have shown up.  </P> <P> The scheduled pitcher for Newhall-Saugus in the Northern Division game at  Saugus High was none other than right-hander Roger Salkeld, the No. 3 selection  in the baseball free-agent draft last week.  </P> <P> Salkeld, who was 13-1 and led Saugus High to the Southern Section 3-A Division  final, was drafted by Seattle. And while negotiations continue between  Salkeld's father, Bill, and Mariner officials, Roger says he plans to continue  to play for Newhall-Saugus (3-0).  </P> <P> "(Seattle) didn't say I couldn't," Roger said.  </P> <P> A reprieve of sorts for San Fernando may soon turn into misfortune for others:  Salkeld is scheduled to pitch in today's doubleheader against Burbank at  Northwest Park at 2 p.m.  </P> <P> Salkeld, meanwhile, continues to pile up awards. Saugus High assistant coach  Bill Bolde said the school was notified this week that Salkeld has been  selected Gatorade California Player of the Year and is one of two pitchers  named to the USA Today high school All-America team.

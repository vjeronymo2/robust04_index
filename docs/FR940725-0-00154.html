			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Consideration should be given to a two tier rescue system where the employer is required to have a small rescue unit (two man team) trained by the outside rescue team for immediate response to a problem. Their level of involvement could be dictated by the rescue contractor who could also determine what rescue equipment should be maintained on-site. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most commenters argued that response times should not be addressed in the standard (Ex. 11&hyph;6, 11&hyph;9, 11&hyph;11, 11&hyph;14, 11&hyph;15, 11&hyph;18, 11&hyph;19, 11&hyph;22, 11&hyph;24, 11&hyph;26, 11&hyph;29, 11&hyph;31, 11&hyph;36, 11&hyph;38, 11&hyph;39, 11&hyph;40, 11&hyph;41, 11&hyph;43, 11&hyph;44, 11&hyph;50). These commenters argued that there were too many variables involved in shipyards for OSHA to be able to specify an appropriate response time. Mr. Joseph J. Ocken (Ex. 11&hyph;31) went further, suggesting that stressing the importance of rescue would lead to even more deaths, as follows: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This entire issue focuses on rescue teams: inside and outside teams, team procedures, response times, and protocols/planning. I have strong reservations about regulating or mandating rescue operations in this manner. There are numerous confined space entries made on a daily basis while there are very few rescue attempts made. Even so, most confined space deaths are associated with rescue attempts. Intentionally or unintentionally the tone of the proposed language seems to communicate very dangerous messages: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RESCUE ATTEMPTS ARE MANDATORY. This may not be intended by OSHA but the language could be misconstrued to suggest it. Many concerned safety professionals have devoted a lot of energy to communicate the opposite message! These teams should not even be referred to as ``rescue teams'' but rather ``recovery or retrieval teams'' in order to avoid any confusion on this point. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HURRY! OSHA's intent is important in that employers need to be reasonable in designating outside rescue resources. The response time message however, is that rescuers must hurry. Given the poor effectiveness statistics for rescue attempts the emphasis should be placed on QUALITY OF RECOVERY rather than SPEED OF RESCUE. Employers should be most concerned with selecting a qualified team and supporting their familiarization with the shipyard, training and drills to avoid further tragedies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RELIANCE ON RESCUE. It might be argued that the proposed rescue provisions require such attempts to be quite different from the haphazard rescue attempts that are notorious for additional fatalities (rather than the desired ``rescue''). This argument needs to be considered in the context of the environment where it will be applied. The very need for a confined space rescue implies that a FAILURE HAS ALREADY OCCURRED IN THE PROGRAM. Objectively we should be concerned that such a demonstrated failure to ensure safe entry in the first place also calls into question the ability to safely conduct a much more dangerous rescue attempt. A confined space entry standard is being proposed specifically to address a grim body of statistics which also tells us that rescue in confined spaces is even more dangerous. Rescue teams will be made up of workers needing protection too. We should be looking to improve other backups rather than emphasizing rescue. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has concluded that it is important for rescue attempts to be initiated as soon after an accident occurs as possible. If rescue attempts are delayed too long, the rescue team could become a body retrieval team instead. OSHA also believes that rescue teams must be properly equipped and trained so that the dangers noted by Mr. Ocken are minimized. Fatalities involving rescuers typically have involved untrained or poorly trained individuals who are not properly equipped for entry into confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres. Final revised Subpart B, generic general industry permit-space standard, &sect;1910.146, ensures that rescue personnel are properly equipped and fully trained to perform rescue. To address the issue of timeliness in responding to requests for emergency services, the introductory text to final &sect;1915.12(e) requires employers to provide a shipyard rescue team or to arrange for an outside rescue service that can respond promptly. OSHA believes that this requirement places a responsibility on employers to take whatever actions are necessary to rescue entrants (rather than retrieve bodies) from spaces covered by Subpart B. Employers must consider such factors as the response time, equipment, and state of training for rescue services not composed of the host employer's own employees when he or she chooses to arrange for such services. The rescue service selected by the employer must be able to arrive at the worksite quickly enough to perform rescue and must be equipped to perform rescue for the employer to be in compliance with the standard. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (e)(1), OSHA is requiring that shipyard rescue teams meet certain criteria. These criteria are intended to ensure that shipyard rescue teams are properly trained and equipped to perform rescue. Outside rescue services are already covered under the generic permit-space standard in &sect;1910.146(k)(1). Employers providing these services are general industry employers (not shipyard employers) who will be covered under the general industry standards for the vast majority of their work. Therefore, the Agency believes that it is reasonable and appropriate to apply existing &sect;1910.146(k)(1) to these employers rather than to adopt separate requirements for outside rescue services in the shipyard standards. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e)(1)(i) requires each employee assigned to the shipyard team to be provided with and trained to use the personal protective equipment they will need to perform their function safely, including respirators and any rescue equipment necessary for making rescues from confined or enclosed spaces or other dangerous atmospheres. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph (e)(1)(ii) requires that employees assigned to the shipyard rescue team be trained to perform their rescue functions safely including entry into confined and enclosed spaces and other dangerous atmospheres. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

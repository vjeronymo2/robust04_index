			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Communique issued by the Christian Democratic Party; place </F> and date not given]    [Excerpts] The president of the Christian Democratic Party  [PDC], Jean-Nepomucene Nayinzira, informs members of the PDC,  all Rwandans, and the international community of the following:  All reasonable people are saddened by the accident which led to  the loss of lives of the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi and  their travelling companions. When Rwandans learned about the  sad death of President Habyarimana, professional killers started  executing the plan that they had been drawing up for a long  time, which was to assassinate all the politicians who fought  for democracy and who were in favor of the implementation of the  Arusha peace agreement. They killed Prime Minister Agathe  Uwilingiyimana, some members of her government, heads of  opposition parties, nuns and priests, members of opposition  political parties, and foreigners who are opposed to the acts of  violence.    The PDC emphatically denounces [words indistinct] set up on  8  April 1994 by claiming that it was made up of all the concerned  parties in opposition with the former government which has been  legalized by Article 8 of the Arusha peace agreement. It is  also sad and shameful to see the president of the National  Development Council, Mr. Theodore Sindikubgabo, calling himself  the president of the Republic, basing this on Article 42 of the  Constitution. He is among those who abrogated it by decree  18/94 of 3 August 1993, concerning the revision of the  Constitution as mentioned in the Arusha agreement. [passage  omitted]    The PDC calls upon government troops, the RPF, all Rwandans  and friends of Rwanda to join together to fight the clique which  is devastating the country.</p>

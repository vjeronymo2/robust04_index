			<p>920406 FT  06 APR 92 / Survey of Light Rail Systems (7): Gone but not forgotten - Early systems helped bring a revolution in urban transport once the world leader in light rail systems - was reached in 1916, by which time 18,000 miles of track were installed in urban areas. In the UK, by 1920, there were 14,000 trams in operation. But despite important advances in tramway technology, especially between 1930 and 1950, these developments failed to stop the accelerating trend in tramway decline, mostly due to economic pressures upon operators. Today, the only evidence of many once-famous light rail systems is to be found in transport museums. What is claimed to be the world's most popular tramway collection is the UK's National Tramway Museum at Crich, located 15 miles north of Derby and six miles from Matlock, which last year attracted 133,000 visitors - achieving a higher figure than many larger transport museums in the US. There are 50 electric and horse-drawn trams at Crich, of which 20 are still operational. Most have been painstakingly restored by staff and enthusiastic volunteers. Beyond the UK, there are specialist museums in the US, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, Holland and Prague. The world's oldest tramway collection is the Seashore Trolley Museum, founded in the US in 1939, at Kennebunkport, in the state of Maine - which, incidentally, is very close to retreat of President George Bush. The Seashore Museum is one of 80 light rail museums in the US, but the largest tram display in the US, in terms of rolling stock, is at Union, Illinois, 60 miles west of Chicago. One of Britain's most famous operational tramways is in Blackpool, Lancashire. Opened in 1885, this was the first street tramway in the UK; it ran on electric current, fed to cars via steel-troughing in the road. In South Wales, a famous tramway operation - similar to Blackpool's - ceased to run in Swansea in January 1960; known as the Swansea and Mumbles Railway, it was the first passenger-carrying rail service in the world. Although it began as a horse-drawn operation in 1807, the system was electrified in 1929. The service ran from the centre of Swansea along the bay to Oystermouth and Mumbles Head. In Cardiff, where the last electric tram ran on February 20, 1950, the corporation issued souvenir tickets with a nostalgic verse on the back. It read: Goodbye my friends, this is the end; I've travelled miles and miles, And watched your faces through the years, show anger, tears and smiles, Although you've criticised my looks - and said I was too slow, I got you there and brought you back, through rain and sleet and snow. Today, however, a consultant's study for a new Pounds 100m bus/tram scheme is under consideration for Cardiff. The plan is based on a Belgium-designed guided light travel system that operates as a bus and a rail network. For researchers, the libraries and archives of the National Tramway Museum and the London Transport Museum are both outstanding sources of reference for urban transport history.* Along with long-distance rail networks, local light rail systems helped to revolutionise economic and social life in cities as people travelled easily outside their own districts for business and pleasure. What is known as a trolley car or streetcar in the US is called a tram in the UK. However, defining a light rail system is not easy - but as a chief inspector of railways said in the mid-1970s: 'It's a light railway if I say it's a light railway.' What is evident, however, is that these systems have a colourful history. For example: The tramcar was introduced to Britain from the US in 1860 and marked a great advance on the contemporary horse-bus, (introduced in Paris in 1819). Tramcars with rails gave a far smoother ride than road vehicles of the day. The cable car, invented by Andrew Hallidie, was introduced in San Francisco in 1873. Cars were drawn by cables running between rails. In Italy, the famous steam tramway between Milan and Magenta opened in 1879  -and operated until 1957. Electric street tramways appeared in Berlin in 1881 and became popular in many cities. The UK's first electric street tram ran at Leytonstone, east London, in March 1882. In the US on May 9, 1900, striking transport workers blew up a tramcar during riots in St. Louis. That same year, in London on June 27, London's Central Railway 'Tuppeny Tube' first ran from Shepherd's Bush, in west London, to the Bank. Japan's first electric tramway was opened by an American company in Kyoto in the early 1890s. Fifty striking tram crew members were sentenced to decapitation in Shanghai, China, in April 1927. Paris closed its streetcar lines in the 1930s; London's last tram ran in July, 1952; Leeds tramways closed in 1959. *For archive services, contact the National Tramway Museum, Crich, Matlock, Derbyshire, DE4 5DP, telephone 0773.852.565; and the London Transport Museum, Covent Garden, London, WC2E 7BB, telephone 017 379 6344.</p>

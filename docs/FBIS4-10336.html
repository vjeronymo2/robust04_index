			<p>BFN     [Text] Buenos Aires, 10 Apr (NA) -- Antonio Bussi, leader  of the Republican Force, considers the elections for Constituent  Assembly members "indicate a flat no to the reform, a flat no to  reelection, and a severe alert to Governor (Ramon) Ortega, as  the people of Tucuman Province are demanding that he start  governing."    Bussi also indicated that the results of the elections "have  exploded the dream" of Governor Ortega of being President Carlos  Menem's number two on the ticket for the 1995 elections.    "His balloon has burst," Bussi stressed in remarks to a  radio  station.    "Please forgive my lack of modesty, but I believe I have  been  winning ever since I entered politics because the people of  Tucuman have no other reasons to forget the recent past, when  the province had me as governor," he said.    Bussi maintained that "as no governor has yet surpassed my  governorship, the people are thinking about the past," and he  reiterated that the decision of the voters "is a severe alert to  Ortega to once and for all start governing the province."    The former provincial governor indicated that he has not yet  studied the possibility of running for the governorship in the  next elections and stated that the decision will be made by the  members of the Republican Force.</p>

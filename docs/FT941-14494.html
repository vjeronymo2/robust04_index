			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A brand new life campaign - Allied Dunbar aims to become market-led with a new advertising drive For the first time in nearly three years, Allied Dunbar, the top-league UK life company, will tomorrow night have an advertisement on television. The intention is that this will kick off a campaign that could be developed over five, 10, or even 15 years. A Pounds 75m budget has been allocated for the first five years' advertising - Pounds 10m of it will be spent in two bursts this year. This substantial commitment is the culmination of a complete reappraisal of Allied Dunbar's position in the marketplace, its products, image and marketing. The process of reform appears to borrow more from the world of fast-moving consumer goods than from financial services. From seeing itself as product-led in the 1970s, to distribution-dominated in the 1980s, the company aims in the 1990s to become market-led. Along the way, it will want to shake off the 'Allied Crowbar' tag it has earned as a result of its robust sales methods. Many of Allied Dunbar's concerns have been problems for the sector as a whole. Recently the life industry has been defensive about a range of issues, perhaps most notably the widespread failure to comply with regulatory standards in the selling of personal pensions to people transferring out of occupational schemes. Nor has the industry's reputation been helped by its vigorous resistance to regulators' determination that sale agents must volunteer to customers the amount of commission they receive and more information about the products they sell. The latest divisions over the future regulatory system and the plans for a personal investment authority are a further example of how life insurers appear unable to take the initiative in improving how people may perceive them. The industry also faces severe changes as it deals with what is widely seen as overcapacity within the sector. While Allied Dunbar believes that the honeymoon period for bancassurance - the selling of insurance products through banks or building societies - may be over, that is not a view taken throughout the retail financial services sector. In any event, it is a wise life company that makes efforts to raise its own public profile when it is facing increasing pressure from competitors who have a presence on most high streets. Allied Dunbar is among the 10 largest life companies in the UK, with Pounds 14bn of funds under management and 1.4m clients. Most of its business, about 88 per cent, comes through its 4,000-strong direct sales force, while the rest comes through independent financial advisers. The company has existed as Allied Dunbar only since the mid-1980s. It was originally set up as Hambro Life in the early 1970s by Sir Mark Weinberg, under whose leadership it revolutionised life insurance sales techniques. He departed in 1990 after it was bought by BAT industries. The reappraisal began in the following year with the appointment of George Greener, former head of Mars confectionery in the UK, as chief executive. One of Greener's first actions was to freeze expensive television advertising while the company sorted out its 'brand' - an approach and the kind of language familiar to marketers of chocolate bars but a shock to executives in the financial services world. Greener has since moved on to a wider role in BAT but the current chief executive, Sandy Leitch, who took over last year, has continued the review. It was found that the company had a completely outdated picture of the marketplace: it was using the industry's standard 'market segmentation' model, linking life stages to financial needs but taking no account of demographic changes. The model - which has been around since the 1950s and is still used by some of Allied Dunbar's competitors, according to Jerry Grayburn, marketing director - assumes, for example, that all 20-39-year-old couples have young children. Says Grayburn: 'If you haven't got children, you don't exist on the old model.' Those over 60 and not retired, and single people with dependent children, were other groups that were previously ignored. The company has developed its own model which is already influencing product design. There are now seven new segments: young professionals; dual career families; up-market empty nesters; mid-market empty nesters; new inheritors; self-employed; and high net-worth individuals. Each of these has a number of sub-segments. The Grey Communications Group was hired to help Allied Dunbar define and build its brand. The agency had little experience in financial services but was known to Greener from his Mars days. Grey's first task was to find out how the company was seen, both by employees and consumers. 'It was confusion. We didn't know what our reputation was - it was different things to different people,' says Grayburn. Some of the contradictory messages that came back were that the company was both crusading and manipulative; was simultaneously caring and aggressive. The next problem was to establish what Allied Dunbar's brand - 'reputation', rather than brand, has been the word more easily understood within the organisation - ought to be. The result contains few surprises: consumers want, for example, to know the company is large, successful and financially secure; they want to be treated as individuals and have individually-tailored solutions to their financial needs throughout their life; and they want to find the company caring, honest, knowledgeable and experienced. Interestingly, clients (customers are no more) also want unpleasant and difficult issues confronted when investments, life assurance and pensions are discussed, and to have a clear idea what provision is being made for which eventualities, says Grayburn. Consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand are helping to develop indices that will enable Allied Dunbar to measure the value of the brand and relate aspects of its performance to the bottom line. It is hoped, for example, that it will be possible to tell, over time, what the relationship is between client satisfaction and profits, so that marketing can be more tightly focused. The first television advertisement, unveiled tomorrow, will not focus on any individual product, but will start to build the brand along the newly-defined lines. Deliberately, no stars will be used, for fear of overshadowing Allied Dunbar's own name. (The name itself will not change, says Leitch: 'The only problem with the name is that it's not well-known enough.') As the television advertisements get under way, all the company's brochures and publications will be overhauled. Until last year there was no unified style, which caused confusion in the marketplace, robbing Allied Dunbar of impact and leading to a 'horrendous waste of money,' says Grayburn, because each publication needed individual design work. An interim redesign (see illustration) will be superseded shortly. Having set out its new, high-profile approach, Allied Dunbar is anxious to do all it can to minimise the risk of its message being undermined by its sales force, particularly given the background of public unease about standards in the life insurance industry. Increased spending on training and compliance, as well as changes to the structure, have resulted, and specialist advisers have been appointed to the 19 regions to support the regional sales directors. The remuneration of sales managers has also changed. Managers will no longer receive a slice of commission on the products their sales agents sell, but will be remunerated according to performance and targets set by the company. Grayburn concludes in classic FMCG-style marketing speak: 'Delivering consistent expectations is a key ingredient of building a strong brand. It is also important to be differentiated from other brands. But, most important of all, we've got to deliver. If you promise but don't deliver you end up like British Rail.'</p>

			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Survey of World Car Industry (23): Steady growth is the goal  -China plays a waiting game China could not be accused of lacking ambition in formulating a policy to meet rapidly increasing demand for cars and commercial vehicles into the next century. The long-awaited Policy for China Automotive Industry Enterprises, released in July, sets the goal of making a hitherto fragmented, low-volume, poor-quality sector into one of the country's 'pillar' industries. Policy-makers appear to have grasped the importance of a vibrant automotive sector to the economy as a whole. But in the interests of orderly development, they are delaying approvals of new foreign entrants until 1996, pending a consolidation of existing plant and facilities. Beijing also wants to strengthen the components sector, a weak link in its vehicle-building industry. Foreign car companies such as Ford, General Motors and Toyota have been told that to 'qualify' for entry to China as fully-fledged participants in passenger car manufacturing they must first invest in the components industry. Since China opened its doors to foreign investors in the 1980s, a few international car-makers, led by Volkswagen, have established a foothold. The German company is producing the Santana (a copy of its Passat produced in Brazil) in Shanghai and Audis and Jettas at a plant in Changchun, northern China. Other foreign participants include Chrysler, building the Jeep Cherokee in Beijing; Daihatsu, producing a minibus in Tianjin; Toyota and General Motors which are building commercial vehicles in Shenyang; Peugeot which has a venture assembling 504s in southern China and Citroen which is producing its ZX small car near Wuhan. Apart from Volkswagen. which built about 150,000 vehicles in China last year, the others are still relatively small-scale operators. Citroen, for example, assembled just 13,000 of its ZXs in 1993. China's output of passenger and other vehicles falls well short of demand. In 1993, 234,000 passenger cars were produced of a total 1.3m vehicles manufactured locally. Some 310,461 vehicles were imported, according to official figures, but this did not take account of thousands more that were smuggled in. By 2000, domestic demand for passenger cars is expected to exceed 2m with local car-makers supplying 90 per cent of the market under the terms of the new plan. At present, car-sales to individuals as opposed to companies and work units account for about 1 per cent of the total, but demand is building among an increasingly affluent bourgeoisie. In its efforts to promote the development of the automotive sector, the government has laid down guidelines envisaging the development by the end of this century of two or three 'large-scale' vehicle-producing conglomerates and six or seven 'backbone' automotive enterprises. This formula, aimed particularly at encouraging economies of scale, leaves the door open for new entrants after the present freeze expires in 1996. China is making little secret of the fact that it is anxious to involve the big American and Japanese producers. Ford and GM are already establishing a strong presence in the components sector. Ford, for example, recently signed agreements with components makers in Shanghai to produce plastic automotive items such as instrument panels and to make safety glass. Ford plans to invest Dollars 50m in these ventures. GM's Automotive Components Group (ACG) recently established a headquarters in Beijing and is seeking to enlarge its involvement in the components sector where it is engaged in joint ventures and licensing arrangements. While China's new automotive policy is aimed at encouraging through tax and other incentives the growth of large-scale producers, it is also directed at rationalising a highly-fragmented local sector. There are, for example, 120-130 vehicle-makers of one sort or another operating in China, but many are tiny, producing just a few vehicles each week. According to a recent study, quoted by the official China Daily newspaper, two-thirds of China's vehicle manufacturers lost money in the first half of this year, and a number were heading for bankruptcy. The highly-fragmented components sector is in a similarly parlous state, and many small producers are expected to go out of business under the new policy, with its emphasis on high volume production and economies of scale. In spite of the freeze on new entrants to assembly and manufacturing until 1996, foreign car makers are extremely active in ongoing discussions about new projects. These discussions are expected to lead to a number of agreements over the next six months or so. Chrysler, for one, is believed to be close to finalising deals to produce minivans in Guangdong and Hainan provinces. A number of carmakers, including Toyota, Ford, GM and Mazda, are involved in discussions with the Shanghai Automobile Industry Corp for a minivan and passenger car project in the Shanghai area. Toyota has also been in discussions with the Tianjin Automobile Industry Corp on possible ventures. Tianjin Auto is the partner of Daihatsu in the production of the Charade small car and minibuses. Toyota has a 16 per cent stake in Daihatsu. According to Japanese press reports, Toyota hopes by the end of this year to start building a factory near Tianjin to produce engines, transmissions and other key components for cars that would be sold domestically. Toyota is reportedly proposing that its Corolla small car would be the most suitable product for the China market.</p>

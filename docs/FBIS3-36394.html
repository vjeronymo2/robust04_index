			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By UKRINFORM correspondent Mikhail Stetsyuk] </F>   [Text] Sevastopol, 5 Feb -- Captain First Rank Aleksandr  Rodkin, Nikolayev senior sea commander, and his subordinates  have prevented the removal of materials and capital equipment  from the supply depot of the local Black Sea Fleet hospital  base. The attempt was made yesterday by the management of a  vessel construction team, quoting an instruction by the Black  Sea Fleet command.    Reporting this fact, the press center of Ukraine's Navy  recalls that the day before, on 3 February, base personnel  informed the Ukrainian Navy and Black Sea Fleet commands, as  well as Ukraine's Defense Ministry about its decision to  transfer to the Ukrainian Army to serve the people of Ukraine,  since both commissioned and non-commissioned officers had lost  all hope for a civilized solution on the part of the fleet's  command to the problem of dividing the Black Sea Fleet and,  consequently, to their social problems.    In its own commentary on the incident, the Black Sea Fleet  press center notes that the fleet's command does not object to  servicemen joining the Ukrainian Army, but the materials and  capital equipment must remain with the fleet until the  presidents of Ukraine and Russia make an appropriate decision on  the division of the fleet property.    Employees of the hospital base complain of an ongoing  removal  of materials and equipment from the supply depots. They say  they are trying to prevent any new attempts to seize the stock.</p>

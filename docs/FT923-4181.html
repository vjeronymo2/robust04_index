			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Survey of Mobile Communications (6): Selling off the airwaves - Radio frequencies SHOULD THE radio waves be a revenue earner for government or a resource available to all at a reasonable price? Some governments are considering fees of more than Pounds 100m for mobile phone licences and, as a result, the question has become a hot debating topic in the industry. But issues of ethics as well as commercial sensitivities come into play and it seems that there is no straightforward answer. Radio is used for many different communications activities. Some are obvious, such as mobile phones and the radios used by taxi companies or the police. But items such as security tags in clothing stores, remote controls for cars or garage doors also operate via radio; they come under the same set of government regulations. In the UK, the government determines who can use radio frequencies by granting licences. A taxi company can get a licence for five radios, just like a large mobile phone operator with many thousands of subscribers. Manufacturers of security products and remote controls do not need a licence, but they do have to obtain permission before they can go ahead and sell their products. The fees charged for licences vary according to the type of use: a taxi company pays less than a mobile phone network operator. Vodafone and Cellnet each pay an estimated Pounds 2.5m for their licences. But as governments in other countries begin to see how much money some services are making, they are questioning the level of the licence fee, especially for mobile phone networks. Obviously, Pounds 2.5m is a tiny proportion of Vodafone's annual turnover of Pounds 585m. Two new mobile phone network licences recently granted in Greece were sold for Dollars 160m (about Pounds 80m). The Greek government is understood to have operated a form of 'auction' for the licences. Prospective mobile phone operators sent in their bids in a sealed envelope. The first licence went to the one offering the most money. The second highest bidder was then invited to increase its offer to the level of the highest bid, in order to get the second licence. The Dutch government is now also considering what value it should place on the spectrum for a second mobile phone network, to compete against the phone company, PTT Telekom Netherlands. A figure of Dollars 250m is being suggested. However, while charging a large sum for the right to use the radio spectrum could bring in substantial revenues for treasury departments, it could be to the detriment of the general public and taxpayers. Mr Keith Sowell, of the phone company US West, points out that such high licence fees are a disguised form of taxation: 'It's a tax. Sooner or later, the reasonable businessman factors it in,' he says. The UK's Radio Communications Agency, the government body responsible for managing the radio spectrum, is currently reviewing spectrum prices. It has a total income of Pounds 27m from 28,000 licences. However, the Wireless Telegraphy Act stipulates that these fees should cover costs of administering the licence, and not make a profit. Auctioning will have to be considered as part of the review, but it appears unlikely that the concept will be taken on board. The pressure for auctioning comes from the so-called shortage of radio frequencies. Radio waves are all around us and in a sense there is no shortage. But, there are only certain frequencies that are good for the commercial applications. These are between 28 Mhz and 3Ghz. In the large metropolitan areas - London, Birmingham, Manchester - frequencies in this range are already almost all taken and there is a need to make sure that they are used as efficiently as possible. There is a view in the industry that making people pay more for licences will lead them to use the resource better. But spectrum auctions have already been looked at in detail three years ago, by what was then the Department of Trade and Industry's radio section. The idea was dismissed as unworkable. The critical issue is 'safety of life'. Mobile communications of all types can be used in situations where the safety of an individual or group of people is at risk. Ambulance and police radios, as well as radios on board yachts that sail around the coast, are obvious examples. But there could also be a case where a lorry has spilled hazardous chemicals on a road - a mobile phone in the cab could be vital to protect other drivers and pedestrians from harm. It is generally thought that commercial prices should not be applied to licence fees for safety of life uses. But it would be difficult to determine a clear-cut way of deciding who pays the commercial fee and who is exempt: 'Even if you take the emergency services out, where do you draw the line?' asks Mr Garry Garrard, mobile communications director with the PA Consulting Group. In the US, a similar debate is taking place. In a bill which goes before Congress this autumn, there is a new allocation for spectrum to be used by emerging technologies. These include personal communications services and new personal digital wireless gadgets such as Apple Computer's Newton. There is a push from the White House that this new spectrum should also be used to bring in revenue which could reduce the budget deficit. An auction is high on the agenda. Under the normal procedures, the allocation of radio licences and the licence fee are handled by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Licences are granted by a lottery of the prospective applicants. However, some companies which obtain licences later sell them on for an enormous profit - one mobile phone licence in Massachusetts went for Dollars 40m two years after it was granted, and no network had been constructed. Such moves could be behind the White House push for auctions. An experimental auction of 30Mhz of spectrum is proposed in the Bill and may get through. But the fear is that speculators could push up prices to unreasonable levels. GTE, which operates mobile phone networks across the US, is lobbying against auctioning. It says that auction prices could force some potential players from the market. 'We want to see open entry and public eligibility,' says the company.</p>

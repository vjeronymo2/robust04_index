A report by Manik Lal Shrestha, director of the Nepal  Institute for Chuche Studies, was followed by speeches at the  seminar.    Noting that Comrade Kim Chong-il has developed and enriched  the immortal chuche idea with new profound ideas and theories,  they said he is a genius of thought and theory.    They said it is because it is advancing under the banner of  the chuche idea that Korea is firmly defending its socialism and  demonstrating its fame to the whole world although socialism  suffered a setback in some countries.    They stressed that a large number of works authored by  Comrade Kim Chong-il serve the world's revolutionary people as a  weapon of struggle, as a priceless asset, and resolved to deeply  study his classical works.    A message of greetings to Comrade Kim Chong-il was adopted  at  the seminar.</p>

The delegation was greeted at Dulles International Airport  by  Ding Mou-shih, Taipei's representative in Washington, and  representatives of the Chinese community here.    Hsu dismissed reports that he would be a candidate in the  forthcoming Taiwan provincial governor election, saying that in  his capacity as party secretary-general, he must try to find  another more qualified candidate for the job.    On Tuesday, the delegation will meet with Haley Barbour,  chairman of the Republican National Committee, and congressional  leaders, including Senate majority leader George Mitchell  (D-Maine), Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Sen. Charles Robb  (D-Va.), chairman of the senate committee on Asia and Pacific  affairs, and Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) chairman of the house  subcommitte on Asia and Pacific affairs.    On Wednesday, they will meet with Natale Bellocchi, chairman  of the American Institute in Taiwan.    They will attend the national prayer breakfast Thursday and  later in the day meet with Jim Brady, vice chairman of the  Democratic National Committee (DNC), and Debra Delee, DNC vice  chairman and executive director.    During their three-day stay here, they will also meet with  members of the Chinese community in the Washington area.</p>

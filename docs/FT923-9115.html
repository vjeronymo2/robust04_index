			<p>920807 FT  07 AUG 92 / International Company News: Banespa looks to expand overseas IMPRESSIVE first-half results have pushed Banespa, the state bank of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest state, up the ladder to rank as the country's second biggest bank for the first time. Mr Antonio Sochacewski, the bank's president, said it hopes to consolidate this position through overseas expansion. Banespa posted profits of Dollars 106.4m for the first half of this year - up 44.2 per cent on last year - and recorded a 48.6 per cent rise in deposits to Dollars 5.25bn. Brazilian banks appear to have recovered from the disastrous blow they received two years ago when President Fernando Collor seized 80 per cent of bank accounts. Most banks have since shed staff and are benefiting from high real interest rates and government borrowing. Banespa has 17 overseas agencies and a new bank, Ban-espa International, is opening in Luxembourg to co-ordinate European operations, with an initial capitalisation of Dollars 16m. The bank is waiting for Brazil's political situation to improve before making its first Eurobond issue, planned to be between Dollars 80m and Dollars 130m.</p>

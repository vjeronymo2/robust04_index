			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / People: Salomon Brothers boosts energy sector coverage by board appointment Salomon Brothers has boosted its presence in the energy sector by poaching David Cockburn from Lehman Brothers, where he has been head of European Energy and Natural Resources since 1989. He is to be director of investment banking in London, with responsibility for the energy sector in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the former Soviet Union. The firm said yesterday that it also plans to take on another analyst for the sector before the end of the year. Cockburn will be a senior member of Salomon Brothers' global energy and chemicals group, which provides capital-raising and advisory services to clients in Asia and Latin America as well as Europe and North America. A graduate of St John's College, Cambridge, he began his career in 1978 as a lawyer at Slaughter &amp; May, before joining Schroders in 1984, where he was responsible for energy financing.</p>

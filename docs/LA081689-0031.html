			<p><P> August 16, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BERNARDI ASKS FOR COST STUDY ON DISPOSAL COSTS AT  DUMPS  </P> <P> Saying the people of Los Angeles have been misled into believing that Lopez  Canyon Landfill offers the only solution to the city's trash crisis, Los  Angeles City Councilman Ernani Bernardi called Tuesday for an in-depth study of  disposal costs at past, current and future dumps.  </P> <P> "Lopez Canyon Landfill is not the only option available to the city in its  development of an adequate solid waste disposal program, and should be  considered only as one of many dominoes," Bernardi said in a motion calling for  the study.  </P> <P> The motion was referred by the Council to the newly formed Environmental  Quality and Waste Management Committee.  </P> <P> Bernardi said the study should compare costs of closing Lopez Canyon Landfill  -- which now accepts three-fourths of the city's residential trash -- to costs  associated with not using other canyons purchased for landfills, such as  Mission, Rustic and Sullivan canyons in the Santa Monica Mountains. He said  costs of opening a proposed new dump in Elsmere Canyon also should be  evaluated.  </P> <P> The city Bureau of Sanitation has estimated that it would have to spend at  least $26 million a year in dumping fees to divert trash from Lopez Canyon to  other public and private landfills.  </P> <P> In a separate action, Bernardi agreed to postpone for a week a motion he and  Councilman Joel Wachs had initiated that would extend by 60 days the review  period for expansion of Lopez Canyon Landfill. City Atty. James Hahn said his  staff needs more time to investigate the legality of altering the standard  environmental review process, which is scheduled to end with a council hearing  later this month.  </P></p>

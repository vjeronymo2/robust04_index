			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SUMMIT TURNED DISPARATE POLICIES INTO UNIFYING GOAL;  </P> <P> DRUG WAR: BUSH AND SOUTH AMERICAN LEADERS HOPE OTHER NATIONS WILL JOIN ALLIANCE  FORGED IN CARTAGENA.  </P> <P> The Cartagena summit marked important progress toward harmonizing the  once-disparate drug policies of the United States and the three  cocaine-producing countries of South America, as well as reinforcing their  resolve to fight cocaine traffic together, Latin American officials said  Friday.  </P> <P> "The results were precisely what we needed, a more aggressive commitment by all  of the countries here," said Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, the commander of  Colombia's intelligence police.  </P> <P> When President Bush met Thursday in Cartagena with the presidents of Colombia,  Peru and Bolivia, the drug policies of the four countries already had evolved  into at least the semblance of common purpose.  </P> <P> The U.S. government had gradually accepted the South American governments' view  that they cannot stop cocaine traffic as long as widespread consumption by  Americans keeps demand for the drug strong. The three South American  governments, in turn, had acceded by degrees to the U.S. view that cocaine was  not just an American problem and that tough police action and eradication of  illicit coca plantations is in the Andean countries' interest.  </P> <P> And both sides had come to realize that the Andean countries need outside  economic support, including aid and favorable terms of trade, to effectively  carry out the costly campaign against cocaine.  </P> <P> By re-emphasizing those and other points of agreement, officials said,  Thursday's summit communique, called the Declaration of Cartagena, strengthened  a spirit of cooperation among the four governments.  </P> <P> President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia said before leaving this Caribbean port  city Friday morning that the meeting was an inspiring success.  </P> <P> "May it be maintained as a shining summit for Latin Americans, leading to  concrete achievements," Paz told reporters.  </P> <P> He said Bush promised to present the Cartagena meeting's call for concerted  multinational action against drugs to the seven leading industrialized nations  at their annual meeting in Houston next July.  </P> <P> "Imagine, if the Big Seven adopt the thesis of Cartagena on the integral fight  against narcotraffic, it will mean that we have the commitment of the most  powerful ones on the planet," he said.  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Secretary of  State James A. Baker III will address a United Nations special session on the  drug problem.  </P> <P> "The United States is hopeful that the special session will result in a  stronger, more balanced, multilateral role for the United Nations in drug  control," Boucher said.  </P> <P> Bush, who had returned from Cartagena on Thursday night, met with his Cabinet  to brief them on the results. He waved off reporters' questions, however. In  emphasizing that the anti-cocaine action must be multinational and coordinated,  Paz said: "What we have said to President Bush is that we commit ourselves to  not grow excess coca leaf, but they must commit themselves to not increase  demand and to never again produce another addicted mayor in their capital. . .  .  </P> <P> "In effect, I believe this meeting has served to put things in their place," he  added.  </P> <P> A U.S. source who asked not to be identified said a major purpose of the summit  for the U.S. side was to get Bolivia and Peru to increase efforts for  eradicating coca plantations. The two countries produce the bulk of the leaves  from which cocaine is made and which are also legally chewed by Andean Indians.  </P> <P> In the past, both Bolivia and Peru have repeatedly demanded greater U.S. aid in  return for eradication, while the United States has conditioned economic aid on  progress in eradication. The result has been much wrangling and less than full  cooperation.  </P> <P> "Let's hope that we have created a better climate for cooperation, that they  won't keep harping on this dollar for dollar thing," the U.S. source said.  </P> <P> He said that, with a U.S. promise of increased attention to the Andean  countries' economic needs in the Cartagena declaration, "we should have more  leverage -- leverage is not the right word -- but more cooperation from them in  policing their own countries."  </P> <P> He cautioned, however, that Congress is unlikely to approve as much aid as the  South American countries would like.  </P> <P> "I would call it an increased emphasis on the economic side, but I wouldn't  call it an Alliance for Progress or a Marshall Plan for the Andean countries,"  he said.  </P> <P> But Bolivian Foreign Minister Carlos Iturralde said Friday that at least $3.5  billion was required by his country if it is to replace 173,000 acres of coca  leaf production .  </P> <P> Julio Londono, the Colombian foreign minister, told reporters that Colombia had  long sought more U.S. attention to the link between effective anti-drug efforts  and economic progress in the Andean countries. The Declaration of Cartagena  signals a change in the U.S. approach, he said.  </P> <P> He said the United States also "recognizes for the first time that consumption  is the central, generating element of this problem" of drug traffic.  </P> <P> Such changes in the American point of view "seemed impossible" three years ago,  Londono said.  </P> <P> The Bogota newspaper El Espectador, which has pressed an editorial crusade  against drug traffickers, said Friday that the summit conclusions "are a  definitive step toward what may be the final offensive against the most  noxious, dangerous and costly scourge afflicting humanity today."  </P> <P> El Universal of Cartagena applauded U.S. commitments at the summit. "The  promise of more economic aid for development and an increase in the intensity  of control over internal consumption cleared the way toward harmony that . . .  undoubtedly means a change in the great anti-drug crusade," said an editorial  in the paper.  </P> <P> But there are bound to be obstacles along the way. For one, the  multibillion-dollar cocaine trade spawns official corruption, giving  traffickers their most effective shield. And because the cocaine-producing  countries are poor, their institutions are often ill-equipped to control the  resource-rich drug business. It is not clear what amount of development aid  might be needed to change this lopsided relationship.  </P> <P> As some Colombian commentators have observed, how can the United States expect  South American governments to control cocaine production and smuggling when it  has been unable to control the lucrative marijuana business at home or to  effectively prosecute its own drug barons?  </P> <P> "It is hoped that in their secret conversations, the Latin American presidents  have told these truths to Mr. Bush," wrote Ricardo Velez Parejo, an El  Universal columnist.  </P></p>

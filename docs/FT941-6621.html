			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / Leading Article: New-look TUC Founded in 1868, Britain's Trades Union Congress is 'relaunching' itself. The need is for a new product rather than new wrapping, since in the last decade, the trade union movement's central body has been poorly led, has generated few ideas and has found no takers for a civil service-style bureaucracy to channel the voice of organised labour to government. Today's official relaunch is a belated recognition of these facts. Mr John Monks, TUC general secretary, wants to give the organisation a new sense of direction, but one that acknowledges the hostile environment in which trade unionism now operates and thus concentrates limited resources - Pounds 10m a year - where they can add most value. To this end he has swept away most of the old committee structures, where disputes were settled and policy compromises forged. Over the coming months, he aims to reshape Congress House to provide more efficent services to affiliated unions and to speak more persuasively to the outside world. Mr Monks deserves credit for these moves and for recognising that, if the TUC is to become a more effective lobbying organisation in the manner of the Confederation of British Industry, it has to win friends in government and in all political parties. There is no reason why it should not achieve this. Despite continuing decline, the trade union movement remains the largest voluntary association in Britain, and more than half its members voted for parties other than Labour at the last election. But to justify its existence a trade union centre, like a national employers' organisation, needs to contribute expert and constructive views to the public policy debate about workplace issues, and to lead rather than just reflect the dialogue within its member organisations. Mr Monks needs to make a splash on issues like flexible labour contracts, the changing shape of public sector employment and the need to control wage inflation in the economic recovery. These are all controversial matters within TUC-affiliated unions. Although Mr Monks represents a return to the quiet, technocratic style of Len Murray, individual unions resent being lectured by the TUC and some are already uneasy at the speed of the current reforms. The emergence of the super-unions - such as Unison in the public sector - may compound the problem as these organisations acquire larger political ambitions in their own right. The broader difficulty underlying the relaunch is the lack of a clear concept of modern trade unionism. The need is for a trade unionism that transcends collectivism, but which makes an assertive contribution to fostering a fair but efficient framework of labour market regulation and corporate law at a time when smaller, service-sector enterprises are of increasing importance. If Mr Monks fails, the TUC may well be judged to have had its day.</p>

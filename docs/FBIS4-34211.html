			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "National Newscast"] </F>   [Text] To ensure protection for the visiting heads of state  and delegations, the Colombian military have joined in a single  strategy and are receiving support from everyone in the country.  For example, 50 escort motorcycles arrived from Santa Fe de  Bogota, and a month ago, for greater tranquility, the Colombian  military met with the heads of security for each of the visiting  presidents. The last preparations for the security plan  resulted from these meetings. Even though the plan was for the  city not to appear to be militarized, it is impossible to  camouflage the work being done on the ground, in the air, and on  the water by the 3,000 men who are responsible for ensuring the  safety of the visiting heads of state.</p>

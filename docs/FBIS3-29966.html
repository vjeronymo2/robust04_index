			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Thailand and Laos have agreed to set up a joint  committee to oversee jurisdiction problems on the Thai-Lao  Mittraphap bridge, ending a year-long impasse over the issue  which jeopardized the April opening of the first bridge across  the Mekong river.    They also resolved to use the deepest point of the river to  demarcate the international boundary on the bridge. The  Thai-Laotian boundary on the bridge will thus continue to be the  same line as the boundary in the river, as insisted by Thai  negotiators. The agreement was reached yesterday at a meeting  between Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri and his Laotian  counterpart Somsavat Lengsavat. Somsavat had stopped over in  Bangkok on his way to Europe for an official visit which will  take him to France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland and Russia.  The setting up of the joint committee will be followed up when  Somsavat returns from his European tour on March 10.    The committee will be in charge of ruling in disputes  regardless of which side of the bridge they may have occurred.  But the Thai side of the committee will take responsibility for  incidents involving Thai nationals and vice versa. Problems  involving nationals of other countries will be ruled jointly by  the committee.    Both ministers yesterday also signed a Memorandum of  Understanding (MoU) on the Development of Luang Prabang Airport.  The MoU detailed a plan for the development and reconstruction  of the airport which is expected to cost about Bt [baht] 50  million. The project will cover the construction of a passenger  terminal building. The Department of Civil Aviation and the  Ministry of Communications will start bidding procedures in  order to select a suitable Thai construction company to  undertake the work which is scheduled to begin in May and should  be completed within 18 months.</p>

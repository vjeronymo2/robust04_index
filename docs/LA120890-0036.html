			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOMETHING GROSS ABOUT DODGER DEAL  </P> <P> What do the Dodgers need? A left-handed relief pitcher, a left-handed starting  pitcher, a second baseman and a leadoff man/center fielder.  </P> <P> So what do they do? They spend $6.4 million on Kevin Gross -- a mediocre  right-handed pitcher with a lifetime record under .500 and an ERA over 4.00.  What a Gross mistake.  </P> <P> JEFF KASMER  </P> <P> Long Beach  </P> <P> and FRANK PEARLSTEIN  </P> <P> Sherman Oaks  </P></p>

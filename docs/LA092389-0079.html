			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> The governing body of track and field in the United States will likely  investigate Darrell Robinson's allegations of drug use by sprinter Florence  Griffith Joyner and other American athletes, a spokesman for the organization  said.  </P> <P> "I would be very surprised if there wasn't an investigation," said Pete Cava,  information director for The Athletics Congress. "What we read (Thursday) is of  primary importance to us. If it takes a top athlete in the U.S. going down like  Ben Johnson did in Canada, then so be it."  </P> <P> Griffith Joyner, who retired in February after winning two gold medals at the  1988 Seoul Olympics, adamantly denied the allegations.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / The Property Market: Uncertain end to 1991 Last year ended on a note of uncertainty with falling rents and a reversal in the yield improvement of the previous two months, according to the latest figures from the Investment Property Databank, a research group. Total returns to the monthly index of the IPD failed to climb back to positive figures after a poor month for office property in December. The sector was doubly hit with one and a half points off both rental and capital values. The 1991 All Properties total return figure of -0.8 per cent concealed continuing short term volatility and large variations between sectors, with offices returning -8.4 per cent and industrials 6.9 per cent over the 12-month period. The pattern of sector returns remained unchanged throughout the year. Industrials showed the highest returns and offices the lowest. Rental values fell in all three sectors, while capital growth and total returns continued to improve, albeit fitfully. The total return in the retail sector fell slightly from the previous month's peak level. Retail property was the only sector to show positive rental growth in December, although yields moved outwards pushing the end year yield up from 8.6 per cent to 8.8 per cent. Office property rents dropped by 1.3 per cent, resulting in the sector's worst ever quarter of -3.2 per cent and year-on-year at -9.1 per cent. Yields appear to have stabilised at around 9.7 per cent. Industrial property produced a total return for 1991 of 6.9 per cent. The year-on-year rental value growth has fallen to -0.5 per cent.</p>

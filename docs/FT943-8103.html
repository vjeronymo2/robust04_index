			<p>940819 FT  19 AUG 94 / Sri Lanka enters an uncertain era Mrs Chandrika Kumaratunga, the victor in this week's Sri Lankan general election, who is due to be sworn in as prime minister today, will need all the luck she can get if she is to turn her complex coalition of opposition parties into an effective government. Until she can exert a firm grip on power, Sri Lanka faces a period of political uncertainty which could easily spill over into society and the economy. 'We are in a tricky situation. People are going to wait and see before they make up their minds about the government,' says Mr Desmond Fernando, a lawyer and secretary general of the International Bar Association. Fortunately, Sri Lanka is a country which has learnt to live with political turmoil. Neither the civil war in the north of the island, an uprising of nationalist extremists in the south in the late 1980s, nor the assassination last year of President Ranasinghe Premadasa has caused significant social disturbances or thrown the economy seriously off course. It is possible the country will survive unscathed the end of 17 years of conservative rule by the United National party. Mrs Kumaratunga's most immediate challenge is to hold together her parliamentary majority. With only 105 seats in the 225-member parliament, her People's Alliance, itself a coalition of nine parties, must rely on the support of at least three minority groupings. Moreover, she will have to co-operate with Mr D B Wijetunga, the powerful executive president, who stands above parliament and belongs to the defeated UNP. Mr Wijetunga's rapid acknowledgement of UNP's defeat suggests he is taking a conciliatory approach. But he may come under pressure from some sections of his party to change tack. Such pressure may surface soon, as among the main aims of the People's Alliance is a revision of the constitution to curb the president's powers. This change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament - which could only be achieved with UNP's co-operation. UNP will also be concerned about the People's Alliance's pledge to stamp out corruption. While some UNP members, including outgoing prime minister Ranil Wickremasinghe, concede the need for tougher anti-bribery laws, they may balk at moves to bring ex-ministers to account. Economic policy-making presents Mrs Kumaratunga with a particularly awkward challenge. She has promised to follow the UNP government's pro-market policies, which have in the past five years brought the country fast growth in output, foreign trade and investment. But businessmen see three dangers. First, to satisfy her left-wing supporters Mrs Kumaratunga may be tempted to make some gestures - such as imposing punitive duties on the import of luxuries. Next, even though the overall direction of policy will be pro-market, day-to-day decisions may not. For example, the government is considering the future of the over-manned state-owned tea industry. UNP, which introduced limited privatisation of the estates' management, was planning more radical reform and Mrs Kumaratunga may be tempted to fudge the issue. Finally, Mrs Kumaratunga could try to increase welfare spending. Her manifesto includes promises of big food hand-outs to the poor. However, she may not be as profligate as she sounds, as such pledges are routine in Sri Lankan campaigning. On balance, businessmen are willing to give Mrs Kumaratunga the benefit of the doubt although they may postpone big investment decisions for a few months. Some executives even argue the People's Alliance will prove good for business. They say that the corruption associated with the UNP was beginning to harm investment activity. Moreover, they welcome Mrs Kumaratunga's determination to end the civil war, in which Tamil Tiger separatist guerrillas are fighting for an independent homeland.</p>

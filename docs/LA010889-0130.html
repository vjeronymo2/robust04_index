			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> CONNECTICUT'S ROBINSON NOW WORKING HARD TO BECOME A TEAM LEADER  </P> <P> He missed his first five field-goal attempts, but he didn't pout. He made a bad  pass in the final minute, but instead of spacing out, he sprinted downcourt and  swooped in behind Villanova's Gary Massey in a manner scarier than any Stephen  King novel. Massey missed.  </P> <P> In between, he gave up four inches and a gallon of sweat as he banged bodies  with 7-foot-2 Tom Greis. And when the action stopped for a second, he bent like  a willow and tugged at his shorts, the universal sign for basketball  exhaustion.  </P> <P> Vince Lombardi once said that "fatigue makes cowards of us all." It did not  make a coward of Cliff Robinson.  </P> <P> "There were a couple of times I wanted to ask for a blow (breather)," Cliff  Robinson said, "but it was too close, so I stayed in there."  </P> <P> If the 1988-89 University of Connecticut basketball team were a building, Cliff  Robinson would be the steel beams. Murray Williams may have supplied the final  flash and dash and Tate George a gentle guiding hand in UConn's 57-55 win over  Villanova Wednesday night in its Big East opener, but, as usual, it was  Robinson who supplied the foundation and the unbending structural support that  kept the Huskies from caving in.  </P> <P> With scouts from seven National Basketball Association teams and a sellout  Civic Center crowd of 16,016 in attendance, the 6-10 senior center struggled to  score 20 points (on 10 of 29 field goal shooting) and grab nine rebounds. But  while Robinson was taking good shots and clearly wasn't in command of the roll  of the rim, he was in command of something far more important:  </P> <P> Himself.  </P> <P> "I wanted to win so badly," Robinson said. "I don't want to go back to those  first two years here. Before, I probably would have gotten myself out of the  game because of fouls and frustration."  </P> <P> When Cliff Robinson plays as he did Wednesday night, he makes "before" seem  like a long time ago.  </P> <P> "Before" was when he whined to the referees. "Before" was when his body  language bespoke anger and insolence that distracted him like a five-alarm fire  whenever things weren't going his way. "Before" was when if Robinson got off to  a slow start, he was better off on the bench.  </P> <P> But when this, a more intense, more mature Cliff Robinson is on the bench, the  only people better off are the opposition. Ultimately, that made it a bad night  for Villanova, because Robinson danced every dance, played every second of this  frantic 40 minutes.  </P> <P> "Cliff was the most composed of any of our players," UConn Coach Jim Calhoun  said. "He was the guy settling everyone down."  </P> <P> He was also the guy expected to be The Man, as is the custom with prospective  first round NBA draft choices.  </P> <P> Especially Wednesday night. Greis notwithstanding, the Wildcats, along with  Boston College, are the smallest team in the Big East. And inasmuch as the  hulking Greis has a sweet shooting touch but little quickness or mobility,  Calhoun was hoping Robinson would wheel around him like a racing car around a  lap pole.  </P> <P> "We felt that Tom couldn't defend Cliff," Calhoun said.  </P> <P> Calhoun's feelings were based on obvious facts. But too often, the results were  ruined by bad rim rolls. While Robinson got Greis in foul trouble -- limiting  him to 28 minutes -- he wasn't getting the ball in the basket.  </P> <P> "I wasn't nervous (at the beginning)," Robinson said, "but I was overanxious.  I've been having a tough year shooting."  </P> <P> The same could hardly be said for Greis, who entered the game ranked sixth in  field goal percentage in the Big East and was 5-of-5 from the field at  halftime. Villanova had a two-point lead and Robinson, after an easy holiday  diet of Harvard and Air Force, was having to work hard at both ends of the  floor.  </P> <P> Needlessly, as it turned out. Robinson finished with three steals and two  blocked shots -- both blocks in the second half. Of Robinson's five rebounds in  the second half -- four were on the offensive board. Hardly the signature of an  exhausted man.  </P> <P> It didn't get Robinson down that the Huskies lost. None of it. He hung in there  to get the Huskies their first win over Villanova since Jan. 23, 1982. He did  what leaders do. He did what he knows he has to do for UConn to make nice  noises in the beastly Big East.  </P> <P> But he didn't make much noise afterward. Just talked calmly about his  responsibilities. Scolded himself for missing that last-minute free throw --  his only trip to the line all night -- that would have sealed Villanova's fate  and made Murray Williams' mad dash unnecessary.  </P> <P> If he were a pro scout, Robinson was asked, how would he assessed Cliff  Robinson's performance?  </P> <P> "That he didn't shoot well but he kept playing hard," Robinson said. "He kept  his intensity up and he boosted everybody to a win."  </P></p>

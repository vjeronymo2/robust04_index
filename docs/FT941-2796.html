			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Fall in Hong Kong puts selling pressure on region Although heavy profit-taking ahead of the March 31 book closing depressed share prices, the Nikkei 225 average was finally only marginally lower as some of the losses were eroded by foreign investors' purchases of large-capital blue chip issues, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei lost 85.61 at 20,592.16 after a day's high of 20,692.97 and low of 20,449.44. Corporate selling pressured prices from the start, but the index fluctuated in a narrow range during the afternoon, supported by bargain hunting. Volume amounted to 570m shares, against 629m. Traders forecast that corporate and institutional profit-taking would last to the end of the month, but also noted growing investor confidence. Declines led rises by 598 to 427, with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks shed 4.74 to 1,648.53 and the Nikkei 300 was 0.91 easier at 303.12. But in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index gained 3.40 at 1,368.13. Steels continued to be bought by foreign investors. Nippon Steel, the most active issue of the day, rose Y4 to Y360 and Kawasaki Steel moved up Y5 to Y378. Overseas investors also purchased blue chip high-technology stocks, Hitachi strengthening Y13 to Y970 and NEC Y30 to Y1,110. Trading houses were higher on reports of their entry into the multimedia industry through cable television. Mitsubishi gained Y30 at Y1,130 and Nissho Iwai Y11 at Y484. Profit-taking depressed car shares. Toyota Motor receded Y10 to Y2,100 and Nissan Motor Y16 to Y897. Construction issues were also lower, with Ohbayashi down Y23 to Y660 and Tobishima falling Y11 to Y517. Department stores, which are expected to report weak earnings, lost ground, with Mitsukoshi retreating Y13 to Y942. Some individuals and dealers targeted speculative stocks. Honshu Paper forged ahead Y48 to Y770 and Keisei Electric Railway Y36 to Y1,010. In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 42.78 to 22,545.16 in volume of 156m shares. Roundup A sharp fall in Hong Kong affected neighbouring markets, although some rises were recorded further afield. HONG KONG shed 2.1 per cent, led by selling in the futures market, the Hang Seng index losing 207.48 at 9,513.13 after a day's low of 9,432.79. Turnover picked up to a provisional HKDollars 4.6bn from Wednesday's HKDollars 3.5bn. HSBC was the most active stock, falling HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 96.50 in turnover of HKDollars 410.2m. Cheung Kong lost HKDollars 1 at HKDollars 40 and Hang Seng Bank HKDollars 1.50 at HKDollars 55.50. KUALA LUMPUR was 1.8 per cent lower, depressed by broadly based profit-taking among index-linked stocks and second and third liners. The composite index fell 19.28 to 1,027.20. SINGAPORE was marked down 1.5 per cent, pressured by institutions unloading blue chips and speculators selling cheaper-priced stocks. The downward pressure was also attributed to programme-linked selling and redemption selling from foreign investors. The Straits Times Industrial index dipped 32.16 to 2,153.65. DBS Land fell 14 cents to SDollars 4.02 in spite of posting healthy 1993 earnings. SEOUL continued to retreat for the third straight day amid further consolidation in blue chips, and the composite index receded 7.97 to 898.56. MANILA rose sharply on strong buying of blue chip stocks, taking the composite index ahead 70.41, or 2.6 per cent, to 2,713.31. While volume fell to 3.04bn shares from Wednesday's 3.49bn, turnover value increased to 1.14bn pesos from 1.08bn pesos. TAIWAN put on 1.2 per cent as buyers came into the market late in the day. The weighted index rose 65.72 to 5,397.06, although turnover was thin at TDollars 39.05bn. AUSTRALIA eased in light trading, reflecting a weakness in the bond market. The All Ordinaries index shed 9.1 to 2,164.4 in ADollars 527.2m turnover. BHP slipped 4 cents to ADollars 17.46 and Western Mining declined 20 cents to ADollars 7.13, but CRA defied the trend, rising 10 cents to ADollars 17.76. CHINA's B shares weakened, with Shanghai's index losing 2.7 per cent to 61.71 and the Shenzhen index 0.5 per cent to 69.89. Brokers commented that overseas investors were worried about the overheating economy, with many reweighting portfolios in favour of Japan. KARACHI closed at a record high on strength in the financial sector as the market resumed trading after a seven-day holiday. The KSE 100-share index rose 27.65 to 2,589.71. BOMBAY was steady, the BSE 30-share index edging up 1.02 to 3,792.98, as liquidity picked up marginally from the very low levels of the previous two sessions which followed the imposition of a ban on forward trading. COLOMBO finished higher, the all-share index gaining 11.23 at 1,252.02, but brokers said they expected the improvement to prove shortlived and that the market would resume the correction which began on March 1.</p>

			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOT GUN SCOTT SURPRISES FOUNTAIN OF YOUTH RIVALS AS SLAVIC, RHYTHM FALTER  </P> <P> Shot Gun Scott, a 25-1 shot, won Saturday's Fountain of Youth Stakes at  Gulfstream Park in a four-horse finish that further clouded the Triple Crown  picture on the East Coast.  </P> <P> Smelly, which went off at 21-1, finished second by a nose.  </P> <P> Unbridled, who closed the strongest after lacking running room through the  stretch, edged Sunny Serve for third in the 13-horse field of 3-year-olds.  </P> <P> The best finish among the supposed Triple Crown contenders was by Slavic, who  went off as the favorite and took sixth place. Second choice Rhythm had perfect  position going to the far turn and faded to 10th. Yonder, trained by Woody  Stephens, was never in the hunt and finished 12th.  </P> <P> Shot Gun Scott, ridden by Dave Penna, ran the 1 1/16 miles in 1:44 3/5 and won  by half a length. The $129,045 Fountain of Youth is the major prep for the  $500,000 Florida Derby March 17 and a steppingstone toward the Kentucky Derby  May 5.  </P> <P> Shot Gun Scott paid $52.60, $21 and $9.60. Smelly paid $22.40 and $13.20.  Unbridled, an entry with Top Snob, paid $6.40 to show.  </P></p>

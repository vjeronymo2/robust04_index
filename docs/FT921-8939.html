			<p>920214 FT  14 FEB 92 / CIS bobs on the nationalist tide PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin arrives in Minsk today laden with political baggage. The meeting of Commonwealth of Independent States leaders brings together men who will ostensibly seek ways of furthering CIS interests, but who are actually immersed in the inevitably divisive process of building nations. Mr Yeltsin is well aware of the nationalist voices in the CIS. He has recently heard them on his own doorstep in Moscow. But Russia, as heir apparent to most of the central structures and foreign policy of the former Soviet Union, has an inherent interest in sustaining the Commonwealth. The Minsk meetings are essential for maintaining some form of collective command system and also to keep the CIS together - without momentum, the parts may separate. This means that little can be expected from the Commonwealth and that everything depends on the political forces which succeed in articulating national concerns. At the centre is Russia. Mr Yeltsin has promised that Russia has ceased to be imperial in its thinking; but he is hard pressed by politicians with a different aim. Last weekend, two kinds of opposition forces held gatherings in Moscow. The first were the reconstituted Communists, demanding the end of a government which had brought ruin to the people. They attracted large numbers but are hampered by their ideology: the leaders are nostalgic for Soviet communism, yet marching with them were various Russian nationalists waving the old Imperial standard and the St Andrew's Cross. There is little doubt that it is the nation, not the Union or communism, to which most people now look. More coherent was a two-day conference of 'patriotic' organisations, led by the small Christian Democrat and Constitutional Democrat (Cadet) parties. Delegates met to express their frustration with the disintegration of the Russian Federation into ethnic and territorial entities claiming independence, and to point to the isolation of the Russians in other republics. Though he was not invited, Mr Dmitri Vasiliev emerged as a dominating personality. He is leader of Pamyat (Memory), an overtly racist organisation which claims to be the leader of the patriotic movement by its early articulation of the theme of a Russia threatened by cosmopolitan culture and capital - dominated of course by international Jewry. Other speakers inveighed against those radicals who have proposed that Russia must allow its separate national groupings a national statehood within the federation - as Mr Yeltsin once did, in his period of opposition to Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. A FURTHER dilution of the economic reform programme was signalled yesterday by Mr Boris Yeltsin, writes John Lloyd. He told parliament: 'It's clear we need a range of measures, which cannot be delayed, to stimulate our economic programme.' Ministers believe the changes so far decreed - by a cut in the 28 per cent rate of VAT to nil on canteen meals and to 15 per cent on a range of food and other products, coupled with profit limits - are regrettable but will not fundamentally affect their ability to cut the vast budget deficit. However, any further decisions to increase wages and state benefits, coupled with further reductions of taxes, would, they believe, break the budget and destroy reform. Mr Yeltsin also announced, to deputies' laughter, that his conservative vice president, Mr Alexander Rutskoi, had been 'entrusted with the task of overseeing agricultural reform'. Agriculture is the portfolio used to bury political opponents in a morass of problems incapable of solution.</p>

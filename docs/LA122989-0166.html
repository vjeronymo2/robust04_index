			<p><P> December 29, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THOMAS MOWS DOWN FOES TO WIN NFL ROOKIE AWARD  </P> <P> His selection as the NFL's defensive newcomer of the year hardly shocked Kansas  City's Derrick Thomas. He had even identified his strongest challenger.  </P> <P> "I've been watching Steve Atwater to see what he's doing every week," Thomas  said Thursday when told he had swamped the Denver defensive back in voting by a  panel of broadcasters and sportswriters for the Associated Press award. "And I  think he was probably keeping tabs on me, too."  </P> <P> If so, Atwater knew he had little chance of overtaking the Chiefs' rookie  linebacker. Thomas' 10 sacks through 10 games helped turn a mediocre Kansas  City defense into one of the top units in the league.  </P> <P> The first defensive player taken in last year's college draft, Thomas is one of  those rare athletes with the ability to make those around him better players.  </P> <P> Still, his first year has not been free of pitfalls.  </P> <P> "I didn't want to play like a rookie, but I'm afraid that sometimes I did," he  said. "I'm nowhere close to where I eventually want to be. But I think I made a  lot of progress. Physically, my body hasn't changed since I was in college. But  mentally I'm getting to the point where I'm studying more and learning more and  starting to know some of the things the old veterans know."  </P> <P> Thomas was an easy winner for defensive rookie honors, collecting 43 1/2 votes  to 22 1/2 for Atwater.  </P> <P> The honor was not unexpected. NFL players had already voted Thomas into the Pro  Bowl.  </P> <P> "Everything was so new to me. It wasn't until about the sixth game that I  really got to the point where I felt comfortable, where I could make my own  decisions out there. In college, holding isn't permitted. Here, it is  permitted. But next year I'll know what to expect. My goal next year is to be  the best I can be."  </P></p>

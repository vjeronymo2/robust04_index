			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / Cut-price sale for troubled project South Quay, a large part-finished office building opposite Canary Wharf in the London Docklands, is believed to have been sold to an overseas buyer for about Pounds 7m, about a tenth of its original cost. South Quay, 360,000 sq ft of space including an unfinished 17-storey tower block, went into receivership in May 1992. The purchaser intends to hold the development until market conditions improve. The South Quay development consists of three separate office buildings above two floors of shops. Two buildings - comprising 144 self-contained business apartments and 30 retail units - are virtually complete while the third building, which includes the tower block, is part-completed. South Quay was built by Wiggins Group, a property developer, and established as a separate company in 1990 when Wiggins underwent financial restructuring.</p>

			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WATER RATES TO RISE 12% IN NOVEMBER  </P> <P> The Palmdale Water District has approved its first rate increase in nearly two  years, with most of the district's 17,000 customers expected to pay about 12%  more for water starting in November.  </P> <P> The five-member board of directors of the public water district, which serves  the east side of Palmdale and surrounding unincorporated areas, adopted the  increase Tuesday night in an attempt to cover a forecast deficit of about  $800,000 for the current calendar year.  </P> <P> The amount of increase varies by type of user. But district officials said a  typical residential customer now paying about $31 a month to use about 30,000  gallons would now pay about $35 a month. The district last increased rates in  February, 1989.  </P></p>

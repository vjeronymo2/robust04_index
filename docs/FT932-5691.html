			<p>930602 FT  02 JUN 93 / Survey of Shanghai (11): Silk road becomes M-way - Textiles A cold, wet Sunday afternoon and a number of well heeled Italians are being shown round the Shanghai No 7 silk printing and dyeing factory. An interesting group: in the showroom the men buy quantities of ladies' lingerie. The women buy silk ties. China now produces about 70 per cent of the world's silk. Factory No 7 is typical of what is happening in Shanghai's textile and other industries. Ten years ago China was exporting vast quantities of silk yarn and fabrics. Now the emphasis is on finished, value added goods. Since 1988 and the declaration of an 'open door' trade policy by China's leadership, a minor revolution has taken place in No 7's activities. Italian experts have been brought in to teach advanced printing and dyeing techniques. Substantial investments have been made in state of the art machinery. As a result of the new, more liberal trading regime sanctioned by the government, No 7 can now deal directly with customers and not, as it had to do before, through cumbersome state import/export agencies. The No 7 factory is now known as one of the most advanced of its kind in China. Mr Lin Yin-zhong, its director, says exports climbed to Dollars 12m last year from Dollars 1m in 1988. 'Though we are a state company we describe ourselves as self run,' says Mr Lin. 'We make our own decisions about co-operation with foreigners and about investments in machinery. It's these two factors which have led to our success.' Low labour costs are another reason for No 7's success. On average the company's 560 workers receive well under Dollars 1,000 per year, though housing and other benefits are provided. No 7's operations are helped by the absence of international quotas on silk goods. The lack of quota restrictions, say some western critics, means that China is now flooding the market with silk products. In so doing the luxury image of silk is in danger of being lost. No 7 has diversified into a wide range of products. More than 80 per cent of exports are now garments like shirts and dresses. 'This is the big profit sector at the moment,' says Mr Lin. 'More and more people in the west are buying silk in preference to other fabrics. It's now far more widely available.' While No 7 has achieved model status in Shanghai's textile industry, elsewhere the picture is not so bright. Until the mid 1980s, Shanghai was the leading textile centre in China. It has now lost that position to other areas, particularly to the more dynamic Guandong province in the south. Nearly 500 hundred textile factories still employ more than half a million people in Shanghai: but the industry has suffered from a serious lack of capital investment and an excess of bureaucracy. Mr Jiang Guang-yu, the director of the Shanghai textile industry bureau, says that Shanghai exported Dollars 2.4bn of textiles last year  - out of a total China export figure of Dollars 18bn. Mr Jiang insists that Shanghai's industry is still the most efficient in China but accepts that other parts of the country have been quicker to adapt to new, more liberal policies. Not all of this is Shanghai's fault. The central authorities in Beijing allowed Guandong to liberalise its trade and investment policies ahead of Shanghai. As a result many Shanghai industrialists moved south to set up factories in Guandong. All important technical staff also moved south, drawn by higher wage levels. Enterprises in Guangdong were given larger shares of the all important export quotas: increasing amounts of tax were transferred from Shanghai to Beijing, causing a shortage of local investment funds. Those policies are now changing, particularly since Deng Xiaoping's visit to Shanghai early last year, during which China's veteran leader gave his personal blessing to the growth and liberalisation of the municipality's economy. Mr Jiang says his bureau is in the process of investing more than Dollars 900m to renovate outdated textile plants. In addition more than 100 joint ventures with foreign companies have been set up in the textile industry with total investments of nearly Dollars 400m. The joint ventures are crucial: foreign companies bring much-needed investment funds their technology and, perhaps most importantly, open new sales channels for Shanghai's goods. Mr Jiang expects Shanghai's textile exports to grow by 8-10 per cent this year. But he says the industry still has too much bureaucracy. 'There are still too many forms to fill, too many state bodies involved. But it's improving - and we are determined to make Shanghai once again the number one centre for quality textiles in China.'</p>

			<p>930424 FT  24 APR 93 / Finance &amp; The Family: When even the experts are confused - Norma Cohen uncovers some nagging worries as Scottish Equitable goes Dutch SCOTTISH Equitable's policyholders can be forgiven for feeling a bit confused. This week, their company announced that effective control would pass to Aegon, a Netherlands-based insurance giant. Policyholders must now vote to approve the switch. But how are they to know if they are getting a good deal? It seems to offer a lot for with-profits policyholders: Pounds 200m in capital will be injected into the with-profits pool with no strings attached. The structure of the acquisition will leave Scottish Equitable with many of the characteristics of a mutual life insurance company. In a mutual, all profits belong to the policyholders and a portion is passed along as bonus, with the remainder locked away in reserves. SE's deal will put a 'ring fence' around the with-profits pool, totalling about Pounds 3bn, and all its profits will be kept for the sole benefit of its policyholders with none going to the shareholder, Aegon. In this sense, SE's 'de-mutualisation' is more attractive for its policyholders than that of some other companies in which the acquiring company has been entitled to a portion - typically, 10 per cent - of the with-profits pool's profits or losses. Moreover, the Pounds 200m injection will ease the strain on SE's solvency ratios, allowing it to restructure its portfolio and move into higher-yielding assets such as equities. This, in turn, should lead to higher bonuses, the reason being the way regulators judge the ability of companies to pay these and otherwise 'meet the reasonable expectations of policyholders.' Companies must have assets of at least 4 per cent above liabilities, but those calculations include assumptions about sharp drops in prices for all classes of assets. Because equities have to withstand a 25 per cent drop in prices, some companies with solvency margins of 10 to 15 per cent are having to increase their holdings of gilts and sell equities. At December 1992, Scottish Equitable had a solvency margin of 10 per cent and, at last July, was 60 per cent invested in UK gilts. Policyholders are giving up the right to 40 per cent of the gains made by the unit-linked side of SE's operations, which accounted for half of all the new business written last year. They will retain the right to 60 per cent of these profits although, as Aegon adds new capital, that share will fall to 50.2 per cent. At present, with-profits policyholders are entitled to 100 per cent. But Aegon is also injecting Pounds 40m into the unit-linked portion of the business, which should help it become more profitable overall. Policyholders may find they have a smaller slice of a much larger pie with no resulting loss in profit. Also, policyholders effectively will be paid for the share of the profits they are surrendering through a one-off bonus, likely to be roughly 40 per cent of one year's bonus payment. All these are reasons why policyholders can take considerable comfort from the deal, but there are some nagging concerns. First, shareholders may well ask if the price is fair - a question that stumps even the experts. Aegon is paying Pounds 240m, a price equal to the so-called 'embedded value' of the portion of the business they will control, plus 10 times one year's earnings. This embedded value is an estimate of the profit which will be released into policyholders' funds over the life of each policy. But estimates of any pool's embedded value will vary greatly depending on actuarial assumptions about such things as morbidity, investment returns and expenses. It is not possible to determine if the embedded value is realistic without reading the full actuarial valuation, and SE is not required to give that to policyholders - although it might choose to do so. A voting trust will look after the interests of with-profits policyholders and will have the right to name directors of the overall organisation. It will have a 'golden share' in that it can restrict certain kinds of actions by the main board. But should the with-profits pool fall below 20 per cent of all business, the golden share will cease, although the trust will continue to administer the affairs of the pool. The question is what role Scottish Equitable imagines with-profits business will play in its future. David Berridge, the group chief executive, says that half of all business written in 1992 was unit-linked. The bulk of the rest was unitised with-profits, a product where policyholders join the with-profits pool. But a marketing shift could reduce the protection for with-profits policyholders over time, a nagging worry for some. What will happen if policyholders do not approve the deal? Berridge has made clear that the company needs capital if it is to continue to grow. Without this, it will have to restrict its new business and limit payouts to policyholders - and that is something no one should want.</p>

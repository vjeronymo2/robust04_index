			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Slough Estates hit by property market but maintains dividend THE PROBLEMS of the property market left 1991 pre-tax profits of Slough Estates, which has a bias to industrial property, down from Pounds 86.4m to Pounds 68.3m before exceptional costs of Pounds 36.7m against Pounds 63.8m. However, the group proposes a maintained final dividend of 7.15p, giving a slightly higher total of 11.55p (11.35p). Sir Nigel Mobbs, chairman and chief executive, said that though the dividend was not covered by earnings per share of 8p (8.1p) it reflected 'our continuing confidence in the future prospects of the group'. He expected 1992 earnings to be sufficient to cover a maintained dividend. Net assets per share, diluted, fell from 375p to 331p. The shares, up 1p yesterday at 177p, stand on a 46.5 per cent discount to the asset value. Sir Nigel said that 1991 had proved even more difficult than 1990, which at the time had been the worst property market he could remember. He said that oversupply of property would 'restrict new speculative development for some years ahead' and that banks were reluctant to lend on new schemes. This would hasten the absorption of existing vacant space. The group's industrial bias and low exposure to central London office properties had helped the portfolio, he said. Operating income fell from Pounds 118m to Pounds 109m because of an absence of property trading profits which contributed Pounds 11.4m in 1990. Net interest took Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 24.5m). The exceptional costs related to write-downs of trading properties and other provisions. Net debt fell from Pounds 825m to Pounds 739m, helped by last April's Pounds 138m rights issue, while shareholders funds rose to Pounds 1.1bn (Pounds 1.08bn). COMMENT After the horrors of the last two years it should be safe to assume that Slough's asset value will stick at about the 330p level this year. A discount of approaching 50 per cent makes the shares look cheap against the sector. Further, the implied promise of a held dividend gives an attractive-looking yield of 8.7 per cent. And the shares have been rotten performers in recent months. So why did the shares give up all but a penny of early gains yesterday? The debate is over capitalised interest - expected to add about Pounds 40m to profits in 1992 which should reach Pounds 60m to Pounds 65m - without which the dividend will not be covered. In such a gloomy environment it would be brave to take the less conservative view.</p>

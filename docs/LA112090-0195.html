			<p><P> November 20, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> SHORT TAKES;  </P> <P> HENDERSON RECALLS MUSICAL BID  </P> <P> Florence Henderson says she regrets arriving in Hollywood about the time the  studios stopped making musicals.  </P> <P> "I loved those old film musicials," said Henderson, best known as the matriarch  of "The Brady Bunch."  </P> <P> "I grew up in this tiny town in southern Indiana where going to the movies was  the biggest excitement of the week. I wanted to be Jane Powell."  </P> <P> She even tried to break into show business as a singer, at a talent show staged  by bandleader Horace Heidt, but the results were less than successful, she  recalled in a recent interview.  </P> <P> "I was such a kid. I didn't know you had to bring your own piano player. I  showed up with a Jane Powell record. On one side, she was singing 'It's a Most  Unusual Day' and on the other was a French song," she said.  </P> <P> " 'What are you going to sing?' Mr. Heidt asked. 'These two songs,' I said.  'Where's your piano player?' he wanted to know. 'Oh, I don't have one,' I said.  That's what I did, too. Of course, I didn't win."  </P></p>

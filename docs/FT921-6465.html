			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Civil servants plan to challenge pay scheme A PERFORMANCE pay system for top civil servants could face a legal challenge which, if successful, would affect the way performance pay is introduced for the rest of the Civil Service. The government wants performance pay to be a part of this year's annual pay review for all 500,000 non-industrial civil servants. The FDA civil servants' union plans a legal challenge to the performance pay system for the top 24,000 civil servants on grounds of sex discrimination. This scheme has operated since 1988 and elements of it are likely to be copied for the rest of the Civil Service. The union, with support from the Equal Opportunities Commission, is seeking legal advice on whether the pay system is in breach of European law. The union says the fact that 42 per cent of men and only 24 per cent of women received performance awards shows that the system is discriminatory. It blames the importance of seniority in the performance system and says that women, who often break their careers to have children, do not stand a fair chance of getting performance awards. The FDA, which may claim extra pay for the women who are said to have been discriminated against, is basing its argument on the Nimz case before the European Court. It was argued in that case that employers had to justify the use of seniority in performance pay or they could be in contravention of the equal pay aspects of Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome. The Treasury, which oversees Civil Service pay, is also understood to be seeking legal advice. It said yesterday it believed the pay system to be working well and was confident that it breached neither UK nor European law. The FDA is also unhappy about the extent of management discretion in the performance system. Bifu, the financial services union, is urging members at Barclays Bank to vote for industrial action over a pay offer. It wants its members in the bank to stage a series of one-day strikes over the bank's proposed package, which would add between 2.5 per cent and 4 per cent to the salaries of non-managerial staff. The Barclays talks are likely to influence pay talks in many other financial services companies.</p>

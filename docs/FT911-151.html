			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / International Bonds: Euromarket awash after post-holiday issues rush THE INTERNATIONAL bond market was awash with new issues yesterday as borrowers launched deals delayed last week by public holidays in Europe and the Treasury refunding operations in the US. Against the background of Citicorp's global asset-backed deal, the sterling sector of the mortgage-backed market was tested by a Pounds 200m twin-tranche issue from Mortgage Funding Corporation No. 4, a special-purpose vehicle of Eagle Star. Lead-managed by Credit Suisse First Boston, the deal offers paper with an average life of 1.5 and five years. Every deal in the sector this year has pushed back the limits of terms which are acceptable to investors. For example, the longer-dated tranche of yesterday's issue pays a discounted margin of 62.5 basis points over the three-month London interbank offered rate. This is identical to the discounted margin offered on the tranche of the recent issue by CMS No 9, which had an average life of 3.6 years. Recent deals have abandoned the earlier practice of offering investors a step-up in margin from next year if banks are forced by the regulators to put aside more capital against holdings of mortgage-backed paper. As sentiment has improved, non-bank investors have started to buy mortgage-backed bonds again, making the market less vulnerable to the proposed regulatory change. The UK government bond market was weak throughout the day, but this did not prevent Tokyo Electric Power from becoming the latest Japanese borrower to issue sterling-denominated bonds. The borrower issued Pounds 150m of 10-year bonds priced to yield 52 basis points over the 10 per cent gilt maturing 2001. The yield spread is wider than on other recent deals by Japanese names. For example, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone launched its Pounds 100m deal at a spread of 50 basis points over gilts and has now tightened to 45 basis points. However, Tokyo Electric Power is less well known in the international bond market. Despite negative sentiment in the market, lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston opted to press ahead with the deal. Having been reoffered to investors at a fixed price of 99.70, the bonds traded down to 99.40 as gilts weakened. However, the yield spread remained at around 52 basis points. Credit Lyonnais became the first bank to issue longer-dated Eurodollar bonds for some months, launching a Dollars 300m seven-year deal. The deal, increased from Dollars 250m, offers paper priced at a yield spread of 74 basis points over US government bonds. Participants said the yield spread was generous enough to tempt investors looking to lengthen the duration of their portfolio exposure to the US currency. The lead manager, Credit Lyonnais, reported strong buying from continental European investors. The paper traded at around the fixed re-offer price of 99.40. The Republic of Ireland yesterday raised Pta10bn with an issue of seven-year bonds in the Spanish market. The deal maintained international interest in peseta-denominated bonds, which was given further impetus by the cut in Italian interest rates over the weekend.</p>

			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DORM DILEMMA  </P> <P> John Berol ("A Solution to Mini-Dorm Dilemma," June 24) makes an eloquent  appeal for protecting our neighborhoods from the insidious erosion inflicted by  unregulated housing.  </P> <P> The economic appeal provided by renting single-family houses to students is  hard to resist.  </P> <P> Pacific Beach, like La Jolla and the college area, is particularly hard-hit by  the additional traffic, noise and all-around density fostered by this practice.  </P> <P> The result: as houses fill to capacity and streets become long parking lots,  any semblance of a single-family neighborhood is lost to the expediency of  housing more and more people. As long as the colleges and universities ignore  their responsibility to house the students they attract to our city, the city  at large will suffer, students and residents alike.  </P> <P> ALFRED C. STROHLEIN  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

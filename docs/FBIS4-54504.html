			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by sta: "Parliament Has Approved the Amendment to </F> Law No. 143 on Pay and Emoluments"]    [Text] On the first day of its 16th session, the  Chamber of Deputies of parliament (15 February 1994) approved an  amendment to change and augment Law No. 143/1992 Collection of  Laws [Sb.] on pay and emoluments for readiness to work in  budgetary and some additional organizations, as specified in  subsequent regulations. This law becomes effective on 1 April  1994.    The following provision is among the most important changes  based on the language of the amendment: Paragraph 4 of Section  16 is eliminated. It said: "Pay is payable in the month in which  the service relationship comes into being or continues." In  practical terms, this meant that soldiers received their pay,  for example, on 15 November for that entire month, their pay  being thus "half ahead." The amendment changes this paragraph so  that pay will be due in the future for the preceding month  worked--that is to say, in practical terms, pay will be due in  May for April.    An additional substantial modification is the introduction  of  the institution of so-called additional pay. This is nothing  other than a 13th payday, or possibly even an additional payday.  Inserted after Section 15 of the amendment is a new section,  Section 15a, that states the following: "Additional pay--In  fulfilling conditions stipulated by government regulations,  employees are eligible for additional pay in a calendar year."  The specific nature of applying this provision currently depends  on the government regulation that is under preparation and that  should be adopted in March. As we found out in the lobbies of  parliament, in the Army there is supposed to be a 13th payday  for which the sponsor of the amendment has stipulated two  variations of the due date. One of the variations speaks of the  halfway point in this year; a second talks about the halfway  point in 1995.</p>

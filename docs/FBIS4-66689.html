			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Sami al-Muhanna: "Saudi Banks Begin to Receive </F> Donations for Jerusalem"]    [Text] Riyadh--Official and popular circles in the Kingdom  of Saudi Arabia and in the Arab and Islamic countries have  responded to the call issued by King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz,  Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, to launch a popular donation  campaign throughout the Kingdom to restore and rescue the  Islamic holy sites in the venerable Jerusalem.    This initiative is part of the commendable efforts exerted  by  the Kingdom to support the Palestinian cause and to safeguard  Islamic holy sites in the venerable Jerusalem.    The custodian of the two holy mosques has instructed Prince  Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, governor of Riyadh Province and  chairman of the Popular Committee to Aid Palestinian Strugglers,  to take charge of the popular donations campaign throughout the  Kingdom.    Prince Salman has addressed a touching appeal to the Saudi  people and to all Arab and Muslim citizens and residents, urging  them to contribute effectively and to donate generously.    For this purpose, Prince Salman has established a unified  account at all of the Kingdom's banks in order to facilitate the  reception of donations.    Thirteen popular committees in the venerable Mecca, luminous  Medina, Riyadh, Jeddah, al-Dammam, Abha, al-Qasim, al- Hasa,  al-Ta'if, 'Ar'ar, al-Kharj, Tabuk, and al-Khafji have begun to  receive citizens' donations that are flowing into banks during  bank work hours from 0900-1400 and from 2100-0030. The banks  will manage the donation accounts and will submit periodic  reports on the progress of the campaign to Prince Salman  Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz.    In a related development, 'Abd-al-Rahim al-Jamus, director  of  the Kingdom's offices of the Popular Committees to Aid  Palestinian Strugglers, has made special statements to express  his pride in King Fahd Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz's noble initiative,  saying, "We believe that this call will receive an immediate and  prompt response from the Kingdom's citizens, especially since  the campaign is led by Prince Salman Bin-'Abd-al-'Aziz, who has  been chairman of the Popular Committee to Aid Palestinian  Strugglers since 20 Dhu al-Qa'dah 1387 of the Hegira,  corresponding to 1968. Donations have amounted to more than 1.5  billion riyals since this committee was created. The Kingdom's  citizens have contributed and members of the Palestinian  community in the Kingdom, both those working in the government  and in the private sector, have donated 5 percent of their  salaries.</p>

			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Spring Ram board wins day on auditor ANGRY small shareholders tried but failed to oust Arthur Andersen as auditor to Spring Ram, the manufacturer of kitchens, bathrooms and home improvement products, at the company's AGM in Leeds. They won on a show of hands by 48 to 40, but Mr Bill Rooney, chairman, said he had 105m proxy votes for reappointment and only 8m against. The vote on the floor was re-taken and most of those against then abstained. However, this was the only blemish on the day for Mr Rooney, Spring Ram's founder. Shareholders backed him after he apologised for management mistakes and promised appointment of a second non-executive director and a strong finance director within weeks. Clearly nervous, Mr Rooney told the packed meeting of about 200 people that a senior manager in Balterley Bathrooms, a subsidiary, had overstated profits to impress his superiors, mainly by manipulating stock figures. No money was stolen, Mr Rooney said, and the fraud was so clever that neither management nor auditors could have reasonably been expected to spot it. The report and accounts and dividend were approved unanimously on a show of hands, as was the election of Mr Roy Barber, a company doctor.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National Assembly  of the People's Government [ANPP], has stressed the great  efforts by the people of Granma in confronting the current  situation, and their profound patriotic and revolutionary faith.  Alarcon and other ANPP leaders participated in a three-day visit  to the province, along with seven of its work commissions, to  inspect preparations for the forthcoming report the province  will render to the ANPP.    [Begin Alarcon recording] [Words indistinct] I must stress  that beyond a doubt, if we seek that part of Cuba where the  roots, heart, and struggle of the fatherland have been alive for  over 120 years, we must immediately think of the Cuban region we  today call Granma Province.    Here one finds many people aware of the progress report  process, aware of what is being done in this regard. It is a  stimulus, something that helps boost the tasks conducted by the  provincial organizations, things they were doing anyhow. This  process, however, helps to give a certain impetus to the entire  collective effort. [end recording]    The ANPP presidency stressed the fact that in Granma, over  500 low-cost houses have been built of a semester plan for  1,000, and the fact that the province has confirmed it will  fulfill its current sugar production plan.</p>

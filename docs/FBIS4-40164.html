			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Text] A group of generals and officers of the Russian  Defense Ministry headed by Deputy Defense Minister Colonel  General Georgiy Kondratyev departed for Abkhazia on 14 June.  The group is to oversee the beginning of the peacekeeping  operation in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone. Slavyanka's  correspondent Vladimir Orlov is among the delegation. He  managed to have an interview with Georgiy Kondratyev just before  take-off.    According to the deputy defense minister, the beginning of  the peacekeeping operation is divided into two stages. The  first stage will take place on 16-19 June. During this stage  the engineer subunits will be deployed to carry out mine  clearance operations in the region of the conflict.  Communications equipment will also be installed and  headquarters set up for the peacekeeping forces. There will be  two such headquarters -- in Gali and Zugdidi.    During the first stage three battalions of the Russian  Transcaucasian troops and the 345th Airborne Assault Regiment  stationed in Gudauta are to be deployed. The peacekeeping  forces' subunits will occupy disengagement lines along the  Inguri riverbank.    The second stage will take place during 21-24 June. During  this stage the number of peacekeeping troops in the conflict  zone will be increased by two more battalions. The full-scale  peacekeeping operation in Abkhazia will begin on 26 June.    Colonel General Kondratyev noted that the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry will have to bear all the costs of the  peacekeeping operation, which will be about 2 billion rubles.  He also noted that in 1993 the Russian Defense Ministry spent  more than 26 billion rubles out of its own budget on  peacekeeping operations.    To the question on the composition of the peacekeeping  forces, Georgiy Kondratyev replied that only the Russian  subunits will be involved. The CIS countries will be  represented only by observers from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and  Ukraine. To our correspondent's question on who will be  appointed commander of the CIS peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia,  Kondratyev replied that this decision will be made on site.</p>

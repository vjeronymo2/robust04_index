			<p>930519 FT  19 MAY 93 / Recovery hopes rise sharply EXPECTATIONS of a strong economic recovery have risen sharply, Gallup's latest survey of consumer confidence shows. The survey recorded the most positive results for a year, with 43 per cent of respondents expecting the economic situation to improve over the next 12 months. Only 22 per cent expected a deterioration. The balance of 21 per cent expecting an improvement, the highest for 12 months, compares with April's balance of 4 per cent expecting the situation to worsen. The improvement in consumer sentiment appears to come from a big fall in the numbers expecting unemployment to increase in the year ahead. Forty-nine per cent thought unemployment would increase, compared with 68 per cent in April.</p>

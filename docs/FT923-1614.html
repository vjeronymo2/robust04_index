			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Survey of Belize (1): A bridge to the future - Belize is a richer and more just society than many of its South American neighbours. Its judicial, political and educational systems work reasonably well. In spite of growing social problems, Stephen Fidler says it is possible to be optimistic about tomorrow WHILE civil war ravaged the rest of central America in the 1980s, Belize remained an oasis of calm. As heavy debt and economic crisis engulfed Latin America, Belize achieved high growth and single-digit inflation. In a zone with a history of military regimes and political instability, Belize offered democracy and respect for the rule of law. Belizeans are proud of what differentiates them from their neighbours; but their destiny will probably lie as much with the Hispanic countries surrounding them as it does with their traditional allies in the English-speaking Caribbean. Belize is becoming, ethnically at least, more like its neighbours. An estimated 40,000 people - a fifth of the population - have arrived from neighbouring states over the past decade, fugitives from civil war or economic deprivation. The influence of the creoles - the Afro-European group that has traditionally dominated Belizean society - has meanwhile weakened because of emigration. This has caused tension: the newcomers have provided the manpower for agriculture, the engine for growth in the 1980s. But they have put pressure on health services and schools. The prime minister, Mr George Price, who with his People's United Party has dominated Belizean politics for 40 years, has spoken of the country as a bridge between central America and the Caribbean. This is a long way from reality, but it is part of a growing recognition among the mini-states of the two sub-regions of the costs of isolation. Until last year, practical co-operation with the rest of central America was impossible because of Guatemala's claim over the territory of Belize. The claim delayed independence of Belize - known until 1973 as British Honduras  -until 1981 and was the reason for Britain's maintenance of a garrison of 1,800 men and a squadron of Harrier jets. Following guidelines hammered out between the two sides, Guatemala last year recognised Belize's independence. A final settlement will require further steps, including ratification in a referendum in Belize and concessions to guarantee Guatemala access through the Gulf of Honduras to the Caribbean. These moves have allowed a lifting of the veto on Belize's membership of the Organisation of American States, to which it acceded in January 1991. Belize will also join the InterAmerican Development Bank in November. The garrison still provides 8-10 per cent of the country's GDP, but its departure will not necessarily mean an end to the British military presence. As a training ground, Belize's jungle terrain is excellent. A withdrawal would anyway have less economic impact now than in the past thanks in large part to the growth of agriculture. Agriculture and agro-processing account for a quarter of GDP, 40 per cent of employment and nearly 70 per cent of exports. However, four-fifths of all Belize's exports benefit from preferential market arrangements, some of which are threatened. As a member of the Commonwealth, Belize exports to EC markets at low tariffs under the Lome convention. Its agricultural products also have tariff-free access to the US under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and the country also belongs to the Caribbean common market, Caricom. The North American Free Trade Agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico is one threat. It may encourage Mexico to become a big citrus producer. A further extension of US free trade agreements to other countries in Latin America, proposed under President George Bush's Enterprise for Americas Initiative, would also erode the special position of CBI countries. According to Mr Ralph Fonseca, minister of state in the ministry of finance: 'The main tenet of our trade policy has been gradualism. We are saying give us to the year 2000 and we can take on anybody.' This approach recognises the country's still heavy dependence on a few export products and its chronic trade deficits. Remittances from overseas - estimated to bring in USDollars 15m to Dollars 17m a year - help balance this. So does tourism, which has grown to become the country's second most important source of foreign exchange. Tourist attractions - rain forest, long expanses of coral reef and important Mayan sites - have potential for further development. Belize has, however, neither the desire, the labour force nor the beaches necessary to become a mass tourist destination. The country also provides a positive reception for foreign investment. There are constraints such as a small labour force and mixed infrastructure: good telephones but poor roads and no access for large ships. Electricity is costly: 21 US cents per kilowatt-hour, almost three times that of the US. It can also offer stability. Government handovers of power in 1984 and 1989 were achieved without big shifts in policy. The Belize dollar has been fixed since 1976 at two to the US dollar and inflation has been low. The government is fairly free of corruption. According to one businessman: 'The worst thing you can say is that occasionally it favours its friends.' However, the bureaucracy is often slow. One businessman describes it as 'expert in procrastination' and Mr Fonseca says the government recognises a need to modernise it. The government is also selling commercial assets. The telephone company has been privatised, although the government retains a significant stake, and plans to sell the electricity company are being finalised. The privatisation programme has critics. Mr Manuel Esquivel, leader of the opposition, says that it risks being dominated by one company: Belize Holdings, controlled by Mr Michael Ashcroft, the controversial chairman of the British car auction and security group, ADT. The government has also attempted to speed up development by increasing capital spending. This and its pay award to public sector workers of an annual 10 per cent for the next three years have increased anxieties that the government is forgetting its traditional fiscal conservatism. Mr Keith Arnold, the central bank president, is worried that the government's revenues are falling behind its spending: 'The government has sufficient funds for the next two to three years, but beyond that it will have to take care.' This will accelerate talk of fiscal reform. Although legislation has been passed to enable imposition of a value added tax, the government has been reluctant to implement it. Yet the tax system is outdated: most revenue is raised through taxing international trade. The government also faces growing social problems. As migrants put pressure on health and education services, emigration to the US is tearing at the social fabric. Into this environment, cocaine has found its way. Belize has resolved one drugs problem - in the 1980s it was one of the top five suppliers of marijuana to the US; now most of the plantations have been eradicated. But it has developed another: on a line between Colombia and the US, Belize is used for cocaine trans-shipment. The Belizean middle men are paid in kind and they have seen to it that a cocaine habit has developed. As a result, crime, particularly in Belize City, is on the increase. Yet, in spite of these problems, it is possible to be optimistic about the future. With per capita income of USDollars 2,000 a year and a reasonable income distribution, Belize is a richer and more just society than many of its neighbours. Its institutions - its judicial, political and educational systems - work reasonably well. As Mr Geoffrey Hart, manager of Barclays Bank in Belize, says: 'This country is not going to be a Singapore. It's no tiger but it has a lot going for it.'</p>

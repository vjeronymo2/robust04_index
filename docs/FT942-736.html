			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Management (The Growing Business): BICs make progress Europe's network of business and innovation centres (BICs) now totals more than 100, including offices recently established in the new democracies of central Europe. Progress of the BICs was celebrated in Seville last week at a 10th anniversary congress of their Brussels-based umbrella organisation EBN*. Developed from a pilot project launched in 1984 by the Directorate-General for regional policies of the European Commission (DG XV1), the centres were primarily intended to help create or expand innovative businesses in areas suffering from serious industrial decline. Financed 50 per cent from Commission funds during their start-up period, some BICs have struggled to attract adequate funds from the private sector, government and local authorities. But the success of their avowed selective approach to small business support has in many of the cases been impressive. A survey of 51 BICs relating to 1992 indicated that most of the 'client' companies were in the information technology, electronics and applied engineering sectors, and that nearly 90 per cent had been in existence for five years (against a European average of 48 per cent for all types of company). Other features were a propensity to innovate, to invest, to export and to employ qualified staff. EBN claims that today's BICs - whose services range from project detection and training to marketing advice and shared logistical support - have between them been responsible for the creation or the development of 4,000 SMEs and 20,000 jobs. Philip Ellison, chief executive of Greater Manchester Business Innovation Centre, one of nine in the UK, says the BIC Europe-wide network is also 'a brilliant one' for exporters, if used correctly. *EBN, Avenue de Tervuren, 188A, Brussels 1150, Belgium.

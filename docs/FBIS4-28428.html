			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Propriety of DPRK's Reactor Core Refueling Method Asserted </F> in U.S. and Japan" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- Voices asserting the  propriety of the DPRK's method of reactor core refueling are  ringing out from the United States and Japan at a time when the  U.S. and the International Atomic Energy Agency have come to the  wrong conclusion that nondivergence of nuclear material cannot  be guaranteed, arguing that the technical possibility of later  measurement of core fuel rods discharged from the 5 megawatt  experimental atomic power plant of the DPRK is lost.    THE NEW YORK TIMES on June 4 wrote that as long as the spent  fuel is kept in a special storage, it is possible to restore the  records of how much plutonium North Korea extracted in 1989.    According to a recent issue of the U.S. weekly DEFENSE NEWS,  John Wolfsthal, senior associate of the Nuclear Control  Association in Washington, held that the method proposed by  North Korea preserves the possibility of verifying later how  long fuel rods stayed in the nuclear reactor and whether  Pyongyang diverted fuel to the manufacture of nuclear weapons,  or not.    He was quoted as saying the IAEA seems to have gone too far  and concern is expressed that the agency is negatively viewing a  possible solution of the issue.    Core refueling itself does not mean the impossibility of the  recovery of historical information, he said.    NHK June 2 said the Japanese Government considers that the  technical check-up of fuel rods is possible by the method  proposed by North Korea.</p>

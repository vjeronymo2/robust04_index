			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / EC aid for textile restructuring The European Commission yesterday finalised a Ecu500m (Pounds 350m) aid programme to help poorer areas of the Community restructure their textile industries, and so indirectly to reduce protectionism against imports, writes David Buchan in Brussels. The chief beneficiary of the aid, to be spread over 1993-97, will be Portugal, where textiles account for one third of manufactured exports. Lisbon had been promised the aid in return for not obstructing an opening up of the EC market to textiles from central Europe and possible moves towards free trade with north Africa.</p>

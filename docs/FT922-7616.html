			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / Letter: The Archbishop, shareholders and re-thinking the purpose and standards of business The Archbishop of Canterbury is right to question the principle that companies limited by shares exist to maximise shareholder value, which is the effect of company law. Prof Handy ('Priorities and purpose at the heart of capitalism', May 12) is optimistic in thinking companies can acquire a different purpose without a change in company law. While voting power coincides with capital stake, and members retain the right to appropriate the entire residual profit of a company, market forces will ensure that the interests of the investors of capital will predominate. Investors can be turned into Handy's 'financiers' only if there is an open door to new investors on equal terms to existing ones (no pre-emption rights), and if the directors have the power to repay costly capital in favour of cheaper. Only then through the resulting limitation of the return on capital, is there a chance for an objects clause, which includes the interests of other 'stakeholders', to become meaningful. That this approach can work is demonstrated by our own success in attracting nearly Pounds 1.5m from private investors for investment on these terms in non-profit enterprise in Third World countries.

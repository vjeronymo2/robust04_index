			<p>941114 FT  14 NOV 94 / Caracas takes control of bank The Venezuelan government has taken control of Banco Andino, a small commercial bank formerly owned by private investors, it was announced at the weekend. This brings to 13 the total number of banks the government has intervened in since the beginning of this year. Venezuela's banking crisis erupted last January when Banco Latino, one of the country's largest banks, failed. The government has also taken over hundreds of subsidiaries of these financial institutions. Banco Andino will apparently remain open under the control of the state-owned Banco Industrial de Venezuela (BIV), which bought 73 per cent of the troubled institution's shares for a nominal sum.</p>

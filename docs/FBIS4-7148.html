			<p>BFN     [Text] The military attaches of embassies of various  countries visited the Ministry of People's Armed Forces on 24  April and enthusiastically congratulated the 62d anniversary of  the founding of the heroic Korean People's Army [KPA].    Comrade Choe Kwang, chief of the General Staff of the KPA,  and officers and men and military officers of the KPA welcomed  the guests.    During the meeting, the military attache of the Russian  Embassy Georgiy Mariyasov, who is the head of the military  attaches corps, said that he sends warm military greetings to  all the officers and men of the KPA who are welcoming the 62d  anniversary of its founding. He also continued:    The KPA that has a glorious history of 62 years overcame all  difficulties and reliably defended the fatherland's security and  the country's sovereign rights. The KPA founded by the  respected and beloved leader not only achieved a great victory  in the anti-Japanese armed struggle, but it was all the more  developed into a strong regular armed force.    Today the KPA is highly upholding Comrade Kim Chong-il, who  is a great man [widaehan pun], as its supreme commander. We are  glad over the fact that the Korean people and soldiers of the  People's Army are able to uphold two great leaders [widaehan  tubunui yongdoja]. On the anniversary of the KPA, we give our  sincere greetings to those great leaders.    Currently, the imperialists are strengthening pressure and  maneuvers of isolation toward the DPRK. We actively support all  the just steps taken by your country against the imperialists'  unreasonable maneuvers. We hope that there will be greater  results in the Korean people's struggle to strengthen socialist  construction and the country's defense capabilities, and to  reunify the fatherland.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Books: A grand talent to amuse TRICKS OF MEMORY By Peregrine Worsthorne Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 18.99, 290 pages SIR PEREGRINE Worsthorne is usually an exceptionally charming man, a bit of a dandy perhaps, occasionally over-sensitive, but fairly well-educated and much better travelled than some of his recent articles have suggested. When it comes to an autobiography, he has one huge advantage: he can write. The first 100 pages or so of Tricks of Memory are sheer delight. Worsthorne turns out to be even grander by background than some of us had assumed. Not only was his step-father Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, a fact which was already well enough known; Norman's younger brother, Ronnie, was chairman of the BBC. There were good connections all over the place. The younger brother of Winston Churchill married the sister of Worsthorne's grandmother. There were frequent visits by Winston himself to the Worsthorne domain, sometimes with the young Perry in sole charge. None of this is told in a spirit of boasting. Indeed it sometimes seems that Worsthorne's subsequent iconoclasm as a journalist was a reaction to being surrounded by the great and the good in his youth. His mother, though as well-off and well-connected as the rest of them, was distinctly a progressive and became more so as she grew older. Worsthorne's attachment to her in the early years was not great. He thinks she sent him to the wrong school - Stowe rather than Eton - out of perversity. It was not until Worsthorne turned down a place in the City, which all the family advantages could have offered him, that his step-father and mother came to take him seriously. From Montagu Norman this may seem odd, but he was a very unconventional central banker. He went to work either in a Lincoln, because a Rolls-Royce would have looked too ostentatious, or on the underground from Notting Hill Gate. Worsthorne slipped into journalism more by accident than design. Again the family connections helped, but could be misleading. He went to head office of the Glasgow Herald on the assumption that he had been appointed deputy editor; in fact, he was a deputy sub-editor who never wrote a word. Still, he stuck it out for two years, mixing between fellow sub-editors and some rather grander Scottish acquaintance, introduced to him through the family. He did not get on well with everyone he met. When he went to The Times and, as correspondent in Washington tried to report the Republican Party thinking of the day, he was told: 'It is not the job of The Times newspaper to provide a platform for reactionary rant.' When he moved to the Daily Telegraph and went on the extended Harold Macmillan tour of Africa, he found that no other British journalist accepted invitations from the Afrikaners in South Africa. The result was that he gained insights denied to his colleagues. Tricks of Memory deteriorates slightly as it nears the present. One of the reasons is that Worsthorne has always fancied himself as a thinker, almost a journalist-philosopher. In a fascinating section, he gives his views on how to write a column. It should not, he thinks, contain too many facts or inside information, but should concentrate on the author's opinions. Yet it is precisely because the younger Worsthorne did travel and was exposed to news that his articles were so good. The talent was to inject some passion or perversity, but the basic material had to be there. I do not remember agreeing with anything he has said or written, but his articles have given me a great deal of pleasure. So does this book.</p>

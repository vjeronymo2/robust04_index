			<p><P> April 22, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GARDENING: AN URBAN OASIS AT GREEN SCENE;  </P> <P> FULLERTON ARBORETUM LOOKS AT EARLY-CENTURY LIFE, PLANTS  </P> <P> There's an urban oasis tucked away in the northeast corner of Cal State  Fullerton campus reminiscent of H. G. Well's "The Time Machine." Today and  Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., the Green Scene at Fullerton Arboretum offers  "an opportunity to see how people lived at the turn of the century, then come  back to the present to view plants and buy things for your home," said Joyce  Rosenthal, event chairman.  </P> <P> Glimpse the past with a guided tour of Heritage House, the Victorian cottage  that was originally the home of Fullerton's first physician. Inside the  restored one-story home you can see the doctor's office, parlor, dining room,  kitchen, pantry and a bedroom. "The whole house acts as a living museum. If the  doctor were to return today, it would be as if he were walking back into his  own home," said Rico Montenegro, arboretum assistant director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> From Common to Exotic  </P> <P> At the annual plant sale, there will be everything from common begonias and  fuchsias to the drought-resistant, unusual bulbines and exotic bonsai, palms,  bromeliads, orchids and rare fruits. "We'll have a number of things you  probably can't get at your local nursery," Rosenthal said. All sale items are  supplied by local horticultural and garden clubs, nurseries and members of the  Potters, the Friends of the Fullerton Arboretum plant propagators. Take a tip  from veteran shoppers and bring a wagon for ease in carrying your treasures.  </P> <P> A variety of gardening demonstrations will be presented by green-thumb experts  beginning at 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. today; 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. on Sunday. Get tips on  such subjects as bromeliad care and potting, how to care for fuchsias, bee  keeping, organic soil amendments and drip irrigation. A complete listing of  demonstrations and exhibitors will be in the program, available at the  entrance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Chances to Win  </P> <P> Door prizes, donated by the exhibitors, will be awarded throughout the weekend.  Watch for the person roving the event selling chances.  </P> <P> The arboretum gift shop will also be open for sales of books, seeds and other  items. And in case you work up an appetite from all the activity, there will be  refreshment booths offering hot dogs, chili, lemonade, soft drinks and cookies.  </P> <P> A donation of $2 per person or $5 per family is requested. Parking is free and  there's easy access for strollers and wheelchairs. The Fullerton Arboretum is  located at Yorba Linda Boulevard and Associated Road, west of the Orange  Freeway. Look for the balloons at the top of the hill.  </P></p>

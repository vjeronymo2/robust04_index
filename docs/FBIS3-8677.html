As is known, the National Council passed a vote of  no-confidence in Vladimir Meciar, the current prime minister.  According to Article 116, Paragraph 6 of the Constitution, on  the basis of this decision of the National Council, the  president of the Republic is to recall the prime minister. The  recall of the prime minister means the resignation of the whole  government. The president of the Republic is determined to ask  those members of the government who were not personally subject  to a vote of no-confidence to temporarily continue exercising  their duties at the utmost until the naming of the new  government. The president of the Republic invited Tibor Cabaj,  the chairman of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia  parliamentary group, to negotiate tomorrow morning with the  strongest parliamentary group about the possibility of creating  a new government.

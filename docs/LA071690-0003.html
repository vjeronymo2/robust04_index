			<p><P> July 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEDIA BIAS ON ABORTION ISSUE  </P> <P> The articles were outstanding. I can only hope that this is a new beginning for  The Times and other media. I can only hope that this isn't just a bone thrown  to the dog so that he will stop barking and go away.  </P> <P> All any "pro-life advocate" has ever asked is that there is fair reporting.  That's all that is asked now.  </P> <P> The "liberal media" and the "conservative anti-abortion activists" need to  consider two things when they are speaking out. Women who find themselves in a  crisis pregnancy situation need compassion, understanding and very practical  help. And unborn babies who are in danger of being aborted also need advocates  to speak out in their defense. Unborn children are valuable and they have the  right to our compassion and protection.  </P> <P> GAIL M. HAMILTON  </P> <P> Northridge  </P></p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / At least eleven survive Airbus crash in France AT LEAST 11 people were believed to have survived after a French Airbus A320 airliner crashed last night in the Vosges mountains in eastern France. Police said that a girl, aged about two, and a member of the crew were among the survivors. Including the crew, 96 people were on board. The wreckage of the Air Inter airliner, on a domestic flight from Lyons to Strasbourg, was found four hours after it disappeared suddenly from radar screens near the village of La Bloss, 50km south of Strasbourg. The aircraft had left Lyons at 6.30pm. Air controllers said the aircraft vanished without giving a distress signal a few minutes before it was due to land at Strasbourg. Officials said the search for the wreckage - eventually located at an altitude of 500 metres south of Mount Saint Odile - was complicated by fog, snow and high winds, dense pine forests and rugged terrain. Airbus Industrie said in Toulouse that there were no immediate indications as to the cause of the crash. 'We cannot speculate on the possible cause,' said an official of a four-nation European consortium. The Airbus A320 is regarded as the most advanced civil aircraft currently in service operated by sophisticated computer systems known as 'fly by wire'. Last night's crash is the third to involve the 150-seater A320 twin-engine airliner, designed for short- or medium-range flights, and is bound to rekindle the controversy over the possible hazards of aircraft operated by highly computerised systems. The A320 has been a best seller for the European consortium, which had booked a total of 661 orders for the airliner and delivered 251 aircraft by the end of last year. But the computer systems have regularly been the subject of debate although Airbus's rivals have introduced similar systems. Airbus emphasised last night that, in the two previous fatal crashes involving A320 aircraft, the airliner, its systems and its engines had been cleared and not implicated as a cause of the accidents. In both cases pilot error was blamed. The accidents involved an Indian Airline A320 which crashed in February 1990, killing 92 people, and an Air France A320 which crashed during an air show, killing three people, in 1988. Airbus said it was sending a team of experts today to join the investigation. Investigators will try to recover the digital flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder (the so-called black boxes). Weather conditions in the Strasbourg area were reported to have been bad. An SAS McDonnell Douglas MD-80 crashed earlier this month because of de-icing problems. The crash is a blow for Airbus at a time when aircraft manufacturers are struggling for new orders from financially pressed airline customers. Airbus saw a big drop in new orders last year - to 101 aircraft from 404 in 1990, a record year for the commercial aircraft industry.</p>

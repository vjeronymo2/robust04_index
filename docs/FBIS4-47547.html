In so doing, the gene of one of the  proteins in the VP-1 virus envelope was fused with a synthetic  oligonucleotide which encodes bradykinine (brd), a short  biologically active polypeptide. In addition, the biological  activity of the resulting vector was examined on the kidney  culture of African green vervet monkeys (CV-1), which are  permissive to the SV40, using immunofluorescent T-antigen  identification, a cytopathic activity study of the recombinant,  by testing its infectious potential, and by determining the  physiological activity of bradykinine by the contractile action  of new-born rat cardiomyocytes. The findings demonstrate that  substitution of the C-terminal region of the VP-1 gene with a  bradykinine gene sequence does not upset the principal functions  of the VP-1 protein; the constructed SV40 (brd) vector is stable  and serves as the basis for forming biologically active viral  particles. The potential for using similar replacement vectors  as producers of short active polypeptides and for studying human  gene expressions is noted.

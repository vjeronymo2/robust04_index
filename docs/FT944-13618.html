			<p>941027 FT  27 OCT 94 / Moscow seeks ways to limit Arctic oil spill damage Russian officials flew to the northern region of Komi yesterday to take charge of the operation to bring under control an oil spill that environmentalists say could have a disastrous impact on the fragile Arctic environment. There is growing concern that winter snow could soon prevent any clean-up of oil slicks blanketing vast areas of tundra. 'If something has to be done, it has to be done right now,' said Ms Valentina Semyashkina, head of a conservation group for the Pechora River. Oil has spilled into a tributary of the Pechora, Europe's richest salmon river, and may reach it. She said oil leaking into the river, over 1,000km north-east of Moscow, could pour into the Barents Sea. 'This has happened before,' she said. The spillage occurred on October 1 when heavy rains caused the collapse of a reservoir containing oil that had leaked from a pipeline near the town of Usinsk. Meanwhile, doubts grew yesterday over US estimates that the spill could be one of the biggest ever. 'There are all these fairy stories about a leak of 200,000 tonnes of oil - that is what oil workers there produce in one month. It is stupid,' said Mr Nikolai Balin, head of the Komi state committee for environment. 'The most plausible figure is 14,000 tonnes.' In Norway, which closely monitors Russian oil spills, officials said there were no plans to lend assistance to the area unless requested by Moscow. 'We do not at the moment see any acute threat to the Barents Sea,' said Mr Per Antonsen, an adviser at the Norwegian environment ministry in charge of disaster co-operation with Russia. 'We are alarmed by the spill, but we have to make our priorities. This is a minor spill compared with what has occurred on the Yamal Peninsula. We have to remain calm and await further information,' he said. Norwegian officials said yesterday they had received a report from Moscow estimating that between 14,000 tonnes and 60,000 tonnes of oil had leaked from a pipeline covering an area of 68sq km. They believed that 14,000 tonnes was not enough to cover such a large area and that the scope of the oil spill was probably closer to 60,000 tonnes. One US estimate has the spill at 200,000 tonnes, but the Norwegians regard this figure as an exaggeration. Moscow told Norway yesterday that about 140 people from the Komi civil defence had been working with buckets and vacuum pipes to contain the spill, but had to abandon clean-up work because of cold weather, ice and snow. Officials in Oslo do not believe the oil will reach the Pechora river, though there are concerns about this possibility arising during the spring thaw.</p>

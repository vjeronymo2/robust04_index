He called for escalating resistance to the  Israeli occupation forces. He stressed that Israel does not  seek peace in the region and that its attempts to circumvent the  Geneva summit are continuing, sometimes by threatening to repeat  last summer's aggression and at other times by imposing  obstructionist conditions to withdrawal from south Lebanon and  implementation of Resolution 425.    For his part, Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri has called for  collective action to end the occupation. He affirmed that a  comprehensive and just peace is the means to achieve a genuine  peace and noted that any partial agreement in the name of peace  will only lead to further conflict and the shedding of innocent  people's blood.    The Amal Movement urged international legitimacy to prove  its  credibility and enforce the implementation of its resolutions,  which Israel violates daily.    The Progressive Socialist Party viewed the massacre as a  message to the Arabs and Muslims and another disgrace for  Zionism, which world public opinion acquitted of charges of  racism at the United Nations.    The National Liberal Party denounced the massacre and  expressed fear of its negative impact on the peace process.</p>

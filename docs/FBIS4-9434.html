			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/4/1994 -- Further to the  dialogue started on the first day of the Crans Montana Forum,  the plenum session of Friday, 22 April, brought together  important personalities to discuss about prospects of peace in  the Balkans. The session was chaired by the speaker of the  Romanian Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase. The presidium  included Deputy Prime minister of the Yugoslav Federal  Government Nikola Sainovic, Bosnian Foreign Minister Irfan  Ljubijankic, Croatia's First Deputy Foreign Minister Ivo  Sanader, Albanian Foreign Minister Alfred Serreqi, Russian  Deputy Speaker Mikhail Mitiukov [name as received], and  Romania's Foreign Minister Teodor Melescanu, who all presented  their countries' points of view on the situation in former  Yugoslavia.    They pointed out at the impact the Bosnian conflict is  having  on the Balkans and at some of the ways that could help settle  the crisis.    The Yugoslav Federation's viewpoint was that the policy of  pressure, ultimatum, sanctions and punishment for Serbia and  Montenegro was not only inefficient and inhuman, but even  counterproductive, with negative effects both on the Balkans and  on Europe. "There is no alternative to achieve peace, outside  negotiations, compromise and equal treatment for all the  conflicting parties." Nikola Saimovic said, and demanded the  immediate cease of hostilities on the territory of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, as the only chance to reach a compromise for  peace.    Bosnia's representative said his country wanted peace, but  would never accept the dictate. He requested Europe to wake up  and commit itself more firmly in the crisis so as to protect  Bosnia against "the imperial ambitions of great Serbia."    Recalling the recent signing in Washington of a document for  the establishment of a Croatian-Muslim confederation, Croatia's  representatives said that this enabled the settlement of a  stable peace between Bosnia and Croatia, and expressed his  country's readiness to normalize relations with the Yugoslav  side. Ivo Sanader pleaded for a new concept in the Balkans:  "Scandinavisation", as symbol of stability.    Albania's foreign minister demanded that reprisals against  Albanians in the Kosovo region be stopped and the province  placed under international guarantees "to avoid having a new  Bosnia-Herzegovina."    Russian Federation envoy Mitiukov reiterated his country's  option for a negotiated settlement of the Yugoslav issue, and  proposed an international conference be called for the purpose.    Concluding the debates, Romanian Foreign Minister Teodor  Melescanu stressed Romania's major interest that the Yugoslav  conflict were solved peacefully, and demonstrated the baleful  consequences the embargo against Yugoslavia has had on the  Romanian economy, which reports losses of some seven billion  dollars.</p>

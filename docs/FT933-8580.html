			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever Unilever's shareholders glancing quickly at yesterday's results must be wondering what the brands rumpus is all about. They have seen their shares slump by 17 per cent since Marlboro Friday. Yet in unhelpful markets, Unilever showed good sales volume gains in its first half and an encouraging 0.1 percentage point advance in operating margins to 8.8 per cent. While it is flattered by currency gains, a 21 per cent increase in sterling earnings hardly suggests a consumer goods business in secular decline. A closer inspection, though, reveals a slippage of both US and European operating margins. The difficult question is whether this is temporary or presages a more ominous trend. The current squeeze may result from one-off pressures as recession grips mainland Europe and Procter &amp; Gamble makes a splash in detergents in the US. Investors seem likely to suspend judgment until the smoke clears from the battlefield. Unilever may be able to rehabilitate itself with the market if it demonstrates more aggressive growth in emerging economies, where sales and margins continue to rise strongly. The company currently derives about 20 per cent of sales from what it calls the rest of the world. With interest cover of 14 times, Unilever is certainly in a fine position to exploit further opportunities. If investors do come round to the view that consumer goods companies have been oversold, those manufacturers with big exposures to developing markets should be among the first to gain. Along with Nestle and CPC International, Unilever would then find particular favour.</p>

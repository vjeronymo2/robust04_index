			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Beckett's vote reform move is disallowed LABOUR'S working party on electoral reform is edging closer to recommending a change in the voting system in spite of a rearguard action by Mrs Margaret Beckett. A meeting of the group disallowed an attempt by Mrs Beckett, party deputy leader, to revoke an earlier decision not to file a menu of options. It reaffirmed the view of its chairman, Lord Plant, that it must deliver a firm recommendation to the National Executive Committee when it meets next month. As Mrs Beckett, a passionate advocate of the present-first-past-the-post voting system, cannot be seen to table a minority report, the odds seem now tipped in favour of a recommendation for change. Nonetheless, the committee is still divided over what system would be appropriate, with its 16 members split into three groups. Probably the largest of these - about six or seven-strong - supports a mixed-member voting system. This would reduce the total number of constituencies from 651 to 500, but would further add 150 MPs selected by regions on the basis of candidates' performances as 'best losers' in the election. The MPs would emerge as a result of weighting the total number of MPs to reflect the parties' shares of the vote. The second grouping - somewhere between three and five-strong - supports first-past-the-post. The last group favours a supplementary vote system that ensures each MP is elected by an outright majority through a variation in the alternative vote system. The final decision of the committee, due at the end of the month, must be passed for approval to the NEC before going out to consultation in the party before the annual conference in September.</p>

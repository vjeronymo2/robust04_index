			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Cadbury Schweppes in Mexico water deal: Pounds 145m share placing planned to fund purchase CADBURY Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks maker, is buying Mexico's leading bottler and distributor of mineral water for Dollars 325m (Pounds 188m). It is one of the largest acquisitions of a Mexican business by an overseas company. To fund three-quarters of the purchase, Cadbury is raising Pounds 145m in a share placing that will expand its equity by about 5 per cent. The issue is priced at 425p a share, compared with yesterday's close of 433p, down 10p. Aguas Minerales is being bought from Fomento Economico Mexicano (Femsa), Mexico's largest beverage business. Mr Pablo Riveroll, an analyst with Baring Research in Mexico said the sale would lift a cloud hanging over Femsa since October when its shareholders, with separate regional investors, bought a controlling stake in the Bancomer bank for Dollars 2.88bn. The deal would allow them to meet a bank payment. Cadbury is buying three brands of plain and fruit-flavoured mineral water - Penafiel, Balseca and Etiqueta Azul, which are estimated to have 68 per cent of Mexico's mineral water market. The business has five bottling plants with wells and last year made a pre-tax profit of 68.2bn pesos (Pounds 13m) on sales of 388.4bn pesos. Mr Frank Swan, managing director for beverages, said Mexico was the world's second largest market for carbonated soft drinks. Each inhabitant consumed an average of 130 litres a year, 50 litres behind the US but ahead of most other countries. Aguas Minerales' sales volume was 423m litres, larger than the group's businesses in France, Spain or Australia. Turnover was about 40 per cent of what it might be elsewhere because of the refillable bottle system. The market was expanding at 9 per cent a year. Cadbury is buying Aguas Minerales at 26 times after-tax profit in 1991, but estimates that the multiple will fall to 17 this year. Earnings dilution is expected to be marginal this year and just over 1 per cent next year because of the tax impact. Mr David Jinks, finance director, said the effect on the balance sheet of finding the remaining Pounds 42.9m purchase sum, the share placing and a Pounds 100m goodwill write-off would be to raise gearing from 39 per cent to 42 per cent. Over the year, net debt was expected to rise from Pounds 333m to about Pounds 440m, including other acquisition spending. Lex, Page 24</p>

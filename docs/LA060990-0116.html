			<p><P> June 9, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GATHERS' DEATH BRINGS FORTH SECOND SUIT;  </P> <P> AFTERMATH: MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR SUIT FILED ON BEHALF OF GATHERS' SON AND ESTATE.  IT WILL PROBABLY BE COMBINED WITH ORIGINAL SUIT.  </P> <P> Attorneys representing the son and estate of Hank Gathers filed a  multimillion-dollar suit Friday, claiming that the former basketball star died  because of negligence by doctors and Loyola Marymount officials who conspired  by concealing medical information to ensure Gathers would continue playing for  the school.  </P> <P> Gathers, a Loyola Marymount basketball player, collapsed March 4 at Gersten  Pavilion while playing in a West Coast Conference tournament game, and was  pronounced dead 1 hour 40 minutes later at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital. An  autopsy determined the cause of death to be cardiomyopathy, a heart disorder.  </P> <P> The 36-page complaint, filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court, names 14  defendants and cites three counts on behalf of Gathers' estate and four counts  on behalf of Aaron Crump, Gathers' 6-year-old son who lives in Philadelphia  with his mother, Marva Crump.  </P> <P> The complaint, which does not list a monetary figure, was filed by Los Angeles  probate attorney Ken Wolf and Philadelphia attorneys Martin Krimsky and Adrian  Moody. Krimsky, who is the court-appointed administrator of the estate, and  Michael Horsey, Aaron's guardian and a family adviser to Marva Crump, are the  plaintiffs.  </P> <P> "You don't have to put a dollar amount in a complaint to make it look  expensive, it's what you prove at trial," Wolf said. "We know, though, that we  are asking more than a million dollars by just looking at the wrongful death  claim from the estate's standpoint, as well as the other claims. How high is  high?"  </P> <P> The 14 defendants in the suit are Loyola Marymount University and four Loyola  employees -- Athletic Director Brian Quinn, Coach Paul Westhead, trainer Chip  Schaefer and Dr. Dan Hyslop of the university's health services.  </P> <P> Doctors named are Michael Mellman and his company, Mellman and Moe;  cardiologists Vernon Hattori and Charles Swerdlow and their company, Apex  Cardiology Consultants; Ralph Gambardella, Clarence Shields and Benjamin  Schaeffer, all Loyola team physicians supplied by the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic  Clinic, which was also named.  </P> <P> This is the second suit in the aftermath of Gathers death against these same  defendants. On April 20, a $32.5-million suit was filed by Beverly Hills  attorney Bruce Fagel on behalf of Gathers' mother, Lucille, brothers Derrick  and Charles, and an aunt, Carol Livingston. Wolf said a motion will be filed  shortly to consolidate the two suits.  </P> <P> Westhead has previously denied all allegations against him. Loyola attorney  Martin L. Burke also said previously that the "University and its members will  be fully vindicated."  </P> <P> One of the counts -- charging negligence by all defendants -- asks the estate  be paid $1 million for a Lloyd's of London policy in the same amount Gathers  bought his junior year in college. The policy, which would have paid Gathers if  he had suffered a medical condition that prevented him from playing competitive  basketball, did not include death benefits.  </P> <P> "If Hank would have been properly advised of his condition and properly  treated, he would not have played basketball," Krimsky said from Philadelphia.  "And if he would have been given the proper treatment courtside, he would have  survived and been able to collect."  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Wolf said settlement negotiations continue between attorneys for  both sides.  </P></p>

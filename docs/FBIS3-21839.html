			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Panama City, 4 Mar (ACAN-EFE) -- Today, Panamanian  President Guillermo Endara revealed that drug operations are  coordinated with the United States, Spain, Colombia, and Central  American countries to prevent drug traffickers from "filtering  their dirty money" into Panama's political and economic sectors.  "I handle a great deal of confidential information on this  issue. We have arrested several drug traffickers and we have  found out the money is moved immediately," Endara told ACAN-EFE  during an interview held in his office. The Panamanian  president, who chose not to reveal specific, coordinated cases  of drug operations, emphasized there is "very extensive"  cooperation with the United States, Spain, Colombia, Costa Rica,  Nicaragua, Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala.    Endara said cases in which drug traffickers have been  arrested, released, and allowed to leave the country have  occurred many times and cannot be considered isolated events.  "All of a sudden, we find the drug trafficker is set free and  allowed to leave the country. It is a worldwide known fact that  the drug business pays a lot of bribes (illegal money  commissions)," explained the president regarding the mysterious  releases. Endara said he has held meetings with Supreme Court  justices and personnel from the Attorney General's Office to get  them to adopt measures aimed at preventing such events from  occurring again.    The president, however, emphasized that it is necessary to  improve the current law on drug trafficking activities. He  insisted on the need to approve the draft bill he had sent to  the Attorney General's Office, which the parliament  "significantly" improved. The new antidrug draft bill introduces  the figure of a secret agent, which is not included in the  current law.    Endara said it is "absurd" that the same penalties that  imposed on drug traffickers be applied to a secret agent if  arrested by the police. He added that agents that infiltrate  receive the same penalties as drug traffickers who deliver or  receive drugs. If a secret agent is sent to jail, "we move  heaven and earth" to get him released. Nobody, however, wants  to be a secret agent if there are no laws to protect him, the  president indicated.    Last Tuesday, during the inauguration of the parliament's  last period of sessions, Endara said Panama is being threatened  by drug trafficking activities, drug use, and money laundering.  He also asked deputies to combat drug trafficking activities  and their effects on the country's economic, social, and  political life. He called on the deputies to approve the new  law so as to be able to fight this "imported scourge" more  efficiently.</p>

			<p>931016 FT  16 OCT 93 / Clinton blockades Haiti to back UN sanctions: Troops on standby to protect Americans on island PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday ordered a naval blockade of Haiti to enforce renewed United Nations sanctions due to take effect on Monday and placed on standby an 'enhanced' infantry company at the Guantanamo base in nearby Cuba. He also revoked the US visas and froze the US financial assets of all those identified as preventing the agreed return of Fr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the ousted president. The naval task force of six warships - the first was to be on station last night and the rest today - is under orders to intercept any commercial shipping suspected of trying to break the oil and arms embargo. Acting in advance of an expected UN Security Council resolution authorising 'military power' to enforce the embargo, Mr Clinton advised merchant ships to give the destroyers 'a very wide berth'. Mr Clinton had hinted on Thursday he might impose a naval cordon, an action rendered more probable by the murder later in the day of the justice minister in the interim government in Port-au-Prince. Yesterday he conceded it was a 'blockade' - if not in the full legal meaning of the word, in 'common sense parlance'. Asked if the infantry force might be used to evacuate the 1,000 Americans now in Haiti, Mr Clinton replied he wanted the troops 'in a position to deal with any contingencies that might arise'. 'There are important American interests at stake in Haiti,' he said, including the safety of Americans and the promotion of democracy. The naval deployment bears some resemblance to the Cuban missile blockade of 1962 ordered by President John Kennedy. Yesterday Congressman Joseph Kennedy, JFK's nephew and close to Fr Aristide, was among several to demand action. In Port-au-Prince, UN special envoy Dante Caputo said most of the UN civilian mission to monitor human rights would leave for the Dominican Republic last night and today. Two pro-military groups demanded that all white foreigners immediately leave the country, independent local radio reported. Torn in the USA, Page 9</p>

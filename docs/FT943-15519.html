			<p>940708 FT  08 JUL 94 / International Company News: Nippon Shinpan plans to sell securitised loans Nippon Shinpan, the consumer credit company, plans to sell securitised loans in the form of bonds as early as August, an official said, Reuter reports from Tokyo. It is the first such sale by a Japanese firm. The company is planning to issue Y20bn to Y30bn (Dollars 204m-Dollars 306m) in eurobonds backed by its automobile loans through a special-purpose company. Goldman Sachs will lead manage the bonds. The government has allowed Japanese loans through credit cards and leases to be sold on a retail basis since June last year, but had prohibited them from being securitised. Japan's Ministry of Finance and Ministry of International Trade and Industry permitted Nippon Shinpan's asset-backed securities on condition that they be sold to overseas investors, the company said. The company said it was taking this step in order to vary its means of fund-raising. Nippon Shinpan added that it also planned to securitise parts of its credit-card loan and leasing asset portfolios.</p>

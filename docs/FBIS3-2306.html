			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter You Xiayin (3266 1115 5419): "Beijing Scholars </F> Expose the Essence of the `Direct Democratic Elections'  Introduced by the British in Hong Kong"]    [Text] Beijing, 5 Mar (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--After the  Chinese Foreign Ministry released the document on the facts of  the Sino- British talks on the 1994/95 electoral arrangements  for Hong Kong, some Beijing scholars have commented on the  British side's attempts to undermine the talks. They have  pointed out that the introduction of a British-type "democratic"  election system is disadvantageous to Hong Kong.    Qiu Liben, an associate research fellow at the World History  Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,  said: Whenever Britain was about to withdraw from a colony, it  tried to change the system in which the executive branch  dominates the legislative branch, under the camouflage of  democracy. The British typically would foster and manipulate  forces within the legislative council, vigorously introduce  "democratic" elections, and thus sow the seeds of turmoil. If  the outcome of the elections did not conform with British  interests, they would wipe it out. This type of hypocritical  democratic "direct elections" must be exposed immediately.    Professor Liu Wenzong of the International Law Research  Center of the Institute of Diplomacy, pointed out even more  bluntly: By introducing overall direct elections in Hong Kong,  the British side actually intends to launch a series of  "reforms" to confront the Basic Law and thus create chaos.  Chris Patten once revealed: "The executive branch must be made  accountable to the legislative organ around 1997." In a "report  by missions to Hong Kong" written in 1991, the British side said  that it is necessary to have the chief executive directly  elected by the public, and suggested that the chief executive be  accountable to the legislative organ of the special  administrative region rather than to the Chinese Government.  These remarks and views have all exposed the British side's  intention of disrupting the stable transition process in Hong  Kong.    Zhang Shunhong of the World History Research Institute of  the  Academy of Social Sciences maintained that Britain's ultimate  purpose in "bestowing" its "democratic system" on its colonies  is to facilitate its infiltration and safeguard its economic  privileges and interests.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Radical proposal for loans Further radical changes in the government's loan guarantee scheme are needed if it is to be of maximum benefit to businesses recovering from the recession. This suggestion is made in a new study* by the Small Business Bureau, a Conservative party lobby group. The report comes within weeks of changes intended to make the scheme more useful. The scheme provides a government guarantee on loans to viable businesses that lack either a track record or security. On July 1 the government increased the maximum loan from Pounds 100,000 to Pounds 250,000 and the guarantee from 70 to 85 per cent. The bureau suggests: Make the scheme available to larger businesses. The recent increase in the maximum size of the loan was not accompanied by an increase in the size of eligible businesses. Simplify the complex eligibility rules. At present manufacturing companies must have a turnover of less than Pounds 3m, construction companies must have fewer than 25 employees and road transport companies must have fewer than five vehicles. The bureau wants a two-tier scheme. Loans up to Pounds 100,000 would be available to businesses less than two years old with up to 50 employees and sales of Pounds 3m. Loans of up to Pounds 250,000 would be available to businesses of any age that have up to 125 employees and Pounds 7.5m of sales. Publish a more helpful explanatory booklet. The present booklet makes qualifying for a loan appear too easy while a separate supplement, not always provided with the booklet, sets out the numerous restrictions. Start a debate about the possibility of requiring borrowers to show either that they have business experience or that they have had training. * Enhanced Loan Guarantee Scheme Report.

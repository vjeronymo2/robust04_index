			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: RWE expects to increase dividend RWE, the industrial conglo-merate built around Germany's largest electricity generator, expects to pay a higher dividend this year, in spite of heavier losses in its waste disposal division. Mr Friedhelm Gieske, chief executive, forecast a profit for the year ending June, comparable to last year's DM881m (Dollars 512m) - but promised a higher dividend on the basis of more favourable tax allowances. Both the oil and chemicals division, and RWE Energie, the electricity generator, will make bigger contributions to the outcome, with the buoyant construction division maintaining its position. Two US investments - the Consol mining group, hit by a seven-month strike, and NuKEM, its waste disposal operation - are the main loss-makers in the group so far this year, Mr Gieske said. On the other hand, improved results in east Germany, with rising petrol sales for RWE-DEA and expanding construction activity, helped two important arms of the company to better results. The mining and raw materials division, centred on Rheinbraun, Germany's biggest producer of brown coal for power generation, saw a drop in turnover of 13.6 per cent, without taking acquisitions into account. Mr Gieske said the losses at Consol reached Dollars 42m as a result of the miners' strike, leaving RWE to carry its DM36m share of that amount. However, he promised much more favourable prospects for the US interest in 1994, with Consol strengthening its position in the low-sulphur coal market with the purchase of Island Creek. Waste disposal, an area into which RWE has expanded rapidly in recent years, saw operating losses of Dollars 96m at NuKEM, where a big restructuring programme has been carried out. Mr Gieske said the entire amount had been provided for in the company accounts up to December 31. Overall group turnover increased by 3.4 per cent up to the end of March, although the growth excluding acquisitions was only 0.9 per cent. Electricity consumption stabilised at a growth rate of 0.3 per cent, after 18 months of decline in line with the German recession. However, RWE Energie was the main beneficiary from improved depreciation allowances introduced by the German government to increase corporate competitiveness. In particular, RWE has been able to write off a large portion of the cost of its big environmental programme to reduce emissions from power stations.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "The Socialists at Their Lowest Point </F> Since 1982"]    [Text] The PSOE [Spanish Socialist Workers Party] is at its  lowest ebb right now. Never before have the findings of opinion  polls been so negative for the ruling party. According to the  data in this "Winter Barometer," for the first time since it  came to power in 1982 the PSOE is not the number one choice of  Spanish voters, as the PP [People's Party] is almost two points  ahead of it. The economic crisis, moreover, has severely torn  the social fabric: One of every two respondents says that  someone with whom he associates daily is unemployed or looking  for a first job. These are the main findings of the poll that  Demoscopia conducted for EL PAIS.    Sixty-two percent of Spaniards describe our country's  political situation as "poor or very poor"; this is a record  number, quadrupling, for example, the December 1988 figure. The  disillusionment with the first few months of the new government,  which the "Autumn Barometer" had already detected, has mounted  over the past three months. Thus, for the first time since 1982  the PSOE is not the party that respondents mentioned most often  when asked for whom they would vote if elections were held now.  Direct voter preference are now more favorable to the PP (22.6  percent versus 20.8 percent for the PSOE); this has no precedent  over the past decade. We are not, to be sure, in an election  campaign, and as a consequence these numbers are a reflection  more of the prevailing state of opinion in society at large than  of clear-cut voter leanings. But this in no way diminishes the  poll's significance as an assessment of the political climate in  Spain. There has been a clear decline in spontaneous voter  identification with the ruling party. In just three months  (October-December) it has seen its explicit support drop by  one-fourth, from 28.3 percent in October to 20.8 percent today.  Significantly, 23 percent of Spaniards under the age of 25 say  that if elections were held today, they would vote for the PP,  while only 13 percent say they would vote for the PSOE. In  contrast, the opposite is the case among the oldest age group  (those over 65), 33 percent of whom say that they would vote for  the PSOE, while 20 percent would choose the PP.    United Left (IU) has also posted an appreciable decline in  explicit voter preference, from 9.9 percent in October to 7.4  percent now. CiU [Convergence and Union], for its part, has  dropped from 3.7 percent in October to 2.9 percent today.    It bears emphasizing, in any event, that there has been a  noteworthy increase in the percentage of people who decline to  answer the question or say they would not vote. They now account  for 37.1 percent, compared to 28.5 percent in October and 22.2  percent in July (this matches the actual voter absenteeism at  the 6 June elections). The electorate has thus once again lost  its enthusiasm, but this pullback cannot be seen in all parties  alike. The explicit voter preference for the PSOE has undergone  the most obvious decline.    The evaluation of the current government's performance so  far  has worsened from just 4.4 (on a scale of 1 to 10) in October to  3.9 today. The drop in the government's overall marks is due  mainly to the more critical attitude among Socialist voters, who  gave it a 5.5 now as opposed to a 6.2 in October. The mark that  the government gets for dealing with the economic crisis and  unemployment is even worse: 3.5 on the average.    The assessment of the main political leaders reflects this  overall climate of opinion. Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister  and leader of the ruling party, got his lowest grade ever: 4.6.  Jose Maria Aznar is up three-tenths of a percent from October to  an average mark of 4.1, eight-tenths below his all-time high of  4.9 in December 1989.    Just 7 percent of the respondents want the current Socialist  government to remain unchanged under present economic and social  conditions in Spain. A massive 80 percent, in contrast, want  changes in the Executive Branch; 27 percent lean towards the  status quo in the current cabinet but with a new economic  policy; 35 percent recommend various prescriptions for coalition  governments, and 18 percent call for new elections. In any  event, the current erosion of support for the PSOE does not seem  to be offset by a clearly perceived alternative, as just 20  percent feel that a People's Party government would do a better  job.

This is  the highest percentage ever, surpassing the previous record of  72 percent posted last fall.    Yet the pessimism about the economy seems to be bottoming  out, as the percentage of people saying that their household's  own economic situation is worsening is mostly unchanged. There  has even been a slight increase in the number of people who  think that the overall economic situation will improve, and  pessimism about future joblessness has leveled out.    In any event, the major impact of the economic crisis on  Spain's social fabric in recent years can scarcely be  underestimated. We cannot forget that according to the findings  of the poll, one out of every two households (47 percent) has a  member who is unemployed or looking for a first job.    In Andalusia the percentage rises to 61.    Some 72 percent of the respondents also say that they have  close friends or relatives not living with them who are out of  work or looking for a first job. Job insecurity has reached  striking levels, as one quarter of the respondents say that they  are very afraid that they or a member of their family who lives  with them could lose their present job in the months to come.    An additional 35 percent say they are "somewhat afraid" in  this regard. Only 36 percent of Spaniards, in contrast, feel  safe about their jobs in the immediate future. Eighty percent  also think that the people around them who are unemployed or  looking for their first job have little or no chance of finding  work in the short run.    Some 42 percent of the respondents say that they have had to  change their buying habits for financial reasons: 35 percent of  the upper or upper-middle class, 47 percent of the middle class,  and 41 percent of the lower-middle or lower class.    Seven out of every 10 Spaniards feel that 1993 has been a  bad  year, but those who think that 1994 will be better are somewhat  more numerous than those who think it will be worse (36 to 24  percent). Moreover, one out of every two Spaniards says that he  is preparing to meet the new year with confidence, while a third  say they are fearful.    These percentages, which clearly reflect more pessimism than  six or seven years ago (back then, 70 percent of Spaniards said  they were confident about the new year), are slightly more  encouraging than a year ago. Spaniards still regard the economic  situation as very serious but seem to be seeing some light at  the end of the tunnel.    As for reform of the job market, an overwhelming majority of  Spaniards consider it necessary, but an equally clear-cut  majority feel that the reform the government is trying to  implement has been poorly explained to the public and poorly  negotiated with the unions.    The so-called allocation of work (fewer hours on the job,  with the resulting cut in pay, to boost the employment level) is  viewed positively by 46 percent of the Spaniards and negatively  by 43 percent. In other words, opinion is sharply divided on  this issue in our country, in clear contrast to public sentiment  in other countries of the European Union (for example, as EL  PAIS reported on 14 December 1993, 71 percent of the Danes favor  allocation of work).

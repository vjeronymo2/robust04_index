			<p>BFN     [Text] ANC Member of Parliament Carl Niehaus says a truth  commission should be set up to disclose, as he put it, all  misdeeds and crimes committed during the apartheid era. Mr.  Niehaus said in Parliament that this was necessary to complete  the process of reconciliation and forgiveness. However, he  emphasized that it should not be translated into a process  similar to that used in the Nuremberg trials. Mr. Justice  Richard Goldstone, also speaking in Cape Town, called for the  establishment of a truth commission on apartheid atrocities  because, as he put it, the victims would not be able to forgive  without openness. He said multiple prosecutions had to be  avoided and that it was essential to expose the past as part of  the process of healing.</p>

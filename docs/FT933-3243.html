			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / World Trade News: Brittan in Uruguay Round plea SIR Leon Brittan, EC commissioner in charge of trade, said yesterday Europe and the US would lose all credibility with other Gatt members if they could not reach agreement and conclude the Uruguay Round by the December 15 deadline. 'We have sufficient will and sufficient determination to proceed,' he said, adding that the US had consulted widely with its trading partners before fixing the deadline with Congress. This refuted a French suggestion that the US had imposed the December 15 deadline on the rest of the world and must therefore be held responsible if the round cannot be completed by that date. Speaking at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast, On the Gatt, he suggested that the US-EC Blair House deal could not be approved until there was agreement on agricultural issues in the Uruguay Round as a whole. Sir Leon brushed aside the question of whether French objections over the US-EC Blair House deal on agriculture will be allowed to sink the Round well before the final leg of the negotiations proceeds. He said EC members could not formally agree to any part of Blair House until they have a comprehensive package on agricultural issues through the Uruguay Round. 'It is part of an ongoing process and at the end of the day nobody is asked to take a position until a whole deal is available. 'In setting (the deadline) the US consulted widely with the international community; we if anything argued for a slightly shorter deadline,' he said. He warned Americans that the US offer of tariff reduction proposals on apparel and clothing was insufficient. Japan and the newly industrialised countries must also improve their offers on financial services and agriculture and cut tariffs in sectors such as shoes and leather goods.</p>

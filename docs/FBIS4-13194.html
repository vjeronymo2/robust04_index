			<p>BFN     [Text] No progress was made in the Cairo talks today, our  correspondent Moti Amir reports. The Palestinians presented a  detailed working paper on water matters, and Israeli experts  will go to Cairo tonight to study it. Differences surfaced in  the subcommittee on communications and following the  intervention of the delegation heads, the Palestinians withdrew  their demand to reopen issues already agreed upon two months ago.    Muhammad Dahlan told our correspondent that six deportees  would arrive in the Gaza Strip tomorrow, and another 10 on  Friday. He noted that there has still not been any progress on  the release of Palestinian detainees. He said Israel now agrees  to release only 4,000 detainees although last week it agreed to  free 5,000. The PLO is demanding the release of 8,300  detainees, including Hamas activists.</p>

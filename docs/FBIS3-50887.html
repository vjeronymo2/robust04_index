			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Mexico City, 8 Jan (EFE) -- Mexican newspapers today  reported that the Zapatist National Liberation Army [EZLN] is  using more than 100 people as "human shields," including former  Chiapas Governor Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, whom it is  holding hostage in the hamlet of Guadalupe Tepeyac.    Reporters from the Mexican newspaper ULTIMAS NOTICIAS said  EZLN members are using their hostages as shields in case the  Mexican Army stages an attack to end the Zapatists' violent  actions. Journalists were able to enter Guadalupe Tepeyac, where  some 60 families live and which is located approximately 800  meters from the border with Guatemala in the middle of the  Lacandona jungle.    The newspaper reported that the more than 100 hostages,  mostly doctors and nurses, are in the hamlet's Social Security  clinic. The doctors and nurses issued a public letter in which  they state they "have not suffered any harm" and that they were  taken hostage on 31 December -- one day before the beginning of  the armed rebellion which, according to unofficial Mexican  sources, has killed 200 people.</p>

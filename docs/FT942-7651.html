			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Poland may revise bank disposal programme Mr Grzegorz Kolodko, Poland's new finance minister, has suggested that the government's bank disposals programme could be revised. 'The first question which we will be answering by the end of next month will be whether we consolidate the state-owned banks or privatise them,' he said in a newspaper interview. The finance ministry has been planning to sell several more state-owned banks, including the Krakow-based Bank Przemyslowo Handlowy (BPH) which was due for privatisation by the middle of this year. It then planned to consider merging the remaining state banks, either with those already privatised or with each other, before privatisation. Mr Kolodko suggested the BPH, one of Poland's largest banks, could be merged with others before being offered for sale. Meanwhile, Mr Janusz Quandt, head of the BPH, is pressing for the bank to be privatised through a share sale to investors. This would avoid the need for a strategic investor as recommended by CS First Boston, which has been advising on the disposal. So far, two banks have been sold: the Poznan-based Wielkopolski Bank Kredytowy, in which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has a 28.5 per cent share; and Bank Slaski, where ING of the Netherlands owns 25.9 per cent of the equity. The state-owned Bank Gdansk is thought to be next in line for privatisation after the BPH. Mr Kolodko also suggested that PZU, the state-owned insurer which controls half of the country's insurance market and reported a 325bn zloty (Dollars 9.6m) net profit last year, should be broken up. This goes against the views of Mr Roman Fulneczek, chairman, who says PZU should be kept together and privatised through the sale of shares to local investors, management and employees.</p>

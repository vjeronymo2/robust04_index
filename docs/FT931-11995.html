			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / Leading Article: The committee and the colliers GIVEN THAT it only had 90 days to complete its work, the select committee's report on the coal industry is a thorough enough analysis of a tortuous subject. Possibly more important, it strives to be free of political bias, which means that Mr Michael Heseltine will be obliged to take it seriously as he formulates his own proposals for next month's White Paper. That is a pity, because the package of subsidies and other regulatory measures which the MPs propose is greatly in excess of what is required to bring sense to the UK energy scene. If fully implemented they would add to the thick layers of aid and protection which have been granted over the years. Who can believe yet another promise that one last heave will get a state-owned British Coal up on its commercial feet? A simple example illustrates this: the report not only recommends a five-year subsidy programme costing up to Pounds 500m to enable British-mined coal to compete with imports. It also suggests that electricity distribution companies be obliged to buy power generated from domestic coal on pain of losing their licence. If the proposed level of subsidy is sufficient to make British coal competitive, why this second measure? Answer: because no-one really believes the figures. Other adjustments The report's 39 recommendations reveal unwillingness to face the facts that stared the government in the face when it proposed to cut coal last autumn. Tinkering with one part of the energy market merely creates a need for compensating adjustments all down the line. There is also a worrisome proposal that the electricity industry regulator should have the power 'to consider the legitimate long-term interests of indigenous fuel producers' - another open invitation to allow producers to inflict higher than necessary costs upon UK industry and consumers. All this suggests that while the overt subsidy may amount to Pounds 500m (a relatively small figure compared with many that have been mentioned), the hidden costs in perpetuating the present arrangements will be much higher. It is disingenuous of the committee to claim that the cost can be borne by redirecting the proceeds of the levy which subsidises the nuclear industry. This device would only throw nuclear's costs on to the Treasury and thus the taxpayer. Since, however, the political realities make subsidy inevitable there is some comfort to be drawn from the committee's desire at least to limit financial support for British Coal in size as well as time. The continuation of subsidies would be linked to progress in cost-cutting - though the report does not spell out how this would work, nor what would happen if British Coal fell behind its targets. Sense of realism The committee has also wisely resisted the temptation to cut back the natural gas industry, having failed to discover decisive evidence in the arguments of the coal lobby that gas is much costlier than coal. In addition, it has left the capacity of the nuclear power industry untouched, believing that the nuclear review which the government has already promised should be allowed to run its course, albeit next year rather than in 1994. There is also realism in the committee's refusal to recommend barriers against imports, though it does nurse hopes that government can do something to reverse the flow of electricity from France through the Channel link. This sits ill with the leading role that Britain is playing in trying to open up and liberalise the EC's single market in energy. The political importance of the report is that it tells Mr Heseltine the number of jobs and pits the House of Commons expects him to save. He should counter this offer with a proposal for wholly transparent subsidies, a tighter timetable, and as few as possible ancillary controls. He should also pick up the committee's anxieties about the duopolistic tendencies of PowerGen and National Power, which resulted from a flawed privatisation and which will in the end need to be countered either by firmer regulation or break-up. But above all, Mr Heseltine should announce that British Coal will join the private sector and be subsidy-free by the next election in 1996-97.</p>

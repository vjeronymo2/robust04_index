			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): US equities soar as urban violence wanes Wall Street US STOCKS soared to record levels yesterday as Wall Street reacted with relief to signs that urban violence appeared to be waning, writes Karen Zagor in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was 42.04 higher at 3378.13, above its previous record close of 3,366.50 on April 16, but the volume of just under 175m shares was not enough to signify a meaningful rally. Advancing issues led, declining by 1119 to 611. Among other market indices, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 gained 4.38 to 416.91 and the Nasdaq composite added 5.40 to 583.54. On Friday, the Dow fell 23.03 to 3336.09. The main factor behind the gains appeared to be relief that the weekend had not brought the feared violence in New York and other large US cities. Big board trading was dominated by blue chip stocks. IBM climbed Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 92 1/2 , Ford Motor added Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 45 and Boeing fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 . A number of pharmaceutical company stocks saw active trading, including Glaxo's American depository receipts, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 26 5/8 and Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dollars 1 7/8 higher at Dollars 76 1/2 . Pfizer, which agreed to sell its Coty cosmetics and fragrances business to Benckiser of Germany for Dollars 440m, rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 72 1/8 . Stronger-than-expected first-quarter earnings from Bally Manufacturing, the casino-hotel and fitness centre owner, contributed to a 25 cents improvement in the issue to Dollars 5 7/8 . Bally turned in first-quarter profits from continuing operations of 8 cents a share against a loss of 33 cents a year earlier. Lincoln National, the seventh biggest publicly-held US insurance holding company, rose Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 54 1/8 following first-quarter earnings of Dollars 101.3m or Dollars 2.19 a share against Dollars 39.3m or 89 cents in the 1991 first quarter. The improved profits came in spite of a decline in revenue to Dollars 1.92bn from Dollars 2.13bn. Napa Valley Bancorp was one of the biggest losers on the American Stock Exchange. The issue tumbled Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 9 1/2 after the northern California-based bank said its board had ended talks with other financial institutions about a possible business combination. In the insurance sector, General Re reversed its losses after plunging Dollars 8 7/8 in two days. Shares in the biggest US reinsurance group closed Dollars 1 5/8 higher at Dollars 80 1/4 . Other insurance stocks also rose, Aetna Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 42 and Travelers Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20 7/8 . Cigna, which reported its first-quarter results after the close of trading, added Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 51 3/4 . In the secondary market, technology stocks continued to lead trading. Seagate Technology firmed Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 16, Apple Computer rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 60 1/2 and Microsoft added Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 114. Canada TORONTO STOCK prices closed little changed, in light trading influenced by holidays in London and Tokyo. According to preliminary figures, the 300 composite index gained 6.48 points to close at 3363.54. Advancing issues outnumbed declines 273 to 258. Seven of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by conglomerates, up 0.7 per cent. The real estate sector had the day's biggest decline at 1.1 per cent.</p>

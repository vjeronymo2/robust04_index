			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / World Stock Markets: Hong Kong posts year's best rise Continued strong liquidity in a market rapidly becoming short of stock combined with technical factors to keep Hong Kong firmly on the upward escalator last week, recording the sharpest five-day advance for any market this year. Miss Sara Dodd of HG Asia sees liquidity as the key to Hong Kong's 10 per cent rise last week, which took the cumulative gain over the last 12 months to more than 98 per cent as measured by the FT-Actuaries World indices in local currency terms. Miss Dodd believes that political developments are having little affect on the market's direction, noting that further strong demand has been evident from the US and that there have been reports of some large purchases from Japan. There have been stories, too, that local Hong Kong-Chinese investors have come to the conclusion that their earlier hopes of an easier market were little more than wishful thinking. James Capel notes that the market became increasingly technical, with futures trading reflecting options hedging. Capel believes that, in its present mood, the market could rise from the present 10,248 to 12,000, although because of the technical nature of trading it could also fall back from that level very quickly. European markets produced a largely lacklustre performance, although Italy was an exception as the second round of local elections provided no unpleasant surprises and parliamentary passage of the budget looked to be back on track. In a review of the Italian market, Mr Oliver Kamm and Mr William Cowan of James Capel note that the final results of the local elections make the PDS the leading party in Italy and that, as such, it has to be taken seriously as a potential partner in any future government. However, they believe the market has already discounted a worst case scenario of intensifying political instability. They add that while the equity market has been depressed since August because of investor perceptions about political risk, as well as concern about the volume of rights issues and forthcoming privatisations, fundamental macroeconomic prospects are favourable over the next 12 months. The team says that following its sharp decline since August, the market offers reasonable rather than compelling valuations, trading on a multiple of 26 times 1993 earnings and 22 times for 1994.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               % change                                                   % change    in US                 % change in local currency**     sterling**   Dollars**              1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year   Start of   Start of    Start of                                          1993       1993       1993  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria       +1.19   +5.85   +40.88   +36.62     +31.55     +29.89 Belgium       +0.81   +4.72   +29.36   +29.11     +22.29     +20.75 Denmark       +1.35   -0.25   +34.48   +37.54     +31.48     +29.83 Finland       +0.46   -0.53   +83.39   +92.89     +79.33     +77.10 France        +0.85   +4.78   +27.99   +23.09     +18.39     +16.90 Germany       +1.69   +6.46   +42.68   +39.00     +34.18     +32.50 Ireland       +0.02   +0.82   +61.25   +51.08     +33.81     +32.13 Italy         +6.45   +6.93   +47.58   +38.49     +23.38     +21.83 Netherlands   +0.50   +3.09   +35.75   +35.21     +30.95     +29.30 Norway        +0.57   -2.02   +21.67   +33.34     +26.70     +25.11 Spain         +1.16   +2.11   +44.61   +43.56     +19.95     +18.45 Sweden        +1.06   -3.86   +35.88   +33.24     +14.56     +13.13 Switzerland   +1.27   +4.74   +45.42   +38.58     +41.21     +39.43 UK            +0.79   +5.17   +21.45   +15.96     +15.96     +14.50 EUROPE        +1.21   +4.60   +31.34   +26.71     +22.89     +21.35 Australia     +1.67   +0.58   +34.29   +29.69     +28.03     +26.42 Hong Kong    +10.01   +6.64   +98.29   +88.31     +91.16     +88.75 Japan         -0.20   -6.89   +10.44   +12.26     +30.03     +28.40 Malaysia      +6.42   +8.71   +96.07   +96.21    +103.69    +101.13 New Zealand   -0.31   +4.18   +41.62   +38.77     +51.81     +49.90 Singapore     +5.01   +7.34   +63.68   +54.29     +60.45     +58.44 Canada        +0.87   +0.30   +23.26   +21.40     +17.63     +16.14 USA           -0.17   -0.36    +6.50    +6.11      +7.46      +6.11 Mexico        +6.15  +17.91   +36.68   +34.68     +36.72     +35.01 South Africa  +5.86   +9.81   +44.16   +45.90     +62.66     +60.61 WORLD INDEX   +0.63   -0.53   +16.40   +15.48     +20.29     +18.79  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on December 10th 1993.

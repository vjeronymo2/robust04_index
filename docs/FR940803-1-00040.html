			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Small Gas Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Although lack of sufficient training has been a factor contributing to accidents on both large and small pipeline systems, OPS, the advisory committees (below) and state pipeline safety inspectors recognize that there is a particular need to improve the knowledge and skills of personnel in some of the small gas distribution systems. Personnel with some deficiencies include not only the operator and operator personnel, but also contractors working for small gas distribution systems. Small gas distribution systems are characterized in this proposal as distribution systems serving fewer than 10,000 customers. They include petroleum gas systems (covered by &sect;192.11) and master meter systems (defined in &sect;191.3), both of which usually serve mobile home parks, housing projects, and apartment complexes; and public, private, and municipal distribution systems. Industry sources estimate that there are about 1,000 petroleum gas systems covered by &sect;192.11, that serve 10 or more customers. Additionally, information in the OPS enforcement data base shows there are 52,000 master meter systems and 1,150 other small public, private, and municipal distribution systems. The lack of qualified personnel working on these small gas distribution systems looms as a potential threat to gas pipeline safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On March 23, 1987, OPS published an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) titled, ``Pipeline Operator Qualifications,'' requesting public comment on the need for additional regulations or a certification/licensing program regarding the qualification of personnel who design, construct, operate, or maintain gas or hazardous liquid pipelines (Docket PS&hyph;94, Notice 1; 52 FR 9189). The ANPRM outlined RSPA's existing regulations requiring the qualification or training of personnel in certain aspects of pipeline safety, such as welding steel pipe, corrosion control, and joining plastic pipe. In addition, the ANPRM discussed RSPA and state efforts to train operator personnel in understanding the pipeline safety regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Comments were received from 134 persons representing various gas and liquid pipeline operators, governmental agencies, and other interested parties. Of the 116 persons who commented on the competency level of operator personnel, approximately 75 percent felt that a lack of competent personnel did not pose a significant enough threat to public safety to warrant further governmental action. However, a minority of about 22 percent felt some attention should be given to small gas distribution systems. Of the 60 persons who commented on the question of whether governmental action, if taken, should apply industry-wide or be limited to small systems, approximately 62 percent favored the latter. Of the 34 persons expressing an opinion on the appropriate governmental action, about 53 percent favored increasing direct training and the preparation of guidance material for operator personnel. The remainder were almost evenly divided between more regulation of training/qualification and a licensing/certification program. Of the 24 persons who commented on what areas of pipeline safety should be covered if additional training and qualification requirements are developed, almost everyone favored various combinations of design, construction, operation, and maintenance. Finally, of the 61 persons expressing an opinion on whether additional regulations for training and qualification would result in an improvement in pipeline safety, approximately 46 percent expected an improvement in accidents prevented or mitigated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Advisory Committees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (TPSSC) and the Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards Committee (THLPSSC) are OPS's gas and liquid advisory committees representing government agencies, pipeline operators, and the public. At a joint meeting in Washington, DC on September 23, 1987, the TPSSC and THLPSSC discussed the ANPRM. The advisory committees generally supported requiring all pipeline operators to conduct training and testing programs for personnel assigned to perform operation and maintenance functions. Many committee members were concerned, however, about the ability of some small gas distribution system operators to provide the necessary training, and requested that any new regulations be sensitive to the limited financial and technical resources of these small operators.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Subsequently, on September 13 and 14, 1988, these committees met again in Washington, DC, and discussed a preliminary rulemaking proposal which OPS had developed for the qualification of pipeline personnel. The basic training and testing requirements now being put forward for public comment were embodied in that proposal. The TPSSC supported the proposal by unanimous vote. The THLPSSC, after making three minor recommendations for clarification of statements in the proposed regulations, also supported the proposal unanimously. However, the three recommendations are no longer germane, since the statements that required clarification have been removed from the proposed requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

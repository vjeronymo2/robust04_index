			<p><P> February 21, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OPEC STICKS TO PRODUCTION QUOTAS TO TRY TO LIFT PRICES;  </P> <P> CRUDE OIL EXPECTED TO REACH $18 A BARREL LATER THIS YEAR  </P> <P> OPEC members are complying with a production accord designed to lift crude oil  prices, a top official said Monday.  </P> <P> "OPEC has more or less found its form right now," said Subroto,  secretary-general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Subroto  said crude oil prices would definitely reach the cartel's target of $18 a  barrel in the second half of this year.  </P> <P> That price will be reached "sooner rather than later" if members hold to their  OPEC-set production quotas and if independent exporting nations reduce their  output, he said.  </P> <P> The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by OPEC was $16.02 a barrel  on Monday, up $4 to $5 from late November, when the cartel's oil ministers  struck a deal to curb production.  </P> <P> The accord set an overall ceiling, or quota, of 18.5 million barrels a day for  the 13 member nations in the first six months of this year.  </P> <P> According to figures released Monday by OPEC, 12 of the countries supplied a  total of 17.42 million barrels a day in January, slightly less than the quota  of 17.51 million barrels set for them.  </P> <P> The cartel said in a news release that figures from the United Arab Emirates  had not yet been received. The UAE, however, has persistently exceeded its  target in the past, according to private analysts. Its current quota is 988,000  barrels a day.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Topped Limits in January  </P> <P> Subroto, Indonesia's former oil minister, said the supply figures provide "a  sign that we are abiding (by) our quota."  </P> <P> Private analysts estimated that OPEC surpassed its ceiling in January by about  a million barrels a day.  </P> <P> OPEC, however, said it measures the quota by adding crude production and the  amount of oil put into, or taken out of, stock. Production, which it defines as  the amount of crude measured at storage facilities, was 18.13 million barrels a  day in January for the 12 reporting nations.  </P> <P> This was the first time the cartel had released such monthly figures.  </P> <P> "The atmosphere in OPEC and among the ministers is much better," Subroto said.  He attributed a major part of the improvement to an August cease-fire that  ended eight years of fighting between Iran and Iraq, key OPEC members.  </P> <P> He also said he sensed oil market participants felt "more comfortable toward  OPEC behavior."  </P> <P> Subroto predicted that non-OPEC nations would agree in the coming months to  trim their output. Representatives of these nations meet today in London to  discuss the situation.  </P> <P> "There is definitely a positive sign that . . . they will do something in  reducing the supply," he said.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> WOULD-BE CUP DEFENDERS ASKED TO PUT UP OR SHUT UP BY JUNE 28  </P> <P> The committee in charge of overseeing the U.S. defense of the America's Cup  Thursday set a June 28 deadline for racing syndicates to show proof that they  are serious contenders.  </P> <P> The announcement followed two days of meetings at the San Diego Yacht Club  between the defense committee and representatives of nine potential defense  syndicates.  </P> <P> Syndicates have been asked to demonstrate by the deadline that they have the  initial financial resources to mount a defense effort by:  </P> <P>  -- providing written evidence that they have the commitments from sponsors,  donors and other revenue sources to raise $6 million toward the start of the  construction of a boat by the end of the year.  </P> <P>  -- posting a $150,000 performance bond that would be forfeited if the  syndicate does not have a valid boat on the starting line for the defense  trials expected to begin in January, 1992. This bond would be the first of two  required. The committee previously said that a $150,000 bond would have to be  posted by July, 1991.  </P> <P> Those who fail to meet the requirements will be 'excused from further  competition," said Tom Ehman, general manager of the America's Cup Organizing  Committee. Ehman said these groups would be dropped from committee mailings,  meetings and other functions. But he added that the committee reserves the  right to accept additional groups after the June 28 deadline.  </P> <P> "We don't want to exclude someone who could help us," Ehman said. "But there is  no way the U.S. can support 10 syndicates."  </P> <P> The deadline will help potential corporate backers focus on the more-organized  defense syndicates, Ehman said.  </P> <P> "We're beginning the fish-or-cut-bait time," Ehman said. "There is confusion in  the corporate marketplace with so many groups contending for resources."  </P> <P> Ehman said that at least three potential syndicates were warned by the  committee that they appear to be in difficulty with regard to meeting the  requirements; Ehman declined to name the groups.  </P> <P> He said one potential group, Pride of America Defense of Los Angeles, has been  dropped after failing to attend the meetings this week. Phil Smith, head of the  group, could not be reached for comment. Ehman said a ninth potential defender  was added this week when David Lowery, a North County businessman, sent a  representative to the meetings.  </P> <P> Ehman said that the Lowery group had the potential to be a serious defense team  and identified four potential defense syndicates as having done good early  preparation: Team Dennis Conner, run by the three-time Cup winner from San  Diego; Isler Sailing International, headed by former Conner navigator Peter  Isler of San Diego; Larry Klein's Triumph America Foundation, San Diego, and  Yankee Syndicate, Cleveland.  </P> <P> The meetings this week also were used as a time to lobby syndicates to firm up  their commitments to the Partnership for America's Cup Technology (PACT), a  research group designed to help the syndicates pool some of their design work.  The group is headed by John Marshall, who led the design team for Conner's  successful 1987 and 1988 America's Cup efforts.  </P> <P> America's Cup Notes  </P> <P> Phil Freedman, founder of the San Diego-based Betsy Ross defense syndicate, has  reduced his role to that of an adviser, said Tom Ehman, general manager of  America's Cup Organizing Committee. Shelley Stepanek has taken over the lead  role with the group. . . . The Leningrad Yacht Club, which was given a two-week  extension until Saturday midnight to file its $25,000 challenger entry fee,  still has not paid. But Ehman said the committee still expects the club to meet  the new deadline. If it does, that will officially increase the number of  potential challenger syndicates to 21.  </P></p>

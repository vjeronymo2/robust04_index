			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HIGH SCHOOLS;  </P> <P> TORREY PINES HAS LONG ROAD TRIP TO STATE SEMIFINAL  </P> <P> Torrey Pines may be playing in foreign territory, but it will have alumni who  have matriculated to UC Davis, Stanford and UC Santa Cruz to offer support.  </P> <P> Tonight, the Torrey Pines girls' volleyball team meets Central Coast Section  champion St. Francis (Mountain View) in the State Division I semifinal at  top-ranked St. Francis (42-1).  </P> <P> But Falcon coach Jim Harrah said the northern site won't work against them:  "Playing up there won't be that much different from playing in tournaments at  Mira Mesa or Santa Barbara."  </P> <P> It marks the first time a San Diego girls' volleyball team has reached the  third round of the tournament in Division I -- Francis Parker won three state  titles in Division III -- but Torrey Pines has a handful of players with  state-tournament experience.  </P> <P> "They're tickled to get this far," Harrah said. "Lack of experience won't have  an effect. They're playing so well right now, and beating the defending state  champion Saturday gave us confidence."  </P> <P> The second-ranked Falcons (31-2) sent three-time champion Mira Costa home with  a 15-17, 15-12, 15-5, 15-9 loss and played what Harrah said was their best  match of the season.  </P> <P> St. Francis, a strong-serving team, is led by 5-foot-10 senior outside hitter  Staci Wolfe. Wolfe's sister, freshman Shelli (5-11), is also a starter.  </P> <P> Torrey Pines is a tall, balanced team offensively and defensively. Starters  Brett Hensel (5-10) and Sarah McCandless (5-10) switch off as setters, Amy  (5-10) and Christy (5-11) Peters -- no relation -- and Audette Paul (6-2) are  outside hitters and Kami Schmedding (6-1) is a middle blocker.  </P> <P> Tyffanii Evans, Mira Mesa's 5-9 forward, could be the best jumper in the  county.  </P> <P> "I don't think there's anybody in the county that can jump better than her,"  Mira Mesa girls' basketball Coach Gary Blevins said. "She can just jump out of  the gym. The other day the ball got stuck (between the rim and the backboard)  and she just flicked it out of there.  </P> <P> "When our boys are playing and that happens they have to go get Tyffanii to get  it out for them."  </P> <P> The El Cajon Valley girls' basketball team not only ranks among the county's  top 10 for its playing ability, the Eagles' are probably the smartest team  around. Just take a look at the team's grade-point average.  </P> <P> The Eagles, who play Hilltop tonight in the first round of the El Cajon  tournament, have five starters averaging a 4.0 GPA -- Heidi and Heather Holm,  Nicolle Eskow, Tracy Wilcox and Sara Mease. The entire team's GPA is 3.7.  </P> <P> "I've never had anything like that," El Cajon Valley Coach Robert Holm said.  "I'm very pleased. They are very intelligent and easy to work with. All plan to  go onto college whether they play basketball or not. They put a lot of time  into the sport and a lot of time into their studies."  </P> <P> In one way, Rancho Bernardo Coach Rob Sills was relieved that his team did not  advance to the Section volleyball finals Nov. 17. That was the day he wed  Andrea Heimbecker.  </P> <P> After the Broncos defeated Kearny in the first round, Sills said, "It's going  to be interesting. I've already been told I can't coach that night."  </P> <P> Rancho Bernardo lost to La Jolla in the second round.  </P> <P> Because of the cancellation of the Kiwanis girls' basketball tournament this  season, Mount Carmel is hunting for games.  </P> <P> Mount Carmel Coach Tracey Johnson is looking for alumni to participate in the  school's first girls' basketball alumni game Dec. 1 at Sundevil Arena.  </P> <P> "I don't know if it will be annual or not," Johnson said. "But right now we're  kind of desperate for a game."  </P> <P> Ramona boys' basketball Coach Al Schaffer thinks that his team's home opener  against Helix Wednesday will be one of the best nonleague matchups this season.  </P> <P> "For a cross-league game, I think it's one of the best," Schaffer said. "The  bragging rights in the county will be up for grabs right away."  </P> <P> It will be the battle of the centers -- Helix's 7-foot Jason Falconer against  Ramona's 6-9 Travis Knight.  </P> <P> "I think it will be a dandy," Schaffer said. "The papers have Helix ranked in  the top 10. We're expecting a good crowd."  </P></p>

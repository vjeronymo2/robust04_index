			<p>930616 FT  16 JUN 93 / International Company News: Time Warner to raise Dollars 750m in Lyons issue TIME Warner, the US entertainment group, plans to raise Dollars 750m through an issue of Liquid Yield Option Notes (Lyons), a form of bond convertible into stock. The money from the issue, together with available cash, will be used to pay off more expensive Time Warner debt. Although the issue has yet to be priced, the Lyons will pay a lower interest rate than the 8 3/4 per cent convertible subordinated debentures that are to be redeemed. The company said the Lyons issue was part of its refinancing programme to lower the cost of its debt and strengthen its balance sheet. Earlier this year, Time Warner redeemed Dollars 3.6bn worth of convertible preferred stock in a share-buy back.</p>

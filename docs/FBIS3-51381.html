			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A military source told EL OBSERVADOR that General  Raul Mermot has been sanctioned with 10 days of strict arrest by  the Army commander in chief, but he will continue as commander  of the Third Army Division based in Tacuarembo because the  sanction is to be applied "without hindering his present  function."    The sources minimized the importance of the sanction that  will end on 17 January. A military source said Mermot "has the  command channels open" and he, therefore, continues "commanding  the division."    The source said Mermot is a member of the Supreme Tribunal  on  Promotions and Resources, adding that for the past 30 days he  has been working at Army Command headquarters, where he  currently is serving his strict arrest.    "The sanction of strict arrest is continuous for a period.  Then we have, according to the characteristics of the violation,  suspensions, reassignments, reassignment suspensions, and trial  by military justice," the source said.    Lieutenant General Daniel Garcia, Army commander in chief,  said Gen. Mermot's sanction is an Army "internal and  administrative issue." A military source added: "The fact that  a general has been sanctioned does not mean it did not happen  before or that it will not happen again."</p>

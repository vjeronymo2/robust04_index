			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / The Lex Column: Wall Street The US equity market started the new week in much better mood than it finished the old. Yesterday's rally must still be taken with a pinch of salt, though. The prospect of strong earnings growth and continued inflows from mutual funds - albeit at a markedly slower rate than last year - have lent the market support this year despite tighter money at the Federal Reserve. The dollar's weakness could yet undermine both props, leaving Wall Street prey to the kind of liquidity crunch which has affected other markets since February. While some of the heat was off the currency yesterday, it is vulnerable to speculative attack as long as intervention is not backed up by moves in interest rates. The snag is that higher rates could slow the recovery to the point where earnings growth is threatened. A trailing multiple of around 20 times leaves little room for disappointment on that score - witness the sharp reaction to the recent crop of profits warnings, particularly in the technology sector. Equities could see some sharp falls if mutual fund investors then actually started selling. The more difficult question is how far other equity markets are at risk. A slide on Wall Street could prove the catalyst for serious selling elsewhere. But other equity markets have mostly been reacting to movements in bonds. The chances are that a rise in short term US rates large enough to stabilise the dollar would prove a tonic for the bond market because it would also calm inflation fears. Even after last week's slide, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen by a little under 3 per cent this year, significantly less than the main European equity markets. It has some catching up to do.</p>

			<p>940524 FT  24 MAY 94 / International Company News: Double listing lifts Kyocera results Kyocera, the Japanese manu-facturer of ceramic semiconductor components, posted a sharp rise in consolidated profits due to the listing of two subsidiaries, DDI, the telecommunications company, and Taito, the video games maker. The company saw a 39 per cent rise in group pre-tax profits to Y68.4bn (Dollars 651.42m) for the year to last March due to profits of Y14.3bn from the two companies' listing and Y7.5bn from share sales. However, cost-cutting helped the mainline business and operating profits rose Y10.5 per cent on a 0.9 per cent decline in sales to Y427.7bn. After-tax profits rose 53.7 per cent to Y36.8bn. Earnings of its ceramic semiconductor parts division rose 9.9 per cent to Y44.7bn, but electronic equipment profits fell 22.1 per cent to Y3.4bn. The optical precision equipment division returned to the black, with earnings of Y2.4bn against a loss of Y673m a year earlier. On a non-consolidated basis, Kyocera posted a 7.8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y35.1bn due to a fall in interest income. Sales were flat at Y300.6bn but after-tax profits rose 10 per cent thanks to income from share sales. For the current year to next March, the company forecasts a 20 per cent unconsolidated pre-tax rise to Y42.1bn on a 8.9 per cent rise in sales to Y327.5bn.</p>

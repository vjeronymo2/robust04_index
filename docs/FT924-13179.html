			<p>921016 FT  16 OCT 92 / Letter (2): Coal seen as victim of muddled economic thinking and lack of long-term strategy Sir, The present government seems determined to prove that it is the most committed of economic purists and to offer up whole chunks of British industry on the altar of a 'free market' which, as we all know, is in no way at all as free as they would like us to believe. The decision to close so many productive coal mines can be seen as a form of economic madness which no amount of waffling about 'the costs of production' by Michael Heseltine can disguise. At a time when good quality coal is hard to come by (ignoring the brown coal which floods in from eastern Europe) we seem prepared to increase our reliance upon coal imports and to accept the idiocy of burning vastly increasing quantities of gas - a valuable feedstock for many other chemical and pharmaceutical products. The decision by past governments not to invest heavily (as the Germans have done) in de-sulphurising scrubbers for our coal-fired power stations helps, of course, the present case against coal - and for gas  - in that the discharge of pollutants exceeds the permitted European levels. That the Germans are now probably world leaders in the manufacture and sale of such equipment, and that many thousands of jobs were created by the German government's decision to invest in this area shows what an enlightened and pragmatic approach to problem solving can turn up.

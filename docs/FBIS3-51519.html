Fujimori, who met with Alexander Watson, assistant secretary  of state for Inter-American Affairs, justified his refusal to  accept the U.S. proposal by noting, as as an example, that the  top Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman "could be freed for lack  of evidence" should the Supreme Court review his case. The  review of terrorism trials "is a risk we cannot accept in the  same way that the United States would not accept it if it were  in our situation," the Peruvian chief of state added. Fujimori  pointed out that the Judicial Branch is not yet "completely  reformed" and that the civilian judicial system "is no guarantee  that human rights will be respected."    Fujimori and Watson met at the Government Palace in Lima. It  was a "constructive and frank," meeting according to the U.S.  government official at its conclusion. [passage omitted]    Fujimori, for his part, expressed his confidence that the  meeting has served to "dispel the doubts" of the United States  about the human rights and democratization process.    Regarding democratization, the chief of state said he told  the U.S. official "that the Peru that existed before 5 April  1992 was not viable and that the measures adopted had been  necessary." According to Fujimori, this "was a topic that was  well understood" by the U.S. Government representative.</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / World Trade News: Push to implement accord on toxic waste REPRESENTATIVES from 41 governments are meeting this week in Uruguay to hammer out an agreement on implementing the Basle Convention signed in May this year. The convention restricts trade in toxic wastes, an increasingly controversial trade and environmental issue. Opening the conference yesterday, Mr Mostafa Tolba, United Nations environment programme executive director, said 300m-400m tonnes of hazardous waste were produced every year. Although most of the waste is produced, transported and stored in industrialised countries, an increasing amount is shipped to the developing world. The convention - which took 11 years to negotiate - has met stiff, if discreet, resistance from the rich countries. They are apparently wary of establishing export controls and even more suspicious of developing countries' demands for a potentially huge compensation scheme to be underwritten by the industrialised world. The scheme would be used to compensate victims of environmental disasters caused by toxic stockpiles. Developing countries take in hazardous waste for storage without adequate precautions. Even if the compensation fund is unlikely to be approved in the shape hoped for by the developing countries, the conference is likely to win approval for a Dollars 6.6m (Pounds 4.3m) two-year budget for a secretariat and training programmes. It is also working on draft legislation to serve as a basis for individual national laws regulating the trade. Greenpeace, the international environmental group, yesterday claimed the trade in toxic waste has increased since the adoption of the convention in 1989. It said that, this year alone, companies in the US and western Europe shipped 74,000 tonnes of waste to 17 developing countries.</p>

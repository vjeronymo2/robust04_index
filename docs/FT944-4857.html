			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Socialists snub Balladur reform France's opposition Socialist party yesterday refused to be co-opted into accepting anti-corruption reforms by prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur, in advance of a forthcoming parliamentary debate on the issue. Socialist leaders boycotted a meeting of MPs which Mr Balladur called yesterday evening to discuss anti-corruption reforms, after which the prime minister was due to make a statement on national television. The opposition wants to remain free to insist during a parliamentary debate on Friday that the conservative government should reverse its easing of anti-corruption measures passed by its Socialist predecessor. Last Friday a special commission appointed by Mr Balladur recommended a total ban on corporate contributions to political parties, as well as a ban on politicians holding senior company posts and a series of measures to ensure fairness and transparency in the award of public contracts.</p>

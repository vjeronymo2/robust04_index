			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] An extraordinary congress of the Slovak National  Party [SNS] is under way in Zilina today. Our colleague Marian  Hudec reports:    [Hudec] The beginning of the expected SNS congress has not  attracted the attention of the Zilina population.    At the very beginning SNS Chairman Ludovit Cernak and over  40  other delegates left the hall, allegedly as a protest against  undemocratic practices in the form of manipulation of the  congress deliberations beforehand.    The delegates to the extraordinary congress expelled Cernak,  Anton Hrnko, and Vladimir Miskovsky from the party. The other  rebels still have a chance to rejoin the party, if they ask for  their readmission in writing before a deadline.    The chairman of the SNS parliamentary group announced a  little while ago that Ludovit Cernak will be deprived of his  post of deputy chairman of the National Council of the Slovak  Republic. This ensues from coalition talks. An SNS candidate  will be appointed to the post.    The delegates to the congress are electing a new party  chairman now. There are four candidates for this post: Jozef  Prokes, Vitazoslav Moric, Marian Andel, and Jan Slota.    Cernak supporters are holding deliberations at the House of  Technology in Zilina, probably about the formation of a new  party.</p>

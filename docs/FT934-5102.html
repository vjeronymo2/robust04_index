			<p>931201 FT  01 DEC 93 / Budget 93: Their Budget - The negative equity holder Miranda Thomas, 29 Has two small children. Husband, Martin, is a solicitor and they live in the west London two-bedroomed flat they bought in 1990 for pounds 131,000. They have just sold it for pounds 108,000. But the total loss is much greater than the pounds 23,000 it appears. The couple took out a pounds 75,000 interest-only mortgage when interest rates were 15 per cent. After paying the building society for four years, they still owe pounds 85,000 Job: part-time teacher at Camden School for Girls Earns: Pounds 7,000 a year Wanted: tax relief on childcare. She has to pay a childminder for two and a half days a week. Did not want: to see MIRAS disappear, but felt it would be unrealistic to expect interest rates to be cut further Verdict: 'I was pleased with the new allowance for childcare for people on family credit. But it's a pity it doesn't go further, especially after all the talk of getting women back to work. We knew the cut in mortgage tax relief was coming. The interest rates are more important to us.'</p>

The amendments clarify the period during which interest is allowed on taxpayer overpayments which are credited against other liabilities of the same taxpayer for interest and certain additions to the tax. The amendments are necessary as a result of changes to the law made by the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984. The regulations affect all taxpayers who have overpayments credited against underpayments. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations are effective on June 7, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Jackie White of the Tax Compliance Branch, (202) 927&hyph;8220, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, P.O. Box 50221, Washington, DC 20091&hyph;0221 ((202) 927&hyph;8220).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> This document contains amendments to the regulations on Procedure and Administration (27 CFR part 70) under &sect;6611 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (IRC) to clarify the period during which interest is allowed on overpayments that are credited against a taxpayer's liability for interest and certain additions to the tax. The amendments will conform the regulations to &sect;344 of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) (Pub. L. 97&hyph;248, 96 Stat. 635), and &sect;158 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DEFRA) (Pub. L. 98&hyph;369, 98 Stat. 696). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) applies &sect;6611 to the taxes it administers and enforces. The IRS published a notice of proposed rulemaking in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on August 25, 1992 (57 FR 38457), and Treasury Decision 8524 (59 FR 10075) was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on March 3, 1994, adopting final rules implementing the TEFRA and DEFRA amendments. ATF believes these regulations are equally applicable to its tax collection activities and is adopting such regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Interest on Overpayments That Are Credited Against Interest on Underpayments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Section 6611(a) of the IRC provides that interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment in respect of any internal revenue tax at the overpayment rate established under &sect;6621. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under &sect;6402(a), the Secretary may credit any overpayment (including any interest allowed thereon) against any liability imposed on the taxpayer under the IRC. Under &sect;6611(b)(1), interest is allowed on an overpayment that is so credited from the date of the overpayment to the due date of the taxpayer's liability against which the overpayment is credited. For purposes of this interest computation, a definition of the term ``due date'' is provided in &sect;70.92(d) of the regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Generally, &sect;6601(f) provides that once an overpayment is credited to satisfy a taxpayer's liability, interest no longer accrues on that liability. Section 344 of TEFRA added &sect;6622 of the IRC, which requires interest imposed by the IRC to be compounded daily. The effect of &sect;6601(f) on the compounding requirement of &sect;6622 is that once an overpayment is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest, that credit cuts off any further compounding of the interest (i.e., interest no longer accrues on the taxpayer's interest liability against which the credit has been made). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Similarly, it is appropriate that no interest liability to the taxpayer accrues on the overpayment once the overpayment is credited to satisfy the taxpayer's liability for interest. Thus, the regulations amend &sect;70.92(d)(2)(iii) to clarify that interest ceases to accrue on any portion of an overpayment that is credited against the taxpayer's liability for interest. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

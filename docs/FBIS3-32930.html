			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lucy Barrios] </F>   [Text] The presidents of the Executive and Legislative  Branches have made the first move toward rapprochement after  several months of dispute -- provoked by the 25 May coup d'etat  and worsened by the purge sponsored by Ramiro de Leon Carpio.    Congress President Oscar Vinicio Villar yesterday reported  that the first action of rapprochement occurred during the  inauguration of the "Fuertes Caminos" project, when he invited  the Executive Branch to find solutions to national problems  through a dialogue and reconciliation. Even though the action  of rapprochement was fortuitous, it grants an opportunity to end  the confrontation between the two branches, based on the  understanding that we will respect our independence and jointly  seek solutions to the most important social problems, he added.  Villar said it is never too late to improve things when there  is a political will, particularly now that the democratic  process, and the country's own stability, are at stake.    Referring to the Great National Agreement, the congress  president said if everyone has faith and works hard to solve the  crisis, and if there is a political will to find solutions  without negatively affecting the masses, we can all overcome the  problems that have provoked national instability. This project  supports the congress position that all the groups which  comprise our society should participate in a dialogue. We are  willing to participate, as an organization, and support the  appeal issued by the Executive Branch because we believe this  will allow us to find a solution to our differences, Villar said.    The official said the current problem is that each group  that  wants to participate in the dialogue has the idea it will gain  something, but if we want to find a solution to our current  crisis we must first make contributions without expecting  benefits. "Referring to this, the groups that have remained in  power in the country must realize it is important that we find  solutions to prevent a grave crisis, because this would return  the country to the obscurantist decades" which prevailed in the  past.    Given this situation, in my role as Legislative Branch  president, I consider positive a rapprochement between the two  state branches because we are aware that a dialogue will allow  us to find solutions to the problems that worry us nowadays, he  emphasized.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Jozo Curic] </F>   [Excerpt] A preliminary draft agreement has been signed on  creating a Bosnia-Herzegovina federation, along with a  preliminary agreement on a confederal union between Croatia and  Bosnia-Herzegovina; transit; human rights; the organization and  distribution of state powers within the Bosnia-Herzegovina  federation; defense arrangements; the creation of a constituent  assembly and high-level committees to draw up a constitution and  take the necessary steps and measures for the realization of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation; a monetary, customs, and economic  union; and a defense alliance between Croatia and the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    In this context, both states would retain their membership  in  the United Nations while the Croats and Muslims would be two  constituent peoples equally represented in a balanced way in  state bodies. A two-chamber parliament would not be able to  make decisions detrimental to any people. Cantons, which vest  some functions in a federal government, are at the heart of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina federation.    The [present] administration and defense chain of command  remains the same in Bosnia until a new constitution is  introduced. A council of Croat cantons and Croat municipalities  in Muslim cantons and vice versa, and the federal organs jointly  created by the Croats and Muslims are the basis for a team of  experts in Vienna to draw up a final agreement by 15 March that  would be signed in the White House in Washington by Presidents  Tudjman and Izetbegovic in President Clinton's presence.    Last night President Clinton spoke to Sarajevo and Zagreb  over the phone. President Tudjman thanked him for the efforts  that the United States had invested in the Croat-Muslim  agreement. I am honored and I appreciate the fact that this has  taken place, President Clinton said, adding: I appreciate your  leadership and you in your capacity as a statesman.    The Croatian president said that he appreciated the U.S.  Government's involvement and asked for guarantees regarding the  UNPA [UN protected areas]. We continue to support Croatia's  sovereignty and integrity, was the answer coming from the White  House. [passage omitted]</p>

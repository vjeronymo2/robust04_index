			<p><P> November 27, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> ABC IS NO. 1 FOR 1ST TIME THIS SEASON;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: FOOTBALL, VIDEOS AND 'IT' HELP THE NETWORK KNOCK NBC FROM THE TOP  SLOT.  </P> <P> A monster, a football game and some home videos helped put ABC on top of the  ratings race for the first time this season as Thanksgiving week again proved  to be a turkey for NBC, it was reported today.  </P> <P> The top-rated show of the week was CBS' "60 Minutes," which had its highest  rating of the season, but coming in second was Part 2 of "Stephen King's 'It' "  on ABC, followed by Monday night football and the two "America's Funniest . . .  " shows, all on ABC. It was the highest-rated multiple-part program of the  season.  </P> <P> The week was NBC's third loss this season; CBS took opening week and World  Series week. While NBC came in second for the week and CBS was third, CBS and  ABC each had four shows in the top 10, compared with only two for NBC.  </P> <P> Part of the reason was the seasonal slump for Thanksgiving, which every year  shows that Americans would rather eat than watch television. Even NBC's  Thursday night lineup can't keep the couch potatoes away from the candied yams.  </P> <P> When they did tune in, they were slightly more likely to vote for "The  Simpsons" on Fox than for "The Cosby Show" on NBC. "Simpsons" tied with "The  Trials of Rosie O'Neill" (CBS) for 37th place while "Cosby" was in 39th.  "Simpsons" had an 11.9 rating and a 24 share, while "Cosby" had an 11.6 rating  and a 23 share.  </P> <P> Another head-to-head contest among new shows was neck and neck: "Fresh Prince  of Bel Air" on NBC was in 25th place, while "Evening Shade" on CBS tied for  27th.  </P> <P> The ABC margin for the week was substantial, with the network boasting a 13.4  rating and a 23 share. NBC had an 11.8 rating and a 20 share, while CBS had an  11.3 rating and a 19 share. ABC noted that was the widest gap between first and  second place this season, except for World Series week, which CBS won handily  thanks to four games in one seven-night stretch.  </P> <P> In the tight 10-week-old season-to-date statistics, NBC holds onto its lead  with a 13.2 rating and 22 share, while ABC has moved into second with a 12.7  rating and a 21 share. CBS is only a tenth of a ratings point behind, with a  12.6 rating and a 21 share.  </P> <P> With the November sweeps almost over, NBC leads, with ABC second and CBS third.  </P> <P> Each ratings point represents about 921,000 households. A share is the  percentage of TV sets in use that are tuned to a particular show or network.  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE TOP 10  </P> <P>  The top 10 programs for the week ending Sunday, according to A.C. Nielsen Co.:  </P> <P> 1. 60 Minutes (CBS)  </P> <P> 2. "Stephen King's 'It,' " Part 2 (ABC)  </P> <P> 3. NFL Monday night football (ABC)  </P> <P> 4. America's Funniest People (ABC)  </P> <P> 5. America's Funniest Home Videos (ABC)  </P> <P> 6. Murder, She Wrote (CBS)  </P> <P> 7. Murphy Brown (CBS)  </P> <P> 8. Designing Women (CBS)  </P> <P> 9. Golden Girls (NBC)  </P> <P> 10. Empty Nest (NBC)  </P></p>

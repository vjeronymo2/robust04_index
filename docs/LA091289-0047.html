			<p><P> September 12, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Workers in the Soviet republic of Azerbaijan ended a weeklong strike protesting  direct Kremlin control of the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Leaders  of the Azerbaijan People's Front, a nationalist group that called the strike  more than a week ago, said that most of their political demands were met. The  People's Front will be officially recognized and allowed to speak at a special  session of the republic's legislature on Friday, a spokesman said in a call to  Moscow from Baku, Azerbaijan's capital. Azerbaijan, a mainly Muslim republic,  is seeking to regain control of Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inhabited mainly by  Armenians. To calm ethnic tensions, Moscow took direct control of the territory  last winter.  </P></p>

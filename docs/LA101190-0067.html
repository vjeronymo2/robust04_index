			<p><P> October 11, 1990, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> LOW-INCOME HOUSING RULES EASED FOR COAST AREA  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council has voted unanimously to ease the requirements  that developers of apartments and condominiums in the San Pedro coastal area  must meet for providing low- and moderate-income units in their projects.  </P> <P> By a 12-0 vote Tuesday, the council deleted a provision in the San Pedro  Specific Plan that required a minimum of 25% low- and moderate-income housing  in projects of at least eight units. The now-defunct provision also required  developers to replace affordable housing demolished for new projects within 18  months and a two-mile radius of the razed units.  </P> <P> In its absence, builders in the San Pedro coastal zone must now comply with the  state Mello Act, a much less restrictive set of regulations that city officials  say is applied in other coastal zones locally and across the state.  </P> <P> "It is a fairness thing," said Dick Takase, a city hearing examiner who  recommended last spring that the city's Planning Commission approve the change.  "Why should property owners and developers in San Pedro be subjected to a more  stringent law than the rest of the city?"  </P> <P> The Mello Act imposes a general requirement for low- and moderate-income  housing in projects of at least three units, but it requires no specific number  of affordable units and allows city officials to waive the provision if they  deem it too burdensome. The law also allows developers to wait up to three  years to replace affordable housing demolished for new projects, and it permits  them to build the replacement housing within a three-mile radius.  </P> <P> Los Angeles Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores, who represents San Pedro, proposed  switching to the Mello requirements in 1987 because of complaints from  builders. Local businesses, led by the San Pedro Peninsula Chamber of Commerce,  lobbied for the change.  </P> <P> "It made it hard for builders to sell their units," Gubler said. "To meet the  25% requirement, the builders tell us they basically had to subsidize those  units by raising the price of the other units. And that made those units  noncompetitive with other units in the area."  </P> <P> No one spoke against the change at Tuesday's council meeting, but several  residents and community groups opposed it during a public hearing last spring.  Opponents said they feared the change would reduce the amount of affordable  housing in San Pedro.  </P> <P> "To eliminate such requirements anywhere in the city is like burying your head  in the sand," Howard Uller, executive director of Toberman Settlement house,  wrote in a letter to the city. "A few wealthy developers will benefit from  this, but it will leave out protections" for low- and moderate-income  residents.  </P> <P> The boundaries of the San Pedro coastal zone extend roughly from 9th Street on  the north, south along Pacific Avenue, west on 25th Street, south along the  Rancho Palos Verdes city line, east along the coastline, and north along  Cabrillo Beach, Crescent Avenue and Harbor Boulevard.  </P></p>

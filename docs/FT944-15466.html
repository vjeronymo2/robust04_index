			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / International Company News: Holdains upbeat in spite of 4.6% profits decline An improved political climate and renewed economic growth allowed Holdains, the South African packaging group, to lift an earlier, gloomy earnings forecast, but it still recorded a 4.6 per cent decline in after-tax profit to R110.6m (Dollars 30.1m) for the year ended in August, down from R134.8m a year ago, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Sales rose 9 per cent, to R2.8bn from R2.5bn, but operating income declined sharply to R168.7m from R196m as a result of intense pressure on the group's margins in the first half of the year. However, after-tax figures were helped by a reduction in interest paid, to R19.8m from R31.8m, as well as lower taxes, at R25.7m compared with R29.4m a year ago. The full-year dividend was maintained at 125 cents. Mr Richard Bruyns, chief executive, said the outlook for the next year was greatly improved. 'Strong turnover growth in all our divisions was achieved in the last quarter and we anticipate that the accelerated pace will continue,' he said. Holdains' balance sheet improved slightly on the year as gearing dropped to 14.8 per cent from 18.4 per cent a year ago. The 1992 figure was 45.1 per cent. The company also announced it had spent R105m on plant expansion and R34m on asset replacement.</p>

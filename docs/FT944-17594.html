			<p>941007 FT  07 OCT 94 / People: Andrew Karney quits Logica Logica's dramatis personae continue to change as managing director Martin Read reshuffles his management team. Andrew Karney, corporate development director, is the latest to exit stage right as the computing services company's reorganisation moves on. Karney, 52, emphasises the parting is amicable: 'New management always wants to bring in new blood and I think that's right.' Although headhunters have kept his telephone busy since his resignation leaked out, he says he has no plans beyond a visit to Indonesia next month to indulge his interest in all things Asian. Karney was one of the earliest recruits to Logica - he joined the company in 1973; he took a special interest in telecommunications and set up the company's joint ventures with Finsiel of Italy and with British Airways and became a board director in 1986. One of the founding directors of Cable London a decade ago, the new world of multimedia seems likely to offer him fresh perspectives and challenges, but he seems lukewarm about the prospects of starting a new company - 'Do I really want to do that?' While he ponders his next role, his wife, Beryl Goldwyn, is off filming an episode of 'The Bill' police series for television.</p>

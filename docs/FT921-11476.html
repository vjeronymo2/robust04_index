			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ lamb group short-lists UK sites FORTEX, THE New Zealand lamb processing group that is seeking a site for a UK plant, will hear submissions during March from four local authorities competing to attract the inward investment. Shropshire County Council said yesterday that Fortex had short-listed a site at Craven Arms, in the lamb-producing south of the county. The other short-listed contenders for the plant are Welshpool in Wales, Dumfries and Galloway, and Lockerbie in Scotland. Fortex requires a landscaped site of about 50 acres, in an area which would provide stock for the plant and at the same time could act as a distribution centre, the County Council noted. The initial planned investment is thought to be between Pounds 20m and Pounds 25m. The plant would process 2m lambs a year. It would offer full- and part-time employment to about 750 people. Since the closure of the JP Woods chicken-processing plant in Craven Arms, with the loss of 500 jobs, the Shropshire authorities have been particularly anxious to attract new industry to the south of the county. After hearing what is on offer from the four contenders for its plant, Fortex is expected to make a decision on its desired location by May.</p>

Older travellers especially are more at risk  from Legionnaires' Disease and dehydration than from contracting  a fatal strain of malaria abroad.    Research by doctors in tropical medicine, to be published  soon, will suggest there is almost no risk of malaria to  ordinary tourists in much of southeast Asia, and most of the  150,000 travellers to Thailand from Britain do not need to take  prophylaxis. Those most at risk are people from ethnic minority  groups visiting friends and relatives and living in close  contact with local people.    Over the last five years the rise in the number of people  returning to the UK every year with malaria has been almost  parallel to the increase in the number of travellers. Each year,  there are 2,000 cases of malaria in Britain, 1,200 of them the  potentially fatal strain, and about 12 deaths.    Dr. Ron Behrens, consultant in tropical and travel medicine  at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in London, says: "Ethnic  minority groups are three times more likely to contract malaria  than ordinary tourists, and research has shown that only 19  percent use prophylaxis, compared with an average of 73 percent  of tourists."

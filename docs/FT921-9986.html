			<p>920208 FT  08 FEB 92 / Food: The pizzaiulo's secret art TODAY we begin a series evoking the pleasures of Street Food. Food that is often at its freshest, cooked in the simplest manner and ready to attack your digestive system at its most receptive - when your appetite has been heightened by the smells of cooking. Street Food is inexpensive and without pretension. It is quick, satisfying and breaks down any language barrier - if in doubt, you just point. It is theatre, as crepes are folded, kebabs grilled or noodles ladled. Above all it is evocative of both time and place. We begin in southern Italy, on the streets of Naples, to taste pizza as it is meant to be eaten. THE TRAGEDY of eating pizza in Naples - generally regarded as the home of true pizza - is that once you have savoured its excellence, you will never be satisfied with anything less. And, until you return to Naples, less is all you will get. In this atmospheric, harsh Italian city, pizza is a part of daily life. It is sold everywhere: in grand elaborate restaurants, popular pizzerias and in just about every bar and cafe, where simple pizzetti are eaten as snacks throughout the day. They come in many varieties and sizes, are inexpensive and are always delicious. The Brandi (Salita S. Anita Di Palazzo, 1-2), at the foot of the notoriously dark Spanish Quarters, is Italy's oldest surviving pizzeria. It was here that the margherita or Neapolitan pizza was created in 1889 for a party given by the Queen of Savoy. The pizzaiulo - pizza chef - accustomed to topping his pizza with a simple tomato sauce and o'cacillo, a medium hard cheese simular to caciotta, wanted to prepare something special for the monarch, and decided to cover his pizza with the colours of the national flag. To represent red, he used a traditional tomato sauce. To this he added fior di latte, the white, mozzarella-type cheese that is used in pizza today, and over them he scattered a few leaves of fresh, green basil. His work was a simple but ingenious combination of tastes, and the result a tremendous success. Following the praises of her celebrated guests, the Queen came to thank the pizzaiulo. On asking him what his pizza was called, the emotional creator repied that he would like to name it after her - Margherita. True to the original tradition of pizza as a simple, economical food for the masses is Da Michele, situated in the busy Forcella Quarters of the old city. (Via Colletta. Open 9.30am - to 11pm Friday to Saturday.) In this small, traditional pizzeria the only pizzas on the menu are the margherita, and marinara - covered in tomato sauce, garlic and oregano. A regular 12-inch pizza costs L3,000 (Pounds 1.70), but if you want to pay L4,000 or more, the pizzaiulo will add cheese and sauce. The philosophy of Da Michele, and the probable reason that queues form on the street every day, is written on a placard hanging beside the igloo-shaped oven: 'Ever since the days of affluence, all people can think of is finance, and even the lowly pauper wants to buy a fancy pizza. But don't ask us for complicated pizzas. They're a hassle to make, they empty your purse and leave you with a stomach ache]' Da Michele is run by four brothers, the grandchildren of the pizzeria's founder, Michele Condurro, whose solemn portrait watches over the simple, green-washed restaurant alongside that of Saint Antonio, the patron saint of bakers. Antonio, the youngest brother, explains how they have continued to sell up to 900 pizzas a day since setting up on the site in 1930: 'It is not difficult to make pizza - anybody can do it - but, to make it well is an art. First, you have to know exactly how much flour, water, yeast and salt to add, and how to mix it. We always make our pasta (dough) the day before, adding only a small amount of yeast and allowing it to rise over 15 hours. This way our crust stays soft and light. From there on it is the skill of the pizzaiulo that makes a pizza good or not. To be a good pizzaiulo takes years of practice, and even then some people just cannot get it right'. The pizzaiulo at Di Michele is Antonio's uncle, Genario. To make a pizza, he takes a small quantity of dough, gently flattens it on a marble counter, covers it with toppings (including a generous lashing of olive oil) and places it on a pala - a long wooden spatula, which the fornaio (baker) places in a wood-burning oven. The pizza is cooked in the intense heat for less than two minutes. Just before it is removed, wood shavings are tossed into the fire, causing a surge of flame that lightly burns the crust and cheese. The process does not look difficult - they never 'play Frisbee' with the dough as flashy pizzaiulos do in Britain, and, in fact, they laugh at the suggestion - but the end product takes talent. The pizzas are served on simple marble tables, with bottles of cola or beer. At lunchtime, an old accordion player adds his Neapolitan gaiety to the shouts of the waiters, chefs and customers. For a more leisurely pizza, the nearby Trianon Pizzeria (Via Pietro Colletta 42-44-46, closed Wednesdays), is considered by many to be the best in town. Contrary to Michele, Trianon offers an extensive selection of pizzas, from margherita to marinaresca (shellfish, calamari, shrimp, tomato sauce, garlic and parsley), and salsiccia e frilarielli - spicy sausage and muster greens. The pizzas are more expensive here, but they are big - it is virtually impossible to eat a whole one yourself. The huge, high-ceilinged dining area is airy and relaxed - a welcome break from the chaotic streets. In the same quarters, Bellini (Via Santa Maria di Costantinopoli 80) is highly regarded by Neapolitans for both its pizza and traditional Neapolitan cuisine, particularly its superb linguini in catoccio - mixed seafood baked with linguini in parchment. Nearby, in the main artery of the shopping area, Via Toledo - known popularly as Via Roma - simple pizzetti to eat at the bar or on the street is sold in the crowded Rosticcerie. Of note is LUISE, near the magnificent galleria and San Carlo opera house. Away from the crowds, on the sea front in Mergellina, is Ciro (closed Wednesdays) which charges Pounds 8 for pizza and roughly Pounds 38 for a full evening meal per person, with wine. If you can take more, La Pizza a metro (Piazza San Luigi) sells Pizza by the metre. Loud groups of Neapolitans crowd around into this popular place, stuffing pizza into their mouths, calling out to one another across tables and laughing madly as a seemingly never-ending, two-metre pizza is pulled from the huge oven and served. In Rome, do as the Romans do. In Naples, eat pizza.</p>

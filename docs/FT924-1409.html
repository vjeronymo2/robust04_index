			<p>921218 FT  18 DEC 92 / ASB warns companies to abide by spirit of rulings THE ACCOUNTING Standards Board has warned British companies and their auditors that they must interpret its rulings by their spirit and not the letter of the regulations. In an information sheet circulated yesterday, the board's urgent issues task force stressed that its abstracts should be guided 'by the spirit and reasoning . . . so as to achieve their underlying purpose'. Mr David Tweedie, ASB chairman, warned that if companies and the accountancy profession did not follow this principle on new standards and rulings he would be forced to introduce 'a monumental rulebook' listing every possible permutation. He said he was 'furious' at the way some companies had begun to interpret board rulings by exploiting loopholes to evade their stated purpose. 'I thought we could get away from this approach,' he said. The statement will apply to all standards, but was spurred by at least five companies' most recent accounts which departed from the spirit of the task force's third ruling last December. This dealt with the treatment on disposal of goodwill - the difference between the purchase price and the net book value of a business when it is acquired. Yesterday's note stressed that companies should not separate the goodwill element from the profit or loss on disposal of an acquisition, but should instead show it as a single item. They should also not credit the profit-and-loss account with an amount equal to the goodwill shown. At least two companies have already done both of these things this year. Mr Tweedie said that the statement was 'a pre-emptive strike'. Any other companies that did the same might expect to be referred directly to the Financial Reporting Review Panel, and their auditors to their own professional bodies for possible disciplinary action. Meanwhile, the task force is also considering proposals that would force companies to show the costs of repurchasing their own debt in the year in which it takes place. The move would have a substantial effect on a significant number of companies that are currently able to spread the effect on profits over several years. It comes at a time when lower interest rates have encouraged companies - including some recently privatised utilities - to buy back higher-rate debt and exchange it for debt at lower cost. The task force said in a memorandum yesterday its preliminary view was that it should require companies to recognise any profit or loss on the repurchase immediately. The task force has started airing its more controversial views before making them mandatory following criticism from companies that were caught unaware of previous changes. But a ruling could be introduced early next year. In a separate ruling, the task force's seventh abstract stated that companies must clearly state in their accounts the details, reasons and effect of any departure in their accounts from the Companies Act requirement to provide a true and fair view. This will become effective from December 23. The Accounting Standards Board also issued a proposed amendment to SSAP 15, the accounting standard dealing with deferred tax. This would permit companies to make deductions net of tax annually on the costs of any post-retirement benefits other than pensions, such as medical costs, incurred by their employees.

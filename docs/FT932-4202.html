			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Northern Foods tastes benefit of Express buy NORTHERN Foods has reaped early benefits from its Pounds 359m acquisition of Express Dairies and Eden Vale, announcing a 21 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Pounds 153.2m. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman, said yesterday the results were 'pretty satisfactory', though a little lower than the group had expected a year ago. The integration of Express and Eden Vale, acquired early last year, had gone well. But on the downside, the recession had lasted longer than expected and had hit the retail trade, in particular Marks and Spencer, one of Northern's four largest customers. Discount food retailers had intensified competition. Raw material price increases, caused by sterling's exit from the ERM last September, were only now being fully passed on. Looking forward, Mr Haskins expected good progress in the current year. He could see no reason why the group should suffer any disadvantages from changes in the milk industry next year, which were still under discussion. He said the group planned to buy all its milk direct from producers and had already had indicative signatures from suppliers of half its 2bn litre requirement. Group sales in the year to March rose 40 per cent to Pounds 2.03bn, but leaving aside acquisitions the growth was 8 per cent. Mr Martin Clarke, finance director, said that excluding Northern's doorstep milk sales, the group's four largest customers - M&amp;S, J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway - accounted for nearly half group turnover. Operating profits increased 31.5 per cent to Pounds 180.8m, with an underlying growth of 6 per cent. The Express/Eden Vale businesses were included for two months of the previous year. Higher borrowings led to higher interest charges, from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 23.8m. Profit sharing increased from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 3.8m. Earnings per share rose 5 per cent to 20.09p, as the Express/Eden Vale acquisition was partly financed by a Pounds 227m rights issue. A final dividend of 5p, up from 4.64p, is proposed, to give a total of 8.4p, against 7.87p. Year end net debt was Pounds 212m (up from Pounds 199m) with gearing at 66 per cent and interest cover 7.4 times. Acquisitions totalled Pounds 34m (against Pounds 398m) and capital expenditure was Pounds 95m (against Pounds 93m). Operating profits in the dairy division were Pounds 92m, against Pounds 62.5m, with an underlying rise of 8 per cent. Margins dipped to 9.6 per cent (from 11 per cent) for the year, because of the Express acquisition, but had recovered to 10.4 per cent in the second half. The group's Pounds 4m deal to buy the Belfast Co-op's milk business was cleared by the competition authorities yesterday. Convenience food profits rose 51 per cent to Pounds 44.4m, with an underlying gain of 14 per cent. Meat profits fell 16 per cent to Pounds 20.2m as van sales to small shops were affected by the competition from large supermarkets. Grocery products increased profits by 13 per cent to Pounds 24.2m.

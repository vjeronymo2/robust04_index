			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / US durable goods orders still rising US DURABLE goods orders rose by a healthy 0.7 per cent in September, providing further evidence of an accelerating industrial economy in the third quarter of this year. Last month's figures would have been even better - up 2.7 per cent - but for another sharp drop in orders for military aircraft, which more than offset strong gains in the car sector and caused the transportation component to incur a 1.8 per cent decline. Nevertheless the overall index, also up by a revised 2.6 per cent in August, has risen in three of the last four months. The August and September gains were the first recorded in consecutive months for a full year. New orders now stand 8.3 per cent above the levels of a year ago. Mr Ron Brown, commerce secretary, said the latest data were 'another sign of continued economic growth'. The extent of the third-quarter advance will be revealed today with the publication of gross domestic product returns for the three-month period. Yesterday Merrill Lynch, in its economic commentary, predicted 2.7 per cent real growth in GDP (nearly 3.5 per cent in the non-farm sector). The securities firm also said expansion in the fourth quarter 'could be as strong as 5 per cent'. The strength in new orders for durable goods last month was also matched by shipments, up 1.9 per cent to a record Dollars 137bn (Pounds 91bn). Here the transportation sector led the way, with new car deliveries more than compensating for the decline in aircraft. New car and truck sales in mid-October were running at their highest annual rate (13.5m units) in the last 18 months and 18.5 per cent above the levels of the same period last year. But the improvement in shipments last month, recorded across all industrial sectors, means that this index now stands 7.6 per cent above the level of a year ago. Unfilled orders for durable goods also declined for the seventh consecutive month in September by 1.0 per cent to Dollars 428.8bn, the lowest level since June, 1988. Factoring out transportation, this measurement dropped by only 0.1 per cent in the month.</p>

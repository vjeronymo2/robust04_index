			<p>930703 FT  03 JUL 93 / US ends opposition to Vietnam loan THE US is to drop its opposition to a multilateral plan to clear Vietnam's arrears to the International Monetary Fund, paving the way for the Hanoi government's reinstatement in the international financial system, President Bill Clinton said yesterday. But Mr Clinton said progress so far on resolving questions about US servicemen taken as prisoners of war or listed as missing in action during the Vietnam war was 'simply not sufficient' to justify lifting the US trade embargo. Yesterday's announcement will allow a group of countries led by France to move ahead with a plan to lend Vietnam the money it needs to pay off its Dollars 140m (Pounds 93.3m) arrears to the IMF. This would in turn open the way for Vietnam to negotiate more substantial balance of payments financing from the IMF and project loans from the World Bank. But it will aggravate the fears of US businesses that they will be left even further behind as Vietnam's potentially dynamic economy is opened up to the outside world. US companies may at present open offices in Vietnam and negotiate contracts for future deals, but may not yet carry out these contracts. On Thursday, Mr Clinton met representatives of the families of servicemen missing in action, who have strongly opposed normalisation of relations with Vietnam, and promised that any further steps would 'strictly depend on further progress by the Vietnamese on the POW/MIA issue'. The POW/MIA lobby is a potent voice in US politics, and remains convinced that Vietnam has not been honest in accounting for missing US soldiers and airmen. The president's own position on the issue is particularly delicate because of his avoidance of military service in Vietnam. He accompanied his announcement yesterday with statements of support from 18 members of Congress who did serve in the war, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who was taken prisoner by the Vietnamese, and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who last year headed a Senate task force investigating the fate of the POW/MIAs. Mr Clinton said he would send a high-level mission to Hanoi to press for further progress on accounting for the POW/MIAs. The US has been working towards a more normal relationship with Vietnam along the lines of a 'road map' sketched out by former president George Bush, which linked economic and diplomatic concessions from the US to progress towards peace and free elections in neighbouring Cambodia, on which Vietnam has more than fulfilled its side of the bargain, and on the POW/MIAs. The administration must now convince the families of missing US servicemen that they are likely to obtain more answers from Vietnam by making further concessions than by maintaining an obdurate embargo. The European Commission yesterday said it was ready to open negotiations on a trade and co-operation pact with Vietnam, boosting the Hanoi regime's campaign to end its commercial isolation.</p>

			<p><P> October 2, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK AHEAD: ASOLO, ITALY;  </P> <P> TOUGH TOPICS FOR EUROPE  </P> <P> Foreign ministers of the 12-member European Community will tackle two tough  questions -- the Persian Gulf crisis and the political union of the Continent  -- at a special three-day meeting in the northern Italian town of Asolo  beginning Friday.  </P> <P> In a follow-up to the last EC summit meeting in Dublin, the foreign ministers  are expected to explore various plans for establishing a closer political  grouping among the nations of Western Europe -- a move resisted by Britain, and  more recently, West Germany.  </P> <P> That topic, however, will be overshadowed by discussions of the amount of  assistance the European nations should provide in the gulf crisis, and the  damage that a full-scale war could to do Western European economies.  </P></p>

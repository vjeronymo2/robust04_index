			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> REPORTERS OF AVOCADO THEFT GET THE GREEN  </P> <P> The California Avocado Commission has paid out more than $10,000 in the past  four months to 26 people statewide who reported or captured avocado thieves.  </P> <P> San Diego County residents took in about a third of the total $10,234 awarded.  </P> <P> The reward money is being disbursed from a $30,000 fund the commission  established in July. The reward is part of a $774,000 anti-theft program that  included the hiring of a three-member undercover investigation unit of county  sheriff's deputies.  </P> <P> Avocado theft became a lucrative enterprise as the wholesale price of avocados  in recent years approached and then exceeded $1 a pound, commission spokesman  Howard Seelye said.  </P> <P> In San Diego County, Valley Center was the avocado theft hotbed during the past  four months. The rural community was the scene of all five county thefts in  which witnesses intervened or took time to report what they saw to authorities.  </P> <P> Ten different San Diego County residents were given reward money in amounts  ranging from less than $100 to as much as $1,000, with the highest amounts  going to witnesses whose reports resulted in convictions.  </P> <P> In all, 19 thefts were reported in San Diego, Riverside and Ventura counties.  </P> <P> Cumulatively, the eyewitness reports led to the recovery of about $10,000 worth  of fruit that otherwise would have been sold on the black market.  </P> <P> The commission estimates thieves steal 5% to 10% of the state's annual crop, a  volume that, at this year's wholesale price of $2.25 per pound, is valued at  between $10 million and $20 million, Seelye said.  </P> <P> Tom Barbour, an inspection official, said the reward program and increased  publicity about avocado thefts has helped break the public's previous apathy  over the problem.  </P> <P> "What we're seeing is a heightened public interest in reporting avocado  thefts," Barbour said.  </P></p>

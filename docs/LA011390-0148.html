			<p><P> January 13, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> PROPOSAL WOULD CUT APARTMENT DENSITY  </P> <P> Overcrowding in Santa Ana could be reduced by amending the city's general plan  to curb construction of high-density apartment projects, according to city  planners.  </P> <P> A proposed amendment, already approved by the Planning Commission, would slice  the number of apartment units from 35 to 15 per acre in the city's downtown and  Civic Center areas.  </P> <P> Other sections of the city are already limited to seven units per acre.  </P> <P> The City Council is scheduled to hold a public hearing on the amendment at its  next meeting Tuesday.  </P> <P> A staff report to the City Council said that overcrowding in Santa Ana has been  caused by housing developments with large numbers of units. The high-density  projects lead to "on-street parking and circulation problems, increased demand  for emergency services and rapid deterioration of these properties due to  overcrowding and inadequate maintenance," the staff report said.  </P> <P> Passage of the amendment would affect 19 housing projects that are in various  stages of city approval. Six of the projects, which already have been approved,  would be allowed under a grandfather clause.  </P> <P> In December, the Planning Commission approved the proposed amendment 5 to 0,  with two commissioners absent.  </P> <P> Three years ago the city had adopted an amendment cutting the allowable  apartment density from 90 units to 35 in all neighborhoods except those  designated as development areas.  </P> <P> Several neighborhood associations have been pushing for limitations on  high-density apartment buildings, particularly those in higher crime areas. In  1986, the East Side Assn., which is made up of about 100 residents,  successfully persuaded the city to reduce the apartment density in its section  of town after a number of apartment complexes were built there and the crime  rate increased.

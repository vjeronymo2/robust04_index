			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Russia has asked Finland for information on the  activities of two Finnish organizations. HELSINGEN SANOMAT  newspaper reported on Saturday [15 January] that the Russian  Embassy in Helsinki had submitted a written note to the Finnish  Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Monday, asking if the Patriotic  National League, the IKL, and the Greater Finland Association  were compatible with the stipulations of the Paris peace treaty.  Under the terms of that agreement, Finland disbanded a number  of nationalist and right-wing organizations which the Soviet  Union considered to be fascist. The IKL is modeled after a  political party that was banned after the last war. The  initials of the organization are the same, however the name is  slightly different. The Greater Finland organization has been  collecting signatures on a petition calling for the return of  territories ceded to the Soviet Union at the end of the war.    Finland's Minister of Foreign Affairs Heikki Haavisto said  the Russian note did not come as a surprise. Top Ministry of  Foreign Affairs officials say the Russian note cannot be  considered a serious issue. They say that when they answer the  note, the Finns will say that the two organizations in question  will be dealt with according to Finnish law alone and that the  organizations do not violate the Paris peace treaty.    Raimo Ilaskivo, the Conservative candidate in Finland's  presidential election, expressed surprise about the Russian  note, particularly concerning its timing, the day before the  first round in the voting of the presidential election. He said  one cannot avoid the question of whether or not the note is an  attempt to influence the outcome of the voting. Prime Minister  Esko Aho said he did not feel the note would have any impact on  Finland's presidential election. Center Party presidential  candidate Vayrynen, meanwhile, said he was surprised by the  note, and did not feel the two organizations in question were in  violation of the Paris peace treaty. Defense Minister Elisabeth  Rehn, the Swedish People's Party candidate, does not consider  the note any interference in Finland's internal affairs.  [passage omitted]    Yuriy Deryabin, the Russian ambassador in Finland, insists  that the note is not linked in any way to Sunday's presidential  election or to the electoral success of Russian ultranationalist  Vladimir Zhirinovskiy. In an interview with YLE television  news, Mr. Deryabin says that the first inquiry concerning the  two organizations was made in May, and was repeated after no  reply came to the first one. He also said the note does not  call for disbanding the organizations and, contrary to the days  of Soviet power, Russia does not interfere in Finland's internal  affairs.    On Friday, meanwhile, Andrey Nikolayev, the commander of  Russia's border guard, denounced what he sees as nationalist  forces in neighboring countries inciting anti-Russian sentiment.  He said ultranationalist groups in Finland, the Baltic  republics, and elsewhere are working to change the present  borders. YLE political correspondent Pentti Lumme says the note  is a reminder by Russia that the Paris peace treaty is still in  force. Finland unilaterally canceled sections of the treaty,  placing limits on its military, but other sections remain in  force, including those banning fascist organizations.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CALIFORNIA VOTERS APPROVE NEW SPENDING FOR ROADS AND RAILS  </P> <P> Looking at the primary ballot, I am again convinced that Californians do not  need a state Legislature.  </P> <P> What we really need are more supermarkets, where even more people can get our  signatures on new propositions for the next election. Is this democracy at its  best? I doubt it. Ballot propositions seem to create distortion of facts,  confusion, visual pollution with billboard ads and prejudice, all contradictory  to rational government.  </P> <P> There are some positive results, however. The California Supreme Court and a  legion of lawyers are guaranteed perpetual employment, as they unravel the  constitutional soundness of all those propositions.  </P> <P> RENATA B. MULRY  </P> <P> Carlsbad  </P></p>

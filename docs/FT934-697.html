			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Arts: Today's Television The wildlife series made by David Attenborough over the past 15 years, beginning with Life On Earth, constitute one of the most impressive and important bodies of work ever undertaken for television. Today brings the final episode of Life In The Freezer, a series about Antarctica which has sustained and sometimes surpassed the extraordinarily high standards set by Attenborough and the BBC's Bristol Natural History Unit in their previous programmes (8.00 BBC1). Television has been as influential as any other factor in driving back the celebration of the winter solstice to the pre-religious roots from which it sprang. Christmas Time In Vienna is a concert starring Placido Domingo, Dionne Warwick, and Ruggero Raimondi. Some of their songs may well have Christian origins, but that seems fortuitous: this is entertainment rather than an expression of faith (8.00 BBC2). Word of mouth suggests you should not encourage the children to stay up for The Secret Adventures Of Tom Thumb which is said to be both'adult' and occasionally depressing (9.30 BBC2).</p>

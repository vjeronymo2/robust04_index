			<p>930313 FT  13 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK engineering This week's clutch of engineering company results once more showed the corrosive effect of advance corporation tax on foolhardy companies which earn profits overseas. Given that the chancellor is strapped for cash, there is unlikely to be much help on Tuesday, despite the government's hollow rhetoric about overseas trade. Still, at least most of the companies seem to have learned one lesson from the last recession. They cut costs early and used real business levels, rather than Mr Lamont's claims on the economy, as a strategic guide. Other defensive measures have been less well rewarded. International diversification has meant that companies which had to endure the long Anglo-Saxon recession will now have to follow on with a long continental European decline. While distorted, January and February's 23 per cent fall in continental car sales is a chilling indication of how bad things might get. And despite the strengthening US recovery, the UK car component manufacturers' greater exposure to Europe will mean another very tough year ahead. The flawed logic of balancing aerospace interests with motoring business has been exposed by the severe downturn in both areas. Rumblings from Boeing suggest that it will have to cut production once more. The clearest victim of these problems is Lucas, which has yet to report. It is slap-bang in the target zone, has been persistently over-optimistic about trading and held back from cutting costs. Small wonder that it is proving tough to find a new chief executive.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Action Committee for Renewal and </F> Togolese Union for Democracy in Lome on 12 April]    [Text] After learning with surprise on 11 April that by a  presidential decree signed on 6 April the government has decided  to organize by-elections in the constituencies of Loti 1, Wawa  1, and Wawa 2, the Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and  Togolese Union for Democracy [UTD] state the following:    1. The two parties wish to stress that Article 155 of the  Togolese electoral laws provides for by-elections, quote, only  in case of vacancy as a result of death, resignation, or  appointment of a candidate's alternate to any other post  incompatible with his status, unquote. Therefore, the three  challenged constituencies cannot be a pretext for the government  to organize by-elections in the these constituencies in order to  (?accept) new candidates. Annulling a poll can only lead to  fresh elections for candidates who previously stood for the same  elections. It is, therefore, surprising that the  above-mentioned decree makes people believe that there could be  two rounds of election in the constituencies, where the second  round of the previous elections was challenged by the Supreme  Court's constitutional chamber.    2. The CAR and UTD also consider that only a government duly  formed after the 6 and 20 February elections, in accordance with  the Togolese Constitution, can organize any by-elections or  fresh elections, but not the outgoing government.    3. The CAR and UTD are surprised that the outgoing  government  published a decree organizing elections in the three  constituencies in question at a time when the head of state is  trying, along with the leaders of the parliamentary majority, to  find ways of resolving the institutional crisis that resulted  from the rejection of these three invalid constituency results.    4. The CAR and UTD regret that after attempts to withhold  the  results of five constituencies, the outgoing government is doing  everything to overthrow the parliamentary majority obtained by  the opposition and to deprive the people of their victory.  Despite the negative maneuvers of certain troublemakers, who  have been identified and who should have been brought before a  court, the elections were described as satisfactory by all the  international observers.    5. The CAR and UTD, considering all the above, denounce the  organization of so-called by-elections by the outgoing  government on the basis of the 6 April decree.    6. The CAR and UTD urge the head of state to continue to  seek  a political solution with the leaders of the parliamentary  majority in order to put an end to the suffering of the people.    Signed by attorney Yaovi Agboyibor for the CAR and Edem  Kodjo  for the UTD.</p>

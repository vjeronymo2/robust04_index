			<p>940219 FT  19 FEB 94 / Machine tool chief quits after early retirement row The boss of Okuma, a leading Japanese machine tool maker, and two directors, yesterday resigned after a row with the government over plans to lower the company's compulsory retirement age. The move highlights the political and social constraints on Japanese companies' attempts to cut costs during the recession. The Labour Ministry has warned other employers not to follow Okuma's example. Mr Yutaka Maeda, Okuma's president who resigned, applied last month for permission temporarily to lower the company retirement age from 60 to 56, to help reduce losses, expected to more than double to Y12bn in the year to March. The plan had the backing of Okuma's company union. This provoked a rare warning from Mr Chikara Sakaguchi, Minister of Labour, that the plan would be socially harmful. He plans to submit a bill to parliament setting the retirement age at 60. Okuma's move was controversial because it challenged Japan's social contract of a job for life in return for lifetime loyalty. Earnings tend to rise with age, rather than merit, so people taking early retirement often make a bigger sacrifice than European or US equivalents. Okuma has promised to restore the retirement age to 60 when its earnings improve, said a ministry official.</p>

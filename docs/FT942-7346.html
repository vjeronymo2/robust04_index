			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / World Trade News: TCI, Sumitomo in Japan deal TCI, the US cable TV operator, and Sumitomo, the Japanese trading house, have agreed to set up two new joint ventures in Japan to operate cable TV companies and supply programme software, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo. The two companies will set up a cable TV operator to oversee the operations of Sumitomo's portfolio of cable TV companies in Japan as well as any others the company might acquire. Sumitomo has an equity stake in 26 cable TV companies with a total of 132,000 household subscribers. The other joint venture company will provide programmes to cable TV companies, take charge of the TV shopping business Sumitomo and TCI are considering, and set up new TV channels. The capital of the two new companies will total Dollars 500m (Pounds 333.3m), with Sumitomo investing the bulk of funds and TCI investing up to the maximum allowed to a foreign company. Recent deregulation moves by Japan's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications increased the permissible foreign equity level to one-third.</p>

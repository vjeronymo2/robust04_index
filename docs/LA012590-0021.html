			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> ENCINITAS BEACH GOES TO DOGS, WITH CITY'S HELP  </P> <P> The Encinitas City Council voted Wednesday night to allow dogs to run unleashed  along Beacon's Beach for a six-month trial period but limited the hours during  the summer.  </P> <P> In a unanimous vote, the five-member council decided that dogs would have their  day during the fall and winter months but that between Memorial Day and Labor  Day they would be restricted to morning and evening hours. Dogs can run  unleashed from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m., giving working  owners of dogs ample time to exercise their pets.  </P> <P> The council, with about 100 people in attendance, also decided to change the  location of the dog beach, deciding to map a three-quarter-mile area from  Beacon's Beach north to Grandview Beach, an area the council said was  less-populated by non-dog owners. The city's Parks and Recreation Commission  had recommended that the dog beach stretch from Beacon's Beach south to the  Stone Steps access.  </P> <P> The decision becomes effective in March.  </P> <P> City officials had expected the strong turnout for the meeting after proponents  on both sides of the issue began making phone calls and circulating flyers to  stir up support for the issue in recent days.  </P> <P> On Wednesday night, more than 30 residents spoke out on the issue including  animal advocates, surfers, grade schoolers, construction workers, lifeguards, a  lawyer and a doctor.  </P> <P> Two-thirds of the speakers were in favor of the dog beach and denied claims  that the dogs andtheir owners would cause either health hazards or traffic  tie-ups in the North County city.  </P> <P> Dr. Brad Schwartz told the council that, in his years as a practicing  physician, he had never seen a disease transmitted from a animal to a person  through dog droppings. He also said he had never seen a case of dog bite from  any North County beach. Running dogs there reduces their stress. he said.  </P> <P> "By allowing dogs on the beach, you may even reduce the number of dog bites in  the city." Cita Walsh told the council that dogs on a beach are part of the  American way.  </P> <P> "I've never seen poop go unscooped, and never seen a person who hadn't stopped  to pet my collie and smile," said the La Costa resident, adding that she and  her pet are regular Beacon's Beach users. "The issue of dogs at Beacon's Beach  is what's America is all about. I'd be surprised if you didn't see McDonald's  and Pepsi begin shooting commercials there."  </P> <P> Dog owners said the beach provides the perfect area for people to exercise  their pets in an area not threatened by automobile traffic. About a dozen dog  owners cleaned up the beach in weeks before the meeting and fashioned plastic  pooper-scoopers to be left at the beach for public use.  </P> <P> Other residents, however, claim the animals not only cause a nuisance with  their constant barking and excrement but are threatening the ecologically  sensitive bluffs with their constant running.  </P> <P> The controversy began last summer before the county turned over to Encinitas  operation of several miles of coastal beaches including Beacon's. In June, the  City Council asked the Parks and Recreation Commission to review the issue and  make a recommendation.  </P> <P> The county had allowed leashed dogs on the beach and even looked the other way  when the animals roamed freely, dog owners said.  </P> <P> The parks and recreation board formed an ad hoc committee of proponents of both  sides of the issue and met for a public hearing in October. In the meantime,  dogs were allowed unleashed on Beacon's Beach.  </P> <P> At that meeting, the Parks and Recreation Commission, by a 5-2 vote,  recommended that unleashed dogs be allowed to run on the three-quarter-mile  stretch of beach between Beacon's Beach and the Stone Steps access.  </P> <P> The group also recommended that owners be required to stay with their pets and  clean up any excrement.  </P> <P> Detractors of the measure warned that the dogs might pose a danger to coastal  birds and marine mammals washed ashore, as well as elderly people making the  somewhat steep descent from the parking lot of Beacon's Beach.  </P> <P> But not all council members were buying such dire forecasts.  </P> <P> "It's all fear, and I'm having a hard time buying all of it," Councilwoman  Marjorie Gaines said of the concerns before Wednesday night's meeting. "The  beach has traditionally been a place where people have a sense of freedom.  We've got too many regulations already."  </P> <P> Gaines, who owns four dogs, said she can understand why people might want the  animals along for protection. She cited two rapes that occurred on the beach in  the last three years, one in broad daylight.  </P></p>

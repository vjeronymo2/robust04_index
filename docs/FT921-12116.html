			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries quiet ahead of State of the Union address A RELUCTANCE to trade heavily before this evening's State of the Union address by President George Bush left Treasury prices little changed in light trading yesterday. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  3/32 at 103 7/32 , yielding 7.716 per cent. The two-year note, however, was down 1/16 at 99 13/32 , to carry a yield of 5.175 per cent. Although most of the details of Mr Bush's annual address have been reported in the press, the bond market remains concerned about the extent of any tax cuts announced by the President. In particular, the investors and dealers are worried that heavy tax cuts could overheat the economy and revive inflationary pressures, and they are worried that national deficit could widen as a result of over-generous fiscal fine-tuning. Market participants also had an eye yesterday on the latest Conference Board consumer confidence index, which will be published this morning, and more important economic statistics, including the January employment report which will be unveiled at the end of next week. The Conference Board is expected to report a modest decline in consumer confidence, while the unemployment rate is forecast to rise slightly in January from 7.0 per cent in December to 7.1 per cent. SHORT-DATED UK government bonds firmed slightly on hopes of a cut in interest rates, but long-dated issues ended the day slightly lower ahead of Wednesday's gilt auction. Traders said sterling's strength raised hopes of a half-point cut in the base rate, with the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 rising from its opening of 100 27/32 to 100 31/32 by late afternoon. The weekend's opinion polls - which showed the ruling Conservative party up to 3 points ahead of the Labour party, helped to lift long-dated gilt prices early in the day. However, longer-dated issues drifted back later, and the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening of 115 19/32 to 115 15/32 to yield 9.45 per cent. Volumes in the futures market were low at 7,000 contracts, and the Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 97.11 to 97.07 by late afternoon. Traders reported some buying of the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked stock due 2001 which the Bank of England announced for sale on Friday. The Bank is to sell two tranches of Pounds 150m each - the 2 1/2 per cent due 2001 and the 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilt due 2009. GERMAN government bonds slipped on low volumes during the day, with traders indicating little reaction to the Group of Seven nations' weekend meeting. The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 88.32, traded down to a low of 88.11 and ended the day at 88.13 on a volume of about 28,000 contracts. JAPANESE government bonds barely changed on the day after the weekend G7 meeting in New York produced no firm statement in support of a strong yen. The yield on the benchmark No 129 closed at 5.235 per cent, having traded in a narrow range of 5.225 per cent to 5.245 per cent on low volumes. Bankers and ministers at the meeting agreed to increase co-operation to strengthen global economic growth and to continue monitoring and co-operating in the foreign exchange markets. Traders said many bond market participants were waiting on the sidelines ahead of tomorrow's expected auction of 10-year government bonds. The Finance Ministry is expected to auction about Y800bn of the No 145 issue, which has a coupon of 5.5 per cent.</p>

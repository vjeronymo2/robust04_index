			<p>940423 FT  23 APR 94 / Finance and the Family: What it's all about Lord Palumbo is a millionaire property developer who stepped down early this month as chairman of the Arts Council just before details of a bitter family feud with James Palumbo and Annabella Adams, his son and daughter from his first marriage, became public knowledge. They issued a writ in England's High Court against the trustees of the Palumbo Family Settlement: their father, their Lebanese-born step-mother, accountant Thomas Tharby and solicitor John Underwood. It claims the four have benefited personally from their positions; have mismanaged trust assets; and that the inclusion as beneficiaries of Palumbo's three children by his second marriage is invalid. The Settlement was established in 1955 by Palumbo's father, Rudolph, to hold some of the fortune he made from developing wartime bomb sites in the City of London. Beneficiaries are Lord Palumbo and his children. At present, it contains about two-thirds of the Rugarth Investment Trust Ltd, the holding company for Palumbo's property assets. The other third is owned personally by him. The writ has come at a difficult time for Palumbo. He is about to start a controversial development of a key site in the City. Part of the finance is planned to come from the Settlement - at a time when the value of the Palumbo property assets reportedly has fallen by Pounds 30m (from Pounds 94m to Pounds 64m) in the past year.</p>

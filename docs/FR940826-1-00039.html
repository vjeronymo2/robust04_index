Background  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> End Stage Renal Disease Payment Exception Requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with section 1881(b)(2) and (b)(7) of the Act, a facility that furnishes dialysis services to Medicare patients with end stage renal disease is paid a prospectively determined rate for each dialysis treatment furnished. This rate is a composite that includes all costs associated with furnishing dialysis services except for the costs of physician services and certain laboratory tests and drugs, which are billed separately. The composite rate may be adjusted periodically to reflect actual facility costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> When a facility incurs higher costs, HCFA may, under certain conditions, grant the facility an exception to its composite rate and set a higher prospective rate. The facility must show, on the basis of projected cost and utilization trends, that it will have an allowable cost per treatment higher than its prospective payment rate and that the excess costs are attributable to one or more specific circumstances. These conditions are specified in existing regulations at 42 CFR 413.170 and are discussed in greater detail in Chapter 27 of HCFA's Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A facility may incur excess costs when it furnishes dialysis services to a patient population with a greater number of pediatric patients or sick patients, such as those with heart disease or unstable medical conditions, which require special equipment, procedures, supplies or staff trained in treating these patients. This is referred to as ``atypical service intensity'' or ``patient mix.'' A facility may also incur increased costs when it is the only supplier of dialysis services in its geographical area (an isolated essential facility), and its patients are unable to obtain dialysis services elsewhere without considerable hardship. Such an isolated facility may find it difficult to find trained staff, may have to pay employees additional wages or travel allowances, or may have to pay additional costs to have supplies shipped to the area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A facility may also incur excess costs as a result of a fire, earthquake, flood, or other natural disaster (extraordinary circumstances). However, we do not recognize those costs when a facility did not maintain adequate insurance, did not file a claim for losses covered by insurance, or did not use its self-insurance program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Increased training costs may also be associated with a facility's self-dialysis training program. A facility may train patients to perform self-dialysis with little or no professional assistance in the facility or at home. It may also train other individuals to assist patients in performing self-dialysis or home dialysis. A facility that has training costs greater than its composite training rate may apply for an exception, but must prove that the costs are reasonable and allowable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920516 FT  16 MAY 92 / International Company News: Paris plans Dollars 1.7bn sale of Total shares THE FRENCH government plans to sell FFr9.5bn (Dollars 1.7bn) worth of shares in Total, reducing its direct stake in the state controlled oil group to 5 per cent. This is by far the largest in the recent programme of partial privatisations, following the FFr2bn sale of a 2.3 per cent stake in Elf Aquitaine, Total's larger state-controlled rival, two months ago. It also marks the renunciation of the French state's 70-year-old policy of treating the country's oil companies as a strategic arm of France's energy policy. The government will sell through the Paris bourse 19 per cent of Total's shares, reducing the stake held by the state and the public sector from 34 per cent to 15 per cent. It will also surrender double voting rights held since the 1920s to reduce its votes to 5 per cent. By contrast, the state owns 51.5 per cent of Elf. France is selling parts of public industry mostly to help finance the growing budget deficit, set to rise from FFr135bn this year to FFr150bn next. It has also sold shares recently in Credit Local de France, a public authority bank. The Total sell-off took the market by complete surprise. The shares closed yesterday, before the announcement, at FFr260, capitalising Total at FFr50bn or ten times this year's estimated earnings. The government has chosen a good moment in Total's fortunes to announce its privatisation. Last month the group announced a 41.5 per cent rise in 1991 profits to FFr5.8bn after tax. However, uncertainty hangs over the future of its chairman, Mr Serge Tchuruk, whose three-year mandate expires next February. In theory, it is up to the government to decide his replacement, though it was not clear yesterday whether the state will keep this right after the share sale. As part of the sell-off, the government is also offering to exchange non-voting shares, or certificats petroliers, for ordinary shares at a rate of four for three.</p>

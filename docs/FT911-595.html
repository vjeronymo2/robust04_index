			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / Government Bonds: Treasuries shrug off fall in US unemployment claims US TREASURIES traded in a narrowly mixed range yesterday in a market that was largely untouched by weak bidding at the Treasury's 30-year bond auction and by a drop in last week's initial claims for state unemployment insurance. In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was  1/32 higher at 96 1/8 , yielding 8.22 per cent after dropping on news of the disappointing auction. Shorter-dated maturities ended the day unchanged to  1/32 higher. The revival in bond prices was attributed to optimism about today's release of April's producer price index. The Federal Reserve once again refrained from operating in the open market and Fed funds traded at the 5 per cent level. The Fed's perceived target for the rate is 5 3/4 per cent. The Fed has not intervened since Monday, when it arranged three-day matched sales when Fed funds were trading at 5 3/4 per cent. During the morning the Labor Department reported that initial unemployment claims had fallen by 45,000 to 455,000 in the week ended April 27. But the market shrugged off the signs that the economy may not be deteriorating and turned its attention to the afternoon's auction of Dollars 11.75bn in 30-year bonds, in the final stage of the record Dollars 37bn quarterly refunding. Players had anticipated strong overseas demand in the afternoon auction, with expectations that the Japanese would be active bidders. But bidding was exceptionally light, with a bid/cover ratio of 1.48 compared with an average of 2.03. AN auction yesterday of Y300bn of 20-year Japanese government bonds carrying a 6.8 per cent coupon was moderately well received. Although JGB prices edged up during the day, the market is worried that a flood of new corporate issues in the next few days may depress prices. The average price for the new 20-year no 16 JGB was 99.3, yielding 6.88 per cent, and the lowest accepted price was 99.15, yielding 6.9 per cent. Traders said that the length of the tail - of 2 basis points - indicated a moderate demand for the new issue, which was taken up by the main Japanese securities houses. The Electric Power companies are expected to issue between Y300bn-Y400bn over the next few days. The yield on the benchmark no 129 10-year bond opened at 6.7 per cent, moving to 6.675 per cent before closing at 6.68 per cent in Tokyo. THE UK government bond market focused yesterday on rumours that the Bank of England was about to announce a new issue of stock. Now that the tap stock - the 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2008 - has been exhausted, the market expects the government to press ahead with its funding programme, possibly with the issue of a conventional 10-year gilt or an index-linked stock. Prices in the gilts market edged up slightly in the morning then slipped to finish little changed. Traders said the increase in longer-dated gilt prices was due mainly to the fact that the supply of 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2008 is no longer hanging over the market. At the shorter end of the market, expectations of a base rate cut soon have already been discounted. WHILE many of the European government bond markets were closed yesterday, interest in Spanish and Italian government bonds remained strong as investors expect to see interest rate cuts in both markets shortly. Spanish government bonds rose yesterday with the yield on the 12 1/4 per cent bond due 2000 falling from 11.65 per cent to 11.62 per cent, while the yield on the 13.45 per cent bond due 1996 fell from 12.03 per cent to 11.99 per cent. Traders said that Spain's inverse yield curve has grown steeper in recent weeks as the long end of the market has outperformed the short end.</p>

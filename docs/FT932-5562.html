			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Accountancy Column: 'True and fair view' still defies precise definition / A look at the background to the most powerful and evocative phrase in accountancy THERE IS a phrase in accountancy just a few words long, which wields tremendous - almost religious - power and yet defies precise definition. A new publication from the Accounting Standards Board this week has vested it with extra authority. It is 'a true and fair view'. Everyone cites it. Few accountants would be willing to sacrifice it. But attempts to get people to define what it means lead only to a sharp intake of breath and a marked silence. True and fair has a long history and considerable current significance. It appears in company legislation. It crops up in the audit reports attached to British company accounts. It is used to justify deviations from existing rules. It is the ultimate invocation of the high priests of accountancy, a mantra used to explain unusual practices, an elusive concept shrouded in mystique and removed from the sullying influence of the dirty day-to-day practicality of accounting standards. 'True and fair is the foundation of contemporary accounting practice,' says Mr Michael Fowle, head of audit at KPMG Peat Marwick. 'It doesn't have a meaning which is precise, but you know when you see something that is untrue. It would be difficult in a debate with a client without it, when you just have a feeling in your waters that something isn't right.' But it is also a phrase open to considerable abuse. As Christopher Nobes, professor of accounting at the University of Reading, sceptically suggests, the use of the phrase 'to present more fairly' in the notes to accounts when diverging from standards is often a clear indication of the complete opposite - that something shady is going on. 'True and fair' has been given new relevance with a legal opinion by Ms Mary Arden, QC, now a judge, published today as an appendix to the Accounting Standards Board's draft 'Foreword to accounting standards'. The Arden opinion is one of the few instances in which lawyers have encroached into the sacrosanct territory of the accountants. The previous example was a similar joint opinion produced by her and Mr Leonard Hoffmann  -now also a judge - in 1983, and supplemented a year later. The new version is a delight to the ears of Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the board. He believes that it invests him with a new-found authority. 'It is a great leap forward,' he says. 'Before we could not move.' The original Hoffmann and Arden opinion cast doubt on how far the Accounting Standards Committee - the board's predecessor - and the statements of standard accounting practice it produced would be heeded in the courts when considering the 'true and fair view' required by company legislation. In the subsequent decade, Mary Arden argues that there has been considerable change. She cites the single court case which has touched on the topic - Lloyd Cheyham v Littlejohn - which vested the old committee with credibility in the eyes of the judge, Mr Justice Woolf. She argues that the wider funding and membership of the Accounting Standards Board compared with the committee - which was essentially controlled by the accountancy profession - will add to the legitimacy of its standards in the eyes of the court. That may be good news for David Tweedie, but it does little to enlighten the uninitiated. In good folksy tradition, stories abound over the sacred phrase. An oft-told tale relates how the captain of a ship, exasperated by the fondness of his first mate for the bottle, wrote in the log 'the mate was drunk last night'. To which the mate appended, nursing his morning hangover, 'the captain was sober today' - a true but hardly fair statement. In a speech 10 years ago, David Flint, an academic, called the phrase 'at the lowest level of its utility, a safety valve, protecting users from bias, inadequacy or deficiency in the rules; a fail-safe device for the unavoidable shortcomings of prescription. Its real utility is in establishing an enduring conceptual standard . . . to ensure that there is always relevant disclosure based on independent professional judgment.' Yet the phrase, just like the issue of audit negligence, remains all but untested legally, let alone satisfactorily described by commentators. It remains an elusive rainbow - a beautiful concept, but one which is difficult to describe and impossible to touch. It has been aptly dubbed 'a term of art'. Mr Fowle says he would love to see it debated in the courts. 'I just wish all the other firms would create the case law.' Mary Arden herself says the phrase is 'a dynamic concept . . . subject to continuous rebirth'. As a special edition of the European Accounting Review out this month shows, 'true and fair' is neither as long-standing over time or as wide-ranging over space as might at first be believed. Peter Walton from the London School of Economics, shows that 'true and fair' was only introduced in the 1947 Companies Act. The 1844 Joint Stock Companies Act first called for a 'full and fair' balance sheet, and the 1879 Companies Act for auditors to state whether it gave a 'full and correct' view. It was British pressure that introduced the concept into the EC's fourth directive, so that the final version in 1978 requires a true and fair view of the company's assets, liabilities, financial position and results. As other papers in the journal show, how this phrase is translated, let alone interpreted, in the different EC countries, varies widely. It has been in place since 1984 as image fidele in France, for example, but with no discernible impact. In Britain, 'true and fair' is what British accountants declare it to be, but in the EC, it will be whatever the European Court decides, warns one German writer. Mr Fowle cites a case of a company which translated its borrowings in Brazil 'wrongly' over several years but in line with accounting standards. He permitted it to continue until the sum rose to 15 per cent of profits, at which point he threatened to qualify the accounts unless the practice was changed. The difficulty is that for every such case during the 1980s, there were many more in which clients were able to defy - or even be assisted by - their auditors in interpreting standards strictly by the letter and not by the spirit of 'true and fair'. As Mr Chris Swinson, a partner with Stoy Hayward, says: 'I feel very uncomfortable with a concept that people find useful in practice but is difficult to define. The impression it gives of absolute truth is not helpful. I have always liked the New World phrase 'presents fairly' instead.' 'True and fair' offers a false sense of security to users of accounts, and a way for accountants to justify their own privileged professional position. That is not to say a thick US-style 'rulebook' - the alternative threatened by Mr Tweedie - would be any better. Legal opinions like Mary Arden's have their uses, but they also have limitations. A recent one by Mr Richard Sykes for Touche Ross over Trafalgar House's reclassification of assets did nothing to prevent the company being reprimanded by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, for instance. At the moment, the board has a fragile legitimacy for 'true and fair' in law which does little to raise it above a meaningless mantra. If it reaches the courts, the board had better hope the case goes to the sympathetic ears of Mrs Justice Arden and Lords Hoffmann and Woolf in the House of Lords on appeal.</p>

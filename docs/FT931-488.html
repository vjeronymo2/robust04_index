			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley advances health strategy paper MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, (above) was keynote speaker at a conference yesterday advancing a paper by her department outlining its Health of the Nation strategy. Meanwhile the Labour party is claiming today that a majority of self-governing trust hospitals ban the public and press from board meetings. A survey carried out by Labour on accountability in NHS hospital trusts showed that among 'first wave' trusts, 50 per cent had not held board meetings, apart from the statutory annual general meeting, which the public and press could attend. Among 'second wave' trusts the figure was 59.3 per cent. Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, claimed trust boards were being packed with Tory nominees. He said the statutory requirement to hold one public meeting per year to discuss the annual report and accounts should be reviewed.</p>

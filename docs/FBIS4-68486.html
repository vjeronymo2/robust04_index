			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Eduard Gazizovich Umarov, chairman </F> of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization of the  Consolidation Party; place and date not given: "Consolidation?  So, Then, We Can Breathe Easy..."]    [Text] "You would like to see our republic wealthy,  attractive, prosperous? You would be pleased to see the  appearance of a whole network of new enterprises and hundreds  and thousands of extra jobs? You would take pride in seeing  shops treating wool and garment factories operating in stable  fashion? The burgeoning of mining industry in our abundant  region with its priceless minerals? High-quality machine tools  not hacking up but cutting the Khabaz and Bezengi stone  according to specifications? And there is hardly a fellow  countryman who would not want to turn the Elbrus region into a  second Switzerland, if not better. The currency resources of  foreigners involved in business, whom we are not as yet "luring"  to the center of our beauties to the republic's benefit, would  help here....    "And if you want all this, if you are interested in people's  relations being not on a national and political basis but  according to professional attributes, with a keen desire for  property, peace, and prosperity, come to us!"    This was the conclusion of the sincere and ardent  introduction to an interview with Eduard Gazizovich Umarov,  chairman of a new party registered by the Kabardino-Balkar  Republic Ministry of Justice on 3 February 1994. It is called  the Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization of the Consolidation  Party.    Here are some extracts from its rules: "The KBRO  [Kabardino-Balkar Republic Organization] of the Consolidation  Party is a political organization voluntarily uniting in its  ranks citizens of the Russian Federation who are permanent  residents on the territory of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic and  who recognize the program and rules of the party and also the  rules of the KBRO of the party....    ...The main goals... are:    the revival of Russia as a distinctive, historically  unique state and of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic as a component  of the Russian Federation uniting in peace and harmony people of  different nationalities, religious beliefs, and professional,  social, and property position on the principles of democratism,  civic unity, patriotism, equal opportunities, the priority of  the highest value--human dignity--and responsibility for the  country and the fate of future generations.    To achieve the said goals... it will participate in  elections to the representative organs of power and local  government, with its own slate of candidates for deputy  included, take part in the established procedure in the  formation of the organs of state power and administration and  also local government, and exercise legislative initiative;    appear in the news media and the party press....    maintain direct contacts and relations among public and  political organizations of other components of the Russian  Federation....    create research, analytical, and sociological centers  for the study of public opinion, the needs and requirements of  the citizens...."    The rules say also that a citizen of Russia who has attained  to the age of 18 and who recognizes the rules of the KBRO of the  party, who renders it support, and who is a permanent resident  on the territory of the Kabardino-Balkar Republic may be a  member of the KBRO of the Consolidation Party.    Party members do not pay dues. The monetary resources and  other assets of the KBRO of the party, the rules say, shall be  formed thanks to the voluntary contributions of organizations  and citizens and income from its own industrial-economic and  publishing activity and also from other receipts authorized by  legislation.    At an organizational session of the new party (its action  committee was made up of about 30 persons) those who spoke noted  the vital nature of the party's base principles. They said that  its program would determine the prospects of the socioeconomic  development of the country and, consequently, of our republic  also.    Of course, I immediately inquired after the sources of the  event, how and in what connection the party chairman had  conceived of its creation in Kabardino-Balkaria, and what  altogether the Consolidation Party of Russia represents.    Instead of answering, Eduard Gazizovich showed me the  journal  DELOVYYE LYUDI with a striking, well-designed cover. It  contained a portrait of Aleksandr Tikhonov, the prominent  Russian entrepreneur and general director of the Interural  Enterprise. He has been chairman of the Consolidation Party of  Russia since October 1992, apparently.    "An entrepreneur in politics?" I expressed surprise.    Here my interlocutor smiled silently. He then showed me a  page of the newspaper KURANTY:    "A journalist put to the person himself, Tikhonov, the same  question...."    Much did, indeed, become clear from a reading of Aleksandr  Anatolyevich's interview with a KURANTY correspondent.    The Interural Enterprise is a multiprofile enterprise and it  has been involved in the production and exports of metal  products, the development and assimilation of new technology,  wood processing, and the production of building materials and  consumer goods. It is apparent that business has been oriented  toward the realization of social programs. Modern installations  for the packing of meat and equipment for the production of  sanitary engineering apparatus have been purchased, clothing is  made up, and nails and cement are manufactured. In Nizhniy  Tagil, where mountains of slag had grown up, its conversion was  organized together with German and Swiss firms. But...  enterprise has become increasingly difficult. The preposterous  taxes are unsettling people. It was then that the idea of  becoming involved in politics, which formulate the rules of the  game, began to mature. After all, it can be seen more clearly  "from inside" what kind of laws should emanate from the state so  that those who are responsible for the economy might breathe  more freely. It should dictate the rules to the politicians, not  the other way about. Tikhonov believes that it is very important  to create in Russia a procedure which would encourage  production, not throw wrenches in its works. And I am sure that  the activity of a highly skilled, honest entrepreneur might even  lead to some amendment in the law which would improve the work  of the enterprise and the ordinary worker.    For this reason he created a party, as he said, with a  unifying principle--creation is possible only in a stable  society. I do not understand, Tikhonov said, the politicians--of  both right and left--who are exacerbating the situation in the  country!    The Consolidation Party advocates a diversity of forms of  property and a multistructured rural economy and everything  being done intelligently. At the end of the interview the  chairman of the Consolidation Party of Russia shared with the  KURANTY correspondent recollections of how he, as an  entrepreneur, had frequently traveled abroad. And had seen the  following picture: In one room the politicians of two countries  were negotiating, in another, businessmen from both sides. And  before the adoption of a political decision, the first would  inquire of the second: We have now considered questions with a  bearing on such-and-such economic problems; what is best here?  And the latter would make suggestions....    "Eduard Gazizovich," I tore myself away from the newspaper  article, "the idea that the most adept politicians could emerge  from the ranks of entrepreneurs is clear to everyone. But let us  return to our party. How might Aleksandr Anatolyevich Tikhonov  help it, a branch of the Russian party, initially?"    "Everything will depend primarily on us, on an expansion of  the circle of business people wishing to join the party. Not  simultaneously and not all at once but certain heights may be  scaled and ties to overseas firms established. We need to create  an original economic basis. To strengthen our intermediary role  in the organization of foreign tourism via Interural, say.    "Foreigners involved in business would be told that people  are not fighting each other here. They would prepare tourist  packages for us, we would drive them around here and offer  billionaires family recreation in the mountains of the Elbrus  region and at the Goluboye lakes and Chegem waterfalls. We  would, crudely speaking, force out foreign currency, which we  would immediately allocate for social needs. Tikhonov has  connections with the countries that have the most modern  drilling equipment, rock drills (Italy, Germany), Swedish  cars.... Of course, they will not invest a kopek for us in this  work unless there are dependable guarantees from the center. Our  membership of the Consolidation Party of Russia, which many of  the world's businessmen recognize, could be this distinctive  guarantee....    "Of course, in order to put things on as broad a footing as  possible, all of Russian power, we need to increase the number  of party members, explain to people the meaning of its work...."    "Eduard Gazizovich, you are known and respected in the  republic as an experienced, professional worker in the public  utilities sphere. If you have resolved to put your economic  knowledge at the service of policy, prosperity, and  consolidation, I would like to wish you well and wish you  success. Our newspaper always supports peaceful, profoundly  considered initiatives. And we will, most likely, meet several  times more for a discussion on this theme."    "I am sure of it. Only let people respond, may they wish to  realize our ideas together with us. My office number is 9-77-64.</p>

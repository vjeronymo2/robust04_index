			<p><P> May 26, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION BASEBALL QUARTERFINALS;  </P> <P> SPARKS HELPS IGNITE MONTCLAIR PREP, 11-9  </P> <P> Montclair Prep Coach Walt Steele will be the first to admit it wasn't pretty.  </P> <P> But in the playoffs, as he'll also tell you, aesthetics count for very little.  </P> <P> After surviving a 2 1/2-hour bus trip to the desert and nearly blowing a 10-run  lead in the final three innings, top-seeded Montclair Prep hung on to defeat  Beaumont, 11-9, in a Southern Section 1-A Division quarterfinal game Friday.  </P> <P> "We managed to survive," Steele said. "We let those guys back in the ballgame,  but we should've known that when you're in somebody else's backyard, they're  not going to back down."  </P> <P> Montclair Prep (23-3) took a commanding 11-1 lead in the fifth inning after  5-foot-9 center fielder Leland Sparks hit a grand slam, his second homer of the  season.  </P> <P> From there, Beaumont (17-10) scored four runs in the fifth to chase starter and  winner Kevin Grant (11-1). Beaumont added three runs in the sixth and one in  the seventh before senior Scott Saklad shut the door for his second save.  </P> <P> Sparks had two hits and five runs batted in. Teammate Andy Shaw had three hits,  and Jared Baumblatt and Keyaan Cook had two hits each.  </P> <P> In the semifinals on Tuesday, Montclair Prep will meet Paraclete, which  defeated Crossroads, 21-5, on Friday.  </P> <P> In other quarterfinal games:  </P> <P> 3-A DIVISION  </P> <P> La Serna 4, Saugus 3 -- La Serna scored the winning run when Saugus pitcher  Chris Hernandez hit Glen Huggins with a 1-and-1 pitch with one out and the  bases loaded in the bottom of the 11th inning.  </P> <P> Hernandez (7-3), a sophomore left-hander, replaced starter Doug Maggiora in the  ninth inning. With one out in the 11th, Jeff Ferguson and Bryan Dunnigan  singled and Willie Adams reached base on a fielder's choice to load the bases.  </P> <P> Senior Walter White was two for five with an RBI for Saugus (20-6-1). Pat Henry  was one for three with a run scored and an RBI.  </P> <P> 1-A DIVISION  </P> <P> Village Christian 3, Kern Valley 2 -- Senior left-hander Matt Bates was two for  three and scored two runs to lead Village Christian in a quarterfinal at Kern  Valley. Bates (8-0) also pitched six innings, allowed two runs and struck out  seven.  </P> <P> With Village Christian (17-6) leading, 3-1, in the bottom of the seventh, Bates  allowed a walk and a double to lead off the inning. He was relieved by Mark  Vail, who walked the first man he faced to load the bases.  </P> <P> Vail retired the next two batters via a strikeout and a fly ball, then walked  in a run to cut the lead to 3-2. Vail, a junior right-hander, ended the game  with a strikeout.  </P> <P> Fillmore 17, Tehachapi 7 -- Junior right-hander Anthony Chessani survived a  rocky start to pitch a complete game as the Flashes advanced to the semifinals  on Tuesday against Village Christian.  </P> <P> Fillmore, which reached the 1-A final last season, led, 7-3, after an inning  and a half, but Tehachapi scored three in the bottom of the second and one in  the third to tie. However, Chessani (10-1), who struck out five and scattered  12 hits, yielded only five hits after the third inning.  </P> <P> Chad Van Winkle, who was two for three, hit a pair of two-run home runs to lead  Fillmore.  </P> <P> Paraclete 21, Crossroads 5 -- Paraclete collected a season-high 20 hits to go  with a season-high run total in a quarterfinal game at Paraclete.  </P> <P> Scott Stewart led the Spirits' attack with three hits, including a two-run home  run in the second inning to give Paraclete (15-7) a 6-0 lead. Jason Williams  was two for three, including a double and a triple, with two RBIs. Jeff  Williams, Jason's twin, was three for five, and Andre Matalon was two for four.  </P> <P> SMALL SCHOOLS DIVISION  </P> <P> Rosamond 11, Queen of Angels 5 -- Felix Renteria was two for three, including a  run-scoring triple, for Queen of Angels (14-5). Eric Montijo added two hits and  two RBIs.  </P></p>

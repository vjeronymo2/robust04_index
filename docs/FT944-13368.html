			<p>941028 FT  28 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Wartsila in Jamaica power pact Finland's Wartsila Diesel Development is building a Dollars 96m floating power plant in southern Jamaica, and will sell the power to the national grid's state-owned operator. Construction of the 72MW plant begins next month and is scheduled for completion in September next year. The plant will be managed and the power sold by Jamaica Energy Partners, a Wartsila subsidiary. An explosion at the island's main power plant in June destroyed 120 MW of capacity, about a quarter of the island's needs. Canute James, Kingston</p>

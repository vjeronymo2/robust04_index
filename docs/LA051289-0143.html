			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOODALL IN PERSPECTIVE  </P> <P> Reading the article on Jane Goodall left me with a strange feeling  ("Spellbinding Advocate for Animals," by Beth Ann Krier, April 27).  </P> <P> Most people know who Jane Goodall is, more people than saw "Gorillas in the  Mist" I would venture to guess. National Geographic has always printed articles  about her work and its importance to our understanding of human behavior in  order that we perhaps could improve the quality of life on this planet. The  writer of this article is using phrases and descriptions that are really in my  opinion not at all appropriate to an article on Jane Goodall. "Seduces her  audiences" . . . "her fine boned hand" . . . "slim and elegant with her gray  hair pulled back in a simple ponytail . . . " these are fashion-like, artsy and  shallow descriptions, not needed since there is a photograph on the front page.  It really doesn't work for me in an article that should be informed and  scientific.  </P> <P> JANE STEVENS  </P> <P> Topanga  </P></p>

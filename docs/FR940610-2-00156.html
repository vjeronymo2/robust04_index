The approval order sets forth a description and discussion of the enhancements being made to the ID system and requires DTC to submit for each principal new feature the finalized rules and procedures in a proposed rule change filing under Section 19(b)(2) of the Act. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33679 (February 24, 1994), 58 FR 59283. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Letters from John Zupan, Chairperson, Bank Depository User Group, to Secretary, Commission (April 28, 1994), from George J. Minnig, Chairman, Securities Operations Division, Regulatory &amp; Clearance Committee of the Securities Industry Association, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (April 29, 1994), and from Lawrence Morillo, Senior Vice President, Pershing, Division of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corporation, to Jonathan G.

Letter from Dr. Keith B. Jarrett, President, Thomson Trading Services, Inc. (A Thomson Financial Services Company), to Jonathan A. [sic] Katz, Secretary, Commission (March 25, 1994) (``Thomson letter''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DTC's response to the Thomson letter disputed the statement that DTC's status as a registered securities depository creates an anticompetitive environment and precludes Thomson from providing electronic trade confirmation services. DTC also stressed that the Commission's review of the standing instruction database feature of the enhanced ID system was not the proper forum for the initial consideration of the propriety of SRO rules that require the use of a registered securities depository for the confirmation and acknowledgment of transactions in depository eligible securities. Letter from Carl H. Urist, Deputy General Counsel and Vice President, DTC, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission, (April 15, 1994) (``DTC's response''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission believes that the issues raised by the Thomson letter and DTC's response need not be resolved prior to the approval of the standing instruction database feature of the enhanced ID system. The Commission understands that discussions regarding Thomson's concerns are underway among Thomson, DTC, and the Securities Industry Association. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

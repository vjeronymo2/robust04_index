During "postperestroyka" the regional bosses have gained  strength on two occasions already. First, immediately after  August 1991 (the collapse of the CPSU) and the ensuing  Belovezhskoye agreement (the disbandment of Union structures),  when centrifugal sentiments increased and leaders of "Federation  components" (at that time the term was not yet in use), like  leaders of former Union republics, tried to take "as much powers  as they could lay their hands on" -- although nobody got very  far apart from Dudayev.    At that time the sovereignization of the regions was  hindered  by several circumstances.    First, the resistance of the new Russian authority, starting  from the president's supporters (Skokov, for example, or  Shakhray, who made considerable efforts to restrain the  autonomous entities which were part of the Federation) and  ending with deputies to the Supreme Soviet, where there were  clearly more supporters of a united Russia than supporters of  sovereignization or the creation of a Russian Republic within  the Russian Federation. Second, the chronic conflict between  the republics and the oblast leaders, who also stated their  demands to federal authority, which hardly facilitated the  sovereignization of future Federation components along national  and ethnic lines. Third, neither -- unlike a number of leaders  of former Union republics -- could rely on a wave of national  movements in their plans for and attempts at  self-determination...there was simply none of these in any  Russian region except Tatarstan.    The second wave of strengthening the regions came in fall  1993. It was then that the Russian president first realized --  in the struggle with the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet --  the need to intercept the regions and proposed the formation of  the Federation Council, which was on the point of starting to  form itself within the Constitutional Conference, and  centrifugal sentiments already predominated in it, unlike in  1991-1992 (by the end of 1992 most regional leaders realized  that sovereignization had no economic foundation and that  administratively too much, alas, revolves around the center),  although the fact that the Federation Council did not support  the president in October 1993 prompted October 1993 to happen  and especially prompted the political and commercial forces  behind it to disband the Federation Council simultaneously with  the Russian Federation Supreme Soviet.    Today we are observing the signs of the latest, third, wave  of activization by regional leaders. This wave promises to be  more fruitful (the "law of dialectics" -- development in a  spiral and the repetition of development that has taken place at  a higher level). First, it has a constitutional linchpin -- the  Federation Council of the Russian Federation Federal Assembly.  Second, there is some experience (unsuccessful experience is  experience nevertheless) of collaboration with federal authority.    The cause of May's activization of regional leaders was the  State Duma's adoption of the federal budget for 1994, or to put  it simply the distribution of state resources. While, for  instance, representatives of the fuel and energy complex, which  controls the government by drawing up the budget to suit itself,  are more or less satisfied with it, the military-industrial  complex was cut, the agrarian complex did not obtain what it  wanted either, and during the budget's adoption other sectors  simply were simply not noticed. The result was the snubbing of  regional leaders, "senators," including leaders of enterprises  which had been left with nothing. The effect was to turn the  Federation Council toward the regions and the  military-industrial complex; the appointment of N. Yegorov, head  of Krasnodar administration, as minister of national and  regional affairs; the rumors of Skokov's strengthened position,  who is apparently still in good standing with some regionals and  the defense sector; the meeting of leaders of interregional  economic associations, etc.  <H5>  What Can Be Predicted in This Situation? </H5>   Above all -- the start of a new phase of struggle in the  upper echelons of power. But not between, for instance, the  president and government or the president and parliament, but  between sectoral clans on the one hand and regional lobbyists on  the other, and also between sectoral groups themselves: THE  FUEL AND ENERGY COMPLEX AND THE BANKS AGAINST THE  MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX AND AGRARIANS. Of course, in the  upshot everything will turn into the latest confrontation  between the executive and legislative branches, but in fact the  main struggle will develop not according to the political but  the territorial-sectoral principle. The phase of struggle for  ideas (the outward, the ostensible) and for resources (the  essental) has ended and smoothly moved into the phase of  struggle EXCLUSIVELY FOR RESOURCES.    In October 1993 sectoral groups, or more precisely a sector  clan, the most powerful one, which is now in power -- the fuel  and energy complex -- relying for support on power [silovyye]  structures, financial circles, and the "Moscow grouping," got  the upper hand over the alliance of regional leaders and the  military-industrial complex. Now the figures of the raw  materials sector have fewer and fewer chances of stopping their  opponents.    The regionals and the military-industrial complex are on the  offensive. The well-known meeting between the president and  military-industrial complex representatives, culminating in the  signing of six presidential edicts which "revitalized" the  economy, was a clear concession to regional and sectoral (not  raw material) leaders.    For its part, the fuel and energy complex does not intend to  give in. On the contrary, it is counterattacking. Reserve  figures are already being "deployed": The mass media have  carried publicity for "Gazprom" leader R. Vyakhirev, V.  Kadannikov, leader of the "AvtoVAZ" joint-stock company, and B.  Berezovskiy, leader of the "LogoVAZ" joint venture (it is known  that the automobile sector is one of the most prosperous sectors  and its leaders are among the most loyal to the president and  premier), Yu. Shafranik, minister for the fuel and energy  complex, and certain other figures.    On Shafranik's initiative, the Association for Economic  Collaboration is being formed (the constituent assembly is  scheduled for 17 June), which is supposed to unite not only the  leaders of the oil and gas complex but also its representatives  in the Federation Council. This association will probably  become the most powerful lobby grouping in the Russian  parliament jointly with the "New Regional Policy" Duma faction,  led by V. Medvedev, president of the Union of Russian Oil  Industry Workers.    But not all representatives of financial circles support the  raw material producers (just as not all regionals support the  military-industrial complex). Many of them are keeping quiet  for the moment, adopting a wait-and-see attitude, trying to  understand the forces at work. Currently they are loyal to  Chernomyrdin but it is clear that in any event it is worth  thinking about mutual understanding with someone else. With  whom? Soskovets? Skokov? Luzhkov? Shumeyko? Shakhray?  Bankers are asking themselves these questions at all their  confidential gatherings and for the moment they prefer to keep  their finger on the pulse of most political groupings.    BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING OUR "RATING" IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN  ADJUSTMENTS.    Thus, there has been an improvement in the positions of  Shumeyko, who stepped up his efforts in the "proper" --  long-term -- direction; Skokov, around whom contacts between  regional elites and military-industrial complex leaders  apparently revolve; and Glazyev, who is also trying to defend  the interests of the military-industrial complex and  science-intensive sectors.    The ranks of the most influential leaders have been  augmented  by N. Yegorov, the new minister for nationality affairs and  regional policy (see table), and another two Yegorovs: Sergey  Yefimovich, president of the Association of Russian Banks, and  Mikhail Konstantinovich, Yerin's deputy. They are kept company  by M. Mityukov, first deputy chairman of the State Duma, who is  one of the leaders most loyal to the presidential team, which  means one of the most promising leaders, and who is being  considered, in particular, as a candidate for the post of  chairman of the Russian Constitutional Court.    State Duma Chairman I. Rybkin's rating is increasing. Not  because the Duma's importance and authority are increasing. The  Duma is simply a platform, an arena capable of turning an  activist -- whether of the Communist Party or Agrarian Party --  into a figure of nationwide scale. A newspaper specializing in  compiling ratings recently wrote that Yeltsin has two  alternatives: "In the current situation Chernomyrdin, in the  long term Zhirinovskiy." That is naive. V.V. [Vladimir  Volfovich Zhirinovskiy] will not do any better than he did 12  December. But as for the premier -- no comment.... Rybkin is  another matter. The modest, quiet Rybkin is now a real  alternative to the president. Provided, of course, as G.  Zyuhganov asserts, the "left-wingers" and patriots agree among  themselves about supporting a single candidate. Do not forget  that the biggest faction in the Duma is not the Liberal  Democratic Party of Russia (50 deputies) or "Russia's Choice"  (70 deputies) but the indivisible bloc of communists and  agrarians (100 deputies).    The list of candidates has also been augmented by such  figures as B. Nemtsov, head of Nizhniy Novgorod Administration;  V. Sergeyev, leader of the premier's press service; A. Livshits,  leader of the Russian Federation president's group of experts,  A. Bryachikhin, prefect of Moscow City's Western District; yet  another Yegorov (the fourth) -- Yevgeniy -- chief of Moscow  government's department for supporting and developing small and  medium-sized businesses; Yu. Petrov, chief of the State  Investment Corporation, who has preserved his links with the  presidential team; G. Satarov, the president's assistant for the  Federal Assembly, who easily finds a common language with the  most diverse political groupings; V. Medvedev, president of the  Union of Oil Industry Workers of Russia and leader of one of the  largest Duma factions; L. Polezhayev, head of Omsk Oblast  Administration and chairman of the "Siberian Accord"  Interregional Association; Yu. Nozhikov, head of Irkutsk Oblast  Administration; K. Titov, head of Samara Oblast Administration  and chairman of the "Greater Volga" Interregional Association;  Yu. Matochkin, head of Kaliningrad Oblast Administration; M.  Prusak, head of Novgorod Oblast Administration; and V. Chub,  head of Rostov Oblast Administration.    We believe that our rating has at least one serious flaw --  it does not fully assess the level of influence of a number of  REGIONAL leaders. This is understandable: Given the existing  shortage of information the situation in the regions was not  studied properly, but we have started consultations with expert  regionalists on this question and we hope that this flaw will  gradually be rectified.    It must be said that it was always the regional  representatives who always predominated in the USSR's supreme  power structures: The recruitment of party and soviet cadres was  carried out in this way -- via the CPSU oblast committees.  Following Yeltsin's victory the new Russian ruling apparatus  was formed mainly of Muscovites. Authority is now returning to  the old tried and true method -- plucking the necessary people  from oblast and republic administrations. Thus, on the one  hand, we are obtaining authorities which fit in with Russians'  mentality but on the other the deintellectualization of the  sphere of state management is taking place, and the place of  luminaries, often born not in Moscow (but who, for this reasons,  nonetheless, know Russia) but who studied at Moscow universities  and finished their studies at the likes of Harvard, are being  taken by collective farm chairmen and other regional chiefs (who  then rule the state like one big collective farm), whom a  commentator has aptly dubbed "behemoths"....    Our May list also featured several shady figures -- deputy  ministers and other state officials. First, M. Yegorov, who is  Yerin's deputy. In the opinion of experts he is now the  strongest figure in the MVD [Ministry of Internal Affairs], at  any rate much stronger than Yerin. Besides which he is a figure  who clearly aspires to power. His name cropped up in connection  with the rumors of Yerin's possible dismissal (this question,  you will recall, was raised by a number of Duma factions after  the murder of Ayzderdzis), when Yerin's deputies -- Yegorov  among them -- came under the spotlight.    Second, P. Mostovoy (list of candidates), Chubays' first  deputy, who is alleged to be the one actually orchestrating all  privatization and the subdivisions of Goskomimushchestvo [State  Committee for the Management of State Property], while Chubays  is more of a figure-head.    Third, G. Petelin, leader of Chernomyrdin's secretariat, who  in our view will be more influential than V. Kvasov, leader of  the government apparatus. Fourth, A. Sobentsov (list of  candidates), first deputy leader of the Russian Government  apparatus.    Despite expectations, Shakhray's rating did not fall. The  squeezing out of the latter by the "president's entourage" to  the edge of the floor on which interregional hagglings are being  conducted, and the inability and evidently the unwillingness of  Chernomyrdin to defend Shakhray, have revealed the weakness of  that particular asset of his -- the strength of his ties with  the presidential branch and directly with the Russian Federation  premier, but something else was revealed simultaneously:  Shakhray is a completely autonomous figure, which means one  that is up for grabs [razygryvayemaya].    Of course, Chubays' rating fell -- as a result of his  acquisition of an enemy like Luzhkov. Moreover, it is quite  clear that it is Chubays who is is losing the struggle under way  between the two biggest Russian property administrators.  Incidentally, when preparing an "influence rating" for the  first time two months back, we noticed that Chubays was one of  the next candidates for being "chucked out" of the government.    The following candidates have moved out of the top 50  proper into the ranks of candidates for the top 50:    -- A. Starovoytov, leader of Federal Agency of Government  Communications and Information (his real influence in the last  "rating" was by all accounts exaggerated),    -- M. Nikolayev, president of the Republic of Sakha-Yakutia  (maybe because he was dependent on "De Beers" and became a  politician not so much on a Russian as an international scale),    -- M. Maley, chairman of the Security Council's  Interdepartmental Commission (has sunk to the bottom),    -- A. Sobchak and G. Popov, leaders of the Russian Movement  for Democratic Reforms, did not keep their places in our list.    As always, the band of the most influential politicians is  not limited to 50. In our opinion candidates for inclusion in  the list of the 50 most influential politicians are:    A. Sobchak, G. Popov, M. Maley, M. Nikolayev, A.  Starovoytov,  V. Kadannikov, N. Gonchar, A. Ilyushenko, P. Mostovoy, A.  Volskiy, I. Golembiovskiy, V. Zhirinovskiy, V. Zorkin, A.  Tuleyev, A. Rutskoy, G. Yavlinskiy, N. Travkin, A. Solzhenitsyn,  R. Aushev, A. Kokoshin, B. Gromov, Yu. Petrov, Ye. Shaposhnikov,  E. Rossel, Ye. Yegorov, A. Makarov, A. Sobentsov, B. Nemtsov, A.  Bryachikhin, A. Livshits, V. Sergeyev, P. Aven, B. Berezovskiy,  S. Rodionov, V. Bokser, N. Ryzhkov, R. Orekhov, A. Kotenkov, V.  Alekperov, Ye. Lakhova, V. Groshev, V. Vinogradov, Yu. Nozhikov,  L. Polezhayev, K. Titov, Yu. Matochkin, M. Prusak, O. Poptsov,  I. Shurchkov, S. Yushenkov, S. Kovalev, V. Shcherbakov, A.  Galazov, G. Satarov, V. Medvedev, L. Sukhanov, V. Chub, and M.  Rakhimov.    Since we have highlighted a number of little-known "shady"  figures -- and in Russia it is customary to classify politicians  as those to whom the mass media are attracted -- we once again  remind you of what we mean by the word "politician." By leading  politicians we mean leaders (of parties and political movements,  executive and legislative organs, information and commercial  structures...), possessing the greatest RESOURCES AND POTENTIAL  in making and ensuring the implementation of state and political  decisions. Putting it simply, those who hold the levers  controlling society and the state. These, our domestic history  shows us, are traditionally not so much tribunes, ideologues, or  even party leaders as functionaries and apparatchiks -- akin to  spiders, spinning their web of power day and night. That is the  reality.</p>

			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / International Bonds: Belgium makes historic return with FFr5bn deal The Eurobond market awakened from its recent torpor and saw several large issues, including Belgium's first in the French franc sector since the second world war. There was also a five-year Euroyen issue for Sweden and two sterling deals. Belgium issued FFr5bn of 6 7/8 per cent eight-year bonds, via joint leads CCF and JP Morgan. The issue was 'the first of a long series of issuance in the French franc market', said Mr Jean Basecq, director-general in charge of debt at the Belgian treasury. He said Belgium's choice of French francs was motivated by a desire for currency diversification. 'We have too much D-Mark and Swiss francs in our portfolio, and will keep issuing in the French franc market,' he said. Meanwhile, Belgium's long-awaited DM1bn issue has been postponed, said Mr Basecq. 'When the market is better and investors are ready to buy, we will come to the D-Mark sector,' he said. Belgium's bonds were priced to yield 20 basis points over the corresponding OAT at their 99.55 re-offer price, which some dealers felt was a bit tight. However, the leads reported solid demand, mainly from French institutional investors. The bonds closed at 99.25 bid, with the spread slightly wider at 21 basis points over the OAT. In the sterling sector, Eastern Electricity, the UK's largest electricity distributor, made its Eurobond debut with Pounds 350m of 8 3/8 per cent 10-year bonds. Yielding 55 basis points over the benchmark gilt at the 99.596 re-offer, the issue was widely deemed to be well-priced. It slipped to around 99.10 bid due to weakness in the gilt market, but the spread held steady. While lead managers BZW and CS First Boston reported healthy demand, others said the issue had been slow to place. 'There currently isn't enough depth in the market for that kind of size,' said one dealer. Part of the proceeds was used to refinance two Pounds 59m tranches of 12 1/2 per cent bonds, said Mr Eric Anstee, group finance director at Eastern Electricity. 'We wanted to take them off our books at 12 1/2 per cent and refinance them at this attractive interest rate,' he said. The remainder of the funds would be used to assist the growth of the group, he said. Earlier in the day, Abbey National Treasury Services issued Pounds 150m of 8 3/4 per cent subordinated 10-year bonds via Salomon Brothers and SG Warburg. Its 85-basis-point spread over gilts at re-offer attracted healthy demand, mainly from UK investors. It also prompted switches out of Lloyds Bank's recently-issued subordinated bonds, as well as other bank issues, one of the lead managers said. The Kingdom of Sweden tapped the Euroyen market for Y75bn of 3 7/8 per cent five-year bonds via joint leads Goldman Sachs and Sumitomo Finance. Structured to pay semi-annual coupons matching the benchmark Japanese government bond, the deal was targeted at Japanese investors. However, there was also demand from Hong Kong and Europe.</p>

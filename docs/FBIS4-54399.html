			<p>BFN     [Text] Sofia, April 26 (BTA) -- "This was a historic  visit," President Zhelyu Zhelev said of the first official visit  of President of the Republic of Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM] Kiro Gligorov to Bulgaria. Mr.  Gligorov said that after four meetings with President Zhelev so  far he was left with the impression that "we can encourage the  further development of mutual understanding between the two  states and the two peoples." President Zhelev and President  Grigorov held a press conference at the end of the two-day  official visit Macedonia's head of state.    President Zhelev said that they discussed three groups of  problems: bilateral relations, the latest developments in the  Balkans and the relations of Bulgaria and Macedonia with the  European and Euro-Atlantic structures. "It was established that  we share willingness for a peaceful settlement of the conflicts  in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and for the prevention of the conflict's  expansion to Kosovo or, God forbid, to the Republic of  Macedonia, which would pose a direct threat to Bulgaria as  well," Dr. Zhelev pointed out. The two presidents found out  that they both support the efforts of the United Nations, NATO,  the United States and Russia to finally find a peaceful solution  to the conflicts and their gradual settlement at the negotiating  table. "Bulgaria could make a humble contribution and would  gladly help the Republic of Macedonia in the process of its  integration with the European and Euro-Atlantic structures:  both with the CSCE and the Council of Europe, over which  Bulgaria will preside from May 10," said Bulgaria's president.  "We enjoy a serious and useful assistance on the part of  Bulgaria in the European structures and the United Nations,"  said Mr. Gligorov.    "Until the Kosovo problem is resolved, there will always be  the danger of the war spreading into Macedonia," he pointed out.  He explained that this was the reason why Macedonia was the  first country to ask for the preventive deployment of UN  peacekeeping forces on its territory. "Macedonia is against the  forming of any alliances that would lead to a new carving up of  the Balkans," he said. In response to a question whether  Macedonia would join the new Yugoslavia, Mr. Gligorov answered:  "Macedonia has chosen once and forever to be an independent,  sovereign state."    President Zhelev said that the visit of Mr. Gligorov to  Bulgaria marks the end of a stage in the development of  Bulgarian-Macedonian relations. He reminded that Bulgaria was  the first country in the world to recognize the independence of  Macedonia together with that of the other three former Yugoslav  republics, Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, on January  15, 1992. He said that the present stage of the development of  the bilateral relations was characterized by the efforts of  Bulgarian diplomacy to gain international legal recognition for  the Republic of Macedonia, by the establishment of diplomatic  relations between Bulgaria and Macedonia and by the rapid  development of trade and economic contacts. "The spontaneous  and vigorous progress of trade and economic contacts shows,  among other things, that official intergovernmental contacts lag  behind the natural development process," Dr. Zhelev said.    In response to a question why no documents were signed  during  the visit, President Zhelev said that in their capacity as  presidents he and Mr. Gligorov can only sign interstate  treaties, and the one with Macedonia is still in a very early  stage of preparation. He added that a couple of agreements  could have been signed but that did not happen because of ad hoc  artificial considerations. "There was a flexible formula,  saying that the documents were to be signed in the official  languages of the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of  Bulgaria, which implied that they were two different languages.  However, the Macedonian part insisted on the clear formula  "Macedonian language" and because of the existing public  opposition, which I believe is quite artificial, we refrained  from signing anything at this stage. I believe that the problem  will be settled; I am sure it will be," Dr. Zhelev explained.    "Every people has the right to chose how its language is to  be called," claimed Macedonia's President. "We cannot sign  anything that would question our language and I am convinced  that the problem will be settled soon because it is a relic of  the past and we have to face the reality," he said. He said he  was convinced that "democratic Bulgaria will find the inner  power to take this issue off the agenda."    When asked why in his address to the Bulgarian Parliament he  failed to mention Bulgarians in Macedonia after he listed  Macedonians, Albanians and Turks as sending their good wishes,  Mr. Gligorov answered that according to the last census there  were less than 3,000 Bulgarians in Macedonia. During his speech  in parliament he was heckled with remarks like: "Are there no  Bulgarians in Macedonia?"</p>

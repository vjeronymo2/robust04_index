			<p>941112 FT  12 NOV 94 / Sleaze claims anger Gonzalez: Tom Burns reports on the allegations against Spain's prime minister Callers put on hold by the busy switchboard at Madrid's El Mundo newspaper are treated to The Beatles in their Sergeant Pepper mode and to John Lennon singing: 'I heard the news today, oh boy. . .' El Mundo, a five-year-old investigative daily in which Britain's Guardian newspaper is a minor shareholder, has been making news for the past week in Spain as well as reporting it. It claims to have uncovered a corruption scandal involving Mr Felipe Gonzalez, and the allegations have turned the suave and veteran prime minister into an angry and potentially vulnerable politician. In a television 'fireside' chat late on Thursday night, Mr Gonzalez darkly hinted at conspiracies to destabilise the economy and eject him from office. Speaking from his book-lined study and flanked by one the bonsai trees that he lovingly tends, he told the nation: 'The only reason for these types of campaigns is that there are those who think the recovery of our country will favour the government.' The prime minister did not mention El Mundo directly, nor did he disclose who was conspiring to upset the 'climate of tranquility', but he insisted that there was a 'minority' determined to create public alarm 'even at the cost of economic recovery'. El Mundo's editor, Mr Pedro J Ramrez, was nonplussed as he huddled with his journalists to watch the broadcast in the paper's newsroom. 'I don't know how this is all going to end but my instinct tells me there is a lot more to all of this. It took us two years to break the Ibercorp story last spring,' he said. Ibercorp was a top people's private bank run by friends of Mr Mariano Robio, then governor of the Bank of Spain. A series of reports by El Mundo led to the downfall of the governor, who was briefly imprisoned this year. Mr Gonzalez has previously been unscathed by the corruption scandals which over the years have enveloped his Socialist party, members of his government and senior officials of his administration. But now he is for the first time in the thick of sleaze allegations. The latest row centres on allegations by the newspaper that the prime minister's brother-in-law, Mr Francisco Palomino, was favoured by government contracts. They have stung Mr Gonzalez into an unprecedented counterattack to defend his integrity. The chief allegation is that Mr Palomino, a Seville businessman married to Mr Gonzalez's sister Lola, profitably sold a troubled boilermaking business owned by his family to a company that subsequently hired him as a non-executive director. The company went on to obtain a contract to install electronic systems in a nuclear-proof bunker built alongside the prime minister's official residence. 'Our first report was that Palomino had made a pile on a Seville property deal and we thought it was a typical episode of speculation in Andalucia (Mr Gonzalez's home region) by someone who had the right connections,' said Mr Ramrez. 'We were prepared to leave it at that and it was only when Gonzalez got so furious about the story that we started investigating further and came up with the government contracts.' Cabinet members and senior Socialists have rallied to support Mr Gonzalez in the face of the allegations, as have leaders of the Basque and Catalan nationalist parties whose votes keep the minority Socialist government in power. The government's spokesman has issued a stream of detailed statements in recent days rebutting point by point as 'falsehoods' the El Mundo allegations. In his TV broadcast, Mr Gonzalez asserted: 'I have never taken personal advantage of my position.' It was a vintage persuasive performance by a master of communication skills. The prime minister said there was not a shred of truth in the allegations, declared that he was not prepared to admit criticism that was 'based on lies', promised that 'life will be very difficult for those who are corrupt', and accused those who attempted to drag his family into the political arena of 'moral cowardice.' Separately the government has asked the state auditors to examine all government contracts which could involve companies associated with Mr Palomino, who has been urged by members of the government to seek legal advice over possible action against El Mundo. Most Spaniards appear to believe in the personal honesty of the prime minister, who in 1993 was re-elected for a fourth consecutive four-year term. However, the fear among Mr Gonzalez's aides is that voters will blame him for the climate of corruption that has grown up during his tenure of power.</p>

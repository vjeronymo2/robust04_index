			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / International Company News: SEC seeks to attract German companies The chairman of the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission, the regulatory body for the US securities industry, yesterday launched a 'bridge-building' campaign to try to persuade more German companies to list their shares in the US. Mr Arthur Levitt, who will be visiting 20 leading German industrial companies and banks during a two-day visit, told businessmen in Frankfurt that it was a lot easier for foreign companies to obtain a listing in the US than they might imagine. 'The provision of information to investors is the sole condition, the real requirement, for access to our markets,' he insisted. 'All companies are welcome, with information as their passport.' At present, Daimler-Benz is the only German company out of 594 foreign companies listed in the US. Germany's biggest company listed its shares in October last year, prompting widespread criticism within German industry at the level of concessions made to the SEC on listing requirements. German companies have traditionally objected to the SEC's disclosure rules, in particular the necessity to present accounts under US General Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP). This objection ensured that with the exception of Daimler all companies in Europe's largest economy are denied direct access to the world's largest capital market. Mr Levitt said that the SEC had worked hard to make the listing procedures simpler for foreign companies. Acknowledging problems with the SEC's image in the past, he vowed to 'make the SEC a positive responsive force'. This is the first time a chairman of the SEC has visited Germany. While many large German companies would like to tap the US equity market through a direct listing, this would mean abandoning Germany's creditor-orientated accounting in favour of more transparent, investor-orientated US accounting rules.</p>

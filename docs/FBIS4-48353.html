			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament, meeting in Zomba today in an  extraordinary session, adopted a new Constitution for the  country which will provisionally come into effect on 18th of  this month. Giving details of the bill, the minister of justice  and attorney general, Honorable Lovemore Munlo, explained that  the new Constitution shall come into force in two stages. It  will first come into force provisionally for a period of one  year from 18th of this month, in order to comply with the wishes  expressed at the constitutional conference which was held at  Kwacha Conference Center earlier this year.    Honorable Munlo said the draft Constitution therefore  provides for the appointment of a constitution committee of  Parliament to create the requisite machinery to oversee the  process of national consultation for the further refinement of  the Constitution.    Among the features in the new Constitution is the  establishment of the office of the ombudsman, whose function  shall be to check and keep watch on public offices and public  bodies in the performance of their duties. It also provides for  the human rights commission, whose function will be to look at  human rights abuses.    Honorable Munlo said the new Constitution also abolishes the  present three regional traditional courts and the national  traditional court. Several members, while supporting the bill,  however expressed reservations on certain aspects of the  Constitution, but noted satisfaction that there is provision for  the (?refinement) of the new Constitution for a period of one  year.</p>

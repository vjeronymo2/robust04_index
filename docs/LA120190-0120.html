			<p><P> December 1, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE ACTIVISTS FORM NATIONAL PEACE GROUP  </P> <P> Student activists here are coordinating a nationwide effort to deliver a united  collegiate message to George Bush and his policy-makers: no Persian Gulf war.  </P> <P> Student groups have been forming across the country to protest the U.S.  military buildup in the gulf, but students at three Washington universities  decided that the peace movement needs a national network.  </P> <P> The newly formed pacifist group, Aegis Justice, hopes eventually to bring  together as many as 700 university organizations. The group already has the  support of at least 200 university organizations nationwide, 23-year-old Dwayne  Voegeli said. The group was founded by Voegeli, a senior at George Washington  University majoring in international politics, and about 200 other students  from Georgetown, George Washington and American universities a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> Aegis Justice is organizing "teach-ins" on campuses nationwide next week and a  student march in the capital in late January.  </P> <P> Extensive national student coalitions already exist, but the Aegis Justice  network wants to connect them and let the groups exchange ideas and lend  support in protesting the U.S. military involvement in the Persian Gulf,  Voegeli said.  </P> <P> The coalition includes a variety of large and small, radical and conservative  campuses, including the University of Amherst, the University of Chicago,  Brandeis College in Massachusetts and UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> Although the network is "for peace and not war, however it is done," Voegeli  said, each student organization has its own agenda as to how the United States  should peacefully end the crisis.  </P> <P> Voegeli said Aegis Justice is hoping to qualify as a nonprofit organization.  The students now are paying for long-distance calls and faxes themselves, but  the group has applied for private grants.  </P> <P> Several regional and national student coalitions have also been synchronizing  campus efforts.  </P> <P> For example, about 50 universities from New York to the West Coast have joined  the California Student Network Against U.S. Intervention in the Middle East.  The group has a list of demands and is planning a series of news conferences  next week.  </P> <P> "There have been hundreds, if not thousands, of demonstrations on college  campuses in the last month," said Rhodney Ward, a UC Berkeley senior who is  part of a national network of about 100 colleges called the Student Action  Union. "When we stand together, we are stronger. We can make ourselves stronger  if we network."  </P> <P> But traditionally radical campuses such as Berkeley are not the only ones  getting involved in the peace movement.  </P> <P> At the normally tranquil University of Montana in Missoula, student protests  against the war are making the campus "a hotbed," said J. V. Bennett, a senior  who helped form the Student Coalition for Social Responsibility a few weeks  ago.  </P> <P> The University of Montana's coalition brings together 16 historically feuding  groups on the campus -- fraternities and environmentalists, abortion advocates  and opponents, Bennett said.  </P> <P> The first Aegis Justice national newspaper will be published in February from  the small, conservative campus of Rider College in Lawrenceville, N.J.  </P></p>

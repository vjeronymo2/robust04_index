			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Volodymyr Lanovyy, doctor of economic sciences, </F> under the rubric "The Economy": "The Metronome of the Economic  Crisis"]    [Text] The critically complex economic condition of Ukraine  demands an unbiased analysis of the sources, causes and factors  of its decline, as well as an analysis of those forces and  processes which are capable of either accelerating or stopping  it. The time has come to make generalizations that will give us  the capability of understanding the nature of the present  macroeconomic phenomona and consciously choosing the way toward  revival.  <H5>  The Sources of Crisis </H5>   The economic crisis in Ukraine has lasted a long time. It  began in 1980-81, when the average annual growth of the gross  social product fell from more than 3% during the  preceding two  years to 1.5-1.8%. The causes of the crisis lie in the  ineffectiveness of the old cost-based, wasteful,  planning-subjectivist system of economic management. As we know,  this system was incapable of promoting the distribution of  goods, capital, and manpower resources according to the real  needs of society. As a result, the structure of social capital,  its division among the different sectors, as well as the quality  of capital projects in terms of technological levels, physical  conditions, and cost recovery, were in conflict with the  structure and quality requirements of social consumption. It  should be noted that in the case of Ukraine, as in the case of  other non-Russian states that made up the Soviet Union, the  structure of capital distribution by sectors and the  distribution of manpower resources was further distorted by an  artificially created demand on the part of enterprises and  residents of Russia and other former republics (demand for  output to meet defense needs, cultivating the boundless northern  and far-eastern territories, ambitious projects in space and in  the pro-Communist Afro-Asian countries, etc.). As a result, the  deformation of the structure of the economy went further in  Ukraine than in Russia, Poland, or Bulgaria, and, thus, the  decline in production may be greater. Not only must Ukraine  reorient her production to meet real domestic demand, but she  must find new foreign markets, abandoning those she had  developed in the past. This requires technological adjustments,  additional spending on marketing, standardization, and ensuring  that products are competitive in terms of both cost and price.    The crisis that began 12 years ago began to display more  clearly distinguishable features at the beginning of 1992. The  liberalization from state control of the overwhelming majority  of prices and the self-collapse of the system of state-planned  distribution of production exposed the crisis that existing  enterprises were in and the fact that many of the goods they  produced were unneeded. A tectonic rupture took place in the  planning stream of the economic crisis. Simultaneously (although  this occurred over a certain period of time), thousands of  former economic ties were broken. The explosive transition to a  new price level did not give enterprises enough time to  accumulate working capital without interrupting the production  process. The economy went into shock and remains in this  condition to this day. The rate of production decline over two  years has surpassed 35.0% (the first year in which the  national  product fell was 1991, when the decrease reached 4.0%),  and  there are no signs of stabilization in sight.    The long duration of the crisis stems from the fact that the  contradictions created in the national economic system run very  deep (they are, of course, also present in other states of the  former Soviet Union). Until the structure and nature of social  capital are strengthened (by changing the specialization of  existing enterprises and modernizing their manufacturing  processes, building new production and infrastructure facilities  which would make it possible to meet the unsatisfied demand for  goods and services, retraining and shifting manpower resources  from certain sectors into others, reconstructing obsolete  transportation and communication systems), there can be no real  revival of production growth.  <H5>  The Characteristic Features and Course of the Crisis </H5>   So far, the crisis has not engendered any factors to produce  structural and technological revival. While during the first  years, until the beginning of 1993, the crisis caused economic  losses to enterprises by making it impossible for them to work  at full capacity, for the past year and more, the crisis has  been creating conditions in which these capacities are being  physically destroyed. The cause is inflation, which in December  1992 surpassed the 50% mark, in July 1993, the 60%  mark, and  in December 1993, the 90% mark. As we can see, inflation  is  steadily rising (let us recall that in June 1992, before the  beginning of the state "financial and credit narcotization" of  enterprises, price growth amounted to only 20%).    Inflation, which exceeds 40-50% per month, prevents  enterprises from replacing their fixed capital. New construction  is completely out of the question. Thus inflation sharply  accelerates the rate of production decline, and hyperinflation  completely halts structural changes in the economy.    A second distinguishing feature of the economic crisis is a  step-like [stupenepodibnyy] movement of price levels. These  price levels are not rising according to plan; they change at  given intervals (every two to three months), increasing each  time by a factor of two to three or four to five. We have  already experienced seven such increases. This is happening due  to the permissive administrative price review procedure, which,  in fact, consists of the state establishing prices for most  products (officially, two-thirds of all prices). After each  price review, business entities and ordinary consumers  experience inflationary shock: Their profits, incomes, or  earnings prove insufficient to allow them to buy materials and  goods as well as services in the same volumes as they were able  to afford earlier. This leads to sociopolitical explosions and  conflicts, strikes, meetings, hunger strikes, etc., that take  place in the same sequence as the price hikes. [Boxed item:     -  The budget deficit in the first half of 1994 will be  higher than in the first half of 1993 and will amount to 35-40\    -  of total expenditures.    -  Within half a year, the exchange rate of the karbovanets will  fall to 180,000-190,000 to the U.S. dollar.    -  Production decreases will result in mass unemployment in the  first half of 1994. An increase in emigration should be  expected.]     On the one hand, this phasal inflation disturbs the  financial  proportions that have formed since the preceding price increase  and strips enterprises of their working capital and banks of  adequate amounts of credit resources. This leads to mass  nonpayments and blockages in goods turnover. On the other hand,  it is impossible to achieve a balance between the money supply  and the supply of goods: after the new prices are set, the total  value of goods exceeds the amount of available means of payment.  After a while, when enterprise and personal incomes are  compensated by government emission and the fixed prices lag  behind the growth of the money supply, the supply of goods  becomes insufficient. From that moment on, both producer and  consumer goods become scarce and disappear from the state trade  network.    The third "national" feature of the economic crisis in  Ukraine is the unwarranted falling of the living standard, which  has now lasted more than three years. During this period,  average real incomes have decreased nearly 45% (at a time  when  earnings have been growing in many neighboring countries --  Russia, Moldova, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia). As a result of  this trend, economic sectors that serve the consumer are  collapsing. Thus, according to our estimates, consumer services  have shrunk by 70%, the physical volume of state trade --  by  45%, the food industry -- by 40%, the output of  milk products  -- by 50%, and the output of clothing and footwear -- by  55%.    The falling living standard leads directly to the shrinking  of the domestic market and a further recession among  goods-manufacturing enterprises due to a reduced demand for  their products. If we take into account that personal savings  have virtually melted away (the amount remaining in banks,  calculated in real terms, has decreased ten-twelvefold), then  effective consumer demand has decreased more than 2.2-2.4-fold.    There are two main reasons why the living standard is  falling: a) the large-scale redistribution of monetary revenues  through budgetary and banking mechanisms to benefit the  raw-materials branches of industry and the military-industrial  complex, and b) the large, disproportionate export of capital  abroad (both to the West and to Russia) by export enterprises,  which then conceal their foreign currency earnings abroad (only  some 20% of this sum returned to Ukraine in 1993). These  are  the "national" characteristics of the methods of financial and  currency regulation used by our government. This three-sided  financial background of the economic crisis in Ukraine  (hyperinflation, step-like [stupenepodibni] changes in price  levels, and decreasing consumer purchasing power) not only  blocks the action of internal stimuli and economic growth, but  increasingly undermines the economy and causes the level of  production to decline even further. We can predict that in the  next few months hyperinflation will also accelerate the drop in  the production of goods for domestic consumption. In addition,  the vigorous outflow of foreign currency will continue (as a  result of the import restrictions introduced by the  Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy government and the worsening domestic  economic conditions). Consequently, personal incomes in Ukraine  will continue to drop in 1994.  <H5>  The Nature of the Course of the Crisis </H5>   Today's production decline in Ukraine is not accompanied by  positive structural changes -- in other words, the crisis is  producing no healing effects. What is more, the impact of the  principal tendencies of the crisis is destructive to the economy.    First, the decline of obsolete traditional industries is not  taking place at an accelerated rate; the output volumes of these  industries are falling at the same rate as the rate for industry  as a whole. Modern industries and technologies are either not  being widely introduced, or the scale on which they are being  assimilated and are functioning is not expanding. This is  blocking the structural changes that could vitalize the rate of  growth of the economy as a whole and ultimately reduce the  energy- and material-output ratio in industry, agriculture, and  transport.    Second, the functioning national capital is not being  transformed from production into financial form: enterprises and  private citizens are not placing their money in bank deposits or  investing it in securities, but are rushing to exchange it for  goods. In addition, there is an increased demand for money,  above all, bank credits (which, as a rule, is a characteristic  feature of the stage in which an economy is growing and not of  the stage in which it is declining). A financial system in this  condition means that existing production is conserved rather  than modernized. No sources of investment into new branches and  kinds of activity emerge in society.    Third, there is no growth in output in those branches of the  economy which produce goods and services for the population --  in other words, in the sphere in which the socialist system  continually recreated a supply deficit. Instead, these are the  very sectors in which production decline is greatest. As long as  this trend continues, Ukraine is doomed to high inflation due to  a chronic shortage of goods and to a continued decline in the  gross domestic product (because of the reduced capacity of the  domestic market).    At the same time, it should be noted that certain structural  changes are taking place, even though these changes are not yet  positive. The greatest structural changes are occurring in  branches that export most of their products and services and in  branches that are geared towards internal Ukrainian consumption.  Those in the first category quite naturally enjoy greater  opportunities and strive to make the most of them. There is  almost no production decline in these branches (primarily oil  refining, metallurgy, the chemical industry, shipbuilding, and  sea, aviation, and motor vehicle transport), and they pay the  highest wages. However, so far, this trend is not promoting  economic stabilization, because there is no return of income  from exports. In fact, capital is being exported at the same  time that there is an acute shortage of domestic investments.  Only if the recovery of funds from exports is ensured (by  increasing or at least maintaining the present levels of  exports) will these structural changes promote stabilization of  both finances and domestic production as a whole. If this does  not happen, the domestic market will soon become so denuded that  virtually all branches involving investment or consumer  specialization will come to a halt.    A second, rather significant structural change stems from  the  process of a partial reorientation on the part of exporters away  from the east and towards the west. This has happened,  primarily, because of a reduced demand among Russian buyers (as  a result of the same kind of crisis as ours and the beginning of  a structural reorganization of the Russian economy, and its  demilitarization in particular), and, secondly, because of the  growing attraction of selling in countries with a stable and  convertible currency and stable and predictable sociopolitical  conditions. The consequences of this reorientation must not be  assessed one-sidedly. From the standpoint of current benefits  and conditions of domestic economic stabilization, this  reorientation must be regarded as positive, but in terms of the  long-range interests of Ukrainian enterprises, such excessive  turning to new markets can lead to negative consequences because  of territorial remoteness, an already satisfied demand, or  smaller arket capacities in other regions.    The third and most important structural change is taking  place along the line that divides the dynamics of output volumes  in the state and private sectors of the national economy. As we  know, the former is experiencing an absolute decrease, while the  latter is experiencing an absolute increase. This might lead one  to conclude that the revival of the national economy can only be  achieved through the efforts of the new, nonstate enterprises.  But this conclusion is premature. Today's private sector is made  up primarily of nonindustrial capital, and growth in this sector  does not result in the overall improvement of the economy and a  rise in personal incomes. Only after financial stabilization is  achieved will the ctive investment of private capital in  industry, agriculture, and the building industry become  possible. If inflation is not curbed, the outstripping growth of  turnover in the private sector and the increasingly higher  income levels of employees in private enterprises will create an  ever widening gap between people employed in the private sector  and the incomes of those working at state enterprises. This is a  detonator for future social disaffection. Moreover, the  structural reorganization of the economy solely on the new  private sector is possible only if a large number of state-owned  enterprises proclaim bankruptcy. On the one hand, this would  cause huge economic losses, and on the other hand, it would  prolong the period of transformation by many decades. Neither  society nor the state would survive this.    From a long-range standpoint, the current crisis is also  dangerous in that it threatens to worsen the quality of manpower  resources by greatly reducing financing of the humanitarian  fields -- education, health care, culture, science, and  environmental protection. The objective conditions causing this  decrease in financing (reduced budget revenues due to a drop in  profitability of enterprises and in personal incomes) is  multiplied by subjective factors (an ineffective taxation  system, the distribution of budget funds to benefit other  sectors, discrimination of the nonstate humanitarian sector,  etc.).    If the future brings with it a deficit of skills, morality,  and professionalism, it will be more difficult to revive and  rearm the economy and enable it to become more competitive.  <H5>  A Look into the Near Future </H5>   The disastrous hyperinflationary background and the falling  living standard in Ukraine are hindering forces capable of  halting the production decline. As a result, the ruination of  the economy will continue and the point at which a reversal of  the crisis can occur will become increasingly lower. This will  last as long as the described destructive processes are not  overcome.    Taking into account what has been said above, we should  examine the opportunities that will emerge in 1994. The  country's main tasks are to reduce the budget deficit and to end  unproductive state spending and financing of losses and  mismanagement. In addition, one of the most urgent goals is to  expand exports and increase hard currency earnings.    Unfortunately, the plan and budget documents of the  Kravchuk-Zvyahilskyy government put in doubt the prospects for a  successful accomplishment of the listed tasks. We can assume  that the budget deficit in the first half of 1994 will be higher  than in the first half of 1993 and ill amount to 35-40% of  total expenditures. This assumption is based on the fact that  budget revenues will decrease due to tax increases, as well as  due to declining production volume and profitability.    The acting government's regulation for the administrative  confiscation from enterprises of their foreign currency earnings  at an artificially low rate of exchange will further weaken  Ukraine's export potential. This will substantially reduce the  volume of raw materials and goods bought from Russia and  increase the trade balance deficit with Russia to approximately  three billion dollars.    The administrative confiscation of foreign currency, along  with artificial bureaucratic restrictions (licensing, higher  tariffs) on imports, will force the holders of foreign currency  to evade bringing these funds back to Ukraine. Obviously, the  amount kept out of the country will grow by another two to three  billion dollars. This will lower the exchange rate of the  karbovanets even further: in a half year's time it will fall to  180,000-190,000 karbovantsi to the U.S. dollar.    One can therefore conclude that in the next few months of  1994, the rate of inflation will not fall below the 65%  mark  per month. This will prevent the emergence of conditions  conducive to technological modernization and to positive  structural changes.    Now should we expect the current Cabinet of Ministers to  make  any large-scale attempts to introduce new organizational forms  of managing enterprises, including privatization. Given these  conditions, the rate of production decline cannot be slowed in  1994. It can be stated with certainty that during the first six  months of this year, the decline of the gross domestic product  will remain at 15-20%.    Inflation will take the form of continually repeated --  every  two to three months -- one-time administrative prices increases  by 300-400% each time. At the same time, we should expect  an  increase in emissions by the National Bank, which in the first  half of 1994 will cumulatively increase nearly tenfold. This  situation will further destabilize the system of payments and  settlement of accounts between enterprises. In light of an even  greater drop in production, many enterprises will be forced to  shut down. In the first half of 1994 alone, these closures will  make mass unemployment a reality. Workers will be deprived of  the opportunity to receive even a minimum wage. We can also  expect an increase in emigration.    The further disparity between the rise in the prices of  goods  and services and increases in wages, pensions, and financial aid  will substantially lower the living standard of the people.  There will be an especially sharp drop in the real incomes of  those who are paid from the budget and the pension fund, because  contributions to these will decrease. The level of financing of  defense, the state administration, and institutions in the  social sphere will drop. If we do not manage to halt these  processes in the second half of 1994, the very statehood of  Ukraine will be threatened.</p>

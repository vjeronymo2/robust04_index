			<p>931019 FT  19 OCT 93 / Groupe Bull to get 'final' FFr7bn injection from state THE FRENCH government yesterday announced a FFr7bn (Pounds 810m) capital injection for Groupe Bull, the loss-making computer group, and the replacement of its chairman. Mr Gerard Longuet, French industry minister, said this would be the last time the government would intervene to support Bull and the company would be privatised as soon as possible. Mr Bernard Pache, Bull's chairman since June 1992, is to be replaced by Mr Jean-Marie Descarpentries, former chairman of Carnaud Metalbox (CMB), the Anglo-French packaging group. Industry observers said Mr Descarpentries had a reputation for tough action and was likely to move quickly to cut costs and reorganise the group, which has lost about FFr15bn over the past three years. Mr Descarpentries is expected officially to take over in the middle of next week. In a statement to Bull employees yesterday, he expressed confidence that the company could be returned to profitability. In addition to the FFr7bn allocation from the government, which Bull will receive this year and next, the company's other principal shareholders are expected to contribute. France Telecom, which owns 16 per cent, will provide FFr1.6bn in new capital. NEC, of Japan, and IBM, of the US, which together hold about 10 per cent, have been asked for FFr700m. The capital raising will largely eliminate Bull's borrowings which stand at about FFr9.5bn. But it is likely to arouse concern at the European Commission. Earlier this month, the EC launched an inquiry into a FFr2.5bn capital allocation for Bull made by the previous French government. Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC competition commissioner, yesterday said the commission would look closely at the latest capital injection. The government is believed to be seeking a sale of its 73 per cent stake in Bull next year. Analysis, Page 26; Lex, Page 22</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa suggested Friday [18 February] that Japan may send a  special envoy to the United States in an effort to avert U.S.  economic sanctions in the wake of last week's breakdown of  bilateral trade "framework" talks. Hosokawa, speaking at a  session of the House of Representatives budget committee, vowed  to do his utmost to prevent relations between Japan and the U.S.  from worsening.    The prime minister was replying to Michio Watanabe of the  main opposition Liberal Democratic Party, who urged the prime  minister to send an emissary to Washington in an effort to  prevent Japan from being internationally "isolated."    Hosokawa and all his 20 cabinet ministers were present as  the  lower house's budget committee started deliberations on a third  supplementary budget for fiscal 1993, which calls for a spending  increase of 2,185.2 billion yen over the second revised budget.    This is designed to cover the largest-ever economic stimulus  package of 15.25 trillion yen, and an increase in the overall  general account budget for the current year ending in March to  77,437.50 billion yen.    Besides the former foreign minister, nine legislators from  both ruling and opposition parties posed questions.    While pledging efforts to rectify Japan's huge trade  imbalance with the U.S., the prime minister urged Washington to  make "a conscientious decision and response" to Japan.    Hosokawa and President Bill Clinton met last week in  Washington, but failed to strike a deal on a new framework to  slash Japan's trade surplus of over 50 billion dollars.    The collapse of the talks stemmed from a disagreement over a  U.S. demand to set numerical targets to measure the openness of  Japanese markets. Japan rejected the demand which it said would  lead to managed trade.    A few days after the collapse of the framework talks, the  U.S. on Tuesday unveiled steps to impose sanctions worth  hundreds of millions of dollars in a dispute over access to the  Japanese cellular phone market. At the budget committee  session, Hosokawa reaffirmed that Tokyo will file a complaint  with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) if the  U.S. implements sanctions, but he also said Japan will deal  with the situation "with a cool head."    Hosokawa said that Japan has to make its own efforts on both  macroeconomic and microeconomic problems because it plays a  large role in leading the world economy. "Japan must tackle  what it can voluntarily...such as making procedures transparent  for insurance and government procurement, promoting cooperation  between the two countries' auto industries, deregulating the  economy, accelerating imports and investments, and securing  competition," Hosokawa said.    International Trade and Industry Minister Hiroshi Kumagai  told the same session that Japan will draw up a program by the  end of February at the earliest to orient Japan's economic  structure more towards domestic demand.    Hosokawa rejected U.S. criticism that "bureaucrats" have led  the trade negotiations, saying that officials of each ministry  made considerable effort to protect national interests.    He said neither politicians nor bureaucrats can accept the  U.S. demand for numerical targets. "We cannot accept a demand  that runs counter to economic deregulation," he stated.    Hosokawa also said Japan will act with responsibility if the  United Nations Security Council imposes economic sanctions  against North Korea over its suspected nuclear arms development  program.    Both Hosokawa and Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura  said they have good relations in spite of reports that the  premier wants to remove Takemura from his post.</p>

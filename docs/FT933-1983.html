			<p>930921 FT  21 SEP 93 / International Company News: Australian bank plans ADollars 118m share issue BANK of Melbourne, the regional bank, has become the latest Australian company to take advantage of a buoyant share market to top up its capital base. The bank yesterday announced a ADollars 118m (USDollars 77.1m) issue of convertible preference shares, which will qualify as Tier 1 capital under central bank prudential guidelines. The shares, with renounce-able rights, will be issued on a one-for-12 basis at ADollars 13 each. They will qualify for a 6 per cent annual dividend entitlement and a conversion date no later than November, 1998. The launch follows a preference issue earlier this year from Australian banking rival, Westpac. Mr Christopher Stewart, Bank of Melbourne chief executive, said proceeds of the issue would be used for general purposes. Normandy Poseidon, the mining group, is to acquire the Larvik Pigmentfabrikk business from Norzink, the Norwegian zinc producer, for about ADollars 30m. The acquisition, through Normandy Poseidon's CML division, includes worldwide rights to the Larvik-process, a leading zinc dust production technology. It also includes royalties arising from the Larvik technology, a zinc dust production facility at Larvik in Norway, and a licence to construct further facilities in Malaysia, close to CML's existing industrial minerals plant. Norzink is controlled by RTZ Corp and Trelleborg of Sweden. Larvik produces 12,000 tonnes of zinc dust and zinc oxide annually. With existing production and the planned plant in Malaysia, CML's annual zinc vapour output would be about 25,000 tonnes. Broken Hill Proprietary is to buy an Australian subsidiary of Conoco of the US for an undisclosed price. BHP expects the transaction to be settled within two months.</p>

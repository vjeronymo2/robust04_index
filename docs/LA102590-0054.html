			<p><P> October 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROGRAM FOR FREE RIDES ON LATE BUSES CALLED A SUCCESS;  </P> <P> TRANSIT: THE RTD SAYS IT GAVE AWAY 59,000 PASSENGER TRIPS LAST MONTH, FAR FEWER  THAN IT HAD EXPECTED.  </P> <P> The RTD's new program of letting passengers ride free if their buses are more  than 15 minutes late was declared a major success Wednesday by bus system  officials who say they gave 59,000 free rides last month -- far fewer than they  expected when they adopted the novel policy.  </P> <P> "We carried in September close to 34 million passengers and we only gave close  to 60,000 free rides," boasted Nikolas Patsaouras, board president of the  Southern California Rapid Transit District. "That translates to 0.18 of 1% --  phenomenal."  </P> <P> Before the free-ride program began Sept. 1, the RTD predicted that drivers  might be handing out up to $600,000 a month in free fares, based on the  percentage of bus runs that are typically more than 15 minutes late in the  countywide system. By contrast, only about $61,000 worth of the $1.10 fares was  claimed by passengers complaining of tardiness last month.  </P> <P> But it was unclear whether the lower-than-expected free-ride rate could be  attributed to more timely buses or to simple lack of interest on the part of  passengers who, when questioned in press interviews about the program, often  seemed ignorant of it or unsure how to take advantage of it.  </P> <P> "There are so many buses, I don't know which one is late," said one confused  passenger last month after the new policy went into effect.  </P> <P> Under the program, passengers who would normally pay cash are allowed to board  free if the bus is late. Those with monthly passes are supposed to get the  driver to punch a warranty card for end-of-the-month cash refunds.  </P> <P> A bus stop survey taken early this summer indicated that about 2.5% of the  system's daily runs were at least 15 minutes late, said RTD spokesman Greg  Davy. But no new numbers were available to show whether that figure had  improved last month.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Davy defended the claims of success made at a downtown press  conference.  </P> <P> "Nick's main point today is that the perception that RTD buses are always late  is incorrect and he feels the first month of this program shows that," Davy  said. "He's not saying no buses are late."  </P> <P> The free rides are part of a major public relations campaign on the part of  Patsaouras, who in July unveiled a Transit Rider Bill of Rights, guaranteeing  RTD passengers good service and a safe journey.  </P> <P> Not everyone has been impressed. Veteran RTD Director Charles Storing  criticized the free-ride proposal when it was first made and said Wednesday  that he still doesn't think it's a good idea.  </P> <P> "I hate to see anybody have to wait for a bus," Storing said. "But there are  just so many situations that cause this that I don't feel RTD should be  punished for circumstances beyond its control."  </P> <P> A spokesman for the bus drivers union, which had initially expressed concerns  about the new policy, was more favorable.  </P> <P> "So far it's gone fairly well," said Goldy Norton, public relations  representative of the United Transportation Union. "It has not to our knowledge  had any great impact on our drivers."  </P> <P> Patsaouras said the cost of the free-fares program -- which will be continued  until the end of the year on a trial basis -- has been offset by ridership  increases. Yet while ridership rose by about 60,000 between August and  September of this year, it is only up about 30,000, or 2%, when compared with  September of last year. And that, district planners say, is statistically  insignificant, since the numbers are subject to a 10% margin of error.  </P></p>

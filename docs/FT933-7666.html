			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Lending increase points to steady recovery MODESTLY STRONG bank and building society lending last month was consistent with an improvement in consumers' willingness to take on new debt, economists said yesterday. Bank of England figures showed a seasonally adjusted Pounds 2.8bn monthly rise in M4 lending - bank and building society lending to the private and corporate sectors. This was slightly higher than expected and a big rise on the figure in June, when lending rose Pounds 627m. With official consumer credit figures, the M4 data reflect a steady, if gentle, recovery. Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at Yamaichi, the Japanese Bank, said: 'The overall message from the figures is that debt is beginning to pick up again. They are consistent with economic recovery.' The underlying growth of broad money, or the M4 money supply, remains weak, however, and points to continued low levels of inflation. Broad money - notes and coins in circulation plus bank and building society deposits - grew a seasonally adjusted 0.9 per cent in July compared with June. This took the year-on-year growth rate to 3.6 per cent, up from 3.3 per cent in the previous month. Although the one-month increase was quite sharp, the annualised growth rate remains close to the bottom of the government's 3 per cent to 9 per cent monitoring range for broad money growth. Separate figures from the British Bankers' Association, covering lending by the UK's nine biggest commercial banks, confirmed that the trend in lending continues upwards, although it has not yet reached the levels of a year ago. Lending by these banks to the UK private sector was a net seasonally adusted Pounds 1.4bn in July, well up on June's rise and on the average of the last six months, both of which were less than Pounds 800m. Lord Inchyra, director-general of the bankers' association, said: 'The composition of lending still presents an all-too-familiar picture with very strong mortgage demand . . . but good-quality commercial propositions are rare.' Unadjusted figures from the association show strong mortgage lending last month offset by reduced lending to most other categories. Mortgage lending rose Pounds 1.05bn, the highest monthly figure for two years and 24 per cent higher than July last year. Consumer credit, however, fell Pounds 192m on the month, nearly twice the reduction of July last year. Within this there was a small increase on credit cards of Pounds 21m. The only significant increase in lending in the companies sector was a Pounds 410m rise in lending to securities dealers, although there was also a Pounds 117m rise for manufacturers. The association said this possibly related to corporation tax payments. Lending to property companies, retailers, building societies, wholesalers, hotels and caterers and construction companies fell.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 28 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa is considering drastically reshuffling his nearly  seven-month-old cabinet by the end of the week, political  sources said Monday [28 February].    Hosokawa's planned reshuffle is expected to center on  removing Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura from his  post. The premier is likely to offer Takemura another  ministerial post, the sources said.    The prime minister aims to change a number of ministers in  his 20-member cabinet in order to tackle economic and  administrative reform, they said.    Hosokawa formed his first cabinet in August to carry out  political reforms, and he apparently thinks the cabinet will  have accomplished its purpose when amendments to the political  reform legislation are approved by the Diet on Thursday or  Friday, the sources said. The legislation was enacted in  January.    Hosokawa on Tuesday will begin hearing opinions of ruling  party leaders on his reshuffle plan and he wants to complete the  shake-up before he delivers his policy speech to the Diet  probably on Friday, they said.    The seven ruling parties have split over Hosokawa's  reshuffle  plan, with the Social Democratic Party [of Japan] (SDP) [SDPJ],  the Democratic Socialist Party and Takemura's Sakigake  [Harbinger] opposed to dumping Takemura, while Shinseito [Japan  Renewal party] and Komeito [Clean Government Party] supporting  the plan.    Since the close of last year, Hosokawa and Takemura have  differed on several important political issues, first on the  partial opening of Japan's rice market, then on the handling of  political reform bills, and on the imposition of a 7 percent  "national welfare tax" in place of the 3 percent consumption  tax, the sources said.    Hosokawa is also likely to abolish the post of state  minister  in charge of political reform, now held by the SDPJ's Sadao  Yamahana, but is considering installing new state ministers in  charge of decentralization of power, deregulation, and external  economy, they said.    The premier wants to retain Justice Minister Akira Mikazuki  because the Tokyo district public prosecutors office has been  investigating a series of bribery scandals involving  construction companies and politicians, the sources said.    Hosokawa will allocate almost the same share of ministerial  posts to the various coalition parties as they hold in the  present cabinet, they said.    On Friday, the cabinet will submit to the Diet the 73.08  trillion yen budget for fiscal 1994. Hosokawa and three cabinet  ministers are expected to give policy speeches to both houses of  the legislature the same day.</p>

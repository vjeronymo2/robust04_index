For Italy it is a matter of turning a  page in history, and it is the voters who are deciding the  transition from the First to the Second Republic. Voting is  taking place in a completely calm atmosphere. This morning the  most important state figures cast their votes. Rocco Tolfa  reports.    [Tolfa] Quiet please, we are voting. Italians are going to  the polls and the party leaders are keeping quiet after a fiery  electoral campaign. However, the leading figures of the Italian  state are saying that these elections truly represent a historic  turning point. This was stressed by President Oscar Luigi  Scalfaro, who voted in his hometown of Novara. The head of  state said this is a decisive moment in the history of our  country. Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, who cast his vote  in Rome, stressed the importance of this vote when he spoke to  our reporter, Anna La Rosa.    [Begin Ciampi recording] I hope that the Saturday of silence  helped the Italian people to meditate internally and to ask  themselves questions about past experiences and about the true  interests of the country in the future. [end recording]    [Tolfa] Ciampi refused to say any more. He held up the law  of electoral silence, which he said he did not intend to break  so as not to disturb the Italian voters who are about to turn a  new page.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Deputy Camilo Escalona yesterday was installed as  president of the Socialist Party [PS] until November 1995, after  the Central Committee plenum ratified the consensus formula  proposed for reorganizing the party leadership.    The new executive board gathers representatives from the  three existing factions within the PS: the "New Left," headed by  Escalona, considered the most orthodox faction; the renewed  faction [renovados]; and the third position faction  [terceristas].    The new PS leadership headed by Escalona has appointed three  more vice presidents in addition to Isabel Allende -- first vice  president and president until yesterday -- and Vivienne  Bachelet, fifth vice president. Gonzalo Martner will be  secretary general and Anibal Palma will be general under  secretary.    The new executive board members are Jaime Perez de Arce  (from  the third position faction) as second vice president; Marcelo  Schilling (from the renewed faction); and Ricardo Solari as  fourth vice president.    The PS plenum unanimously approved the restructuring of the  leadership by 79 votes in favor and four abstentions. Manuel  Almeyda did not want to vote, and argued that the grassroots  should have participated in the process.    This decision was made following two days of meetings and  debates that took place in the "El Canelo de Nos" center.  [passage omitted]</p>

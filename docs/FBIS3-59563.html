			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Four extremely advanced Russian jet engines are on  the benches of the Proel laboratories in Florence. They are  being studied to learn the secrets of this Russian technology,  and integrate it with that of Proel (Alenia-Finmeccanica),  thereby leading to the creation of an all-Italian propulsion  system.    The Russian engines, produced by the Fakel company, are of  the electroionic plasma type. The molecules of a gas (xenon),  are ionized inside them and brought to a high temperature. They  leave at high velocity, generating the thrust. These engines  have an extremely high efficiency and this makes them ideal for  use with telecommunications satellites, both to keep them in  their correct positions in orbit and also for making changes to  the orbit. Chemical rockets are used at present. These require  heavy tanks filled with hydrazine. The electrical propulsors on  the other hand are small, light, and consume very little. This  means that their use reduces the weight of the satellites by 20  percent.    The Russians have been using these propulsors for 20 years.  However, because the construction technology was not very  refined, they had the handicap of a limited life. Now that they  have arrived in the West, they will be revised to obtain better  results. Proel, which has already acquired precious experience  with the similar technology of the electronic gun for the  Tethered satellite and with the development of neutralizers for  the German ionic engine Rit, is now developing a project for a  completely Italian engine to be used on future satellites.    Company president Marco Gerevini stated that: " We have  received a contract from the ASI [Italian Space Agency], valued  at 8.5 billion lire, to perfect this new technology within 28  months."    Designer Gianfranco Cirri added that: "About 20 billion lire  will then be needed to build a prototype to fly. All the parts  for this could come from Proel."</p>

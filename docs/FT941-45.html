			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / International Company News: Interbrew buys Zagreb stake Interbrew, the Belgian brewer, has won the tender to buy a 23.78 per cent stake in Zagreb Breweries, Croatia's largest brewery, with a bid of DM19.5m (Dollars 11.69m). Its offer, which values the brewery at DM82m, beat four rival bidders including Brau of Austria, Castel of France and Mr Andronic Luksic, a Croatian millionaire now living in Chile. The shares sold to Interbrew are owned by the Croatian Privatisation Fund and two Croatian pension funds. The brewery was privatised in April 1993 and the majority of shares are owned by employees. Interbrew plans to invest a further DM21m through a capital increase which would constitute the largest foreign investment in Croatia. The latest investment marks a rise in investor interest in Croatia. Foreign companies made equity investments of Dollars 16m in 1992 and Dollars 56m in the first nine months of 1993. But with the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina appearing close to resolution, bankers are predicting that the level of investment will rise gradually. 'There will be a lot of interest in medium to small deals, particularly from Austrian and German companies,' said Mr Charles Harman, executive director at CS First Boston in London. 'Bigger deals will not be so easy.' A privatisation law came into force in May 1991 and 1,907 enterprises had been privatised by the end of January. 'We haven't stopped the process even for a minute, even at the most difficult moments,' said Ivan Penic, president of the Croatian Privatisation Fund. The law allows Croatian workers to buy shares of up to DM20,000 in book value at a 20 per cent discount to the nominal value plus 1 per cent for every year they have worked. One third of the remaining shares in each enterprise were transferred to two pension funds and the balance was transferred to the Croatian Privatisation Fund, which now has a DM8bn portfolio of assets. However, the government desperately needs money and the fund is starting to sell assets. In early March, the fund agreed to sell a 30.5 per cent stake in Croatia's second-largest brewery, at Karlovac. The buyer was Mr Luksic, who paid DM10m for his stake. The fund is planning to sell stakes in several other consumer product companies, including Kras, Croatia's largest chocolate producer.</p>

			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> USD ENDS ALL DOUBT QUICKLY;  </P> <P> COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE TOREROS TAKE A 32-13 FIRST-HALF LEAD ON THE WAY TO AN  EASY, 71-45 VICTORY OVER STEPHEN F. AUSTIN.  </P> <P> In the University of San Diego's Saturday night shoot-around with Stephen F.  Austin State, the Toreros shot a hole in the idea any team can beat another in  college basketball.  </P> <P> SFA never had a shot. USD's 71-45 victory in front of 713 at the USD Sports  Center was, for all intents and purposes over in . . . well, pick your spot.  </P> <P> After trailing, 2-0, USD scored five points in a row. It may have taken the  Toreros four minutes 10 seconds to record their first point (perhaps because of  a week layoff for final exams) but once they got untracked, they had no  trouble.  </P> <P> Scoring streaks of 14-0 and 7-0 helped USD establish a 22-point lead, its  biggest of the first half, with 17 seconds left.  </P> <P> The amazing thing was that USD had scored just 32 points, the Lumberjacks 10.  It took a three-point basket at the buzzer by Jeff Williams to give SFA 13 by  halftime.  </P> <P> Had USD not been shooting so poorly early -- the Toreros made just six of 20  shots (30%) in the first 6:02 -- it might have had one of its better first  halves ever.  </P> <P> As it was, SFA had one of its worst in 64 years. After Tim Holloway scored the  game's first basket at 17:30, the Lumberjacks did not score again for another  4:45.  </P> <P> That paled in comparison with the 6:42 nap it took after its fourth point. With  6:02 left, Norman Schippers' 15-foot jumper cut USD's lead to 19-6.  </P> <P> A few minutes later, John Jerome made two free throws and a layup, and Pat  Holbert sank a three-pointer to give USD a 28-8 lead.  </P> <P> It was pretty much over from there.  </P> <P> After four consecutive road losses, USD needed a victory to begin its  eight-game home stand. USD is 3-5 and plays four more nonconference games at  home before opening West Coast Conference play Jan. 6 against Santa Clara.  </P> <P> Perhaps more, it needed to avoid a loss to a team that has yet to win this  season (0-6) and has lost eight in a row over two seasons, two shy of the  school record set in 1941-42.  </P> <P> "We've been on the road, and we've been beat up pretty bad," USD Coach Hank  Egan said. "We needed a win."  </P> <P> Said Wayman Strickland, who had one of his best games since switching to point  guard this season, "We need to get well on this home stand."  </P> <P> SFA was a good short-term remedy, but was it a case of the Toreros playing  well, or did the Lumberjacks play that badly?  </P> <P> Said Egan: "I think we played well at times. I think defensively we played  better than we have. They're a young team, no doubt about it."  </P> <P> SFA has six freshmen, three sophomores and just four upper classmen. That  makeup reminds Egan all too well of his teams the past two seasons.  </P> <P> In the two-plus years since making the NCAA Tournament, USD is 22-42. SFA is  20-42 over that same period after making the National Invitation Tournament in  1986-87.  </P> <P> But USD is clearly on the upswing. The Lumberjacks . . . well, they were picked  to finish last in the Southland Conference.  </P> <P> The statisticians at courtside probably set a personal record putting together  the numbers after the first half. It isn't hard to figure out a game that's  32-13.  </P> <P> USD made twice as many shots (12-6) and had nearly twice as many rebounds  (19-10). The Toreros made seven of eight free throws to SFA's zero of zero (USD  committed only three fouls). SFA had 11 turnovers to just six for USD.  </P> <P> The only statistical area the Lumberjacks were even was in three-point field  goals. Both teams made one of three. The second half was closer mainly because  SFA made five three-pointers and shot 46% from the field.  </P> <P> Still, the 45 points was a USD opponent low for this season, as was the 13 in  the first half.  </P> <P> Jerome, averaging 19 points per game, led all scorers with 22 points. Gylan  Dottin added nine and Kelvin Woods eight as Egan substituted freely in the  second half.  </P></p>

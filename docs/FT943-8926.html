			<p>940815 FT  15 AUG 94 / Brazil seeks aid for regional integration costs The Brazilian government has proposed that new financing should be made available to support regions hurt by the movement toward economic integration in Latin America. Mr Celso Amorim, foreign minister, said his government had suggested that this and other proposals should be discussed at the summit of American leaders called by US President Bill Clinton to take place in Miami in December. Mr Amorim told a small group of foreign journalists in Braslia that the proposal was one of several made by Brazil which reflected its hope that the summit 'will be more than a media event'. The suggestion was that funds should be made available by the Inter-American Development Bank to support the free trade effort in Latin America. The money should 'not only support regional projects such as roads or electricity generation, but also help economic adjustment in areas that are affected by integration'. Integration was beneficial, 'but there are sectors that suffer in the process,' he said. Brazil has also proposed discussions on trade at the summit 'to find a mechanism in which areas heavily protected by the US are open for negotiation'. Protection of the US market was high in several sectors important to Brazil. Orange juice carries a specific per litre tariff that works out at 35-40 per cent, which Mr Amorim described as 'outrageous', while protection of the footwear industry was another concern. It was also seeking fuller discussions with the US on its anti-dumping rules 'that very often work in ways that we consider arbitrary'. Braslia also backed a Venezuelan proposal to increase international co-operation to tackle corruption in government. Such co-operation should include the ability to gain evidence from examination of bank accounts in other countries to help investigate corruption cases, he said. Brazil had also proposed funds from the IADB or the Organisation of American States for the creation of a special agency - 'a kind of UN Development Programme' - to cover the issue of human rights.</p>

			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / De Michelis faces corruption probe MR Gianni De Michelis, foreign minister in Italy's previous Andreotti government, has been placed under investigation for alleged corruption, Venice magistrates announced yesterday. Mr De Michelis is the leading Socialist figure in the Veneto region and the magistrates' move follows an inquiry into alleged rigged contracts and illegal financing of political parties. Mr De Michelis last night vowed to defend himself vigorously. On July 6, Mr Giorgio Casadei, a key aide of the former foreign minister in the Veneto, was arrested and imprisoned on charges of alleged corruption relating to contracts at Venice airport and an autostrada extension. The magistrates must now decide whether to ask parliament to waive immunity on Mr De Michelis, who took over as deputy leader of the Socialist party last month when Professor Giuliano Amato was chosen to be prime minister. The Venice magistrates' investigations follow similar lines of inquiry to those of the Milan municipal corruption scandal.</p>

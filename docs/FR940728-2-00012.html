			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For Enlin, we calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. We revised inland freight, ocean freight and packing case cost to incorporate the average weight of cross pipe fittings as determined during verification because Enlin did not do so as requested by the Department. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 1.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. We disregarded cancelled sales which were included in the sales listing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. For those sales with updated payment and/or shipment dates which were not incorporated into the final computer tape submission, we recalculated the imputed credit expenses based on the weighted-average difference between payment and shipment dates for those sales which were both shipped and paid for during the POI. For the associated expenses, we calculated a product specific weighted average.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Ta Chen, we calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. We estimated the appropriate shipment date for U.S. purchase price sales which had an incorrect shipment date reported. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 3.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. We recalculated imputed credit for purchase price sales based on amended shipment dates that were improperly reported and by using the lower of two U.S. interest rates available to Ta Chen. ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comment 3 and 4 below.) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. We recalculated U.S. inventory carrying costs on a warehouse-specific basis taking into account the amended interest rate noted in item 2.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. For ESP sales made from all U.S. warehouses, we recalculated the movement expenses and bank charges based on expenses incurred on shipments that were made during the POI rather than on expenses incurred on shipments made twelve months prior to the POI. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For Yih Tai, we calculated USP according to the methodology described in our preliminary determination, with the following exceptions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. We recalculated packing based on revisions to packing labor as determined at the cost verifications. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Foreign Market Value <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in our preliminary determination, we determined that the home market was not viable for sales of SST pipe fittings made by either Enlin and Yih Tai. We selected Canada as the third-country market basis for FMV for both Enlin and Yih Tai. We found the home market viable for sales of SST pipe fittings made by Ta Chen. We calculated FMV as noted in the ``Price-to-Price Comparisons'' and ``Price to Constructed Value (CV)'' sections of this notice. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost of Production <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As stated in our preliminary determination, the Department initiated a cost investigation based on reasonable grounds to believe or suspect that Enlin, Ta Chen, and Yih Tai's home market/third country sales were made at prices below their respective cost of production (COP). We received responses to our cost questionnaires and verified the submitted data. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

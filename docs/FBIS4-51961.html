			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- Kim Hwa-sim who is the  daughter of the unconverted long-term prisoner, Kim In-so, sent  letters to various organisations of South Korea and her father  on May 4.    She is a university teacher in Pyongyang.    In her letter to the headquarters for the promotion of the  repatriation of old Kim In-so and Ham Se-hwan, the Human Rights  Committee of the National Council of Christian Churches, the Bar  Association for Democratic Society and the Family Movement for  Realizing Democracy in South Korea, she appealed to them to  cooperate in the return of her father to the North. She said  her father should have been returned to the North at the time of  the repatriation of POWs according to the international law on  POWs because [words indistinct] while active as a guerrilla, his  route blocked in the strategic retreat, after going to the South  Korean area during the war.    "The South Korean authorities kept my father behind bars for  33 years and seven months for he refused ideological  conversion," the letter noted, and stated: "This is a very wrong  act ignoring the international law and the humanitarian idea of  the Red Cross."    She went on:    "That my father who is a POW should be returned to the North  where his children live at an early date unhindered by any  condition and reason, is a unanimous call of the entire fellow  countrymen and the conscience of mankind.    "I earnestly request once again your organisations which are  engaged in righteous activities in South Korea for national  reconciliation and unity, democratisation of society and  national reunification to continue to show deep concern for the  misfortune of my family and make persistent efforts for an early  repatriation of my father."    Kim Hwa-sim in the letter to her father said the DPRK Red  Cross Society urged the repatriation of Kim In-so and Ham  Se-hwan last year and on April 19 this year, but the South side  is taking an unjust attitude toward it. "This is an act ignoring  the international law on the POWs," she said.    Recalling that the dear leader Comrade Kim Chong-il recently  expressed concern over the fate of the unconverted long-term  prisoners in South Korea and said they should be brought back to  the homeland, the letter expressed the firm belief that her  father would come back to the hometown, removing obstacles lying  in his path to the North, just as he won the struggle for  justice for 40 years.</p>

Homeland police spokesman Col  Dave George could not immediately confirm or deny the claim,  saying officers did not enter brief detentions for questioning  into a common register.    The ANC Eastern Transvaal region said in a statement deputy  regional secretary Phillip Radebe, his driver Mandla Mholongo,  and regional organisers Ephraim Mogale and Piet Mello were  arrested at Moretele 2 on Sunday and taken to Hammanskraal  security offices.    They were interrogated, kicked, punched, burnt with  cigarettes and warned not to set foot in Bophuthatswana again,  and were then released.    The four had gone to Marapyane village at Moretele 2 to  attend an ANC meeting. Voter education material such as  calenders, pamphlets, stickers, ballot papers and personal  notebooks were confiscated, the ANC said.    Col George said the men should forward their complaints  through police headquarters or lawyers.</p>

			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Macallan-Glenlivet down by 15% to Pounds 2.84m MACALLAN-Glenlivet, the Scotch whisky distiller, reported a 15 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the half year to June 30, because of reduced demand for new whisky from blenders. Profits fell to Pounds 2.84m (Pounds 3.33m) on reduced sales of Pounds 6.93m (Pounds 8.18m). Operating profit fell to Pounds 2.36m (Pounds 2.86m) as demand for new fillings from blending customers fell by 36 per cent. Sales of the company's own brand, the Macallan single malt, increased by 17 per cent, widening its international distribution. Mr Phillips expected overseas sales, particularly in Italy, to remain buoyant. 'The devalued pound should make it easier to export,' he said. 'Despite poor conditions in the domestic market, the board expects profits for the full year will be close to those of last year,' he stated. Pre-tax profits in 1991 increased by 10 per cent from Pounds 6.69m to Pounds 7.38m. Midterm earnings per share fell to 1.77p (2.34p). The interim dividend was increased to 0.3p (0.25p)</p>

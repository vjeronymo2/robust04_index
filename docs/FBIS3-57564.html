During the conversation they dealt with  prospects for developing economic and cultural cooperation  between our countries.    Bilateral official relations at present, noted Yerik  Asanbayev, are exemplary and effective. South Korean  businessmen in a short period of time have initiated production  of televisions in Almaty and refrigerators in Karaganda.  However, the dynamism of cooperation must be raised, especially  in the sphere of providing credits to Kazakhstan.    To support the recently introduced national currency and to  ease the transfer to a market economy we need support from  outside, stressed the vice president. The republic needs to  gather a critical mass of credits for a structural  transformation of the economy and introduction of new technology  in development of minerals. He expressed the confidence that  the South Korean side, which at one time promised to allocate  $350 million to Kazakhstan, will keep its word. Housing is  built quickly and well in that country. To carry out the  program of housing construction in our republic it is intended  to make a close study of that experience in order to use it in  action. Gratitude was expressed to the ambassador for  humanitarian assistance to the value of 150,000 dollars, which  had arrived that day in Almaty from Seoul.    Kim Chang-kon stated that he would exert every effort to  strengthen friendly ties between the two countries, to improve  economic links, and to attract businessmen from the Republic of  Korea to Kazakhstan.</p>

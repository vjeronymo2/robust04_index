			<p>BFN     [Text] Kharkov [no dateline as received] -- While in the  oblast on 17 June, Leonid Kuchma, president of the Ukrainian  Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs and a candidate for  president of Ukraine, expressed himself critically regarding the  Supreme Council having elected Vitaliy Masol as the new prime  minister. He is convinced that this does not demonstrate the  recognition of this person's authority, but is a manifestation  of ordinary political games on the eve of the presidential  election. "If Ukraine's voters elect someone other than Leonid  Kravchuk or Oleksandr Moroz as president on 26 June, Leonid  Kuchma stressed, then cooperation between the prime minister and  the president will be fairly problematical."    Leonid Kuchma did not rule out that the last week in the  presidential marathon will bring much that is unexpected. In  particular, in his opinion, contenders for the presidential seat  will withdraw their candidacies. If Oleksandr Moroz does this,  Leonid Kuchma expressed the hope that his [Moroz's] electorate  will vote for Leonid Kuchma. In the opinion of Leonid  Danylovych Kuchma, the forces supporting him in Ukraine's east  and south should influence changes to the existing state of  affairs more actively, when in fact western Ukraine is dictating  its conditions to the whole of the 50 million-strong country.    Leonid Kuchma maintained: "If I am not elected, this will  not  be a great tragedy for me. On the whole, I am returning to  politics only in order to save Ukraine. Otherwise, I would not  risk going into the corridors of power."</p>

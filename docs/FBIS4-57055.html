			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Analysts in the Peruvian security forces have  concluded that the new Shining Path Central Committee, which is  headed by dissident Alberto Ramirez Duran, also known as  "Feliciano," has decided to reorganize the party to resume the  so-called "people's war."    The key steps toward this objectives are: a) resume "work  with the masses" (especially in poor Lima neighborhoods); b)  step up military actions; c) strengthen compartmentalization  (cell organization) at all levels; and d) enhance underground  security. The main objective is to move ahead with the  so-called Sixth Grand Plan, whose implementation stopped  suddenly in September 1992 when Abimael Guzman was captured.    In simple words, "Feliciano's" Shining Path faction intends  to continue terrorist operations, openly disregarding Guzman's  instructions to his followers, who have paid no attention so  far, to cease violent actions in the quest for a peace agreement  with the government.    Above and beyond the feverish fantasies of Shining Path's  current leadership, the organization no longer poses an imminent  threat for the Peruvian state. The analysts believe that  Shining Path's decay is irreversible, although it is not going  to be a short-term process. The experts indicated that the final  battle against the terrorist organization is nowhere in sight  yet, and it would be imprudent to lower the guard.    According to information this newspaper and Dincote  [National  Counterterrorism Directorate] gathered in Lima suburbs, for some  time now the Shining Path has been infiltrating many  shantytowns, settlements, cooperative urban developments, and  the multitudinous Lima marketplaces. This infiltration is  simply part of the "work with the masses" aimed at rebuilding  cadres.    The murder of neighborhood leader and street vendor Benito  Escalante Apaza on 29 April, near La Parada in the La Victoria  district, was followed by the murder of national boxing champion  Carlos Lavalle, a much-liked former leader of the Felix Raucarte  Housing Cooperative in Ate-Vitarte. Dincote found out that  Lavalle was killed by an Shining Path annihilation squad, and  that Escalante Apaza used to be a leader of the Manuel Scorza  settlement in San Juan de Lurigancho.    Dincote also found out that Shining Path militants killed  two  residents of the Santa Eulalia district (Huarochiri Province),  near Chosica, early on 28 April. The victims were accused of  stealing cattle. The police explained that terrorists seek to  win the residents' trust and support by punishing criminals.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / International Company News: Gillette posts record earnings in third quarter STRONG growth in sales of the Sensor range of shaving products helped produce record third-quarter income of Dollars 142m for Gillette, the US shaving and consumer products group. This was a 13 per cent increase on the same period last year, writes Richard Tomkins in New York. Turnover for the quarter rose by 7 per cent to Dollars 1.34bn and net income per common share rose 12 per cent to 65 cents. Mr Alfred Zeien, chairman and chief executive, said the results had come in spite of persistent economic sluggishness and the adverse effect of shifts in exchange rates with European currencies. Profits from blade and razor products were higher than in the comparable quarter, the company said. Toiletries and cosmetics profits were modestly ahead, while profits on stationery products were sharply higher following the first-time inclusion of Parker Pen's results. In contrast, tough competition sent Oral-B profits sharply lower. Net income for the nine months to date was 12 per cent up at Dollars 422m before the effect of accounting changes.</p>

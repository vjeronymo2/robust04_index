			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Oftel measures aim to increase competition in telecom market A RANGE of initiatives to speed up competition in the telecommunications market was unveiled yesterday by Mr Don Cruickshank, director general of Oftel, the industry regulator. Mr Cruickshank said the measures would enable rivals of British Telecommunications to establish themselves more rapidly. In the next five years he expected competitors would invest Pounds 5bn-Pounds 6bn in the UK - roughly half BT's rate of investment. The dozen initiatives cover issues such as portability of telephone numbers, publication of BT's previously confidential market information and access for competitors to BT's directory inquiries database. Although many measures are technical, Oftel believes that collectively they will make a big difference to the development of competition. Mr Cruickshank was speaking following an industry-wide forum held on Monday in London to discuss arrangements for competitors to connect their networks to BT's. The meeting was attended by 18 operators including BT, Mercury Communications, several cable television companies and American Telephone and Telegraph, the largest US telecoms group. Both Oftel and BT said progress had been made but further discussions would be needed. Mr Cruickshank said he did not expect strong resistance from BT to his agenda for promoting competition. He said BT had an interest in showing there were no obstacles to fair competition in the UK, not least because of its ambition to gain access to foreign markets. Some of the initiatives are still under discussion but final decisions on whether to press ahead will be taken over the next six to nine months. The main ideas are: Interconnection - Oftel is working on determining a standard menu of interconnection charges that competitors would have to pay BT for using its network. It is also considering specifying service levels and technical standards that BT would have to abide by when providing interconnection services; Number portability, which would allow people switching from BT to another local operator to keep their numbers; Market information - Oftel will publish information detailing market shares in different segments of the industry; Equal access which would allow customers with BT lines to use the long-distance services of rival operators as easily as BT's services; Opening BT's directory inquiry database to competitors.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 2 KYODO -- Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata  expressed grave concern Thursday [2 June] over North Korea's  refusal to accept inspections of its suspect nuclear facilities  sought by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    "If (North Korea) does not talk without reserve, it will  lead  to an undesirable direction," Hata told reporters at his  official residence. "North Korea should take a serious view of  the concern of the international community."    The United States has warned it will seek economic sanctions  against North Korea if the IAEA is prevented from carrying out  tests on nuclear fuel rods at the 5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon  some 90 kilometers from Pyongyang to determine whether spent  fuel has been diverted to the manufacture of nuclear weapons.    North Korea over the past week has been removing spent fuel  rods from the reactor. The IAEA has warned that its capacity to  carry out tests will be lost "in days" without proper technical  arrangements.    North Korea has repeatedly prevented IAEA inspectors from  carrying out full inpections on its nuclear plants, fueling  suspicions that the country is secretly developing nuclear  weapons.    A government spokesman later said Japan's position is to  seek  a peaceful resolution of North Korea's nuclear issue.    "We still hope this issue will be resolved in a peaceful  manner through efforts by the parties concerned," Deputy Chief  Cabinet Secretary Nobuo Ishihara told a news conference.    Ishihara also noted the government is scrutinizing North  Korea's virtual refusal to accept Monday's UN Security Council  statement that urged Pyongyang to comply with nuclear safeguards  requirements.    Despite the harshly worded rejection, Ishihara said, no  noticeable shift in North Korea's stance on the matter can be  seen.    It is not known how the countries involved will respond to  Pyongyang's renewed refusal to allow international inspections  of its nuclear reactor as IAEA inspectors are still continuing  observation in North Korea, he added.</p>

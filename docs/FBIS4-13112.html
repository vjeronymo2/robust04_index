			<p>BFN     [Text] Cairo, 16 Apr (INA) -- Kim Yong-sop, ambassador of  North Korea in Cairo, has held the United States responsible for  the continuation of the unjust embargo imposed on Iraq and its  consequent human and material losses.    In an exclusive statement to INA's correspondent in Cairo,  the Korean ambassador said U.S. determination and deliberate  attempts to harm Iraq, and its use of the Security Council to  apply illegal resolutions against it, violate international law  and seriously jeopardize world peace and security.    He said U.S.-Western attempts to commit aggression against  Iraq, besiege it, and interfere in its domestic affairs are all  part of a old, and now new, colonialist scheme, led by the  United States, to intimidate Third World nations, particularly  countries that adhere to independent decision making and reject  U.S. hegemony.    The North Korean ambassador said U.S. claims about the  implementation of international resolutions, whether by Iraq or  Korea, have fallen on deaf ears and have no legitimate  foundation or relation to international law. He said these  resolutions are void and are in line with U.S. interests in the  world.    He said the Security Council has lost its true role in  maintaining law and protecting nations and is now being used in  an ugly manner to achieve U.S.-Western strategy whose features  are today clearer than any time before.    The ambassador said his country firmly rejects the false  propaganda campaign led by the United States against it under  the pretext of Korea's rejection of the White House wishes and  orders.</p>

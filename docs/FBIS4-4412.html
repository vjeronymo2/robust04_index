			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 30 (YONHAP) -- The Seoul government  welcomed Japan's announced market-opening measures in a  commentary Wednesday, saying it looks forward to a more concrete  and effective follow-up in June.    Although Japan's market opening package requires further  study, it proposes specific ways to reduce the country's trade  surplus, increase public investment and advance deregulation, a  Foreign Ministry official said.    "We evaluate highly the sincere efforts for market opening  by  the Japanese Government, such as expansion of domestic demand  and increasing imports," he said.    "We hope that the plan's specific contents will be wrapped  up  in June and include more concrete and effective opening  measures," the commentary said. "And also that such steps by the  Japanese Government will improve South Korean entry to the  Japanese market and contribute to rectifying the trade imbalance  between South Korea and Japan."</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Juba, 15 May (SUNA) -- The convention of Juba  peace gathering affirms the southerners' extreme desire for  peace, said Vice President Major General George Kongor.    Addressing the opening session of the gathering, Kongor said  that the gathering is a message unanimously reached by the  internal front to condemn the acts of those who back the  continuation of the war in the south. The revolution, he said,  is keen to achieve the Sudanese peoples' full desire for a  comprehensive peace and stability in southern Sudan. All the  Sudanese people reject the continuation of the 14-year war, he  added. [passage omitted]</p>

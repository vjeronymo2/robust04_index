			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / Troops quell Venezuela riots Venezuela has used troops and police to put down rioting and looting in two of its provincial capitals, writes Joseph Mann from Caracas. Crowds took to the streets in the eastern city of Cumana and in Barinas, in western Venezuela, on Tuesday. They were provoked by a Supreme Court decision to suspend 'temporarily' a repeat of gubernatorial elections, scheduled for March 14. The results of the original elections, on December 6 last year, were inconclusive. The army, national guard, and marines took control of the two cities, where one person was reported killed, scores injured and several hundred arrested. Clashes continued in Cumana yesterday.</p>

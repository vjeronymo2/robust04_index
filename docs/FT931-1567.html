			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Output by Bosch to leave Germany BOSCH, the German vehicle components, electronics and power tools group, is to transfer production of car alternators from Stuttgart to south Wales and Spain. The company says alternator production will cease 'in the medium term' at Feuerbach, Stuttgart. Production will be moved to a plant at Miskin, near Cardiff, and a smaller factory at Treto in Spain 'in order to reduce costs and thus secure competitiveness'. Bosch says a cut of up to 700 jobs at Feuerbach, which will continue to make other components, 'cannot be excluded'. The Miskin plant, which has been manufacturing alternators since it opened two years ago, is expected to double annual alternator production to 5m by 1995-96, and to increase its workforce over this period from 700 to 1,200. Bosch said Feuerbach had been a pilot facility for a new compact alternator and it had always been the company's strategy to transfer production to its Welsh and Spanish plants. The alternator made at Miskin, where the overall investment in the plant and equipment is about Pounds 100m, is designed to cope with the increasing amount of electrical components in cars. Eighty per cent of the Miskin alternators are exported. A second production hall in Wales will be opened later this year. The arrival of Japanese car-makers in the UK was an important factor in Bosch choosing to open Miskin, which also has lower labour and production costs than Stuttgart. Bosch has a no-strike agreement at Miskin and says that staff relations are very good.</p>

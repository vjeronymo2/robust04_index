			<p>940615 FT  15 JUN 94 / Survey of Telecommunications in Business (1): A crucial role in companies large and small - The high value of business in the financial services sector is a powerful driving force behind competition, liberalisation and innovation across the telecommunications industry Never have telecommunications been so vital to business success. From being one important service among many, telecoms have become strategic to most businesses. And as reliance on telecoms has increased, the range of the industry's services consumed by the corporate sector has risen. This is as true of small as of large businesses. The local plumber, who a decade ago relied on a 'plain old telephone' and possibly a spouse to take messages, will now very likely have a pager, a cellular phone, and two home phone lines complete with answerphone, call-waiting, fax and other value-added services. If he or she belongs to a larger organisation, there might also be a personal computer networked to the parent company's billing, ordering and messaging systems. At the other extreme, telecoms is the lifeblood of the financial services sector. Furthermore, the value and concentration of business in the financial services sectors of the main industrialised countries are powerful driving forces behind competition, liberalisation and innovation across the telecoms industry. Research recently completed by the London Business School for London's City Corporation on the telecoms infrastructure of the industrial world's principal financial centres highlights the important social, industrial and economic knock-on effects of those trends.* Based on a study of telecoms and financial centres in France, Germany, Japan, the US and the UK, the LBS reaches five conclusions of significance far beyond the financial services sector: A financial centre's competitive advantage in telecoms is 'much more likely to be a consequence of the differences in tariffs, product choice and reliability than of differences in the technology employed.' Telecoms account for about 8 per cent of the financial service sector's spending on goods and services, a significantly higher percentage than that spent by other sectors. To put this in perspective, about 35 per cent of all international calls from the US originate in New York City; 80 per cent of all telecoms spending in France originates or ends up in Paris; more than a quarter of all the UK's cellular mobile calls are made within London's M25 orbital motorway. In each case the financial sector is but one aspect of the concentration, but nonetheless a critical one. The value to telecoms operators of business generated by financial sectors is leading to massive infrastructure investment in them. Fibre-optic grids and new switching and transmission technologies are providing broadband and other advanced services down to the level even of medium-sized businesses requiring a few dozen lines. This is particularly true of the financial districts of London, New York and Tokyo, where the volume of business is greatest and several operators now provide fibre grids. The availability of advanced services at competitive prices is, in turn, helping to preserve the concentration of financial services. A few years ago it was fashionable to believe that modern telecoms would encourage a migration of business away from established centres, with business districts disintegrating and 'teleworking' becoming ever more prevalent. There is evidence of this in some sectors, but the LBS study suggests that in financial services the disparity between network provision in established centres and beyond may be having the opposite effect, acting as a strong incentive to continued concentration. The value of the telecoms business in financial districts is serving as a powerful stimulus to competition between operators, with many new entrants building their own local infrastructure to by-pass the former monopoly suppliers and customise their own services. Where competition is allowed, the effect has been to reduce tariffs, widen product choice, improve overall service quality, make multiple-sourcing a rule for most businesses - and, once again - to help preserve concentration. In three of the five centres - New York, London and Tokyo - the market for the carriage of 'voice' traffic over public networks is largely liberalised, and competition between operators is fierce. In New York, 'competitive access providers' (Caps) by-passing the local network of Nynex, the regional Bell operator, have taken about 60 per cent of the former monopoly operator's private-line business. Mr Richard Jalkut, chief executive of Nynex's New York operations, says: 'They have turned us upside down. We are doing things now which we had convinced ourselves three or four years ago were impossible.' For instance, Nynex now provides 1.5 MBit circuits within 24 hours, which a few years ago used to take Nynex six months. The largest of New York's 'Caps', MFS, has just launched a network in the City of London, offering local services across its own infrastructure and re-sale facilities beyond. It is the fourth operator in the City to build its own infrastructure, and another two are in the offing. In addition, upwards of a dozen re-sale operators are established, aiming particularly at high-tariffed international traffic. Take the case of one of the UK's largest insurance companies, with a large office in the City and a network of more than 50 centres across the country. The company now boasts three City of London suppliers - BT, Mercury, and Worldcom, a US international re-sale operator. It is looking at both MFS and Colt, another US operator launched earlier this year which is building its own City infrastructure. 'I am after not just price but resilience,' says the company's telecoms manager. Resilience - back-up capacity in case one operator fails - is a key factor: many telecoms managers are keen to 'dual source' to improve their resilience; and resilience, in turn, makes them reluctant wholly to sever their ties with the former monopoly operator, however great the price savings on offer from its competitors. A report by the New York City Partnership in 1990 estimated that a loss of service in a key business district for a single day could disprupt financial transactions worth more than Dollars 1 trillion. Significantly, the insurance company mentioned above still sends about half of its long-distance business over BT, on grounds of resilience. In France and Germany, the other two centres studied by the LBS, the 'voice' monopolies of the state operators will remain in force until 1998, under the timetable for telecoms liberalisation agreed by the European Union's Council of Ministers last year. The liberalisation of mobile, satellite and value-added services has already led to strong competition, particularly in virtual private networks for large corporate customers. Within a year, MFS plans to open shop in Paris and Frankfurt, offering services within the limits of the EU rules. What is competition doing to prices? Without doubt it is forcing them down, but one needs to be wary of simplistic generalisations. The graphs of price levels (see chart below), taken from a recent study of business tariffs in the UK, France, Germany and Italy by Analysys, the Cambridge-based telecoms consultancy, reveal a complex picture. In almost every sector surveyed, the UK came out with lower telecoms prices than the other three countries. But it also had lower prices a decade ago, before liberalisation and the privatisation of BT. The relative gap between the UK and the others has not changed greatly over the decade - indeed, for international calls it has narrowed significantly. The principal UK gainers appear to be very large - 100-line plus - businesses. Furthermore, the gap between Mercury and BT has narrowed progressively in the past few years, as competitive and regulatory pressures have forced BT's tariffs sharply downwards. It is a similar picture in the US, where fierce competition between AT&amp;T and MCI has steadily eroded the tariff gap between the two carriers. In mobile and other value-added sectors, competition is entrenched in the US and is spreading fast across Europe. The UK's fourth mobile cellular operator was launched earlier this year; the auction of PCS licences in the US next year will further intensify US cellular competition; and competing operators are spreading fast across mainland Europe and Asia-Pacific. In fixed-line services, although competition is likely to be fiercest in financial centres, the US and UK experience suggests that it will extend well beyond in due course. 'Caps' are entrenched in most large US cities; legislation before Congress could bust the Baby Bells' remaining local monopolies. In the UK, central Manchester is about to become as hotly contested a market as central London, with three operators building infrastructure in addition to BT and Mercury. The trends are the same across the rest of the developed world. Australia and New Zealand have undergone radical programmes of telecoms deregulation; Hongkong Telecom's local monopoly is to be abolished next year; and numerous other Asia-Pacific states are proceeding down the same road. For businesses able to grasp the potential of choice and technological advance, the opportunities are legion. * Jenny Ireland, 'The Importance of Telecommunications to London as an International Financial Centre,' Corporation of London, Guildhall, London EC2P 2EJ.

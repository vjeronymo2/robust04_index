			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed rules would require that the performance history for the pool offered be presented before any other performance history in the disclosure document. The performance of pools similar to the pool offered would be presented after that of the pool offered, on a pool-by-pool basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The performance disclosure requirement of current Rule 4.21(a)(4) focuses on the past performance of the pool offered, its CTAs, principals of the CTAs and, if the pool has less than a year history, the CPO and each of its principals. As noted above, these requirements would be largely eliminated for pools with at least a three-year operating history. For pools with a shorter history, additional past performance records would be required to be disclosed. These requirements were devised to focus upon the performance of pools similar to the pool offered and of persons responsible for management of a significant portion of the offered pool's assets. Further, to the extent that performance of principals is required, unlike the current rule which requires disclosure of the performance of all principals, the proposed rule would require disclosure of the past performance of ``trading principals'' only. A ``trading principal'' would be defined in proposed Rule 4.10(m) to mean a principal of a CPO or CTA who participates in making commodity interest trading decisions for a pool or client or who supervises, or has authority to allocate pool assets to, persons so engaged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed rules also would take into account arrangements in which pools use trading managers to direct their trading. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The term ``trading manager'' is defined in proposed Rule 4.10(j) as any person, other than the pool's CPO, with authority to allocate pool assets to CTAs or investee pools.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Trading managers are CTAs and are required to be registered as such.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the practice of retaining trading managers to select and monitor the performance of CTAs and investee pools to which pool assets will be committed has become commonplace. CPOs seek to maximize pool returns by allocating pool assets based on analysis of the returns achieved by CTAs retained for the pool and investee pools in which the pool has invested as compared to those of other CTAs and investee pools, and in response to changing market conditions. CPOs frequently rely on trading managers to continuously review the performance of CTAs and investee pools and allocate and reallocate pool funds. Because the trading manager, rather than the CPO, conducts the asset allocation activities for the pool, the Commission believes that the principal focus of the performance disclosure for a pool in which a trading manager is responsible for allocating the assets should be on the trading manager, rather than the CPO. Thus, when a pool has a trading manager, the trading manager's performance would replace that of the CPO.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With respect to CTAs, the proposed rules would require disclosure of the past performance of CTAs only where they manage twenty-five percent or more of the pool's futures and commodity option trading and thus would constitute ``major CTAs,'' as defined in proposed Rule 4.10(k). The proposed rules also would require disclosure of past performance of investee pools constituting ``major investee pools, that is investee pools allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's assets. The term ``major CTA'' would be defined in Rule 4.10(k) to mean a CTA allocated or intended to be allocated twenty-five percent or more of the pool's initial margins for futures contracts and premiums for commodity options. Proposed Rule 4.10(l) would define ``major investee pool'' as an investee pool allocated or intended to be allocated at least twenty-five percent of the assets of a pool. These definitions are intended to include CTAs or investee pools to whom the CPO of a pool that has not commenced trading intends to make allocations at or above the specified thresholds. Similarly, CTAs and investee pools to whom the CPO of an operating pool intends to reallocate assets such that the allocations will total twenty-five percent or more under the margin or total asset standards also would be included.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To further reduce the volume of performance data contained in the disclosure document, the proposed rules would eliminate the requirement to present performance data with respect to CTAs allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's initial margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated less than twenty-five percent of the pool's assets and require only that ``adverse'' performance be disclosed as to CTAs allocated ten percent or more of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and investee pools allocated ten percent or more of the pool's assets. ``Adverse performance'' would be defined in proposed Rule 4.25(a)(8) as an annual rate of return of one hundred basis points less than the ninety-day Treasury Bill rate on December 31 of the calendar year in which the performance occurred or the termination of any pool pursuant to a loss termination provision. To disclose adverse performance, the CPO would indicate the year in which the performance occurred, the rate of return for that year, and the name of the CPO, CTA or investee pool responsible for the performance. An indication of adverse performance would be required to be given for the pool's CPO (where the pool had a trading manager whose performance was disclosed in lieu of that of the CPO), any trading principal of the CPO or trading manager whose performance was not otherwise disclosed, any CTA, other than a major CTA, allocated at least ten percent of the pool's initial futures margins and commodity option premiums and any investee pool, other than a major investee pool, allocated at least ten percent of the assets of the pool offered and the trading principals of major CTAs and the CPOs of major investee pools that have no prior operating history. Proposed Rule 4.25(c)(3)(iii) would permit CPOs to provide capsule performance in lieu of giving an indication of adverse performance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

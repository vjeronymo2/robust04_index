			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: BABY-SITTER GETS 15 YEARS TO LIFE IN  CHILD'S DEATH  </P> <P> A Van Nuys baby-sitter was sentenced Thursday to 15 years to life in prison for  shaking an 18-month-old girl so violently that the child died.  </P> <P> Nova Marcia Thompson, 35, sat quietly as Judge Judith Meisels Ashmann sentenced  her for the June 9, 1989, death of Jasmine Lynn Sanders, who lapsed into a coma  after being shaken and scalded with water.  </P> <P> Prosecutors said Thompson shook the toddler because she was not chewing her  food properly.  </P> <P> Thompson pleaded guilty in October to one count of second-degree murder,  averting a trial in which her own daughter would have been the main witness  against her.  </P> <P> In exchange for Thompson's plea, prosecutors dropped one count each of felony  child abuse and corporal infliction of injury stemming from a severe burn on  Jasmine's foot and bruises on her face, head and torso.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A LIFE NO LESS PRECIOUS  </P> <P> I was recently requesting sponsorship, in the form of pledges, for the AIDS  Walk Orange County, held June 10, at Mason Park in Irvine. I am writing in  response to the reactions I received from many people. People from all walks of  life (white- and blue-collar, wealthy and poor) who recoiled in horror as if by  my very presence and mention of the word, the killer is at their door.  </P> <P> AIDS is indeed a killer and, yes, AIDS is a gay disease. Gays did not cause  AIDS.  </P> <P> The occurrence of this tragic disease is a biological event, not a moral  comment. If that were so, how would one explain/justify the dichotomy of AIDS  appearing in predominantly heterosexual populations in impoverished  agricultural communities in Africa? It is also inaccurate to assume the  promiscuity of gays or that all gays have AIDS.  </P> <P> AIDS has no respect for these imaginary boundaries that seem to make certain  groups in society feel safe. It has touched most every group with any potential  for the disease.  </P> <P> AIDS has touched all racial and ethnic groups, gays/lesbians and heterosexuals,  and all age groups from the mature (Paul Gann) to the adolescent (Ryan White)  to the newborn babies.  </P> <P> This to me is reason enough to support the cause to fund the research and to  fight this catastrophic killer of gays and heterosexuals alike  </P> <P> I, too, have a fear of AIDS. I am a female Caucasian, heterosexual, non-drug  user. I also believe strongly that one's beliefs/lifestyle should not be forced  on others, whether it be religion, politics or sexual preference. We are  fortunate to live in a country that allows this freedom. Our preferences or  choices are ours to make.  </P> <P> I think we need to look at and inside ourselves, both individually and as a  society. Is it so easy to turn our heads, hearts and pocketbooks on a group of  people because they make different choices or have different lifestyles from  our own or that which we consider normal?  </P> <P> Finding a cure for the disease so the next "Ryan White" (and it seems there  will be more), the next gay/lesbian, the next heterosexual or the next baby  doesn't die is the real point. Life is precious -- no matter whose it is!  </P> <P> DEBRA K. SAIN  </P> <P> Orange  </P></p>

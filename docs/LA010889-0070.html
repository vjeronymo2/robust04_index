			<p><P> January 8, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEAR DALE: HEAVY TEXTURE NEEDS KNOCKING DOWN  </P> <P> Question: I remember reading some time back of a method to wallpaper over  textured walls, namely sheet rock or heavily textured wallpaper. Our problem  with our condominium unit in Koloa, Kauai, Hawaii, is 1,400 square feet  completed "finished" in textured drywall. Is there a product that will cover  the texturing so we can wallpaper the condo?  </P> <P> Answer: If the wall is heavily textured, you'll have to remove the texture and  proceed from there if you're interested in wallpaper, advises Joel Roses of  Dunn-Edwards, president of Western Wallcovering Distributors Assn.  </P> <P> If the texture is not so heavy, any wallpaper dealer should have a covering  material that will keep the stipple from showing through, he said. Roses  doesn't like the overwhelming tendency of California builders to texture walls  and ceilings; I couldn't agree with him more. Texturing covers a multitude of  sins, including low-quality drywall work.  </P> <P> According to a sampling of 200 home shoppers in new-home tracts in Los Angeles,  Orange and Riverside counties, nearly 70% prefer a smooth surface over a  textured one; a majority of those surveyed would be willing to pay extra for a  non-stippled surface.  </P> <P> About 85% of these home shoppers said they plan to use wall covering in some  area of their new home, supporting their preference for smooth-finished walls,  Roses said. To this I add a hearty Amen!  </P> <P> IN THE MAIL: Professional Builder's Mid-September issue predicts that  residential remodeling expenditures in the United States will top the $100  billion mark this year -- the first time this magic number will be exceeded. As  usual, Los Angeles will continue to be the biggest single remodeling market,  according to Lisa Gilmore writing in the trade publication. She added that the  Midwest and Northeast will continue to be the main areas of remodeling in the  nation.  </P> <P> It's too bad that the magazine's circulation is limited to members of the  building community. This particular issue is devoted to bathroom and kitchen  remodeling, and most of the jobs illustrated and described are applicable to  the real world most of us inhabit. Many of the remodeling jobs in consumer  publications are high-end in the extreme. The magazine should be available at  larger public libraries or from a friendly builder or contractor.  </P></p>

Deputy Monde called those who spread such  information irresponsible and, according to him, do so for the  purpose of sabotaging the parliament's current work.    Frantz Robert Monde also explains to Radio Metropole that at  this phase of the negotiations and discussions, it is a question  of finding a modus operandi for obtaining suspension of the  sanctions:    [Begin recording] Personally, I denounced this irresponsible  action from the person who stated during the CARENA conference  that we went to Washington to choose Larosiliere. I think it is  a low, cowardly, untimely blow, not coming from a responsible  man. In this vein, I assure that lunatic that it is out of  question to have Larosiliere or any other person as prime  minister right now. We never discussed that. It comes only from  his fertile imagination.    "Our first objective is a truce that will allow parliament  to  vote for a prime minister without the sword of Damocles, the  embargo, hanging over our heads. They give us the truce; then we  take a position regarding the choice of a prime minister. It is  not during this tour... [changes thought] We came to have our  points of view heard, to demonstrate how the Haitian people are  suffering from the embargo. We did not come to attack this  person or that person, but we are asking that Haitians listen to  us, understand us, so we may soon find a solution, not the  solution of this person or that person, or my solution. Rather  it will be a concerted solution from all the concerned elements,  the protagonists, the Army -- we told them [not further  identified] we are very close to the Army, there is nothing to  hide."    So far, it has been very constructive. We have had several  meetings. First we met with the National Freedom Institute,  which invited us. We met with Walter Fautroy. We were very  touched by him. Walter Fautroy wept over the fate of Haiti and  supported us on the idea of a truce, a temporary lifting of the  embargo, a suspension of the sanctions to allow the interested  sectors to formulate a concerted strategy. We met on 7 February  at the State Department -- Pezzullo, Caputo, and some American  technicians from the State Department working on the Haitian  case. Until now, we have tried to emphasize our point of view as  deputies. Normally, the choice of a prime minister would not be  of interest to us right now, since he will probably meet the  same fate as Malval, or even worse.    What we are interested in is not to negotiate with a knife  at  our throat. It is out of question for me to meet with President  Aristide or discuss the choice of a prime minister. We are  adamant on that. I do not know where this information comes  from. They are people who are showing off, who wish to be  actors, who are playing roles. I am furious when I hear that  while we are here making every effort, many sacrifices, to  propose a solution, those men, in their little heads, vent their  noxious minds. Those men have extreme reactions. They wish to  sabotage our efforts. They are not serious. I think that the  person who made that statement can now take his group, install  someone in the National Palace, and make the decisions on the  lifting of the embargo. [end recording]</p>

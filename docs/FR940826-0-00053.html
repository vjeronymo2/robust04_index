			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Sections 12.951 through 12.953 set forth the procedures for monitoring and reporting on the recipient's financial and program performance and the necessary standard reporting forms. They also set forth record retention requirements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;12.951  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Monitoring and reporting program performance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Recipients are responsible for managing and monitoring each project, program, subaward, function, or activity supported by the award. Recipients shall monitor subawards to ensure that subrecipients have met the audit requirements in Section 12.926. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe the frequency of submission for performance reports. Except as provided in &sect;12.951(f), performance reports will not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. Annual reports shall be due 90 calendar days after the end of the grant year; quarterly or semi-annual reports shall be due 30 days after the end of the reporting period. The Federal awarding agency may require annual reports before the anniversary dates of multiple year awards in lieu of these requirements. Final performance reports are due 90 calendar days after the expiration or termination of the award. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) A final technical or performance report shall be required after completion of the project only if the awarding agency determines this to be appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) When required, performance reports shall generally contain, for each award, brief information on each of the following: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) A comparison of actual accomplishments with the goals and objectives established for the period, the findings of the investigator, or both. Whenever appropriate and the output of programs or projects can be readily quantified, such quantitative data should be related to cost data for computation of unit costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Reasons why established goals were not met, if appropriate. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Other pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis and explanation of cost overruns or high unit costs. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (e) Recipients shall not be required to submit more than the original and two copies of performance reports. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (f) Recipients shall immediately notify the Federal awarding agency of developments that have a significant impact on the award-supported activities. Also, notification shall be given in the case of problems, delays, or adverse conditions that materially impair the ability to meet the objectives of the award. This notification shall include a statement of the action taken or contemplated, and any assistance needed to resolve the situation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (g) Federal awarding agencies may make site visits, as needed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (h) Federal awarding agencies shall comply with clearance requirements of 5 CFR part 1320 when requesting performance data from recipients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;12.952  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Financial reporting. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The following forms or such other forms as may be approved by OMB are authorized for obtaining financial information from recipients. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A, Financial Status Report. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each Federal awarding agency will require recipients to use either the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A to report the status of funds for all nonconstruction projects or programs. A Federal awarding agency may, however, have the option of not requiring the SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A when the SF&hyph;270, Request for Advance or Reimbursement, or SF&hyph;272, Report of Federal Cash Transactions, is determined to provide adequate information to meet its needs, except that a final SF&hyph;269 or SF&hyph;269A shall be required at the completion of the project when the SF&hyph;270 is used only for advances. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) The Federal awarding agency shall prescribe whether the report shall be on a cash or accrual basis. If the Federal awarding agency requires accrual information and the recipient's accounting records are not normally kept on an accrual basis, the recipient shall not be required to convert its accounting system, but shall develop accrual information through best estimates based upon an analysis of the documentation on hand. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The Federal awarding agency shall determine the frequency of the Financial Status Report for each project or program, considering the size and complexity of the particular project or program. However, the report shall not be required more frequently than quarterly or less frequently than annually. A final report shall be required at the completion of the agreement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

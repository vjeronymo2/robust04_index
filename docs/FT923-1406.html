			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / Taiwan sidles in as Fujian heeds Deng's call: Angus Foster visits Xiamen special economic zone and reports on how it is making ground on Shenzhen IN JANUARY Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader, chose to relaunch economic reform from Shenzhen, the special economic zone across from Hong Kong. But his call to 'be bolder still', a fitting symbol for the end of of China's three-year austerity programme, was equally felt further up the coast in Fujian, the province which looks out onto Taiwan, and in its own special economic zone of Xiamen. Industrial output in Xiamen increased 14 per cent in the first half of the year, slightly below Shenzhen. But Xiamen has always been a poor relation and Shenzhen was able to rely on Hong Kong's infrastructure. Like Guangdong before it, Fujian is being transformed by overseas Chinese investors who are finding their own countries no longer compete in processing and labour intensive industries. Taiwanese companies are increasingly visible, following their government's 1987 decision to allow indirect investment in China. Fujian appeals because the same Chinese dialect is spoken and more than half of Taiwanese people claim it as their ancestral home. Lu Gongnan, chief of the Xinglin investment zone near Xiamen, said one in four of the zone's 50,000 urban population works for a foreign investor and 20 more factories - making products for export ranging from garments to computers - are being built. Xiamen officials say their policy of liang di, yi gao, or keeping wages and charges low and quality high, is attracting foreigners. According to businessmen, average wages of 350 renminbi yuan (Pounds 36.50) a month for factory workers and 1,000 yuan for technicians are about 10 times less than in Taiwan. Industrial land prices, which are fixed by the government at 140 yuan a square metre, are several hundred times lower. Foreign investment totals are sketchy because some investors hide their place of origin for political or business reasons. Actual investment also often falls below promised investment. Hong Kong companies are still probably the largest investors in Fujian, but some are fronts for Taiwanese seeking anonymity. Mr Han Qinghai, at Xiamen University's Taiwan research institute, estimated Taiwan has invested Dollars 1.2bn in Fujian, half of which is in Xiamen, and Dollars 3.6bn in China as a whole. A fair proportion is probably speculative. China's renewed emphasis on reform has helped increase Fujian's project approvals for the first half of the year by 300 per cent to more than Dollars 1bn. In Xiamen, approvals are up 75 per cent, to bring total promised foreign investment to Dollars 1.2bn. Along the coast, Fuzhou, the provincial capital, Quanzhou, an emerging port and Putian, self styled as China's 'shoe city' because it is home to Nike's Taiwanese sub-contractors, are all registering double digit economic growth and even higher foreign investment. Fuqing, recently approved as a foreign investment zone, may also take off if Mr Liem Sioe Liong, an Indonesian Chinese, goes ahead with reported plans to invest in infrastructure and industrial projects. The central shopping district of Xiamen has started to resemble those in Guangdong. Hotels built for foreign investors are sometimes full. Graduates are once again leaving prized jobs in government ministries for the private sector. Rapid economic growth is bringing familiar problems. Investors complain Xiamen's infrastructure is not keeping pace with the changes. Many factories are sending goods by road to Shenzhen, even though it increases transport costs 30 per cent, rather than use Xiamen's congested port. Taiwan's underground gangs are also believed to be investing in Fujian. Several Xiamen residents said they fear new-found commercialism is undermining traditional, socialist values. Neither have China's old problems been solved. Mr Deng's call for bolder reform will again switch attention away from the woefully inefficient state owned sector. In Xiamen, this accounted for 40 per cent of industrial output last year, and a higher proportion of government revenues, but continues to make unwanted products. Wage inflation has increased to 10 per cent, although wages in foreign-invested factories are kept lower by importing workers from poorer, inland provinces. Nevertheless, most economists agree China's urban inflation rate, which topped 40 per cent in the late 1980s and contributed to the Tiananmen Square protests, will emerge as a problem again. But two trends, which again mirror developments in Guangdong, suggest Fujian is undergoing lasting, structural adjustment. Foreign investment is moving away from the hub of Xiamen in search of better incentives or lower wages. Second, investment has started to flow into tertiary industries like finance and leisure. Eight foreign banks, mainly from Hong Kong, have established branches in Xiamen. Citibank and Dai-ichi Kangyo have representative offices. Taiwanese banks are still prohibited from dealing direct with China. Two foreign-invested golf courses are being built and foreign funds, especially from the Philippines, have flowed into the still poorly developed private real estate market. One official, decrying this 'real estate fever', said private land prices have risen by 500 per cent in some areas, reflecting the market's inefficiencies as well as a renewed taste for speculation.</p>

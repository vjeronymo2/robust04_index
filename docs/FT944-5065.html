			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / World Trade News: US leads Gatt ratification rush Ratification of the Uruguay Round world trade agreement by the US Congress last week looks set, as hoped, to open the way to the rest of the world to follow in the next few weeks. By yesterday, 42 of the 125 countries participating in the round had completed the national procedures needed to approve it. Officials at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade expect 100 to have done so by the end of the year. Almost 50 are expected to have acted by Thursday, when senior trade diplomats meet in Geneva to confirm January 1 as the date when the agreement and the new World Trade Organisation come into effect. No minimum quota has been set for the number of countries that have to ratify the deal before it can come into force. But it is generally accepted that, in addition to the US, they must include Japan and the European Union. In Japan, the lower house of the Diet (parliament) ratified the agreement on Friday, as part of a clutch of trade bills which included a Y6,010bn (Pounds 38bn) spending package to help cushion the impact of farm trade liberalisation. The upper house is due to ratify at the end of this week, though this is a formality. The EU Council of Ministers plans to ratify the agreement and approve legislation to implement it at a two-day meeting starting on December 19. That will follow expected approval of the agreement by the European Parliament next week. But because of the ruling by the European Court last month that the agreement involves 'mixed competence' between the European Commission and member states, each EU country must also approve it before it can take effect. So far, only Britain, Germany and Ireland have completed the process, though it is well advanced in several other countries, including Italy and Spain. Brussels is confident that all 12 EU members, along with new entrants Austria, Finland and Sweden, will have acted before Christmas. However, Portugal is delaying ratification until the Council of Ministers has formally approved an Ecu400m (Dollars 508m) aid package to help the country's textile industry adjust to the phasing out of trade barriers agreed under the round. The aid has already been agreed by the European Commission and Parliament, but may not be approved by the Council before its meeting on December 19. Portugal says that if the Council did not act this month, it would be prepared to hold up ratification until next year, though this is widely interpreted as a bargaining tactic designed to ensure a speedy decision on the aid. France's national assembly is ready to ratify the agreement on December 14, but its government is pressing for the December 19 Council to assess US implementation - and particularly how Washington intends to maintain its Section 301 trade legislation. France wants the Council to approve a proposed EU 'illicit practices' regulation, designed to open other countries' markets. Ratification has hit snags in two other important trading countries. In Australia, action is being held up at least until next week by two minor party senators who hold the balance of power in the Senate. In South Korea, the opposition Democratic Party, which represents farming interests that would be hurt by the deal, may try to block approval this week by the parliamentary foreign affairs committee. The DP has indicated support for the WTO, but may try to use ratification to exact concessions from the government on a number of issues. In both countries, the threat of delays does not appear serious. However, it is potentially embarrassing politically, because Australia has strongly championed the round, while Mr Kim Chul-su. South Korea's trade minister, is a candidate to head the WTO. Only four countries - Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Cyprus and Poland - have told Gatt they may be unable, for different reasons, to ratify by the end of the year. Switzerland and Liechtenstein have to allow time for a possible referendum on the deal. Cyprus wishes first to complete a wide-ranging revision of trade policy related to its bilateral trade agreement with the EU. Poland says it may not be able to complete the required changes to legislation by year-end and is reluctant to ratify in advance. Current Gatt members have up to two years to ratify the deal after the WTO comes into force, but must then apply its provisions as if they had been members from the start. This leeway may be reduced further if Gatt members decide later this week to terminate the Gatt agreement before the two years are up. Many countries are said to be in favour of a one-year cut-off, during which time the Gatt and WTO would operate in parallel.</p>

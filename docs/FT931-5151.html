			<p>930308 FT  08 MAR 93 / Yeltsin proposes new law to split powers PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin said yesterday he would propose to Russia's Congress of People's Deputies on Wednesday a new law to divide powers between the executive and legislative branch. But if his law was rejected, he said in a television debate, he was ready to hold a referendum, which some of his parliamentary opponents have accused him of fearing. Mr Yeltsin did not say how the law differed from a draft agreement between the executive and legislature which he has already proposed and which was rejected by the standing parliament on Friday. But the advantage of a law would be that it would require a simple majority instead of the two-thirds vote needed for constitutional change. But the president evaded questions over whether he might resort to some kind of authoritarian solution, hinted at last week, if the Congress or full parliament also voted to cancel the referendum it approved in December. Mr Yeltsin said the country's constitutional crisis affected everyone even though it might not seem to. 'Say I issue a decree and all of a sudden the local council in Altai says it won't be carried out. What kind of authority is that?' But he stressed he wanted to avoid confrontation with parliament and reach agreement if possible. He also gave some more details on the three 'short and clear' questions he proposed to ask if a referendum were held. The first would ask Russians to vote for private land ownership: he suggested this would be so popular that he did not 'even need to comment on this'. The second question would seek permission to reduce the current system of standing and full parliaments to one bicameral assembly 'which would talk little but achieve a lot'. Finally, he wanted a special constituent assembly, rather than the present deputies, to adopt a new constitution. He said a constituent assembly would attract 'new people, who would not be prevented by vested interests from adopting a new constitution which would be in Russia's long-term interest'.</p>

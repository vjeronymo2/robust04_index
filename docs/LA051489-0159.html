			<p><P> May 14, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Philippine soldiers aided by a former Communist rebel found three mass graves  where the remains of scores of people killed by guerrillas are believed buried,  a military spokesman said. Those buried in the graves, just south of Manila,  are thought to have been killed by the Communist New People's Army in a purge  of suspected spies in their ranks after arrests of rebel leaders last year.  Reporters said they counted 28 bodies in a mass grave in the town of Kavinti in  Laguna province.  </P></p>

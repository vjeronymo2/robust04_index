			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Midland expected to omit dividend MIDLAND GROUP is unlikely to pay a dividend for the second half of 1991, making it the first English clearing bank to omit a dividend since the 1930s. A year ago, it became the first bank since the Depression to cut its dividend. A formal decision will not be taken by the bank's board until next week, when Midland is due to disclose its 1991 results. But executive management is expected to recommend that no dividend be paid, and a payment may be impossible in any case. 'It is difficult to see how Midland can pay a dividend,' said a financier with an intimate knowledge of the company. 'It does not have the distributable reserves.' Under company law, companies can only pay dividends out of their distributable reserves. At June 30, Midland's distributable reserves were just Pounds 53m. Analysts believe Midland suffered a bad debt charge in 1991 close to Pounds 1bn on its UK loans alone. Its results are due on February 27 and brokers expect it to report a pre-tax loss of between Pounds 50m and Pounds 140m for the year. If the more pessimistic analysts are correct, Midland's distributable reserves would be wiped out, making it impossible to pay any dividend. Midland's dividend dilemma is a reflection of the severity of the current recession, which has placed many borrowers in difficulties and forced banks to make huge provisions to cover the risk of bad debts. None the less, Midland's balance sheet remains strong by international standards. Its Tier 1 or core capital is thought to be equal to more than 5 per cent of its assets, which is well above the minimum level set by the Bank of England. Last year, Midland appointed a new chairman, Sir Peter Walters, and a new chief executive, Mr Brian Pearse. Unlike most companies, Midland does not divide its annual dividend between an interim and final payment. Instead it normally pays two interim dividends, though the second-half interim is the equivalent of most companies' final payments. It made a first interim payment, of 1.7p, in respect of the first six months of the year. So even if it did not make a second payment, it would remain on the dividend list and its shares could continue to be held by all investment funds. Midland's shares closed up 5p yesterday at 232p.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the foregoing reasons, the Board believes that merger/conversions should, in most cases, be permitted only in situations where a State Savings Bank is ``undercapitalized,'' ``significantly undercapitalized'' or ``critically undercapitalized'' as defined in the FDIC's capital maintenance regulations. At this time, however, the Board does not propose to impose a blanket prohibition on non-supervisory merger/conversions. The FDIC will continue to review proposed merger/conversions with an emphasis on whether the fair value of the State Savings Bank would be delivered to the rightful recipients. The FDIC is requesting specific comment on this topic and specifically whether a moratorium should be placed on merger/conversions involving sufficiently capitalized State Savings Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VII. Comparison With OTS Regulations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As noted above, the requirements imposed by the proposed rule would essentially parallel the OTS Revisions. There are numerous other provisions in the OTS' mutual-to-stock conversion regulations (12 CFR part 563b), however, that are not included in either the FDIC Interim Rule or the proposed rule. Those OTS regulations impose upon converting savings associations specific and detailed requirements on, among other things: items to be included in the plan of conversion, stock purchase priorities, percentage limitations on stock purchases and MRPs, proxy solicitation and the form and content of proxy statements, the form and content of offering circulars, accounting rules, liquidation accounts, notices of filing, availability of conversion documents and pricing and sale of securities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Preliminarily, the FDIC believes that the requirements imposed by the proposed rule, coupled with the requirements of the Interim Rule, would enable the FDIC to monitor the conversions of State Savings Banks for issues involving safety and soundness, fiduciary duty and other violations of law. Pursuant to the Interim Rule, the FDIC uses the OTS regulations as a frame of reference in reviewing proposed mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. The FDIC also looks to the applicable state law and regulations in reviewing proposed conversions. To date, the FDIC has not identified a need to adopt a more comprehensive set of regulations addressing all aspects of the mutual-to-stock conversion process. It has been suggested, however, that in order to achieve greater uniformity with the OTS' conversion regulations the FDIC's conversion regulations should be expanded to match the scope and depth of the OTS rules. Thus, the Board specifically requests comment on whether the FDIC's regulations should be expanded to include provisions similar to those of the OTS regulations that are not already included in either the Interim Rule or the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VIII. Convenience and Needs Requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The OTS has issued a proposed rule that would add a requirement to its mutual-to-stock conversion regulations that, in determining whether to approve such a conversion transaction, the OTS would consider the convenience and needs of the community served by the converting institution. 59 FR 22764 (May 3, 1994.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ``convenience and needs of the community to be served'' by the applicant is one of the statutory factors required to be considered by the Board in acting on applications for deposit insurance (12 U.S.C. 1816). Thus, in connection with the review of mutual holding company reorganizations of insured depository institutions the FDIC already is required to (and does) apply a convenience and needs test. The Board requests comment on whether the FDIC could and should also consider imposing such a requirement in connection with the mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> IX. Summary of Comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FDIC received 85 written comments on the Proposed Policy Statement and Interim Final Rule: 60 from banks, savings banks, cooperative bank and saving associations; 7 from bank and thrift industry trade groups; 6 from state banking and thrift regulators; 5 from individuals; 5 from law firms; 1 from a bank holding company; and 1 from a regulatory ``shadow'' group.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. FDIC Oversight Role  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The comments did not focus on describing recent abuses in mutual-to-stock conversions. They generally acknowledged that there had been notable examples of insider abuse in the recent past and then suggested how future potential abuses could be avoided. Many of those who commented recommended that the FDIC play an oversight role in the mutual-to-stock conversions of State Savings Banks. One state stock savings bank that is owned by a mutual holding company noted that ``present abuses in several recent and proposed conversions have demonstrated the need for the FDIC to maintain oversight of the conversion process, to ensure that issues of both safety and soundness and of fiduciary care are identified and adequately addressed.'' One state savings association trade group commented that ``with recent publicity over some apparent abuses in the [conversion] process and resulting Congressional concerns, *&blank;*&blank;* it is most appropriate and important for the FDIC to assert regulatory jurisdiction over conversions by state nonmember banks.'' One state thrift regulator noted that the FDIC had issued an ``excellent set of rules'' with a ``very conservative, realistic approach to a situation which could have gotten out of hand if left to go unchecked.'' One State Savings Bank said simply that ``past abuses [in mutual-to-stock conversions] support the need for FDIC oversight.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Station commentary] </F>   [Text] Gentlemen: U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher expects his talks in Damascus to be serious and  important. Syria firmly believes in a just and comprehensive  peace in the Middle East based on the resolutions of  international legitimacy, a peace that entrenches international  law as the sole umbrella for this peace.    Syria is a basic party to the peace process. Without active  Syrian participation, peace cannot prevail in the region.  Still, Syria cannot be lured into half-way solutions or  half-way settlements. Syria will not bargain on Arab rights and  Arab lands. Syria sees no chance for peace unless this peace is  just and comprehensive.    The U.S. secretary has much experience with Syria, where he  has held lengthy talks several times. On more than one  occasion, Syria has supported the U.S. Administration's efforts  to relieve the peace process of the Israeli intransigence and  behavior that Tel Aviv's rulers hoped would abort the entire  process.    During the recent and historic Geneva meeting between  Presidents al-Asad and Clinton, the U.S. President announced his  open support for President al-Asad's call for an honorable peace  of the brave. Christopher joined President Clinton in expressing  the conviction that Syria's role is central to the success of  the peace process. They repeatedly hailed Syria's constructive  efforts.    It is an established fact that Israel has placed every  possible obstacle in the way of a just and comprehensive  solution of the region's crisis. Israel has sought to replace  the Security Council resolutions, the principles of the Madrid  conference, and the essence of the U.S. initiative itself with  partial and phased settlements that do not meet minimum Arab  aspirations and rights. To the contrary, these settlements  entrench occupation and colonialism, and exasperate tension in  the Middle East.    For more than two years, the Syrian, Lebanese, and Jordanian  delegations to the Washington negotiations were unable to  convince Israel to discuss the subject of withdrawal from the  occupied Arab territories. Israel has openly rejected  discussing the subject of withdrawal from the Golan and south  Lebanon, and has proposed an endless series of conditions,  restrictions, and advance security arrangements in return for  promises of partial withdrawals.    Israel did not discuss with the Arabs in Washington the  realization of a just, comprehensive, and equitable peace.  Instead, it discussed the imposition of its settlements, which  seriously undermine the principles of just and comprehensive  peace.    The Israeli position can be summed up as follows: Arabs  should prove their peaceful intentions by concluding treaties,  normalizing relations, opening borders, and subjecting their  occupied territories to long-term Israeli control.    This is not peace. It can never lead to peace. It is an  attempt by the occupier to entrench its occupation and impose  its will. It is natural that Syria, Lebanon, and Jordan reject  such an alleged and deceptive peace, and adhere to the Security  Council resolutions and the Madrid conference agreements. One  principle of a solid peace is that this peace should be  equitable and just, and should return rights to their owners.    Israel's leaders are completely aware of Syria's positions.  They know there will be no peace without Israel's complete  withdrawal from the Golan and all the occupied territories.  They also know Syria will in no way involve itself in partial  settlements and compromises.    So, the proposals that Israel asked the U.S. secretary to  bring with him will not be serious if they do not meet Syria's  demand for full withdrawal. If peace can be realized through  deeds, not words, then Syria is waiting for deeds, not words.  These deeds include full acceptance of the Security Council  resolutions, not proposals that circumvent these resolutions and  evade the principle of full and rapid withdrawal, the  dismantling of all settlements, and the evacuation of all  settlers.    Syria supports just and comprehensive peace. It will  continue to work tirelessly for just and comprehensive peace,  but within the framework of international legitimacy and its  resolutions.</p>

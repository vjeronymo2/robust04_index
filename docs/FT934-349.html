			<p>931229 FT  29 DEC 93 / Bargain-seekers encourage retailers' new year hopes Bargain-seekers have flocked to Britain's shops for this week's winter sales, continuing the pre-Christmas buying spree and encouraging retailers' hopes of a buoyant 1994. Travel companies said there had been a surge in holiday bookings. 'I would guess we are 60 to 70 per cent up on last year on bookings for summer holidays,' said Mr Russell Amerasekera of Thomas Cook. At Liberty's store in London's Regent Street, whose sale began yesterday, Mr Tony Salem, retail managing director, said: 'I've not seen anything like this for at least four years.' In London and other parts of the UK, stores coped with crowds, though yesterday's snow held back sales in parts of the north of England. The MetroCentre in Gateshead, near Newcastle upon Tyne, had 133,000 visitors on Monday and almost as many yesterday. Sheffield's Meadowhall Centre said Monday had been very busy, with people arriving at 8.30am for breakfast in stores that opened early. 'A number of our stores reported record takes from the first sales day,' said Mr Ron Woodman, MetroCentre's marketing manager. 'There's a move to cash rather than credit.' Shops had even sold plastic Christmas trees to Norwegians, regular visitors to the north-east for winter shopping. Icelandic shoppers were also buying heavily. Mr Salem said overseas shoppers were now more in evidence, with a long queue at Liberty's value-added tax refund counter for export sales. At Selfridges, the department store in London's Oxford Street, Mr Tim Daniels, managing director, said sales figures were better than expected, up by around 10 per cent on last year. 'There seems to be a lot more confidence around,' he said. As in other stores, menswear was particularly sought after. Mr Daniels, who is also chairman of the Oxford Street Association, said other stores in the street, such as Marks and Spencer, had experienced sizeable sales increases. 'The whole street is very strong.' In Selfridge's porcelain and glassware department, the Villeroy and Boch porcelain tableware section reported a threefold sales increase. The store's audio section reported sales of mobile phones up sharply. Like the retailers, Mr Amerasekera at Thomas Cook ascribed the rise in business to a return of consumer confidence. But discounting also played a part. In spite of security alerts, shoppers yesterday streamed into Belfast for the sales. Shops in central Belfast said business was brisker than for many years. Travel agents reported particularly high demand.</p>

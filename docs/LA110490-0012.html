			<p><P> November 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> BRITISH LABOR PARTY STRUGGLES WITH IDENTITY: HAS IT LOST ITS WORKING-CLASS  ROOTS?  </P> <P> One question haunted the Labor Party's political metamorphosis here: Is it  losing its socialist soul?  </P> <P> The party of the working class has embraced moderation and modernity with a  passion that is disturbing some old-timers.  </P> <P> There is less talk of socialist struggle these days than of electoral  strategies.  </P> <P> The red flag of revolution has been replaced as the party's emblem by the red  rose of peaceful growth.  </P> <P> Restoration of public ownership now takes second place to promotion of private  industry. The welfare state cedes priority to investment.  </P> <P> The trade unions that previously financed and controlled the party are being  increasingly sidelined.  </P> <P> The party of the underdog has disavowed its high-taxes-high-spending policies.  It is now committed to living, as a government, strictly within its means  whatever the social hardships.  </P> <P> Party leaders deny any retreat from the basic socialist goal of a fairer and  more caring society. They argue that they are simply adapting to the times.  </P> <P> But a new survey of 5,065 party members has reaffirmed a strong commitment  within the ranks to traditional socialist values, feeding suggestions that the  reforming leadership is not in tune with many members.  </P> <P> Ernie Roberts, a delegate attending his 45th annual Labor conference, said:  "During those 45 years I have seen many attacks on the democracy of our party.  . . . We must stand firm for our democratic rights to amend the policies and  statements of our party.  </P> <P> "The combined intelligence of the delegates to a Labor Party conference is  greater than that represented on the (leadership) platform."  </P> <P> Another delegate, Val Dunne, of the bakers' union, complained that middle-class  and technical recruits to the party are increasingly dominating policy-making.  </P> <P> She said: "These comrades . . . have this disproportionate influence, but above  all they don't represent the working class and the poor people."  </P> <P> "It is one thing to devolve electoral tactics onto a small number of leading  members, but quite another to devolve onto them responsibility for our  political direction in the long term. That would be both unfair and, in the  long term, a disaster."  </P> <P> Picking up the whiff of dissent, the political editor of the pro-Conservative  Daily Mail, Gordon Greig, noted that there was "a gut feeling (among delegates)  that it might be time to make a stand against a leadership whose star appears  to be guided by the polls rather than principles."  </P> <P> Even the pro-Labor Guardian noted that three largely symbolic votes against  leadership plans on the conference's opening day "served as a reminder that the  acceptance of (party leader Neil) Kinnock's reform package by many unions and  activists still leaves Labor's heart in intermittent conflict with its head."  </P> <P> If, in the midst of radical change, the Labor Party needs to be reminded of its  deep working-class roots it could meet in no more fitting venue than Blackpool.  </P> <P> This resort was built on the notion of "wake's week," when blue-collar  industries would close for summer vacation and the workers would come here from  the mines and mills of England's industrial northwest to clean their lungs and  fill their stomachs.  </P> <P> Their pleasures were as simple as they were cheap: a walk along the pier, a  ride on the carousels or a day on the beach when it was sunny; a gamble of  pennies in the arcades or a sing-along in the pub when it was wet. Their diet  was as basic as it was repetitive: fish and chips, or meat pie and mashed  potatoes.  </P> <P> They were from real cloth-cap-and-clogs backgrounds. They were the very stuff  of the early blue-collar Labor Party.  </P> <P> Today their grandchildren and great-grandchildren still come here in the tens  of thousands from nearby industrial towns for the same simplest of pleasures.  </P></p>

			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / UK Company News: C&amp;G first-half profits likely to exceed Pounds 100m Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester Building Society, the UK's sixth-largest, is on Thursday likely to announce pre-tax profits exceeding Pounds 100m for the first half of this year, after a sharp drop in provisions for bad and doubtful debts. It recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 75.3m for the first six months of last year. An increase of more than one third would be broadly in line with some other large mortgage lenders, and a significant difference could re-open the debate about the Pounds 1.8bn cash bid for the society by Lloyds Bank. One of the questions raised by some members of the C&amp;G Alternatives Group is whether C&amp;G could have attracted - or could still attract - a higher bid. At the time of the announcement in April, one analyst suggested that a third party could afford to offer up to Pounds 2.5bn. Originally the deal was due to be concluded in the second quarter of next year. In June, however, the scheme suffered a setback in the High Court which said that the society's plans for distributing the Pounds 1.8bn among its members and others was unlawful. Revised proposals, issued in mid-August, envisaged that completion of the deal would be delayed by about three months.</p>

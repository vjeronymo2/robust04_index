			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Former eastern bloc zinc exports more than double ZINC EXPORTS from former eastern bloc countries more than doubled last year from the 1991 level, pushing the western market into a substantial supply surplus. Preliminary estimates by the International Lead and Zinc Study Group suggest eastern bloc net exports rose from 104,000 tonnes in 1991 to 250,000 tonnes. There was a steep increase from Kazakhstan where western producers, attracted by low costs, sent zinc concentrate (an intermediate product) for refining. There was also a sharp rise in Polish exports. Zinc mine output in the west hardly changed from the 1991 level at 5.58m tonnes last year. Refined metal production was 0.7 per cent down at 5.35m tonnes while zinc consumption slipped 0.8 per cent to 5.36m tonnes. Increased imports took the supply surplus up from 86,000 to 238,000 tonnes. The surplus is highly visible because much of the metal is in London Metal Exchange stocks, which reached 500,000 tonnes for the first time.</p>

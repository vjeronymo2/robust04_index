			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Andrey Aderekhin report: "Better Not To Travel to the </F> Kuban Without Invitation Now"]    [Text] Krasnodar Kray -- The Krasnodar Kray Administration  has adopted a series of documents imposing severe restrictions  on opportunities for newcomers to obtain permanent residence  permits, as well as on temporary stays in the Kuban for foreign  citizens and persons without citizenship. These restrictions do  not affect Russians.    According to some estimates there are now about 600,000  immigrants in the Kuban -- mainly from interethnic conflict  zones. Only a fraction of them are registered in the kray and  have residence permits. The kray administration head's decree  says that the multinational stream of immigrants is posing a  serious threat to social and political stability.    This new state of affairs significantly restricts the  categories of people who can obtain the right to permanent  residence. For example, Krasnodar Kray Immigration Service is  being instructed to grant the status of refugee or enforced  migrant only to those who have close relatives in the Kuban who  have already been living here more than five years. These same  persons can register as residents of Sochi only in exceptional  circumstances.    Citizens from the former USSR and persons without  citizenship  now must have invitations, which are officially registered by  the organs of local self-government, in order to enter the kray  on a temporary basis. Moreover, they have to apply to the  internal affairs organs within 24 hours of their arrival for  registration. A one-shot fee of 20 percent of the minimum  monthly wage has been imposed for the invitations' official  registration. Those who are involved in entrepreneurial or  other profit-making activities will have to pay the same amount,  but in their case it will be payable for each day they spend in  the Kuban. People visiting close relatives, invalids, students,  entertainers, workers on tours of duty, and several other  categories of arrivals are exempt from the registration fee.    The Caucasus Special Border District's "Krasnodar"  operations  section of troops has been advised to hand over those who arrive  in the Kuban without invitations drawn up in the prescribed  manner to the Federal Counterintelligence Service or  representatives of the internal affairs organs in the location  where they were allowed to cross the Russian Federation state  border.    True, a blunder has been made. The administration head's  decree mentions that the decree will come into force the moment  it is published. However, a large number of the kray's  inhabitants who are awaiting guests from the former USSR have  only just found out about the necessity for them to have an  officially registered invitation for a temporary visit.</p>

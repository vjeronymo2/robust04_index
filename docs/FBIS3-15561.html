After the meeting Ivan Rybkin said in an exclusive interview  with ITAR-TASS that he discussed with Shevardnadze a wide range  of bilateral problems. We display keen interest in establishing  peace throughout the Transcaucasus, the Russian parliamentarian  emphasised.    Recently the Georgian parliament voted for the conuntry's  joining the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Debates  on this issue and voting were very difficult, and I  congratulated Shevardnadze with such a positive outcome, Rybkin  said.

			<p>920511 FT  11 MAY 92 / Construction Contracts: Clinical research facility development A contract worth Pounds 9.4m has been placed by Pfizer of Sandwich, Kent, with BALLAST NEDAM CONSTRUCTION, based in Bromley, for the construction of a four-storey clinical research facility and an amenity/link building. Scheduled for completion next May, the project will provide 7,850 sq metres of space for clinical research use and for plant and computer installations. The amenity/link building will provide three levels of accommodation, including a mezzanine floor, and will connect Clinical Sciences II, as the new complex is called, to Clinical Sciences I. The specification calls for a steel frame, reinforced in situ power-floated concrete slab floors (on metal decking to upper levels) and a metal deck and steelwork roof tiled in fibre slate. Other new awards for the company's south east regional office include a 1,626 sq metre warehouse at Sittingbourne for Wereldhave Properties, worth about Pounds 600,000, and a small school refurbishment for the London Borough of Bromley.</p>

			<p>940827 FT  27 AUG 94 / SNP to help with Tayside fuel bills A council controlled by the Scottish National party intends to help elderly and poor people pay their electricity bills by purchasing pre-payment electricity stamps from Hydro-Electric at a discount. The stamps will be sold at the discounted price through social-work offices in Tayside region, where the SNP won control from Labour in May. The SNP says the scheme will mitigate the increase in fuel bills caused by the imposition of value added tax. Hydro-Electric said it sold the stamps at a 3 per cent discount to shops for resale and had also sold them to the charity Age Concern. It said, however, that it had only had preliminary talks with Tayside. During the regional council election campaign the SNP promised to pay Pounds 10 a year to low-income families, those on benefit, the elderly and those with disabilities in councils where it took control. When it won the Tayside and Grampian regions, however, it learnt that it did not have the legal power to make the payments. It says the only cost to council taxpayers will be that of administering the scheme. It hopes to arrange a similar one with British Gas.</p>

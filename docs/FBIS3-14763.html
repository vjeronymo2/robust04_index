			<p>Language: <F P=105> Latvian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Morris Posse: "Russia Dissolves Gas Delivery </F> Agreement With Latvia"]    [Text] Riga, 11 Feb -- The Russian joint stock company  "Gazprom," without giving reasons, has dissolved the contract  with the state joint stock company "Latvijas gaze" (LG) on  natural gas deliveries for the current year, LG Vice President  Girts Stelbovics informed journalists at a press conference  organized by leading Latvian energy experts. Agreements have  been dissolved also with Lithuania and Estonia. For the purpose  of signing new agreements, a 14-member Russian delegation is  scheduled to arrive in Latvia.    At the same time, the president of the state joint stock  company "Latvenergo" Gunars Koemecs stated that the Riga  municipal authorities have settled only 54 percent of their  accounts for the consumed heat. His enterprise has not received  payment for heating of apartments and for hot water amounting to  6 million lats. Due to the cold weather in February, the sum of  the debts may increase by one third, Koemecs said.    G. Stelbovics also said that the main reason for the  "Gazprom" action is the fact that LG owes 23 million USD to the  Russian enterprise. The problem will be resolved during the next  few days, because the Latvian Cabinet of Ministers has accepted  the payment of this sum to LG, from the credit of the European  Bank for Reconstruction and Development.    Although the decision of the Cabinet states that the money  is  slated for necessary gas supplies in the summer, G. Stelbovics  has told DIENA that the money will go toward covering the debt.  The large debts of LG result from the fact that the debtors do  not pay for the consumed gas -- the total sum of debts on 1  February amounted to 49 million lats.    At least 80,000 USD will be necessary for purchasing gas in  the summer. To receive such a sum, there are talks being  conducted by different foreign commercial banks and other  financial structures, DIENA was told by G. Stelbovics.    It seems alarming that such a numerous delegation is coming  to Latvia, said the state minister of energetics, Andris  Kreslins. The reasons might become known after the visit of the  representatives of the state gas enterprises of the three Baltic  countries to Moscow in the next few days. It is also not known  what the conditions and prices proposed by Russian  representatives will be, and what effect they will have on  Latvia's economy and people.</p>

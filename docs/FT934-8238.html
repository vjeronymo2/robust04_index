			<p>931116 FT  16 NOV 93 / Computer rubs out pencil in US exams THE trusty 'number two' pencil, the one common bond among applicants for US higher education, took a step towards oblivion yesterday when the nation's largest exams administrator said applicants for advanced degrees could take their admission exams on computer. Nearly 400,000 students a year take the Graduate Record Exam, which is required for admission to most university graduate schools in the US, except for business, medical and law courses. Plans are also under way to computerise the Standardised Admissions Test required for undergraduate admission for first degrees, but this is not expected to be available on computer before the turn of the century. The delay is because of the logistical problems involved in administering the test to around 1.3m students who take it every year. By 1997, when the GRE will be available only by computer, aspiring graduate students will also be able to forgo the experience of sitting in a huge room of stressed fellow students. Instead, students will schedule appointments and take the exam in small groups, according to Ms Charlotte Kuh of Educational Testing Service, the private company that develops and administers both the GRE and the SAT. The computer tests are adaptive, meaning that questions get increasingly difficult as students answer them correctly. This will allow better students to earn higher scores and move through the test quickly, skipping over easy questions. The adaptive tests will allow students to write a short essay or complete a more difficult maths section in addition to the existing sections - verbal, quantitative and analytical reasoning. Ms Kuh said she hoped the new test would eliminate some of the advantages of students able to pay for expensive preparation courses, but companies providing such courses are rushing to develop new strategies. As many as 26,000 students pay Dollars 695 each to take test preparation courses at either Kaplan Educational Centers or the Princeton Review. Mr Robert Cohen of the Princeton Review, with Dollars 40m in sales annually, said it was ridiculous to think a new test could make his services obsolete. He said his company already had a programme geared for the computer test.</p>

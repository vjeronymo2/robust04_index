			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / International Company News: MIM Holdings surges to ADollars 132m for year MIM Holdings, the Australian mining group, yesterday announced a 75 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 132.8m (USDollars 95.4m) for the year to the end of June, on revenue down 11 per cent to ADollars 1.8bn. However, net profit was unchanged at ADollars 87m after excluding an abnormal profit of ADollars 45.8m on the sale of the group's interest in Teck Corporation of Canada. At the bottom line, profit was ADollars 106.3m after exchange differences and minority interests, compared with ADollars 6.9m the previous year, when MIM wrote off its investment in the troubled Newlands, Collinsville and Abbott Point (NCA) coal project. MIM said the revenue fall was partly caused by the exclusion from the results of the NCA operations, which are operating at capacity but generating insufficient cash to meet interest payments. The group is discussing refinancing proposals with the banks. Revenue was also reduced by lower prices for copper, lead and gold, and copper production difficulties caused by adverse weather conditions. However, MIM said reduced revenue from lower sales and prices was more than offset by a strong performance from the Porgera gold mine in Papua New Guinea, which is 30 per cent owned by Highlands Gold, an MIM subsidiary. The group cut costs by nearly 12 per cent to ADollars 1.7bn. At the operating level, profits fell to ADollars 145m from ADollars 155m the previous year, but increased to ADollars 62m in the fourth quarter from ADollars 47m, reflecting cost savings.</p>

			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / International Company News: Southam plans links with Black SOUTHAM, the Canadian newspaper group in which Mr Conrad Black's Hollinger recently became the largest shareholder, plans to forge closer links with Mr Black's other international publishing investments, The Daily Telegraph in the UK and Australia's Fairfax Holdings. Mr William Ardell, Southam's chief executive, said yesterday an alluring aspect of Mr Black's business strategy was that 'he sees papers in a global context'. No discussions have taken place on areas of co-operation, but Mr Ardell foresaw opportunities to create products, including improvements to existing papers. Southam is expected to tap The Telegraph's UK industrial relations experience to deal with labour problems at its loss-making Vancouver offshoot which runs the city's two leading newspapers. The 200-plus small US newspapers owned by Hollinger relied heavily on The Daily Telegraph for coverage of the Gulf war in 1991. The North American edition of the Jerusalem Post, which is also controlled by Mr Black, is printed by a Hollinger subsidiary in New Jersey. Hollinger recently completed a deal to buy 22.6 per cent of Southam, which publishes 18 daily papers and has interests in business information services and trade publications. In an understanding modelled on last year's Hollinger-Telegraph agreement, Mr Black has agreed to safeguards to prevent a creeping takeover or a proxy fight for control of Southam. Hollinger will name three representatives to the Southam board, but a majority of board members will be independent of both Southam management and Hollinger. Any deal worth more than CDollars 100m (USDollars 78.1m) or 10 per cent of Southam's market capitalisation must have the assent of holders of a majority of Southam shares, excluding Hollinger. John Fairfax Holdings, the Australian newspaper group 15 per cent-owned by Mr Conrad Black's Daily Telegraph group, predicts pre-tax profits of ADollars 105m (USDollars 72.4m) in the year to June, compared to earlier forecasts of ADollars 94m, writes Kevin Brown in Sydney. But revenue was expected to be 3 per cent below an earlier forecast of ADollars 782m.</p>

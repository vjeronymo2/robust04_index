			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / GM confirms upturn in car market with doubled profits General Motors of the US, the world's biggest vehicle maker, more than doubled its net profits to a record Dollars 1.9bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in the second quarter from Dollars 889m a year ago. All of the big three US vehicle makers - GM, Ford and Chrysler - have achieved record profits in the second quarter, as they continue to recover from the heavy losses of the early 1990s. The profits of the big three US carmakers are rising sharply helped by the continuing strength of the North American market and the start of recovery in western Europe, where GM is currently the most profitable volume carmaker. GM remains the highest cost producer in North America with profit margins far below Ford and Chrysler, but it is starting to reap the benefits of a drastic restructuring of its North American automotive operations, which have suffered losses for the past four years. In the second quarter GM's domestic automotive operations achieved a net profit of Dollars 723m, compared with a loss of Dollars 33m. GM's international automotive operations also increased net profits by 77 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars 543m from Dollars 306m reflecting continuing high earnings in Latin America and 'significantly improved profitability' in Europe. GM Hughes Electronics, the defence and automotive electronics subsidiary, increased its net profit in the second quarter to Dollars 267m (Dollars 232m). Its Electronic Data Systems subsidiary raised earnings to a record Dollars 197m (Dollars 178m), but GMAC, its financial services operation, suffered a fall in earnings to Dollars 216m from Dollars 285m. Mr Jack Smith, chief executive, said that GM recognised that it could not become 'complacent'. 'We still have a lot of work ahead to improve our earnings power and achieve target earning margins.' In the second quarter it achieved a net margin of 2.7 per cent on its North American automotive operations (NAO) compared with a loss of 0.1 per cent a year earlier. International automotive operations increased their net margin to 7.5 from 4.6 per cent. 'The dramatic improvement in NAO's margins is an encouraging sign that we're on track. We're still considerably short, however, of our 5 per cent annual net margin target,' said Mr Smith. In the first half GM virtually doubled its group net income to Dollars 2.78bn from Dollars 1.4bn a year ago on a turnover, which rose to Dollars 77.9bn (Dollars 70.8bn). Before changes in accounting principles net income rose to Dollars 33.5bn. Leaders of the pack, Page 19</p>

			<p><P> October 28, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: IT'S A SIGN THAT ELECTION SEASON IS IN FULL BLOOM  </P> <P> Turf tussle: A sign war is raging in Lawndale, where candidates for City  Council have taken their battle to the city's front yards.  </P> <P> Candidate Gary McDonald told reporters last week that he spotted rival Norm  Lagerquist tearing down the campaign sign of a third council hopeful, Ron  Maxwell, on a resident's front lawn.  </P> <P> A local newspaper gave the story big play, publishing McDonald's claim that  Lagerquist turned "ghost white" after being caught "red-handed" in this crude  attempt at street-side spin control.  </P> <P> But the issue, it turns out, was not so clear-cut.  </P> <P> Lagerquist says he had every right to do what he did: The Maxwell poster, he  says, had been stapled onto a stake carrying a Lagerquist sign.  </P> <P> Maxwell admits this is true. But he says Millie Morales, who rents the house  where the sign removal occurred, did not want more posts driven into her lawn.  He says she gave him permission to tack his sign to Lagerquist's stake.  </P> <P> Morales confirms Maxwell's account, but says she'll never let a candidate place  a sign in her yard again. Politics, she discovered, knows no boundaries.  </P> <P> "I'm a Jehovah's Witness and we don't vote anyway," Morales said. "I told my  husband we shouldn't do this because then we're going to be involved. And look  what happened."  </P> <P> Color of money: His campaign account slipping into the red, but congressional  candidate Guy Kimbrough is counting on a pair of well-known artists to paint  him into the black before the Nov. 6 election.  </P> <P> Artists Richard Serra and John Baldessari have each agreed to donate 10  limited-edition prints of one of their paintings to Kimbrough, who is trying to  unseat U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Long Beach).  </P> <P> The prints will be offered to supporters in exchange for $1,000 campaign  contributions, the maximum allowed by law.  </P> <P> Serra and Baldessari's donations are part of an effort by artists to oppose  politicians who want to rein in the National Endowment for the Arts.  </P> <P> Among the targets is Rohrabacher, who led an unsuccessful attempt in the House  this month to bar NEA support for art projects that offend any religion, are  "indecent" or could be interpreted as denigrating the American flag.  </P> <P> That has left Kimbrough with a new sense of art appreciation.  </P> <P> "We will be down to zip by 6 o'clock today," he said Thursday, referring to the  cash balance in his campaign account. "We need a minimum of $15,000 to pull the  last part of this campaign together."  </P> <P> Write-ins: South Bay oil refineries can produce more than fuel. This year, two  of their byproducts are Socialist Workers Party write-in candidates for  statewide office.  </P> <P> Joel Britton, a plant operator at Chevron's El Segundo refinery, has filed  papers as the party's candidate for governor. And Eli Green, a pipe fitter at  Arco's Carson refinery, is the insurance commissioner candidate for the party,  which does not have enough members to qualify its candidates for the state  ballot.  </P> <P> Among the party's main planks: U.S. forces should not wage war in the Persian  Gulf, the government should not tax wage-earners, and unions should form a  nationwide labor party to represent the interests of U.S. workers.  </P> <P> The deployment of U.S. troops in the gulf only stands to benefit big business,  he says, whereas soldiers from working families are the ones who would be  placed at risk.  </P> <P> "This would be an example of a rich man's war but a poor man's fight," he said  Friday. "It's hypocrisy."  </P> <P> Political touring: With cassettes, freeway drivers can study languages,  meditate or even gain what it takes to lose weight or quit smoking. Why not  prepare for the Nov. 6 crush of ballot propositions while behind the wheel?  </P> <P> Tape recordings describing state and county propositions are being offered by  several South Bay public libraries, including those in Inglewood, Torrance and  Manhattan Beach.  </P> <P> The tapes, supplied by the Secretary of State's Office, contain the official  title and summary of ballot measures along with an analysis and arguments pro  and con.  </P> <P> The cassettes may save potential voters from eye strain but, oh, those ears.  Total listening time: the equivalent of a 55-m.p.h. trip to Las Vegas. GEORGE  HATCH, KIM KOWSKY and MARC LACEY  </P></p>

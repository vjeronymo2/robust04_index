			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 22 (YONHAP) -- Prime Minister-designate  Yi Yong-tok pledged Friday that he would do his utmost to serve  the country and people if his appointment is legally approved by  the National Assembly.    "I will see to it that the entire government becomes one  under the leadership of the president and devote myself to live  up to the responsibility bestowed upon me," Yi told reporters at  his office in the National Unification Board [NUB] after his  appointment was announced.    The NUB minister said the unification is possible once the  people unite and continue with reforms to build a free country.    "Picturing a unified country, I will do my best to ensure  freedom and welfare of the 70 million people of the Korean  peninsula," he said.    He added that press reports about the intra-government  confusion over unification and security-related policy were  wrong.</p>

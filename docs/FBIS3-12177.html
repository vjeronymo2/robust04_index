			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Minister Ya'ir Tzaban has said that in tomorrow's  cabinet session he will again demand that all of the Kahanist  organizations be outlawed and that the concentrations of  settlers be moved out of Hebron.    Minister Amnon Rubinstein also said that tomorrow he will  support the suggestions to outlaw Kakh members and supporters,  to distance them from Qiryat Arba', disarm them, and not draft  them to the IDF [Israel Defense Forces]. He told our  correspondent Hayim Hecht that the upsetting remarks Kakh  members made on Qol Yisra'el's weekly newsreel prove that the  extremist settlers' moral standards have drastically  deteriorated.</p>

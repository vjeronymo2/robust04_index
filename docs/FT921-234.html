			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Security Pacific broker sold off SECURITY Pacific, the troubled west coast US bank, last night completed its divestment of Hoare Govett, the stockbroker, with the sale of Hoare Govett Asia to the management. At the same time, the management sold 49 per cent of the company to Guoco Group - the owner of Dao Heng Bank, a medium-sized Hong Kong bank. The deal came a month after Security Pacific signed a letter of intent with ABN-Amro, the Netherlands bank, for the sale of Hoare Govett in the UK and Europe. Mr Tony Lowrie, Hoare Govett Asia's chief operating officer, said yesterday that the deal would enable the broker to relaunch itself as a lead-ing Asian house, and to strengthen its links with institutions and companies in the region. The firm, which will be renamed HG Asia, has eight sales and research offices in Asia and sales operations in London, New York and Sydney. No price was given for the transaction, which is conditional upon US regulatory agencies' approval and an audit. However, Security Pacific is still likely to have lost more than its total investment of some Pounds 100m in Hoare Govett. It bought control of the firm in December 1984 and took full ownership in 1987.</p>

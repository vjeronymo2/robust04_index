			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Pressure grows for North American free trade pact THE LEADERS of the US, Canada and Mexico are due to hold a three-way telephone conference today in an attempt to clear some of the remaining obstacles to a North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). The conversation between President George Bush of the US, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Mr Brian Mulroney, prime minister of Canada, comes amid mounting pressure for a political decision to conclude a deal. The Nafta talks themselves appear to be close to a breakthrough, according to Washington trade specialists, although differences remain over energy, agriculture and cars among other things. Corporate advisers to the negotiators have been told that something 'could break soon'. Negotiators fear progress towards an agreement could be complicated by political considerations, if candidates opposing Nafta make a strong showing in primary elections in the industrial states of Michigan and Illinois tomorrow. Mr Bush's rightwing challenger in the Republican ballot, Mr Patrick Buchanan, has espoused protectionism as a central issue in his campaign. In Michigan, car workers and other unionised labour are fiercely hostile to Nafta, which they believe would result in the transfer of US manufacturing jobs to lower wage Mexican factories. The two frontrunners for the Democratic presidential nomination, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, are broadly in favour of the Nafta talks. Their challenger, former Governor Jerry Brown of California, has adopted the issue in his quest for working class votes. Mr Brown has attacked the 'fast-track' authority by which Congress allowed the administration to negotiate a Nafta deal which it could not then amend. Mr Bush defended the Nafta talks in a campaign trip to Michigan. 'I do not accept the wisdom of some that says that a free trade agreement is going to result simply in an export of jobs. It is not going to do that, and I believe that we ought to keep pressing for it. I don't care what the politics of it are,' he said in a speech to the Economic Club of Detroit. Some of the president's campaign advisers are less certain about the wisdom of pressing ahead with Nafta. Some officials believe that it would be dangerous to conclude either Nafta or a Gatt multilateral trade agreement, either of which would face opposition in Congress and might be difficult to ratify this year. The Nafta issue is a two-edged sword. The prospect of free trade with Mexico is welcomed in south-western states such as Texas, but generally unpopular in old industrial states such as Michigan.

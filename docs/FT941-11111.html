			<p>940205 FT  05 FEB 94 / Cookery: A pride of pies Pies, like roasts, are the pride of the British table. From medieval times to the end of the 18th century, no feast would have seemed complete without its proper complement of them. Spices often were used to flavour pies, and sugar and dried fruits were much in evidence in earlier centuries. The pastry was often of the hot watercrust type, the work of a monumental mason so to speak: fortress walls designed to seal and protect the solidly-packed filling and its gravy from air that might taint it. The whole structure deliberately was made robust enough to withstand travel along jolting roads. In the beginning, not all pies were intended for eating. Sometimes, chefs confected them purely for entertainment, and these 'conceits' and 'subtleties' were displayed. By the late 18th century, though, the pastry-maker's art began to wane as pastry gave way to the potato. Great meat or game pies ('treasure chests of the choicest titbits,' as Elisabeth Ayrton called them in The Cookery of England), elaborate 'coffyns,' raised crusts, towering layers of the flakiest puff pastry and the most sumptuous fillings slipped from the repertoire of all but the grandest houses. Enter instead the simple and infinitely homely cottage and shepherd's pies with minced meat, and fish pies consisting of nothing more than over-boiled cod under a blanket of mashed potato. Now, though, many cooks are making fish pies that display some hint of former glory, and last summer I had some success with some fish pies of my own. These were filled with salmon, capers, black olives, chopped coriander or flat-leafed parsley and chives, bound lightly with a lemon and fish stock sauce, and topped with puff pastry gilded with egg yolk and cream. Although the pastry was shop-bought, I enlivened it by rolling it out extra-thin and sandwiching a criss-cross of anchovy fillets between two sheets of it. The anchovy dissolved to provide a salty savour. An elegant dish for fair-weather eating. In raw February, though, substantial offerings are more timely and a classic steak and kidney pudding is my favourite choice for entertaining foreigners to Sunday lunch. It is less obvious than a roast and easier for the cook. No basting to do and no last-minute gravy to make. In fact everything can be done ahead as suet crust puddings benefit from re-heating. The only thing I like better than a suet crust pudding is a suet crust pie, or what the Irish call a ciste. Essentially, this is a stew given a suet crust lid. It could hardly be easier to produce. No special pastry-making skills are required and no rolling pin, either. The dough can simply be patted into a round and laid over the meat when it is part-cooked and the gravy is seasoned to your liking. Delicious. LEMON &amp; LAMB PIE WITH TURMERIC (serves 4) Two cultures collide magnificently here: suet crust, a supremely British achievement, and the winning north African combination of sheep meat, earthy yellow turmeric and the tang of lemon. Slow cooking produces a gravy of rich savour and some of it is soaked up by the pastry. Spring lamb would be wasted here. Mutton, hogget or mature lamb is what is needed and neck fillet of lamb from New Zealand makes a good choice. The lemon should be firm and juicy, grown organically or unwaxed as the peel as well as the flesh is used. If the weather is freakishly cold or appetites are gargantuan, make a thicker layer of suet crust. Use 8oz of flour instead of 6oz, and 4oz of suet instead of 3oz. For the filling: 1 1/4 lb neck fillet of lamb; 1 lemon;  1/2 lb onion, roughly chopped; 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped; 1 teaspoon turmeric; a smidgin of olive oil; 1 1/2 teaspoons flour; 12 fl oz water. For the crust: 6oz self-raising flour; a scant  1/2 teaspoon of baking powder; 3oz suet; a seasoning of salt and pepper; 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves; 3 fl oz cold water to bind. Method: Grate the lemon zest finely and cut the white pith from the flesh. Discard the pith and chop the flesh into small pieces. Cut the lamb into bite-size cubes and brown them in batches in a little very hot oil. (I do this in the flame-proof casserole in which the pie can be cooked and brought to table). Reserve the browned lamb. Stir the onions and garlic into the fat remaining in the casserole and let them take colour. Sprinkle on the turmeric and flour, then add the lemon zest and flesh and a little salt and pepper. Pour on the water and bring to simmering point, stirring. Return the lamb to the casserole, cover tightly, and cook gently for 45 minutes. Towards the end of this time, make the suet crust. Mix the dry ingredients together, stir in the water to bind, and finish mixing the dough by hand. Turn on to a floured work surface and pat it into a disc that will just fit inside the casserole. Lay the suet crust directly on top of the filling and cover the casserole again, slipping a piece of buttered foil (buttered side down) between the pot and its lid. The foil will ensure a good fit and prevent the evaporation of too much gravy during cooking. The butter will prevent the suet crust sticking to the lid if it rises dramatically as it cooks. Continue simmering very gently indeed for 1-1 1/4 hours until the meat is tender, the flavours of the filling are fused, and the pastry is puffed up and light. Keep the flame very low and/or use a heat retarder to avoid any risk of the bottom of the pie catching and burning. Spinach steamed until it is just wilted goes very well with this dish.</p>

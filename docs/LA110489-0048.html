			<p><P> November 4, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SHERIFF ENDORSES TAX MEASURE FOR SANTA CLARITA VALLEY ROADS  </P> <P> Saying he considers a $285-million tax measure to build roads in the Santa  Clarita Valley important for safety, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block  has endorsed the measure and is urging voters to approve it when they go to the  polls next week.  </P> <P> The Roads Now Committee, which has attempted to portray Measure P as a safety  issue, announced Block's endorsement Friday.  </P> <P> The committee already had the backing of the Los Angeles County Firefighters  Assn. and this week announced the endorsements of the Los Angeles County Fire  Department Assn. of Chiefs and the Assn. for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs.  </P> <P> In a letter to the Roads Now Committee, Block wrote: "I usually do not take an  active role on local political issues, but I view Proposition P on the November  7th ballot as a safety issue. The road projects funded by Proposition P are  critical to emergency vehicles' ability to get to their destinations quickly  and safely."  </P> <P> The Roads Now Committee concedes that it will not be easy to win the two-thirds  vote needed to pass the measure. An opposing group says developers and  government, not homeowners, should pay for roads.  </P></p>

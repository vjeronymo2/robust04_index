			<p>930310 FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Transfer Technology rises 72% TRANSFER Technology, the specialist engineering group, increased pre-tax profits by 72 per cent last year with the help of acquisitions. Pre-tax profits for 1992 rose from Pounds 5.51m to Pounds 9.45m. Earnings per share, affected by last year's Pounds 23.9m rights issue, rose less sharply to 42.8p (36.5p). The emphasis of the business has moved since it was formed through the merger in 1991 of Central &amp; Sheerwood, a Robert Maxwell company, and interests controlled by Mr Geoffrey Robinson. Through acquisitions and organic growth, dependence on the automotive components sector has been reduced so that the main contribution to operating profits now comes from control and manufacturing technology. Turnover of Pounds 106.9m (Pounds 68m) produced a gain in operating profits to Pounds 10.3m (Pounds 5.38m). Acquisitions accounted for Pounds 23m of turnover and Pounds 3m of operating profits. The profit growth, on top of a rise in net margins from 8.1 per cent to 8.8 per cent, partly reflected the rationalisation of acquisitions. A final dividend of 9.75p raises the total to 16p (13p).</p>

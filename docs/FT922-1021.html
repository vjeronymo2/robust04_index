			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Executive Cars (3): Catching up fast - The European Market SENIOR British executives tempted to move to a continental Europe-based company in the EC's single market next year, but concerned about possible loss of the company car which is among the most hallowed of UK 'perks', have rapidly decreasing cause to worry. Studies by management remuneration groups such as the Monks Partnership and Brussels-based Wyatt Company provide firm evidence that most continental European countries are moving towards British levels of provision, even while UK Chancellors have shown a desire to squeeze such perks out of the remuneration system. Indeed, at managing director level, the UK now ranks only sixth in the European league for automatic car provision. Admittedly, that is splitting hairs since 96 per cent of managing directors in Britain get one, according to Monks survey figures. But Britain is nevertheless behind France (97 per cent), Spain (98 per cent) and, most of all Austria and Germany, where Monks found 100 per cent allocation. Even four out of five Swiss managing directors - better able than most to buy their own Mercedes - received either a car or an allowance with which to buy one. British managing directors contemplating 'opting out' of their own company cars as a result of increasing personal taxation on its benefit might not, however, be too impressed at the average size of allowance - Dollars 10,238 a year according to Wyatt's statistics, which currently would not cover one year's depreciation on some quite modest executive cars in the depressed UK market. At director level, Germany and Ireland have moved up to share equal ranking with the UK on 97 per cent provision but, according to Monks' statistics, the gap is narrowing swiftly with countries which, even until fairly recently, expected most directors to buy their own. Even Belgium, once notably miserly towards its directors, now provides cars for two-thirds of directors. The further down the managerial tree such surveys descend, however, the more the 'old' picture of the UK as a particularly benevolent country for car provision does re-establish itself. At middle manager level, one half of Spanish employees, for example, are offered cars while 96 per cent of their British counterparts - almost the same percentage as managing directors - receive them as a matter of course. On present trends, however, the gap will close significantly over the next two or three years - only just over one third of Spanish managers were receiving cars in the late 1980s. French middle managers have reason to smile as well. Last year, according to the Monks survey, 54 per cent of middle managers received cars, compared with only 30 per cent two years previously. The surveys shed some interesting light on some of the cultural differences between countries in terms of the cost and type of cars provided. In Spain, for example, Monks found that the managing director's car is likely to cost at least three times more than that of the sales rep. In egalitarian Sweden, however, the chief executive's car often costs only about one-third more than the salesman's. The UK is not notably more egalitarian than Spain. Indeed, the Monks study found that the average of Pounds 28,000 which British managing directors spent on their cars was the highest of all the countries in the study, although this is explained in part by high purchase taxes - since reduced as a result of the cut in Special Car Tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. Of particular interest to UK businessmen, as they await the conclusions of a government-ordered review of the current structure of company car taxation, might be the extent to which other European countries offer their executives a choice between a car or a cash allowance. In Britain, according to Wyatt's statistics, only between 3.4 per cent and 4.3 per cent are offered such a choice, irrespective of whether the employee is a rep or the chief executive. At the other extreme, between 57 and 90 per cent of Norwegians, depending on job category, get the choice, as do between 15 and 20 per cent of Germans. Self-evidently, the choice of car made by Europe's executives is a matter of profound importance to their manufacturers. So what exactly is most popular? According to a compilation made by the FT's Jobs Column from the vehicles most mentioned within the Wyatt research, for all management levels averaged over 17 countries, the league table runs: 1, Audi 100; 2, Ford Scorpio-Granada; 3, BMW 5 Series; 4, Renault 25; 5, Opel Omega (Vauxhall Carlton); 6, Volvo 700 Series; 7, Mercedes 200 Series; 8, Peugeot 405; 9, Renault 21; 10, Ford Sierra. For chief executives only, the 'top five' list reads 1, BMW 5 Series; 2, Audi 100; 3, Volvo 700 Series; 4, Mercedes 200 Series; 5, Saab 9000. The overall hierarchy is a source of particular satisfaction to Audi, the Volkswagen group's executive car arm. The Audi 100 has been 'top of the pops' since the late 1980s. What has yet to show up in any of the charts is an executive car with a Japanese badge attached to it. But with what started out as a trickle of Japanese executive cars starting to become a flood, it is a moot point for how long such a situation will prevail.

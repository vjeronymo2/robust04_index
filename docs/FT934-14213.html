			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / International Company News: Kia Motors concerned as Samsung lifts its stake KIA MOTORS officials have expressed concern that the company, South Korea's second-largest vehicle manufacturer, may become the target of the country's first takeover bid, writes John Burton in Seoul. Samsung, the electronics conglomerate, has lifted its stake in Kia by 40 per cent to 9.6 per cent during the past three months, according to the Securities Supervisory Board. This makes Samsung the second-largest corporate shareholder in Kia after Ford of the US, which has 10 per cent. Samsung denies the stock purchase is the start of a takeover bid. But analysts say it is unusual for such a large investment to be made in one company. If Samsung is preparing a bid, it would be Korea's first big merger or acquisition through the purchase of large blocks of shares on the stock exchange.</p>

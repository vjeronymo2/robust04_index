			<p>941013 FT  13 OCT 94 / Canada plans for cable and telecoms freedom Canada is to clear the way for open competition between telephone companies, cable-TV operators and other telecommunications providers, under a new policy unveiled by the industry minister, Mr John Manley. The government has directed the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which regulates broadcasting and telecoms, to study the legislative changes required to bring down regulatory barriers. The CRTC is expected to complete its report by the end of February. 'We want real competition, and our vision is not restricted to established industries,' Mr Manley said. 'We fully expect - and will actively encourage - a host of new entrants. We want competing carriers and other service providers to have full access, on equitable terms, to the facilities of telephone companies and cable companies, other than capacity used for broadcast signals.' Although foreign investors are presently limited to minority stakes in Canadian phone, cable and broadcasting companies, several have already entered the market. AT&amp;T, for example, owns 20 per cent of Unitel, which pioneered competition in long-distance telephone services two years ago. Sprint, the US long-distance company, has a 25 per cent interest in Call-Net Enterprises of Toronto, another new entrant in the long-distance market. The CRTC last month spelt out plans to encourage competition in local telephone services, which are presently dominated by monopolies in each of Canada's 10 provinces. The traditional cross-subsidy of local rates by long-distance revenues will be substantially reduced with the aim of attracting new entrants.</p>

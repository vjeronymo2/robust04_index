			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Haiti observers told to leave in 48 hours Haiti's military-backed government has given a team of more than 100 human rights observers, representing the United Nations and the Organisation of American States, 48 hours to leave the country, claiming they are a threat to national security. The move created a flurry of diplomatic activity in New York yesterday, as the most senior officials of the UN and the OAS gathered to consider how to respond to it. Mr Dante Caputo, the UN's envoy to Haiti, said that neither Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the secretary general, nor the head of the OAS had yet determined how to handle the situation. But the UN was not going to be pushed around. A UN official said there were 40 UN staff and 64 representatives of the OAS, all in Port au Prince, having concentrated in the capital after withdrawing from other locations in the country. The regime had an obligation to guarantee their protection but was not doing so, the official said. The ultimatum to remove the international mission within 48 hours was delivered without previous warning and the UN knew of no recent instance that might have provoked it. It was issued by the military government, which overthrew President Jean-Bertrand Aristide almost three years ago, and is likely to further anger the US and other governments that have been pushing the regime to step down. Haiti is under an international economic embargo, but the military has refused to leave office. The expulsion order stated that the observer mission should leave the country 'in order to avoid an incident or provocation'. The government ordered the mission to stop its work a week ago, but the UN General Assembly subsequently renewed the mission's mandate on Friday. Mr Caputo said yesterday that the expulsion was an outrageous provocation. 'The reasons are quite obvious. They kill people. They torture people. They rape people. And they don't want any witnesses in their country.' He said the expulsion would be discussed with the governments of Argentina, Canada, France, the US and Venezuela - the 'friends of Haiti' - ahead of a meeting scheduled for last night between Mr BoutrousGhali and Mr Christopher Thomas, the acting secretary general of the OAS. The government of the Caribbean island of Grenada has denied that it has reached an agreement with the US to provide 'safe haven' to Haitians fleeing their country. The government said it had received the US request, but had not yet agreed to it. The US government said last week that Grenada, Dominica and Antigua had agreed to grant temporary asylum to Haitians until the political crisis there had been resolved.</p>

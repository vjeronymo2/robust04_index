			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, June 8 (AFP) -- The PLO has rejected an  Israeli offer to release 2,500 Palestinian prisoners on  condition that they serve out their time in the self-rule area  of Gaza, a member of the Palestinian Authority said Wednesday [8  June].    "The Israeli conditions are to send them to Gaza to finish  their sentences," authority member Jamil al-Tarifi told AFP.    "During this time they would not be under police custody or  in prison they would just have to stay in Gaza."    PLO Chairman Yasir 'Arafat had spurned the offer, al-Tarifi  said.    "According to the Cairo agreement for autonomy, 5,000 were  to  be released as a first step with no such conditions" he pointed  out.    "The prisoners also refuse this option."    Al-Tarifi said Israel was prepared to free 2,500 inmates on  Thursday provided the PLO agreed to keep them all in Gaza. "As  far as we know they will now not be released."    'Arafat had appointed 'Abd-al-Razzaq al-Yahya, who took part  in the self-rule negotiations in Egypt, to head a coordinating  committee for security which will review the prisoner problem  with the Israeli authorities.    Al-Yahya arrived in the autonomous enclave of Jericho on  Tuesday.    About 8,000 Palestinians are still held in Israeli jails.  Out of the 5,000 due to be released within five weeks of the  signing of the May 4 self-rule deal, only 1,700 have so far been  set free.    Israel has given no reasons for the hold up nor confirmed  that it had offered to free 2,500 with the above conditions.</p>

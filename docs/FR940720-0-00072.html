			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Measurement of Reformulated Gasoline Fuel Parameters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (&sect;80.46)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The table of aromatic compounds in &sect;80.46(f)(1)(ii)(K) is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> being revised. The aromatic compounds listed in the final rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are those used by EPA during the development of the analytical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> method for the rulemaking. In this notice some compounds that no  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer are available commercially have been deleted from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> list, and several aromatic compounds that are found in commercial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasolines and are available commercially to make reference  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials have been added to the list. Only materials of known  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purity or those specified as 99% pure or greater should be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as calibration standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The number of calibration levels should be sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bracket the expected concentration of each compound. Two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration levels were used in the initial evaluation of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test method. In the future, however, EPA probably will use five  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calibration levels with at least three internal standards used in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the standards and samples in order to improve precision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Initially EPA prepared standards by volume. Currently,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> however, EPA prepares standards, samples, and internal standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> by weight. Conversion to volume percent is performed by using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the density of the aromatic compound in question. Standards for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline that are prepared by weight are considered to be more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accurate than standards that are prepared by volume.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Neither the use of five calibration levels, nor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preparation of standards by weight, should be viewed as changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the regulations, but rather as Agency recommendations intended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to improve precision.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. General Requirements for Refiners, Importers and Oxygenate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Blenders (&sect;80.65)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> a.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Designation of Gasoline as Oxygenated Fuels Program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Reformulated Gasoline (OPRG) or Non-OPRG. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 80.65(d)(2)(iii) is revised in order to clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> categories of gasoline that may be designated as oxygenated fuels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program reformulated gasoline, or OPRG. The final rule, at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;80.65(d)(2)(iii), specifies that reformulated gasoline must be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as OPRG, or not OPRG, to provide a mechanism to ensure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline outside of oxygenated fuels control areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> during oxygenated fuels control periods has at least the 2.0  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> weight percent oxygen content mandated by the Clean Air Act. <FOOTCITE>3</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The final rule requires parties who meet the oxygen standard on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> average to meet the oxygen standard separately for gasoline not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as OPRG. If OPRG and non-OPRG gasoline could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> averaged together for oxygen purposes, the gasoline in the OPRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas_where 2.7 weight percent oxygen is required during the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygenated fuels control period_could be used to offset gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with 1.5 weight percent oxygen intended for use in non-OPRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The ``oxygenated fuels control areas'' are those areas where the use of oxygenated gasoline is required during the winter season pursuant to section 211(m) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C.  <!-- PJG 0034 unknown --> 7545(m). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Today's revision consists of two parts. First, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation is clarified to make specific that the OPRG/non-OPRG  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designation applies only to reformulated gasoline and not to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> RBOB. The final rule requires RBOB to be designated as OPRG or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> non-OPRG, but the OPRG designation for RBOB serves no purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because RBOB does not become reformulated gasoline until  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygenate has been added. The final rule is unchanged regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygenate blender responsibilities_oxygenate blenders who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> produce reformulated gasoline by combining RBOB with oxygenate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are required to designate the gasoline as OPRG or non-OPRG, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to meet the oxygen standard separately for gasoline not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designated as OPRG.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second change regarding OPRG-designated gasoline is the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition of a new provision, at &sect;80.65(d)(2)(iii)(B), to clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that reformulated gasoline that contains at least 2.0 weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent oxygen may be designated as OPRG regardless of whether or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not the gasoline is used in an oxygenated fuels program control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> area during an oxygenated fuels program control period. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> change allows terminals that serve both oxygenated fuels areas  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and non-oxygenated fuels areas to stock a single reformulated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> gasoline that could be used in both areas, instead of having to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stock both OPRG and non-OPRG designated reformulated gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This change also allows all reformulated gasoline that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2.0 weight percent oxygen per-gallon standard to be designated as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OPRG, without such gasoline being restricted to use in oxygenated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel areas during oxygenated fuel control periods.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A terminal thus could stock reformulated gasoline that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contains 2.7 weight percent oxygen and, therefore, that meets the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> oxygenated fuels oxygen requirement, and deliver this gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into both OPRG and non-OPRG markets. A terminal also could stock  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reformulated gasoline that contains 2.0 weight percent oxygen for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivery into both OPRG and non-OPRG markets, and splash blend  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> additional oxygenate with those batches of gasoline that are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delivered into the oxygenated fuel area during the oxygenated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fuel control period. <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Section 80.78(a)(6) prohibits adding oxygenate to reformulated gasoline, except in the case of reformulated gasoline that is designated as OPRG and is used in an oxygenated fuels program control area during an oxygenated fuels program control period. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

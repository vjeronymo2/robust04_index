A relevant Foreign Ministry official revealed that the  Russian Government informed our government that the submarines  that Russia recently sold to North Korea were decommissioned  submarines from which weapons and equipment were all removed.  Therefore, these submarines were sold in accordance with a  commercial contract, not a contract for weapons supply, and this  contract prescribed that the Russian side will inspect the work  of dismantling the decommissioned submarines.</p>

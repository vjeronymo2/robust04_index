			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the final rule of November 16, 1993, the Service interpreted that Appendix III species are considered CITES-listed species for the purposes of these regulations only if they originate in the country that listed them in Appendix III. The Service noted that the listing of a species in Appendix III is a unilateral action by a particular CITES Party, thereby requiring CITES permits and implementation of CITES permit issuance requirements for that country only; when the species is found in countries that did not list it in Appendix III, only a certificate of origin is required, stating that it did not originate in the country that listed the species in Appendix III. Therefore, when the species is found in countries other than where listed in Appendix III, it is not subject to the same level of CITES controls, and indeed is only listed in the Appendices to assist the listing state in implementing its domestic legislation. Based on its understanding of the intent of Congress, the Service implemented a final rule whereby Appendix III species were subject to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> automatic <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  import prohibitions of the law, if they originated in the listing country. Otherwise, they would be subject to the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> discretionary <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  prohibitions of the law.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Humane Society of the United States and Defenders of Wildlife brought a civil action against the Secretary of the Interior in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging that part of 50 CFR 15.11 which restricts the importation of certain Appendix III exotic birds.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Humane Society of the United States  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Babbitt,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Civ. No. 94&hyph;0296 (D.D.C., March 29, 1994). A hearing in the District Court took place on March 7, 1994. Plaintiffs argued that this provision, which was adopted through notice and comment procedures, violates the language of the Wild Bird Conservation Act of 1992. They sought relief to suspend or invalidate the following exception, contained in the final rule, to the prohibition on importation of birds listed in the Convention's appendices: ``This paragraph (b) does not apply to an exotic bird species listed in Appendix III to the Convention that originated in a country that has not listed the species in Appendix III'' (50 CFR 15.11(b)(2)). Plaintiffs argued that this provision violates the plain language of the Act, which bars the importation of ``any'' species listed in ``any'' appendix to the Convention.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On March 29, 1994 U. S. District Judge Louis F. Oberdorfer found the contested regulation to be invalid. (This Court Order was discussed in a Notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  published on May 24, 1994.) Therefore, the Service hereby proposes to amend 50 CFR 15.11 (b) and (c) to comply with the Court Order. The Service proposes that all bird species listed in CITES Appendix III, (in addition to those in Appendices I or II) wherever found, cannot be imported into the U.S. unless they are either accompanied by an import permit issued pursuant to subpart C of 50 CFR part 15, or they are included in an approved list. On March 17, 1994 the Service published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 12784) a proposed rule that would establish those approved lists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Effects of the Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Service has determined that this proposed rule is categorically excluded under Departmental procedures in complying with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). See DOI Departmental Manual, 516 DM 2, Appendix 1, &para; 1.10. The regulations are procedural in nature, and the environmental effects are judged to be minimal, speculative, and do not lend themselves to meaningful analysis. The permits and other administrative actions authorized under the WBCA and regulations will be subject to future NEPA documentation requirements, on a case-by-case basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=85 g=1 f=1 --> Executive Orders 12866, 12612, and 12630 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This proposed rule has been determined not to be significant for purposes of Executive Order 12866. This action would not be expected to have significant taking implications for U.S. citizens, as per Executive Order 12630. Any effects on small entities (importers, shippers, etc.) would likely be minor, and would in any event, be the mandatory result of the district court ruling. Future proposed rule making will establish procedures for listing of species approved for import, which may reduce any effects on small entities. No reporting requirements would be added to existing regulations. Therefore, this revision would not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities as described by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Since the proposed rule applies to importation of live exotic birds into the United States, it does not contain any Federalism impacts as described in Executive Order 12612. The Department has certified that this proposed rule meets the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> No new information collection requirement(s) are contained in this proposed rule for which OMB approval under 44 U.S.C. 3501 is necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

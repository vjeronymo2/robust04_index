			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Law Lords put Sunday trading in doubt LOCAL authorities were yesterday given the power to clamp down on shops that open on Sundays, after the Law Lords dismissed an appeal by B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, ending its five-year legal battle over Sunday trading laws in England and Wales. Opponents of Sunday opening urged councils to use their powers, but retailers already trading on Sundays vowed to continue. They said they would intensify pressure on the government to introduce new legislation to replace the 1950 Shops Act, widely seen as impractical and outdated. The Law Lords said that following a European Court judgment in December it was clear that European rules, which prohibited quantitative restrictions on trade between EC states, did not apply to national legislation prohibiting retailers from opening their premises on Sundays. B&amp;Q had argued that the ban on Sunday opening was incompatible with free-trade principles of the European Community. This argument was rejected by Mr Justice Hoffmann in a 1990 ruling. The DIY chain appealed to the Law Lords who referred the issue to the European Court for the second time since 1988. Giving judgment yesterday, Lord Goff said the European Court's second answer was so 'unequivocal' that B&amp;Q's appeal must fail. The Shopping Hours Reform Council, which is calling for partial deregulation of Sunday opening, said the ruling cleared the way for the government to bring forward its proposals for new legislation. 'Shoppers, shopworkers and shopkeepers will all raise three cheers if the government gets a move on,' the council said. Keep Sunday Special, the campaign group which supports only restricted Sunday opening, agreed on the need for reform. But Dr Michael Schluter, campaign director, said it was 'totally unacceptable for the multiples to flout existing Sunday trading law. Mr Bill Connor, deputy general secretary of Usdaw, the shopworkers' union, agreed there was 'no longer any excuse' for retailers to disobey the law. Dr Schluter added that an opportunity for reform already existed in the private member's bill introduced by Mr Ray Powell, Labour MP for Ogmore, due to begin its report stage on May 14. However, the bill, based broadly on the Keep Sunday Special's proposals, is unlikely to become law, and opponents say it is riddled with anomalies. Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, last week promised a draft bill to reform the Sunday trading laws would be published within the next few months, together with a paper about its impact. Among retailers, Mr George Robertson, Sainsbury's senior legal adviser, said the Lords' ruling would not affect its plans to open on Sundays. Sainsbury's is trying to persuade local authorities to use their powers under Section 48 of the Shops Act to make exemption orders allowing grocery shops to open between 10am and 4pm if a majority of local retailers is in favour. Tesco also pledged to continue opening, while Safeway said it had no intention of disappointing its shoppers. But Marks and Spencer and John Lewis Partnership said they would continue to uphold the law and not open on Sundays. Only a handful of councils, including Kirklees (which has been in dispute with Tesco), Norwich, Stoke, Torfaen and The Wrekin, have continued to enforce Sunday trading laws, but others, including Waverley, Horsham, Ashford, Kennet, Cambridge, and Wyre Forest, have indicated they would seek prosecutions or injunctions if the House of Lords upheld the European Court ruling. Opponents of Sunday shopping believe at least 20 others may follow suit.</p>

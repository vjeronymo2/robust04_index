			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava, April 12 (CTK) -- Slovak Deputy Premier  Brigita Schmognerova today in an address to parliament asked for  support from deputies and citizens for the tough measures her  government was going to pursue in order to make up for  ex-premier Meciar government's mistakes.    "The government has not taken over an easy heritage," said  Schmognerova at today's parliamentary debate on the government  programme.    She said that in addition to economic recession and the  breakup of the federation, the previous cabinets incompetence  and hindrance of reforms were to blame for the bad state of the  Slovak economy.    As a result, gross domestic product fell last year by 4.1  percent, industrial production by 13.5 percent and construction  work by 25 percent. Slovakia's foreign trade deficit was nearly  27 billion crowns, the state sector's debt reached 60 billion  crowns and prices grew by 23 percent. Fifty-seven percent of  all enterprises were loss-making.    "This government could have chosen the easier path of  preserving the present status quo without the unpleasant impact  of unpopular measures, whereby it would have achieved a good  pre-election position," said Schmognerova.    She stressed that reaching the government's stated goals --  approaching zero GDP growth, a 10-13 percent inflation rate,  unemployment below 17 percent and a budget deficit below four  percent -- would be very complicated and would require public  support.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Applicants have adequate facilities in place to ensure implementation of the methodology and procedures for calculating the net asset value and dividends and distributions among the various classes of shares and the proper allocation of expenses among such classes of shares, and this representation has been concurred with by the Export in the initial report referred to in condition 7 and will be concurred with by the Expert, or an appropriate substitute Expert, on an ongoing basis at least annually in the ongoing reports referred to in condition 7. Applicants will take immediate corrective measures if this representation is not concurred in by the Expert or appropriate substitute Expert.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 9. The prospectus of each Fund that offers multiple classes will contain a statement to the effect that a salesperson and any other person entitled to receive compensation for selling Fund shares may receive different compensation for selling one particular class of shares over another in a Fund.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 10. The Distributor will adopt compliance standards as to when a particular class of shares may appropriately be sold to particular investors. Applicants will require all persons selling shares of the Funds to agree to conform to such standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 11. The conditions pursuant to which the exemptive order is granted and the duties and responsibilities of the Trustees with respect to the Multiple Pricing System will be set forth in guidelines, which will be furnished to the Trustees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12. Each Fund will disclose the respective expenses, performance data, distribution arrangements, services, fees, sales loads, deferred sales loads, and exchange privileges applicable to each class of shares in its prospectus, regardless of whether all classes of shares are offered through the prospectus. The shareholder reports will disclose the respective expenses and performance data applicable to each class of shares. The shareholder reports will contain, in the statement of assets and liabilities and statement of operations, information related to each Fund as a whole generally and not on a per class basis. Each Fund's per share data, however, will be prepared on a per class basis with respect to all classes of shares of such Fund. To the extent any advertisement or sales literature describes the expenses or performance data applicable to a particular class of shares, it will also disclose the expenses and/or performance data applicable to all classes of shares offered by such Fund. The information provided by applicants for publication in any newspaper or similar listing of the Funds' net asset values and public offering prices will separately present each class of shares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 13. Applicants acknowledge that the grant of the exemptive order requested by the application will not imply Commission approval, authorization or acquiescence in any particular level of payments that the Funds may make pursuant to their rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plans in reliance on the exemptive order.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 14. Any class of shares with a conversion feature (``Purchase Class'') will convert into another class (``Target Class'') of shares on the basis of the relative net asset values of the two classes, without the imposition of any sales load, fee, or other charge. After conversion, the converted shares will be subject to an asset-based sales charge and/or service fee (as those terms are defined in Article III, Section 26 of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice), if any, that in the aggregate are lower than the asset-based sales charge and service fee to which they were subject prior to the conversion.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 15. If a Fund implements any amendment to a rule 12b&hyph;1 plan (or, if presented to shareholders, adopts or implements any amendment of a non-rule 12b&hyph;1 shareholder services plan) that would increase materially the amount that may be borne by the Target Class shares under the plan, Purchase Class shares will stop converting into Target Class shares unless shareholders of the Purchase Class, voting separately as a class, approve the amendment. The Trustees shall take such action as is necessary to ensure that existing Purchase Class shares are exchanged or converted into a new class of shares (``New Target Class''), identical in all material respects to the Target Class as it existed prior to implementation of the amendment, no later than the date such shares previously were scheduled to convert into Target Class shares. If deemed advisable by the Trustees to implement the foregoing, such action may include the exchange of all existing Purchase Class shares for a new class (``New Purchase Class''), identical to such existing Purchase Class shares in all material respects except that the New Purchase Class will convert into the New Target Class. The New Target Class and New Purchase Class may be formed without further exemptive relief. Exchanges or conversions described in this condition shall be effected in a manner that the Trustees reasonably believe will not be subject to federal taxation. In accordance with condition 3, any additional cost associated with the creation, exchange, or conversion of the New Target Class or New Purchase Class shall be borne solely by the Adviser and the Distributor. Purchase Class shares sold after the implementation of the proposal may convert into Target Class shares subject to the higher maximum payment, provided that the material features of the Target Class plan and the relationship of such plan to the Purchase Class are disclosed in an effective registration statement.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 16. Applicants will comply with the provisions of proposed rule 6c&hyph;10 under the Act, as such rule is currently proposed, and as it may be reproposed, adopted, or amended.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Margaret H.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Carmen Parra report: "Government Puts Through Labor Reform </F> With Support of Only 52 Percent of House"]    [Excerpt] Madrid -- The labor reform was approved  yesterday at the Congress [of Deputies] plenary session with the  votes of the Socialist Party and the Catalan and Basque  nationalists. In short, it has the actual support of 52 percent  of the house, a support different from the voting which took  place a week before the 27 January general strike -- against  that reform -- when 90 percent of the deputies rejected the  amendments proposed to the bill as a whole by United  Left-Initiative for Catalonia and the Canary Islands Coalition.  The leading opposition group -- the People's Party -- abstained  in the voting on the urgent job promotion measures bill,  creating apprenticeship contracts, and supported only a part of  the reform of the Workers' Statute.    The alliances for approving the new trade union election  regulations were different. Here the PSOE [Spanish Socialist  Workers Party] had to rely basically on the votes of United Left  and the Canary Islands Coalition, in view of the all-out  opposition of Convergence and Union [CiU] and the People's Party  to the text agreed on by the government and the main trade  unions, the Workers Commissions and the UGT [General Workers  Union] -- the only agreement that they have reached in the past  four years.    The reform of the Workers' Statute and, within it, the new  regulation of collective bargaining and dismissal had the  support of the PSOE, CiU, and, in part, the PNV [Basque  Nationalist Party]. The People's Party asked for the voting on  the articles to be broken down, and also supported one part of  the bill and abstained on another.    With the Socialist Party's support, CiU managed to get it  deemed not a fraud in law to dismiss in successive three-month  periods a number of workers below the threshold set by the bill  -- 10 percent of staff -- if the causes cited are different in  each 90-day period. In addition, dismissals affecting the  entire staff of enterprises with five workers or less will not  be deemed mass dismissals.    For its part, the urgent employment promotion measures bill  was finally approved following the setback which it suffered 10  March at the so-called scandalous plenary session, at which the  People's Party reported irregularities in the voting. The bill  was sent from the lower house to the Senate with 177 "yes" votes  (the PSOE, CiU, and the PNV), 24 "no" votes (United Left, the  Canary Islands Coalition, and the Republican Left), and 134  abstentions (the People's Party).

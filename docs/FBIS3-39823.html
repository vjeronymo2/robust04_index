Mr. Mandela also said he was  convinced there would be free and fair political campaigning  throughout South Africa. He was speaking in Amsterdam at the  conclusion of his visit to the Netherlands.    [Begin recording] [correspondent Cliff Saunders] This Mr.  Mandela and Mr. Carl Niehaus emphasized -- that every effort  would be made to ensure that democratic, free, and fair  elections were indeed held in South Africa. Disruption and  intimidation would not be tolerated.    [Niehaus] Every citizen of this country must have the  freedom  to participate in these elections, and we will convey that  message very loud and clear through our negotiations with all  the different parties.    [Saunders] Asked about the competence of the peacekeeping  force, Mr. Mandela expressed full confidence in the abilities of  General Ramushwana to handle the problems presented by different  ethnic groups coming together.    [Mandela] The problems -- the teething problems -- that have  manifested themselves -- I think he has handled them with great  confidence.    [Saunders] Mr. Mandela said he intended visiting Israel once  a settlement had been achieved there, and he referred to the  meeting he had with Mr. Yasir 'Arafat in the Netherlands  yesterday.    [Mandela] We have similar standpoints and similar aims. Both  of us are freedom fighters. Both of us believe in the peaceful  resolution of mutual problems, and I came here also to inform  him of what efforts we are doing in our country and the progress  that has been made.

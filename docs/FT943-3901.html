			<p>940912 FT  12 SEP 94 / Arts (Openings): Geneva Hugues Gall's final season as director of the Grand Theatre opens tonight with a new production of Mozart's 'Idomeneo', staged by Christopher Alden and conducted by Armin Jordan. Gall's enlightened policies have enhanced Geneva's operatic reputation over the past 14 years. He now faces a much bigger challenge as he prepares to move to the Paris Opera, where the Chung affair has given him a taste of battles to come.</p>

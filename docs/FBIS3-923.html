The homeland's interim  administration had "requested Mr Mangope to stay at his  residence in Motswedi for his own safety", Lynette Lavender,  first secretary of the South African Embassy told SAPA.    Meanwhile, about 7,000 striking civil servants attended a  meeting at the Mmabatho Civic Centre, where a workers' committee  members urged them to return to work "in hours and not days".    He said the work stoppage had achieved a number of its goals  such as the reincorporation of Bophuthatswana into South Africa  and free political activity now being allowed in the former  homeland.    Donwntown Mafikeng was chock-a-block with cars, buses and  taxis clogging all the main streets and throngs of people were  seen on the pavements. "Town is the busiest I've ever seen it,"  a businessman said. Although many of the shops were still bare  as a result of looting last week, banks were doing a brisk trade  and those with goods to sell were packed with people.</p>

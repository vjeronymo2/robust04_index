			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["News analysis" by Li Hubing] </F>   [Text] Brussels, January 12 (XINHUA) -- America's European  allies are happy with the results of the recently concluded NATO  summit. Manfred Woerner, NATO's secretary general, described  the meeting as "historical and a big step forward toward the  next century."    U.S. President Bill Clinton's current visit to Europe, his  first since taking office, has attracted as much public  attention as the summit itself.    The reason may be that people are eager to know: what  changes will occur in the transatlantic security alliance now  that the Cold War has ended?    The statements made by Clinton in Brussels demonstrate that  the U.S.-European relationship remains generally harmonious.  They share common views on many important issues concerning  NATO's future and Europe's new security arrangements.    During the summit, the 16 NATO leaders agreed that the  Western military alliance remains at the center of European  security.    They endorsed the concept of building multinational task  forces involving NATO and non-NATO nations -- the common joint  task forces (CJTF) -- intended to make NATO more flexible in  dealing with regional conflicts both inside and outside Europe.    Within this framework, NATO will provide military resources  to European allies, if necessary.    The leaders also adopted proposals for establishing  partnerships with former Warsaw pact countries.    Some former Warsaw Pact countries such as Poland, Hungary,  the Czech Republic and Slovakia, are eager to join NATO. But  the proposal adopted, known as the "partnership for peace" plan,  falls short of offering these countries either a timetable for  membership or security guarantees. The NATO leaders instead  have characterized NATO expansion as "an evolutionary process."    The summit was, however, dominated by a more urgent issue --  the war in Bosnia.    The leaders reaffirmed that NATO is ready to carry out air  strikes in parts of Bosnia to break the Serb strangulation of  Sarajevo if the United Nations requests such action.    They believe that if NATO continues to do nothing in Bosnia,  its credibility would be seriously damaged.    In any case, the summit was a great success for the alliance  and the consensus reached on almost all issues demonstrates  transatlantic unity.    However, it must also be noted that the summit reflects a  change in this relationship, having to do with reshaping  European defence burdens in the post-Cold War period. In this  prospect, the European allies will have to assume a greater  burden.    It is clear that the "partnership for peace" plan and the  concept of establishing the CJTF, which indeed will usher in "a  new period" for NATO, also means that the United States will do  less for European defense and security, and Europe will have to  rely largely on itself.    Regardless of any commitments on Clinton's part, the  Europeans know very well that the U.S. will not treat issues of  European security the same it did during the Cold War.    The U.S. will not easily allow its 100,000 troops deployed  in  Europe to become involved in European conflicts. In the  Yugoslav crisis, for example, the U.S. has argued that the  conflict there is "a European problem."    It may be assumed that if the same conflict erupted during  the Cold War years, the U.S. would not have remained a bystander.    With the end of the Cold War, NATO is entering a new era,  and  it is impossible for the transatlantic relationship to remain  unchanged. Both the U.S. and its European allies are well aware  of this, but are reluctant to point it out.</p>

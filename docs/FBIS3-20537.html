An Interview With the Well-Known  Economist Wu Xiang"]    [Text] Abstract: The sluggish increase in farm  incomes is the key to our rural problems, one which affects  development of the national economy. Why is this happening? The  cause lies in our inability so far to understand, either in  theory or in practice, that increases in farm income and labor  force transfers are key points of agricultural problems, rural  problems, and farmers' problems. The obstacle to understanding  comes from the thinking and concepts produced under the planned  economic system, expressed chiefly in the attitude toward the  development of township enterprises. In addition, some people  are expressing the view that transfer of the rural labor force  will affect agriculture's stable development. However, many  years' experience with reform proves that the development of  enterprises is of considerable benefit to the stable development  of agriculture; therefore, bringing up the prerequisite that  "without agriculture there is no stability" should now be  "without industry there is no stability in agriculture." How to  resolve rural problems, agricultural problems, and farmers'  problems, while carrying out further rural reform? Renewed  concepts and changed ideas are the preconditions for resolving  rural problems, while at the same time unifying understanding  from upper leadership to localities, ensuring that the general  goal of the next step in rural reform is to increase farmers'  income and implement transfer of the rural labor force. With  this objective, we must widen our sights in developing  agriculture, paying attention not just to agriculture itself,  but rather stressing the simultaneous development of  agriculture, township enterprises, and small towns. There must  be total support for and development of private enterprises,  individually owned enterprises, and the joint-stock system. We  must establish and perfect the various key markets. Looking at  the goal of achieving a comfortable standard of living in the  1990s, the next six years presents a rather heavy assignment, so  it is urgent that we promptly establish appropriate objectives  and missions for further rural reform, as well as formulate  supportive policies.    This reporter had been planning for quite some time to  interview the economist Wu Xiang [0702 6272], who had  participated in the work of formulating the primary policies for  rural reform. When the figure of an average increase of 2  percent for farmers was announced, it gave me the impetus to  turn this plan into reality.  <H3>  Sluggish growth in farmers' incomes is the key rural problem  and the key factor affecting the domestic economy. </H3>   Agriculture is in good shape at present, if we are looking  at  the supply situation for agricultural products and by-products  in urban and rural markets. However, if we go deep into the  countryside, we will find that there are many problems there and  with agriculture--the comparative benefits of farming have  declined, with low enthusiasm and heavy burdens. Such phenomena  as irregular circulation channels, "sales difficulties" and  "payment in IOUs" appear frequently. Sixty percent of the  counties exist on financial subsidy from the central government,  some not affording salary payments. Relations are tense between  cadres and the masses. Wu Xiang stated that these problems were  closely related, but the key point was the sluggish growth in  farmers' income.    In his opening remarks, and without prior consultation, Wu  Xiang agreed with the topic of my interview. He said that the  growth in farmers' incomes was not only related to the  development of the countryside, but also directly affected the  development of the national economy. Foreign media have  commented recently that the economic power of the developing  areas along China's coast, such as Guangdong, has been quite  close to that of the four Asian dragons, with the difference  that behind the coastal areas, there is a rural market of nearly  800 million population. Also, based on national investigation  documents: at present, 50 percent of farm families can sustain a  livelihood only through what they produce on the farm, with a  zero commercial rate; 35 percent of the farmers are able to  market less than 30 percent of their total agricultural produce,  just maintaining simple reproduction; only 15 percent of farmers  have a commercial rate higher than 30 percent. Wu Xiang said  that this document shows that the majority of China's farming  families can only maintain simple reproduction, carrying out  exchange of produce on a small scale and allocation and  consumption within their families. The extensive countryside  that foreign nations call "precious land" is actually just a  piece of virgin land. We must understand clearly the farmers'  level of prosperity, and make correct evaluations in order to  establish better policies.  <H3>  Transferring the surplus labor force is the key to  increasing farmers' income. </H3>   [NONGMIN RIBAO] According to your meaning, the goal of  further reform in the countryside is to increase farmers'  income. On this point, the central government has all along made  many policies; but why have there been no substantial gains?    [Wu Xiang] That is so. After the masses of farmers had  resolved the problem of having sufficient food and clothing,  they went after currency instead of agricultural products. But  the real result was that increasing production did not increase  income. The average annual income gain of Chinese farmers from  1989 to 1991 was only 0.7 percent, lower than the average rate  before rural reforms were implemented. To increase farmers'  income, the state has repeatedly raised grain prices, but the  fact is, while the cost of agriculture has accelerated growth,  the profits from price rises in the end have not gone to the  farmers. On the other hand, prices of most agricultural products  have opened up, some of them approaching the international  market. Once China is officially back in GATT, the prices in the  international market will be close to the maximum price of  agricultural products in the domestic market..., there is plenty  of evidence that there is only a slight possibility of raising  farmers' incomes through large scale hikes in the price of  agricultural products. Therefore, to increase farmers' income we  should look for ways which lie outside agriculture, and these  ways are: adjust the industrial structure, vigorously developing  secondary and tertiary industry, transfer the surplus rural  labor force, and then gradually enlarging the operational scale  of agriculture.    There is a mutual cause and effect relationship between  growth in farm income and transfer of the surplus labor force:  these are two aspects of the same problem, the key to ongoing  rural reform and development. The more fully we understand this  problem, the better its resolution, and we can establish good  circulation within a shorter time. Otherwise, not only  agriculture, but the rural economy and even the entire nation's  economic development will suffer serious disruption, making the  realization of a well-off living standard and the four  modernizations just empty talk. Moreover, various contradictions  which affect stability and unity will be more intense, and if  they pile up, there will be danger of an explosion. This is  absolutely not an exaggeration just to scare people. At present,  in China's rural areas there is a surplus labor force of as much  120 million people, and it is estimated that this will reach 200  million people by the end of this century. They are desperate to  leave their hometowns and lands to seek higher incomes, but our  lack of definite knowledge concerning this aspect has led to, on  the one hand, the "tide of flowing workers" becoming stronger  every year, and bringing massive social problems with it. On the  other hand, the majority of farmers must remain in the  countryside against their will, and keep on planting. This often  creates misconceptions, hiding the seriousness of the problem;  indeed, this is exactly where the danger lies. It is high time  that we give a great deal of attention to this problem and deal  with it.  <H3>  The labor force transfer problem is unclear, regardless of  whether it is in our understanding or in practice. </H3>   [NONGMIN RIBAO] The calls for transfer of the labor force  and  conversion of the industrial structure are not weak; to what do  you want us to pay greater attention?    [Wu Xiang] Since the 14th Party Congress of the CPC fixed  the socialist market economy as our target model of reform, the  voices calling for us to pay attention to the problem of  farmers' income growth have become stronger. The central  government and the State Council have issued repeated  injunctions to reduce farmers' burden and increase investment in  agriculture. This session of the central government's conference  on rural work again stressed the problems of agriculture, the  countryside, and farmers. Therefore, resolution of the problems  is getting closer. But one point that has not been clarified and  resolved completely is that farmers' income growth and transfer  of the rural labor force are the keys for agriculture, the  countryside, and farmers; therefore, it is really impossible to  resolve the problem through agricultural slogans.    [NONGMIN RIBAO] What do you think is blocking people's  understanding of the problem?    [Wu Xiang] Generally speaking, concepts and ideas produced  under the planned economy system still exercise a malign  influence, the only difference being that it pops up in  different forms at different times.    From the first organization of cooperatives to just before  rural reform, millions of farmers contributed firsthand an  accumulation of 600 billion to 800 billion yuan, but they were  unable to share in the civilization and development brought on  by industrial development. Under the dual urban-rural structure  established in this way, farmers have no freedom to move and  select their jobs, and even the children of farmers are bound to  the land with their parents, bringing on a situation whereby 800  million farmers, engaged in making the food we eat, do not have  enough to eat or wear themselves. This remains fresh in our  minds. We must take serious reference from this historical fact.  Fundamentally, the key point in China's reform is to break the  dual structure which separates urban and rural, and transfer  large batches of the surplus rural labor force from agricultural  production. But in practice, there are still some leading cadres  who just do not understand this.    In 1985, there was a several tens of billion jin drop in  grain production, followed by three years of rising and falling.  Cities and some leading departments reacted strongly to this;  they thought that the problems stemmed from agricultural, even  rural, policies; some people even argued that these ups and  downs in grain production was actually following the ups and  downs in policies.    But farmers had a totally different reaction, because the  drop of grain production was compensated for by the rapid  development of township enterprises, so farmers' incomes still  showed some increase. What is more important, millions of  farmers found new hope in the development of township  enterprises. China's farmers have surmounted massive obstacles  by their surprising indomitability and will, they have supported  development of township enterprises, and have been called "an  abruptly emerging new force," but some comrades are still  suspicious of township enterprises, even looking down upon them  or speaking accusingly of them.    In fact, the bulk of farmers' income growth has come from  township enterprises, this has been proven by practice: "without  industry, there is no prosperity." But people who hold the old  concepts of the planned economy system can't see the positive  aspects of developing township enterprises, and of course they  find it impossible to put the emphasis in developing the  countryside and the rural economy on developing township  enterprises, transferring the labor force, and increasing  farmers' income.  <H3>  The prerequisite of no stability without agriculture is "no  agricultural stability without industry." </H3>   [NONGMIN RIBAO] Quite a few people think that so much  emphasis on farmers' income growth and transfer of the rural  labor force will affect grain production's lasting and stable  growth. What is your thinking on this?    [Wu Xiang] My answer is don't worry. Everyone knows that the  problem of feeding over 1.1 billion people is a huge task, one  that cannot be sluggish at any time. If there should be any  trouble in grain production, no one can help us. The problem is  how to guarantee the continuous and stable development of  agriculture and grain production. Practice has proven that  producing grain solely with grain production in mind, or farming  solely with farming in mind, will just lead us down a narrow  path, and this doesn't work, especially under market economic  conditions. When there were major problems with township  enterprises, there were some people accusing it of being the  evil root of the rise and fall in grain production, their reason  being that the best labor in the countryside all moved to  industry to make money. In fact, there is no evidence for this  talk. In some developed coastal regions, with cuts in the amount  of land for grain, total grain production dropped, but there was  a rise in the per mu average production, not a decline.  Furthermore, there was a dramatic rise in agricultural  productive value. In the Wenzhou area, among more than six  million people, the average land owned was just over four fen.  This is even less than in southern Jiangsu and the Pearl River  Delta. Despite the vigorous development of family industry and  township enterprises, the agricultural productive value still  rose continuously, both the average production per mu and total  production. The three years of rising and falling grain  production which began in 1985 involved complex, multifaceted  problems which require detailed analysis. I won't talk about  that here. But it is certain that the fundamental root of  China's poverty and backwardness is that we have 900 million  farmers engaging in producing food grains. Wherever there are  fewer farmers directly engaged in the food grains business,  where the labor force has transferred, and township enterprises  are developed, then farmers' income have increased, and there  has been hope for agricultural modernization. So, I believe the  prerequisite of "no stability without agriculture" should be "no  agricultural stability without industry."    If we really want to guarantee the continuous and stable  development of agriculture and grain production, and not just  talk about it, we must "play the pipe backwards"; that is, first  to pay attention to developing agriculture, developing township  enterprises, transferring the surplus labor force, adjusting the  industrial structure, and gradually enlarging the operational  scale of agriculture.  <H5>  What should the future course be? </H5>   [NONGMIN RIBAO] In your opinion, how should we be dealing  with the current problems in the countryside, in agriculture,  and with farmers. And how to get started?    [Wu Xiang] Based on the facts mentioned above, I suggest  such countermeasures as:    1) While emphasizing that the problems of agriculture, the  rural areas, and farmers are relevant to the fundamental  problems of the entire situation of the party and the state, we  should be emphatic that farmers' income growth and transfer of  the rural labor force is the key to these problems; it should be  taken as the starting point of all rural policies, and be put in  the forefront of all rural work. Leading organs and cadres at  all levels should take this as their guiding thought. There  should also be education in this for all rural cadres, for  renewed concepts and changed ideas are prerequisite to resolving  these problems.    2) To guarantee continuous and stable growth in agriculture  and grain production, we should discontinue the old way of  farming just with farming in mind, and producing grain with just  grain production in mind. We must gradually reduce and even stop  the administrative interference of planned economics, taking new  measures appropriate to the laws of economics, to protect grain  planting families from loss, and insure that grain-selling  regions make profits. Implement an agricultural development  policy of high production, excellent quality, and high  efficiency. I believe that putting excellent quality ahead of  high production is more scientific in many respects.    3) Enlarge our vision of agricultural development: we should  go from the small scale of 1.5 billion mu of cultivated land to  the large scale of 9.65 million square kilometers. Vigorously  develop agriculture, carry out construction in mountainous  areas, engage in the breeding business and the processing of  agricultural products and by-products; in this way a certain  amount of the labor force will be absorbed in local areas.  Providing work as a form of relief and constructing roads in the  near future can not only add job opportunities but also create  the conditions for selling agricultural products and  by-products. We should extend the concept of capital  construction on farmland to capital construction in agriculture,  making for continuous improvement in the rural infrastructure.    4) The vigorous development of township enterprises and  small  towns is the major channel for increasing farmers' income and  transferring the rural labor force. The eastern region should  pay more attention to developing export-oriented enterprises,  improving their technical level, striving for high level, big  scale, and excellent quality. The central and western regions  absolutely must not stop developing because of their poor  foundation and past lack of success; rather, they should  organize cooperative projects between the eastern and western  regions which are based on local situations, attracting capital  and technology, developing competitive products, converting  their resources advantage into a merchandizing advantage. Small  towns are the seat of secondary and tertiary industry, and it  just won't do to not develop small towns, especially when it  comes to developing service industries. Counties are the link  between urban and rural, models for small town development  throughout the whole county. Doing a good job of comprhensive  reform and county construction at the county level is of extreme  importance in developing the rural economy.    5) There must be deeper reform, and accelerated market  development. Without a pluralistic market entity, there will be  no market economy. Therefore, we should encourage simultaneous  development of the State owned, collective, privately owned, and  individual economies. Defining the property rights for  individual and privately owned operations, powerful competition,  and substantial efficiency wil have an outstanding effect in  absorbing surplus labor. We should develop these with complete  confidence. The joint-stock system is just unfolding in the  countryside, we should give full support to promoting its  further healthy development, maximizing its role of allocating  social resources. As for developing the commercial market, we  should establish markets for the various key factors, especially  the labor force market and financial market, develop various  intermediary organizations, cooperative organizations, and  scientific and technical service organizations, linking the  markets and the farmers. This will contribute to improving  farmers' income.    Calculating by what is needed to accomplish the goal of  being  well off, the annual rate of increase in farmers' income should  be 5 percent in the 1990s, but due to deficits in the first four  years of the decade, it will be harder in the next six years.  Therefore, we should not miss the opportunity to establish  correct targets and missions for further rural reforms.  Moreover, it is urgent that we adopt take appropriate  corresponding policies, for we absolutely cannot lower our guard.</p>

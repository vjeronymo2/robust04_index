			<p>940312 FT  12 MAR 94 / Liberal Democrat spring policy conference opens The 1,300 delegates at the Liberal Democrat spring policy conference will debate a range of initiatives designed to set the stage for the parliamentary, local and European elections in the next three months, Kevin Brown writes. Debates on issues such as the inner cities, homelessness, social policy and prostitution are intended to sharpen the party's urban image for a battle with the Tories for inner-city and European seats. Party leaders acknowledge that the test will be the Eastleigh by-election caused by the death of Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP. The party believes it can win the seat, which would guarantee a high profile in the European elections in June. But Liberal Democrat strategists believe that the government may hold the by-election as early as mid-April in an effort to catch the opposition parties off guard.</p>

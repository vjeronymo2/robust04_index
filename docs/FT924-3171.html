			<p>921209 FT  09 DEC 92 / Video sales help Carlton rise 15% CARLTON Communications, the television and film services company, yesterday announced a 15 per cent profits increase helped by strong sales of video cassettes, especially in the US. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 88.3m to Pounds 102.3m in the year to September 30. Mr Michael Green, chairman, described the performance as 'good progress in a tough year'. The results were in line with stock market expectations, although the shares slipped 2p to 717p on light profit-taking. Analysts expect Carlton, which takes over the London weekday TV franchise from Thames on January 1, to make profits of about Pounds 128m this year. Video and audio production and distribution lifted profits 49.8 per cent to Pounds 46.6m. Video cassette production for customers such as Walt Disney and Warner grew strongly in line with the US 'sell through' market. Pickwick, the European video and budget music distributor acquired in February, contributed Pounds 1m of operating profit on Pounds 42m of sales, although this did not include the busy Christmas season. The television and film services division was affected by high average US dollar exchange rates at its Technicolor film processing subsidiary. Profits fell from Pounds 28.4m to Pounds 25.1m. Video and sound products, which includes specialist production equipment sales to the TV industry, continued to recover and increased profits 39 per cent to Pounds 19.4m. Carlton's net cash balance declined from Pounds 162.6m to Pounds 108.5m due to increased working capital needs and investments. Net interest earnings fell from Pounds 17.9m to Pounds 10.5m. Profits from associates, mainly a 20 per cent stake in Central independent TV, increased from Pounds 2.8m to Pounds 6.69m. Operating costs of Pounds 12.7m incurred by Carlton TV were deferred until the station begins broadcasting. Group turnover excluding associates increased 18 per cent to Pounds 635.2m. At the interim stage, turnover was 13 per cent higher at Pounds 324.7m while pre-tax profits grew 7 per cent to Pounds 49.4m. Earnings per share increased 15.5 per cent to 34.2p. A final dividend of 10.3p is proposed to raise the total for the year by 10 per cent to 17p. Lex, Page 18</p>

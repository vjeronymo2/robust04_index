			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> KRAFT TRIAL PENALTY PHASE TO BEGIN JUNE 5, WILL COVER 8 MORE KILLINGS  </P> <P> The jurors who found Randy Steven Kraft guilty of murdering 16 young men in  Orange County were ordered Tuesday to return June 5 for a death penalty  hearing, where the prosecution will present evidence of eight more murders.  </P> <P> However, on May 24 Kraft's lawyers will raise a series of issues with Superior  Court Judge Donald A. McCartin out of the jury's presence. Chief among them  will be a renewed attempt to prevent the prosecution from showing jurors any  more entries from a list found in Kraft's car. Prosecutors claim it is a "death  list" that Kraft wrote to keep track of how many people he had killed.  </P> <P> Kraft, 44, of Long Beach, was convicted Friday of the 16 murders. Most of the  victims, between the ages of 18 and 25, were mutilated or sexually abused, and  dumped along or near freeways. Prosecutors claim they have linked Kraft to 45  murders altogether in what could be the worst serial murder case in the  nation's history.  </P> <P> After Kraft's conviction for all 16 murders, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown  decided to narrow the number he would introduce at the penalty phase of the  trial to eight. Six of those occurred in Oregon and two in Michigan.  </P> <P> The defense lawyers complained in the Santa Ana courtroom Tuesday that Brown  owes them a better explanation of what evidence he will present next month.  Brown responded that his case should be obvious to them, and that the list  would be the primary evidence.  </P> <P> "It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out," he said.  </P> <P> The Oregon entries on the Kraft list are all written in a row: "Portland ECK,"  "Portland Denver," "Portland Blood," "Portland Hawaii," "Portland Reserve" and  "Portland Head." The entry that Brown claims represents two Michigan victims is  "GR 2," written immediately below the Oregon entries. The two young men were  last seen alive attending a horticulture convention at the same hotel where  Kraft was staying in Grand Rapids, Mich., in December, 1982.  </P> <P> One of the young men found dead in Oregon was from the Denver, Colo., area, and  another was from Hawaii. A third was in the National Guard reserves. Brown  claims that a fourth victim had lost an enormous amount of blood, to explain  the "Portland Blood" entry. While the other two entries have not been  explained, Brown claims that they must represent the other two victims because  the six entries match the number of unsolved murders in that state attributed  to the same serial killer.  </P> <P> Another issue the defense intends to bring up is the media attention given the  trial after last Friday's guilty verdicts. Kraft lawyer William J. Kopeny said  he was "shocked" at all the publicity, and added: "There is a grave danger that  this jury has been prejudiced by the publicity."  </P> <P> The judge did note that one juror sent a message to the court stating she had  inadvertently seen a headline on the Kraft case in a newspaper Tuesday morning,  but did not read the article. The judge admonished the jurors again not to read  or listen to anything about the case until after the trial is over.  </P> <P> The judge asked the defense lawyers for an estimate of how much time they  expect to take putting on their case in the penalty phase. But they told him it  would be next week before they could say with any certainty. Prosecutor Brown  told the court he expects to take about 2 weeks to put on the evidence of the  Oregon and Michigan murders.  </P> <P> The judge met with the defense lawyers in chambers -- much to Brown's surprise  -- to discuss any scheduling problems they might have during the trial. When  they came out, the judge said he might permit a 2-week interruption during the  penalty phase to accommodate the Kraft lawyers in scheduling witnesses.  </P></p>

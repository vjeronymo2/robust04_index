Could you make a general assessment?    [Aliyev] My visit to Turkey aims at further developing the  ties between Azerbaijan and Turkey, both on the level of states  and peoples. Moved by this consideration, I accepted the  invitation of the honorable President of Turkey Suleyman  Demirel, who is our dear friend and brother, and came to Turkey.  We held talks to solve these issues at the state level and to  work out concrete measures. We held very fruitful and important  talks, as a result of which we signed almost 16 agreements and  protocols. Each of them is of the utmost importance and signals  the direction of the future development of relations between the  Turkish and Azerbaijani states.    [Advan] An agreement on friendship and the development of  multifaceted cooperation was also signed between Turkey and  Azerbaijan yesterday. It includes an interesting article, which  stresses that if either of the two contracting parties comes  under any attack the other country will take the necessary  measures against the aggressor. Do you think that this article  will elicit a reaction from Russia?    [Aliyev] If we have indeed attached our signature to such an  article then we must remain true to that article.    [Advan] Could we now consider the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline  as  a done deal? What measures were envisaged in this regard?    [Aliyev] I issued a presidential instruction whereby I  ordered the Azerbaijani Oil Company to conduct talks and  finalize contracts with Western companies. Now, these talks  will be held. It could be that at these talks the sides might  agree or disagree with certain issues. This is only natural.  Once these contracts are finalized, the oil pipeline issue will  also be resolved. I do not doubt that the oil pipeline will  pass through Turkey.</p>

			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / The Barlow Clowes Trial: A baptism by fire for the novice investment investigators - Richard Waters on whether regulators can stop such crimes in the future MR JEREMY ORME, a towering accountant with a cadaverous pallor, is in the front line of the UK's fight against investment fraud. A seasoned investigator with the penetrating eye and clipped delivery of his calling, he is moved to biblical references. 'Wickedness is like the green bay tree in the bible,' he says. 'Cut it down and it will grow up again.' Mr Orme is head of enforcement at the Securities and Investments Board, the main investment watchdog. For him and the team of investigators he heads, wickedness is tangible - the fraud and theft which deprives investors in some cases of their life savings. None of them is prepared to say that another Barlow Clowes will not happen. 'The moment we think we have done enough, we can be sure we will not have done,' says Mr Orme. Mr Jim Gaskin, head of enforcement for Fimbra, the regulatory body for independent financial advisers, agrees. 'If I said it couldn't happen again, it would be a hostage to fortune, and of course it would then happen tomorrow,' he says. Yet both argue that the UK's system of investment regulation is far better than it was. Closing Barlow Clowes was, in fact, one of the first successes of the regime introduced under the 1986 Financial Services Act (FSA). After years of dilatory action by the Department of Trade and Industry, SIB moved to close Barlow Clowes in 1988 just days after it took on its full powers under the act. Before the act, investment regulation was administered by the DTI under the Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act. After it, a raft of new regulatory bodies, led by SIB, was set up, each with its own team of investigators. The teams are patched together with accountants, lawyers and assorted experienced investigators from outside the investment world. The Department of Trade and Industry no longer directly regulates the investment industry. However, it too is taking its responsibilities under the Companies Acts far more seriously after the bad publicity generated by Barlow Clowes and other cases of the mid 1980s. Its investigations division now employs 195, marking a 'significant increase in the past two years'. Mr Gaskin at Fimbra points to some of the lessons that have been learnt in the short time the act has been in force. Inspection visits on investment firms are now targeted at those considered to carry the highest risk of fraud: those with a single controlling director, for instance, or those audited by a single accountant rather than a partnership. External signs, such as the late filing of accounts or even the changing of an accounting date, are monitored as signs of possible problems. 'They are much more focused visits now,' he says. 'There's a much better assessment of where the risks are.' Yet at least four weak links remain in the regulatory system. Each makes it easier for investment frauds to be perpetrated, or delays the time it takes for frauds to come to light. The first is the role played by auditors in the regulatory system. Along with an investment company's own board of directors, they are central to the prevention of fraud. According to Mr Orme: 'It would be a grotesque waste of national resource to think that corporate governance and auditing can count for nothing, and that the specialist regulator has to start again.' Faced with public concern that it was not doing more to fight fraud, the auditing profession spent years arguing that the public misunderstood the role of auditors before accepting that their role needed to be expanded. 'It was very regrettable that the accountancy profession has taken so long,' says Mr Orme, himself a former senior partner of Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm. He said he was disappointed that it had not been quicker in its response to public concern. Mr Bill Morrison, chairman of the Auditing Practices Board, accepted that accountants may have been slow to act before, but said substantial changes were being proposed to meet public concerns. 'The question now is whether we are being too ambitious in what we are trying to achieve,' he said. The second weak link is the unwillingness of professionals in the City to 'blow the whistle' when they suspect fraud. 'There needs to be a general awakening about whistle-blowing,' says Mr Orme. Investment failures are invariably followed by comments from City professionals that they suspected something all along, he says. In spite of constant pleas from the regulators and the Serious Fraud Office for greater help, the general attitude in the City seems not to have changed. The third weak link has been the people on whom the job of supervising the investment world has fallen, though substantial headway has been made in raising the quality of investigators in recent years. Low salaries are one explanation; lack of experience another. At the outset of the FSA regime, says Mr Gaskin, 'there were lots of people around with auditing experience, but auditors are not responsible for detecting fraud. We are - and we're getting better at it'. The fourth problem has been the sheer number of investigatory bodies in the City, each with overlapping interests. The political in-fighting and jealousies this has created have at times spilled over into bad feeling between regulators, though none has been bad-mannered enough to express it publicly. Co-ordination between the regulators has improved as they have learned to live with each other: but as the collapse of Bank of Credit and Commerce International proved, 'colleges' of regulators all sharing responsibility for a financial firm can fail dismally. Ms Marjorie Mowlem, Labour's voice on City affairs, said that a Labour government would 'streamline the regulatory system to prevent financial advisers choosing the weak link in the web of regulatory institutions'. The best defence probably rests with investors. Mr Gaskin says it is 'the old, old story: if it looks too good to be true, it probably is.'</p>

			<p><P> November 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STORY OF COMPTON SCHOOLTEACHERS  </P> <P> It was interesting to read your article titled "Inner-City Teachers: Well, It  Isn't the Paycheck." (Times, Nov. 5). It was a positive piece reflecting the  dedication of teachers in the Compton Unified School District. I am proud of  those teachers and they deserve to be commended.  </P> <P> My rhetorical question is why did the title say "Inner-City" teachers, as  opposed to "Compton" teachers? If it had been a negative article, you can bet  that it would have used the word Compton. In any event, I am on my way to  personally compliment the Compton teachers you cited for their commitment to  their profession.  </P> <P> KELVIN D.

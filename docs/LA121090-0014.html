			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO  </P> <P> Similar robberies at two gas stations may be the work of a serial robber,  officials said.  </P> <P> The first incident, at an Arco station in the 3300 block of El Cajon Blvd.,  occurred at 9:10 p.m. Saturday, when a robber jumped over the counter, shot the  clerk in the leg with a handgun, took cash from the register and fled on foot.  </P> <P> About an hour later, authorities said, possibly the same man entered another  Arco station in the 8800 block of Clairemont Mesa Blvd. He, too, jumped over  the counter, shot the clerk in the leg, raided the register and fled.  </P> <P> After consulting with some detectives in the robbery division who are  investigating the two incidents, Sgt. Chuck Peck said, "They may be related and  may be the start of a new series of robberies."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Cuanza Norte Province continues to be the scene  of fierce fighting and Eduardo dos Santos' men continue to  suffer irreparable defeats. In a vain attempt to fulfill their  dream of occupying the city of N'dalatando, the Luanda war  chieftains chose to reinforce their forces with more mercenaries  along the Dondo-N'dalatando axis. Fighting intensified when the  forces of the Luanda regime tried to move in the direction of  the coveted city of N'dalatando and it was especially fierce in  the area of the bridge over Lucala II River, where the People's  Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FAPLA] left 63  soldiers confirmed killed on the ground. Our forces also  captured two (?VHS) two-way radios, 44 AK-47 weapons, one rocket  launcher, and countless rounds of ammunition.    The Voice of Resistance of the Black Cockerel correspondent  in the area reports the fighting occurred in a very closed area,  which explains why all the captured war materiel is not yet in  the hands of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola  [FALA] which are, however, continuing their searches.  Mercenaries were clearly taking part in the fighting. Several  FALA soldiers have told Firmino Lucamba, our correspondent in  N'dalatando, that they saw many men with painted faces in the  FAPLA ranks.    Meanwhile, the infantry was made to pay the price of that  adventure. The Popular Movement for the Liberation of  Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] air force dropped bombs which  claimed innocent civilian lives. Firmino Lukamba reports that  the MPLA-PT air force daily carried out eight raids on the  villages of Cuanza Norte Province.    Many people lost their lives in an MPLA-PT air raid  yesterday  morning, but it was only possible to confirm that 12-year-old  Rosa Fernanda and 11-year-old Fatima Diogo had been wounded. It  is worth noting that Fatima Diogo lost her parents in the course  of the MPLA- PT air raid. [passage omitted]</p>

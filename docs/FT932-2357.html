			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / Survey of North American Business Travel (11): Be patient and have fun - Damien Fraser advises visitors to take Mexico City on its own terms THE LARGEST, oldest, probably most chaotic, and certainly most polluted place in North America is Mexico City. The business, political and cultural capital of Mexico accounts for 38 per cent of the country's gross domestic product, some 30,000 industries, and is home to around 15.3m Mexicans. Mexico City has now become a magnet for foreign businessmen, with the country having torn down trade barriers some seven years ago. Unfortunately its infrastructure has not improved to meet the flood of new businessmen. It has just one, over-stretched airport, a handful of over-booked hotels, and at most a dozen top-class restaurants. Mexican telephones are terrible; and only a very brave, or over-confident, foreigner would rent a car and try to find his way around the sprawling capital. Despite growing economic integration between Mexico and the US, Mexican business customs also remain sharply different from those in the US. Many Mexicans are suspicious of the telephone, which means meetings have to be scheduled even when a phone call would suffice. Punctuality and conciseness are not national characteristics. But for the foreigner willing to put up with a few cultural differences, business can be rewarding and fun. Mexicans are generous, good-humoured and like to mix business with pleasure (and vice versa), so meetings can easily turn into lunches and dinners, or weekends, and contacts into friends. The businessman invariably starts off at the chaotic international airport, unless he has his own airplane, in which case he will have to land some way away, at Toluca. Hundreds of porters and freelance taxi drivers will be ready to help the newly arrived, but the best advice is to head straight for the official taxi booths and buy a pre-paid ticket for the government-controlled taxi service. There are no luxury hotels in Mexico City, though several are being built. The Camino Real, in the smart district of Polanco, is probably the most fashionable. If patience is not your virtue, the Japanese-owned and decorated Hotel Nikko, also in Polanco, the brand new and garish Marquis Reforma (with the best gymnasium) or the Galeria Plaza, both in the busy Pink Zone, are a little more efficient, if a bit dull. Setting up appointments in Mexico can be trying, as working hours vary from office to office, and sometimes within offices. Some companies in the private sector (Cifra) open at 8.30am and close at 5.30pm, taking an hour off for lunch. Others, such as the government, open at (roughly) 10am. take three hours for lunch between 3 and 6pm, and work to 9pm or later. Many more, like Telmex, the telephone monopoly, seem to have half their staff working on private sector hours, and another half on government hours. To make matters worse, many executives and government officials have several offices dotted around town, and practically all have scores of secretaries, personal assistants, advisers, and heads of advisers, to screen them from unwelcome advances. Try to make your call before 11.30am - after that it may be too late, as the day has taken on its own logic. And remember that, if you have no luck in getting through, it's probably because you're not wanted. When they want to say yes, Mexican businessmen and government officials can be quite as efficient as their US counterparts, or more so. But if they want to say no, many prefer to say nothing. The first appointment is breakfast, which could start any time between 8.00 and 9.30am. Try your hardest to make the booking in your hotel. Since lunch is so long, breakfast is recommended, if you don't think the conversation will or should last two hours or more. Breakfast is heavy and, like everything in Mexico, comes with spicy sauces, so beware. After breakfast, appointments start. If you mind being late, don't try and schedule more than one every other hour; if you don't mind about lateness, schedule as many appointments as you can, and see how the day evolves. Lunch can start at any time between 2.00 and 3.30pm, and will go on for a couple of hours or more, though, as with a number of Mexican habits, a growing number of Americanised executives are cutting it short. Best restaurants include the pricey Champs Elysees (politicians) and the more relaxed Bellinghuasen in the Pink Zone; Isadora (business types) and Estoril (business types and politicians), in Polanco; and San Angel Inn, in the south (tourists). If you have had something to drink, and if you head feels dizzy, it's probably because of altitude, rather than the ubiquitous yellow smog that covers the city in winter months. Still, doctors warn against vigorous exercise when the pollution count reaches dangerous levels, as it nearly always does.</p>

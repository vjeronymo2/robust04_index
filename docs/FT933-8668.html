			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Portugal in telecoms alliance THE international tele-communications companies of Portugal and Brazil have formed a strategic alliance which plans to invest Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) in upgrading services and promoting joint ventures in third countries. The non-exclusive alliance between Marconi of Portugal and Embratel of Brazil is the latest in a series of international telecoms deals aimed at expanding the market for multinationals and exploiting opportunities in developing regions. With joint annual turnover of Dollars 1.7bn last year, the companies will form one of the smaller of the new alliances. It builds on existing commercial and technical co-operation between them. The Portuguese-Brazilian link partially mirrors a strong advance by Spain's telecoms monopoly, Telefonica, into the telecoms market in former Spanish colonies in Latin America. Telefonica has bought control of operating companies in Argentina and Chile in the past three years.</p>

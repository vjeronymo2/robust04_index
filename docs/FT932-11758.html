			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / IFC to seek Russian joint ventures THE International Finance Corporation will move aggressively to find investment opportunities in Russia in partnership with foreign companies, Sir William Ryrie, the IFC's executive vice president, said yesterday. Although Russia's present economic crisis and high inflation was a big deterrent to foreign investment, Sir William said, the medium to long-term potential for foreign investment was very large. Russia joined the IFC two weeks ago, opening up the possibility of direct investment in the country by the corporation. The IFC, which is the member of the World Bank group charged with promoting private investment in developing and former communist countries, is likely to focus its attention first on the oil and gas industries, the hotel business and telecommunications. The IFC has been active in promoting privatisation in Russia since late 1991. It pioneered the privatisation of small-scale enterprises and transport services in the Nizhny Novgorod region and is now helping Russia to sell off medium-sized and big enterprises. According to officials, the interest of Russians in acquiring privatised companies is growing in spite of the economic crisis in the country. So far 42,000 of 275,000 small enterprises in Russia have been privatised, the IFC said.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Food and Drink For Christmas: Still silence of the Lowlands  -Giles MacDonogh mourns the closure of a string of distilleries IT HAS been a bad year in the Scottish distilleries. The heady liquid in the whisky loch is rising fast and the industry's response has been to silence a number of stills. Most distilleries close for a spell during summer to allow staff to holiday and for maintenance work; but this year the closures were longer than usual and some of the distilleries did not open for production in the autumn. As you travel from still to still you hear some pretty fancy semantics these days: when is a 'silent' distillery actually a mothballed distillery; when is a mothballed distillery actually closed? Worst hit have been the Lowland malts. In June, United Distillers decided to close all its Lowland distilleries with the exception of Glenkinchie. Whisky-lovers shed the odd tear for the gentle Bladnoch, Scotland's most southerly distillery: a delicate, Lowland classic. But that was nothing to their reaction to the closure of Rosebank, a triple-distilled whisky which many considered the greatest in its class. There was no question that Rosebank was a better malt than Glenkinchie; but Glenkinchie had an advantage which Rosebank could not equal: the distillery is in a pretty valley just half an hour's drive from Edinburgh; perfect for a day out for tourists. Rosebank, on the other hand, was in the ugly industrial town of Falkirk. Not many tourists would travel to Falkirk. So Rosebank got the bullet. In June, Bladnoch and Rosebank were definitely closed. UD's decision was hardly greeted with applause from the specialist press and the company modified its tone. Now the stills are simply mothballed. Time will tell us what that expression means. Bladnoch and Rosebank were just the last in a series of closures. Gone is Grants' Ladyburn; St Magdelene and Kinclaith went a decade ago; Allied's Lomond and Interleven have been mothballed; At the moment only one Lowland malt, Auchentoshan, is distilling. Why did the Lowland malts go to the wall? Opinions differ. For a malt whisky to survive, say the experts, it must be able to appeal to the blenders. Within UD the line is that the Lowland malts had too little personality to play a big role in blends such as Johnnie Walker or Bells. In the distilleries, however, one hears a quite different story: at Glenkinchie only 10 per cent is reserved for release as a single malt; the rest goes into UD blends. Similarly Stewart Hodgkinson at Auchentoshan told me that his whisky was in demand from blenders as it 'packed' a blend and allowed, you to be a little more sparing with the more rarified products of the Highlands and Islands. Snooping round a blender's office the other day I found no shortage of Lowland malts among the palate of whiskies to be used in one of the premium blends. When I spoke to the blender about this he was frank: he deeply regretted the passing of some of the Lowland malts, in particular Rosebank, but he had no shortage of stock for the time being. Glenkinchie is also silent. The excuse is the need to replace the wash tun: the vessel in which the porridge-like wort is mixed from malted barley and hot water. The new wash tun will take a year to fit, say UD. Elsewhere they are sceptical. 'It took us just six weeks to replace our wash tun,' One distillery manager told me, 'Why do they need a year?' The implication is that Glenkinchie has also produced more than it can sell. Still, UD is unlikely to mothball Glenkinchie, which plays is part of the highly successful 'Classic Malts' portfolio. It is a light whisky. Almost no peat is used in the drying of the malt. As a result Glenkinchie is more or less devoid of the smokey, phenolic aromas of the more powerful malts. It is certainly not a bad dram: the aromas of dried fruit and nuts dominate. With Rosebank gone, Auchentoshan is the last Scottish malt to be made by triple distillation: a method which was always common practice in the Scottish Lowlands and Ireland. Triple distillation means that the whisky comes off the still with a higher proportion of the beery wash transformed into alcohol than in the case of a double-distilled malt. The process eliminates quite a number of flavour compounds, but it also removes the heaviness of the malt. Auchentoshan's light elegance together with its delicate orange zest and cereal bouquet have encouraged the distillery's owners, Morrison-Bowmore, to launch a new malt in the new year: Auchentoshan 'Select'. This is to be a vatted malt without an 'age statement' designed to appeal to the younger drinker who is being wooed by bourbon and vodka. I have tasted the malt. It is not their standard 10-year-old, nor is it their fruity 21-year-old; but it deserves to succeed if the Lowland style is to survive.</p>

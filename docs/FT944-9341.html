			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / People: Cockshaw becomes chief exec - again Sir Alan Cockshaw, 57, (far right), chairman of Amec, is to take on the role of chief executive following the announcement that John Bateson, 53, (right) is to take early retirement after seven years at the helm of the engineering and construction group. Bateson, who has worked for the group for 25 years, will retire at the end of March 1995. Sir Alan, who has worked in tandem with Bateson for over 20 years, said yesterday that Bateson had always said he wanted to go in 1995. Sir Alan characterised Bateson's departure as nothing more than a 'straightforward retirement'. He said he was 'very sorry' to lose Bateson but understood that he wanted to devote more time to his family's caravan park business. Amec said that Bateson will not receive any special compensation when he goes and he will continue to assist the group on a number of specific matters. Amec has been struggling to recover from the recession and this year's estimated profits of around Pounds 25m are still going to be more than two thirds below the figure of five years ago. The news of Bateson's departure comes only three months after the replacement of Dennis Clark, head of Amec's process and energy business, and is likely to increase City concerns about Sir Alan's autocratic management style and the question of management succession. Sir Alan, who was Amec's chief executive between 1984 and 1988, stressed yesterday that he did not plan to take on the chief executive's job permanently. He expected to pick a new chief executive within the next year and said that he very much hoped that Amec's next chief would come from inside the group. Keith Humphreys, who is chairman of the UK arm of Rhone-Poulenc and joined Amec's board last year, has been appointed non-executive deputy chairman of Amec. Meanwhile, George Payne, who replaced Clark and heads the process and energy sector, has joined the board.</p>

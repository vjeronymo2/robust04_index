			<p>930609 FT  09 JUN 93 / Vodafone plans big spending increase VODAFONE Group, the mobile telephone company, yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and said it planned to increase its investment and capital spending by more than half. The company vies with Cellnet for dominance of the UK mobile market. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 271.8m to Pounds 322.5m on turnover of Pounds 585.3m, against Pounds 664.1m in the year to March 31. Capital spending is projected to rise to Pounds 300m this year, compared with Pounds 190m. About Pounds 170m will be invested in the UK, mainly on the company's advanced digital network - built to the pan-European GSM standard - and on its micro-cellular network, both of which are due to be launched this autumn. The priority for the Pounds 130m overseas investment programme is construction of national GSM-standard networks in Australia and Greece. Vodafone also has a network contract in Germany and says its paging business in Spain should soon secure a mobile licence. The company also announced a joint venture with South Africa's Rembrandt Group and Telkom Ltd to operate South Africa's first cellular telephone network. The joint venture, in which Vodafone will have a 35 per cent stake, is about to submit an application for a 15-year R100m (Pounds 21m) cellular licence. If, as expected, it gains a licence later this year, it aims to offer a commercial service by mid-1994. In an upbeat assessment of the current year, Mr Gerry Whent, chief executive, spoke of strong subscriber growth in recent months and surprisingly low levels of migration by business customers to the low-user tariff introduced last autumn. Both Vodafone and Cellnet have low-user tariffs offering reduced line rental charges in return for higher call charges. Cellnet gained more new customers than Vodafone in the first three months of the year, after an aggressive marketing campaign. However, Vodafone pulled ahead again last month, and claims 56 per cent of the total mobile market. Mr Whent said he expected to increase his subscriber base from 838,000 to more than 1m in the coming year. He projected annual compound growth in the mobile market of 22 per cent to the year 2000, by which time 10 per cent of the population would have a mobile phone. However, he conceded that Vodafone would soon have to make tariff 'adjustments' to counter the impact of Mercury One-2-One, which is about to launch its PCN network within the M25 area, charging prices around 40 per cent below those of Cellnet and Vodafone. More than a quarter of Vodafone's traffic is within the M25 area. Earnings per share were 22.07p (18.38p). A final dividend of 3.53p makes a total of 6.96p, a 20 per cent increase. At the end of March the group had Pounds 152m in cash and liquid investments, up from Pounds 65m last year. Lex, Page 22</p>

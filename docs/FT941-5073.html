			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / International Bonds: Irish Treasury may launch global issue IRELAND'S National Treasury Management Agency is considering the launch of the first ever global bond issue denominated in Irish punts. Syndicate officials believe such a deal would meet with considerable interest from international investors, given that they are significant holders of Irish government bonds and that the availability of Eurobonds denominated in the Irish currency is fairly limited. Mr Michael Horgan, deputy director of domestic debt at the National Treasury Management Agency, said gross new issuance is expected to be IPounds 2.25bn in 1994, covering the government's borrowing requirement and redemptions. He added that the Treasury is considering whether to launch a global bond issue, and is looking at the possibility of borrowing at the long end of the yield curve, but would not be drawn on the size of the deal, which is rumoured to be about IPounds 500m. The devaluation of the punt earlier this year scared off many foreign investors, who had held as much as 30 per cent of the Irish gilt market. Mr Horgan said foreign ownership fell to about 15 per cent just after the devaluation but has returned to earlier levels. Nervousness in the world bond markets continues to preoccupy borrowers and investors and syndicate officials had few other prospective deals on which to comment. The Republic of Turkey recently completed roadshows for its global offering in the US, and market participants are waiting to see whether it goes ahead with the launch, given the market background. The deal is expected to be at least Dollars 500m in size, and possibly as large as Dollars 750m, according to Salomon Brothers, which is joint lead and book-runner with Merrill Lynch for the issue. Turkey is apparently still considering a whole range of maturities. Australia Post, which is facing increased competition from private carriers following a cabinet decision last autumn, is raising ADollars 235m through an issue of five-year notes, Nikki Tait adds from Sydney. The government-owned business said that the fund-raising would provide around ADollars 200m of new investment, as well as refinancing maturing bank loans.</p>

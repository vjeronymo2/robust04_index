			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] After a tour of Mostar today, General Michael  Rose, the commander of the peacekeeping forces for  Bosnia-Herzegovina, said he was dissatisfied with what had been  done to enable the civilians to cross freely from one part of  town to the other. It is easier for civilians to cross from one  part of Sarajevo to the other than from the eastern to the  western part of Mostar and vice versa, Rose said, adding that  the freedom to cross from one part of Mostar to the other was  like the freedom to cross from East to West Berlin during the  Cold War. In his talks with representatives of civilian and  military authorities of the western part of Mostar, he said that  much more had been done in central Bosnia to implement the  Washington agreement, and in particular to provide free movement  of civilians.    Representatives of authorities of western Mostar said it was  better to normalize life in Mostar slowly but surely, than hurry  and make quite possible mistakes, which could reverse the peace  process back to the starting point. What has been done so far  to completely end the fighting is a lot for Mostar,  representatives of Croatian authorities said, adding that the  latest Croat-Bosniak political agreements would certainly  stimulate the normalization of life in Mostar.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Three persons have been killed and 10 injured in  Serb attacks on Brcko. Over 3,000 shells have landed on the  defense positions of the Brcko municipality, the political  department of the 108th Croat Defense Council [HVO] Infantry  Brigade has reported. The Serbs have been using howitzers,  tanks, multiple rocket-launchers, and mortars, while a number of  commando groups have attempted to break through. These attempts  have been successfully foiled.    An HVO advance party has reported that the Serb formations  are again concentrating in several locations, while intelligence  officers have said that a group of the so-called Bijeljina  Panthers, a criminal formation that has taken part in some dozen  massacres in northeast Bosnia, has arrived in Brcko.</p>

However, the graph of GIB best rates, provided by Baronworth, shows that the actuaries who set the rates sometimes assume that base rates will rise, and take that into account in the rate they offer - note how rates rose before the general election. The latest moves suggest the actuaries are confident that a base rate rise can be avoided.</p>

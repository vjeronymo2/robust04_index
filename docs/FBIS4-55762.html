			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague, May 20 (CTK) -- President Vaclav Havel has  signed the law on the restitution of Jewish property, Havel's  spokesman Ladislav Spacek told journalists last night after  Havel's meeting with the chairman and deputy chairmen of the  Chamber of Deputies (parliament).    Spacek said that more detailed information concerning the  signing of the law would be provided by the Presidential Office  on Friday. The law, passed by parliament on April 29, was  handed to the Presidential Office on May 5. Havel could have  applied suspensive veto on the law. Some deputies said after  its passing they would submit the law to the Constitutional  Court as they believe it defined the victims of Nazism on the  basis of racial aspects, and that it thus contradicts the  Constitution.    At a dinner last night the prepared law on the Senate, the  as  yet non-existent upper chamber of the Czech parliament, was  discussed, parliament Deputy Chairman Karel Ledvinka told  journalists. He said the parliament officials had informed the  president of the fact that "there is a good will in parliament  to pass the law."    Spacek added that Havel prefers a two-round system for the  Senatorial elections.</p>

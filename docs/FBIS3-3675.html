If the U.S. actually suspends MFN for China under the  pretext  of "human rights," "it would have a very disruptive effect for  the Pacific region," they warned.    "As was already noted, trade with China is crucial for many  economies. If economies were forced to choose, it could happen  that it would be the United States that would find itself  isolated and its actions widely condemned," the outlook said  under the title "Risks in the Forecast -- the Greatest Anxiety."    The outlook was released here this evening in conjunction  with the 10th International General Meeting of the Pacific  Economic Cooperation Council which is being held here on March  22-24, 1994.    "No one should want such a confrontation, so it is to be  hoped that a satisfactory solution to the dispute can be found,"  the report further noted.</p>

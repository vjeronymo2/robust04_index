			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Soares seeks battleground for last fight: Portugal's Socialist president has declared war against the centre-right government The opposing politics and contrasting personalities of President Mario Soares and prime minister Anibal Cavaco Silva embody conflicting sides of the Portuguese psyche. For almost a decade they achieved a precarious harmony that resulted in a lasting and fruitful stability. But the fragile unity collapsed this month when Mr Soares, a Socialist, marked his 70th birthday with a vehement attack on the centre-right government. Portugal's political institutions are now openly at war, upsetting the country's balance as it prepares for a general election next October and a presidential ballot in early 1996. In an interview in the Diario de Noticias newspaper, Mr Soares said nine years of majority government by Mr Cavaco Silva's Social Democratic Party (PSD) had placed 'excessive powers in the hands of one man'. He was concerned over a growing perception that Portugal was slipping towards a 'dictatorship of the majority'. Dictatorship is an emotive word in Portugal. Mr Soares's comparison of today's political climate with the 1926 revolt that ushered in 48 years of authoritarian rule was more than the PSD could bear. Mr Cavaco Silva summoned party leaders who produced a statement amounting to an official declaration of hostilities with the president. Mr Soares had abandoned the role of neutral arbiter for which the country elected him, the PSD said, and was actively intervening in party politics to try to influence the outcome of the general election. He was persecuting the PSD, promoting instability and dividing the country. After nine years of smiling deference towards each other - widely advertised as being for the good of the nation - Mr Soares and Mr Cavaco Silva are locked in a bare-fisted political combat in which few holds are likely to be barred. Mr Cavaco Silva, 56, has an active political future at stake. He is expected to seek re-election as prime minister next year, but may decide to run for the presidency instead. But Mr Soares is not eligible under the constitution for a third consecutive term as president and appears more concerned about posterity. The president and the prime minister speak from opposing sides of both the political debate and the national temperament - and each has equal legitimacy to do so. Mr Cavaco Silva's government has won two successive single-party majorities that Portugal's political system was never expected to produce. From a hard-working, provincial Roman Catholic family, the prime minister is valued as a pragmatist who gets things done. Although sometimes dour and inflexible, he is regarded as honest, upright and frugal. Without making political comparisons, these are traits the Portuguese have prized in leaders such as Salazar and General Antonio Ramalho Eanes, president from 1976 to 1986, and who is widely expected to enter the contest to succeed Mr Soares. Mr Soares has chosen to close his career with a stinging attack on how he fears Portugal is evolving. The PSD party machine has taken over the state, he suggests. Parliament is a powerless mouthpiece of the government and people cannot get a job unless they belong to the PSD. Using contested figures, he says the economic gap between Portugal and Europe is widening, not diminishing as the government promised. The Portuguese should reflect carefully before electing another majority government. But Mr Soares's anti-government ferocity in not an unalloyed gift to Mr Antonio Guterres, leader of the opposition Socialists. The president's domination of the political debate has made him a hero of many disaffected opposition figures but leaves the Socialist party leaders on the sidelines, looking ineffectual. Opinion polls put the Socialists only slightly ahead of the PSD, far from the commanding lead that would make Mr Guterres a strong contender for the post of prime minister. Mr Cavaco Silva may have lost a good deal of support. But it is far from clear that Mr Guterres has yet gained enough credibility to replace him. Mr Soares's chief weapon under the semi-presidential system is the power to dissolve parliament and call an early election. He describes this as his 'atomic bomb'. The president is toying with that bomb more menacingly today that at any time since he came to office. A spring election would theoretically favour the Socialists as the economic recovery forecast for next year would still be immature. But the only concrete grounds for a such a measure is that a company linked to the Portuguese armed forces is alleged to have serviced Angolan military aircraft, damaging Portugal's neutrality in its former colony's civil war. It would be difficult for Mr Soares to justify an early election on this issue alone. But dropping hints that he is considering a dissolution of parliament is an effective way of undermining confidence in the government as the election campaign gets underway. In this climate, Mr Cavaco Silva may decide his best tactic is to call the president's bluff and offer his resignation.</p>

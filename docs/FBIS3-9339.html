A new government, whatever its  composition, offers a new opportunity for a dialogue, which we  have always encouraged," Foreign Minister Geza Jeszenszky said  in Turin on Sunday [20 March].    Jeszenszky, who attended a series of events marking the  death  centenary of 1848-49 Hungarian freedom fight leader Lajos  Kossuth (1802-1894, died in Turin), spoke to MTI about  Hungarian-Slovak links after the Bratislava government crisis,  and the future of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia.    "When Hungary congratulated the newly-independent Slovakia,  it stressed that the good wishes are also for the ethnic  Hungarians living there. We feel reconciliation between  Slovakia and Hungary is possible, but only if preceded by a  compromise between Hungarians and Slovaks in Slovakia,"  Jeszenszky said.    He recalled his repeated negotiations with the new Prime  Minister Jozef Moravcik, who was then foreign minister, on the  minority problem. "I hope that the new Slovak Government will  strive to create friendship between the two countries and their  peoples in keeping with its original program, instead of  fabricating artificial enemy pictures and enemies," the foreign  minister added.    Regarding Saturday's rock concerts held in several large  towns of the world at the call of Sarajevo Radio to protest  against the raising of a new "wall" in the Bosnian capital,  Jeszenszky -- who visited Sarajevo early this week -- pointed  out:    "Everything possible should be done to prevent repetition of  the Berlin Wall, and to promote unification of still divided  towns in Europe and elsewhere. Administrative borders must be  freely crossable: They can separate certain communities, but  they must not separate the people.</p>

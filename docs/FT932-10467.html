			<p>930508 FT  08 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Sedgwick seeks investors for Lloyd's SEDGWICK Group, the insurance broker, is backing an initiative to attract new investors to the Lloyd's insurance market. Sedgwick is joining forces with Mr Michael Wade, the former chairman of brokers Holman Wade, to form Corporate Lloyd's Membership (CLM), a joint venture company which will offer individuals, either directly or through other investment vehicles, the opportunity to invest at Lloyd's on a limited liability basis. 'We aim to fundamentally change the investor profile of the market. It is the nearest thing to selling shares in Lloyd's,' said Mr Wade, who will be chief executive of the new company. The scheme follows hard on the heels of the Lloyd's business plan last week, which outlined the terms on which incorporated Names can participate at Lloyd's. Mr Wade said CLM hoped to form at least one investment fund which would be incorporated as a Name and trade with a range of syndicates. Matters would become clearer after Lloyd's publishes more detailed regulations in the summer. 'We want to attract a wide range of people . . . from those who buy PEPs to millionaires', said Mr Jim Payne, the Sedgwick executive who will be vice-chairman of the new group. Mr Payne said CLM was also keen to attract many Names who had resigned from the market because of concern about their unlimited liability for losses. 'Many people have lost their nerve in the last five years.' Although no figures were made available, the funds would be of a significant size, 'We are not talking about Pounds 10m or that sort of level,' said Mr Wade. Sir Peter Parker, the former chairman of British Rail, will chair the new company. Earlier this year Sir Peter and Mr Wade resigned from their positions at Holman Wade, which specialised in providing stop loss insurance. The new company will work closely with Sedgwick Lloyd's Underwriting Agents, the Sedgwick members' agency which handles the affairs of individual Names.</p>

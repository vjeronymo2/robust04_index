			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Hungary's economy shows sign of recovery INDUSTRIAL output in Hungary rose 5 per cent in September, the first tentative signs of recovery in the economy, writes Nicholas Denton in Budapest. The rise lifted production 1.5 per cent above a year earlier and gave industry its first year-on-year growth since 1990. Hungarian industrial production statistics tend to fluctuate from month to month and overall the figure is 38 per cent below 1988. Gross domestic product is still forecast to fall by 5 per cent this year compared to 1991.</p>

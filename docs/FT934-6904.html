			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / 50-year rail franchises urged Franchises to run parts of British Rail should be for at least 50 years rather than the expected maximum of 15 years, Mr James Sherwood, chief executive of Sea Containers, the shipping company, said yesterday. Mr Sherwood, speaking at an FT conference, also called on the government to repackage franchises so that each contained a mix of profitable and unprofitable routes which could be operated without subsidies or price controls. Sea Containers operates the Orient Express, which runs on BR tracks and is considering bidding for BR routes to the south-west of London. Mr Sherwood said 50-year franchises would allow operators to make a good return on rolling stock, which has a 30-year life. The franchising director, responsible for monitoring franchises, should have power to terminate early the contract of any operator not meeting required standards. He warned that privatisation of BR was likely to lead to closure of provincial services which could be better provided by buses, and the demise of the British Transport police, whose work could be taken over by cheaper private-sector security guards. Mr Sherwood called on the government to drop its proposal to allow competition between operators on the same route. 'There is already enough competition for rail from road and air; we don't need any more.' Mr Sherwood said he was concerned that the government had underestimated how much capital would be required to maintain a rail network. 'If rail staff come with Pounds 100 of capital each in a buy-out, we will have a deteriorating system,' he said. 'Big companies must come in and invest billions of pounds to improve it.' The conference, on the economics of rail privatisation, heard a call for companies operating train services to be allowed to own and operate the track - the government proposes that BR's track will be owned and run by Railtrack, a separate organisation. Mr Brian Cox, a director of Stagecoach Holdings, a bus operator which is considering bidding for franchises, called on Railtrack to subcontract some of the services it will provide back to the franchisees who run the tracks. Mr Roger Salmon, franchising director, said he wanted to see rail franchisees set up an association of train operating companies to take a lead in discussing issues such as complementary ticket systems and sharing of stations.</p>

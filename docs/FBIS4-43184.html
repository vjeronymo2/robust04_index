			<p>BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis began his talks  on the Cyprus issue in New York by meeting with the UN secretary  general's senior adviser. Today, Mikhailidhis will have  successive talks with the representatives of the 15 UN Security  Council member states and Alternate UN Secretary General Marrack  Goulding.    In a statement to the Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation  correspondent in New York, the foreign minister said that a new  report by UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali is  unjustified and will set a bad precedence. He added that the  recent talks between Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative in Cyprus, and Turkish Cypriot  leader Rauf Denktas do not justify the issuing of a new report.    Referring to the telephone conversation between U.S.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher and President Glavkos  Kliridhis, Mikhailidhis said that the call was designed to  encourage efforts on the confidence-building measures procedure  to continue. Discussing the U.S. position, Mikhailidhis  rejected claims that Cyprus-U.S. relations are being disturbed,  describing them as relations of continuous and close  communication.    Mikhailidhis will meet the UN secretary general on Thursday  [16 June]. It has not yet been decided whether he will go to  Washington for talks with U.S. State Department officials.</p>

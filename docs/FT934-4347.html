			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Spanish cabinet agrees labour market reforms The Spanish cabinet yesterday approved controversial legislation that seeks to create employment by promoting apprenticeship schemes and to stimulate industrial investment by removing labour market rigidities. The initiative received a boost from the Bank of Spain which cut its benchmark lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 9 per cent, but it prompted strong hostility from trade union leaders who are planning a general strike against the measures next month. There was only a lukewarm reception from employer representatives, who say the reform does not go far enough. Hailed by the government as a breakthrough in its attempt to restore Spain's competitiveness, the legislation comes at the end of a fruitless three-month attempt to establish a consensus between employers and unions over labour market reforms. Yesterday's decision allows companies, from Monday, to hire unqualified under-25-year-olds as apprentices for up to three years. These new employees will earn 70 per cent of the minimum wage during their first working year and incur minimal social security costs to the employers. The cabinet, under the same decree law, also removed legal impediments to part-time work. The government hopes these measures will have a major impact on unemployment which stood at 3.5m, or 23 per cent of the labour force, at the end of September according to the national statistics office. The largest group among the unemployed total is formed by first time job seekers and, under the former rulings, part-time workers were not counted as employees by the statistics office. The unions accuse the government of introducing 'junk jobs' and say that employees on fixed contracts will be replaced by low-paid apprentices and by part-time workers. The main body of yesterday's legislation is formed by a draft bill that will go before parliament early next year and which alters fundamental guidelines on working practices and on dismissal procedures. Essentially the bill makes redundancies in Spain, which are held to be the costliest in Europe, easier and cheaper by broadening the terms of justifiable dismissals and by shortening compensation from 25 to 20 days per year worked. The draft bill also removes existing rigid statutory rules concerning the extent of working days and holidays, overtime, job classifications and geographical mobility for company employees.</p>

			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Swedish purchase lifts Charter - Shares rise 25p after better than expected interim results Shares in Charter jumped yesterday in a falling market, rising 25p to 780p, as the UK industrial group announced better than expected interim operating profits of Pounds 28.2m. The result, which compared with Pounds 19.5m last time, was about Pounds 5m better than expectations. The market was particularly impressed with Charter's progress in integrating Esab, the Swedish welding business acquired for Pounds 293m in August. In the six weeks it contributed to these results, Esab returned operating profits of Pounds 8.4m. 'The assumptions we had made for Esab in 1997 have already been surpassed in this six week period,' said one analyst. Esab was already achieving margins of 11 per cent, with further scope for imporvement, analysts said, against expectations of 10 per cent. Mr Jeffrey Herbert, chief executive said the restructuring of Esab was going well. Charter expected to incur exceptional costs of between Pounds 10m and Pounds 20m as a result. The pre-tax line appeared less encouraging, with profits falling by 2 per cent from Pounds 31.3m to Pounds 30.8m. Sales for the six months to September 30 moved ahead from Pounds 288.4m to Pounds 358.8m. Charter said the decline in pre-tax profits was due to a Pounds 6.6m drop in interest gains to Pounds 2.6m. On a like-for-like basis, pre-tax profits had improved by more than 20 per cent. Interest fell as a result of the buy-back of shares held by Minorco, the off-shore arm of Anglo-American. The company was restructured last year selling its stake in Johnson Matthey and using part of the proceeds to buy back Minorco's 36 per cent stake. This had left it with a cash pile which helped to fund the Esab purchase. Excluding Esab, Charter's three divisions of building products, railtrack equipment and coal returned marginally higher operating profits of Pounds 19.8m (Pounds 19.5m). Mr Herbert said that he was confident of a further improvement for most businesses in the current year, with the exception of coal. There remained considerable uncertainties given the the privatisation of British Coal in the UK and the competitive environment in the US. Charter increased its interim dividend from 7p to 7.5p. Earnings per share rose from 18.8p to 23.7p. COMMENT deal look like a steal. Few suspected that Charter would be able to get margins up to these levels so soon, not even the management. Even better, there appears to be substantial scope for further improvement through brand synergies and rationalisation. Esab is also experiencing recovery in several markets, most notably the US and Pacific, while Europe finally appears to have hit bottom. So much good news might make investors wonder when it will all turn to tears. For the moment however, the Esab story is a tempting one. Forecasts are for profits of about Pounds 63m this year, rising to Pounds 88m in calendar 1995. The propective p/e for 1995 of about 14 times looks decent value given Esab's potential.</p>

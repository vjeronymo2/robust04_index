			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / Parliament and Politics: Backbenchers bring mixed messages - The mood among Tory MPs returning from holiday It is one of the more enduring myths at Westminster that Tory MPs see parliamentary recesses as a never-to-be-missed opportunity to test the political mood in their constituencies. In reality, most on the government benches studiously avoid living in the areas they represent. The tanned Tory faces in the lobbies yesterday attested to the widespread preference for a break spent relaxing in the sun over one opening spring fetes or sipping medium dry white wine at fund-raising buffets. There are of course honourable exceptions; and the local elections on May 2 meant that most if not all had to put in at least a token spell on the political stump. The message they brought back for an embattled Mr John Major yesterday was, to coin a phrase, indecisive. Most were surprised that what was to have been a peaceful interlude over Easter had turned into a media inquest on whether Mr Major can make the grade in Downing Street. Most were frankly fed up with the party's continuing internecine strife about the replacement for the poll tax. But they were also uncertain about whether a party which has spent most of the past two years shooting itself in the foot is now prepared to direct its fire towards the Labour opposition. From a few of the disgruntled and dispossessed on the Thatcherite right came a warning that they are far from certain that her legacy is safe in Mr Major's hands. Some close to the former prime minister said she remains loyal to her successor but is anguished, and sometimes disparaging, about some recent decisions. Mr Chris Patten, the party chairman, and Mr David Mellor, the chief secretary to the Treasury, found themselves the recipients of some less than flattering comments about their 'centralist' intentions from a former cabinet colleague. Two weeks away from Westminster has lowered the political temperature among Tories. Another cut in mortgage rates and the promise of more to come has provided the long-awaited glimpse of light on the economic front. Most hope an announcement in the next few days on the poll tax replacement will take at least some of the sting out of that issue. Mr David Martin, whose tiny majority of 205 in Portsmouth South makes him one of his party's more assiduous canvassers, insists that the sniping at the prime minister heard among London's chattering classes is not echoed on the doorsteps. ''Give the prime minister a chance' is the message I have been getting from the ordinary voter,' he says. 'They saw that the community charge destroyed Mrs Thatcher and they are very pleased that John Major is tackling it'. Mr Nicholas Budgen, the eclectic Tory MP for Wolverhampton South West, is not known to be among the most fervent admirers of the new regime. But he too admits that the announcement of a Pounds 140 cut in poll tax bills means there is 'surprisingly little' concern about the issue on the doorsteps. Others echo the views of Mr Norman Tebbit, the former party chairman who retains close links with Mr Major's Downing Street. Labour, he believes, cannot win the general election on its own merits, but the Conservatives could lose it if they become distracted by internal bickering. Mr Graham Riddick, who represents the marginal Colne Valley, puts it crisply: 'The thing that strikes me is that no-one actually wants a Labour government. Once we have fully got our act together we will get re-elected.' Not all are so upbeat. Sir Rhodes Boyson, a vocal opponent of a return to a property-based system of local taxation, warns that the decision to abandon the poll tax must not be at the expense of his Brent North constituents. They, and voters in dozens of similar suburban seats around London, did well out of the poll tax. Sir Rhodes is in a minority. The problem for the Tories is that the economic recession and the question mark over Mr Major, underscored again last night by BBC Television's Panorama programme, amplify the discordant notes. There is little evidence that the prime minister is a ditherer, but he should know more than most that in politics perceptions are often more important than reality.</p>

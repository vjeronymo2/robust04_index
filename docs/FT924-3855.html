			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / EC names group to look at publicity THE EUROPEAN Commission yesterday named the seven people who will carry out an inquiry into the alleged failings of Brussels' communications and information policy. Sir Bernard Ingham - Downing Street spokesman when Lady Thatcher was UK premier - was on the original shortlist for the group. But the Commission said yesterday that in the end he was not asked to take part in the communications audit. The Commission has included in the list two senior officials responsible for Commission and European Parliament information policy, contrary to suggestions that it should be made up entirely of objective Brussels outsiders. The working group, which should report by the end of next March, will be chaired by Mr Willy de Clercq, a former commissioner and Belgian member of the European Parliament. The other members are Mr Ronald Beatson, director general of the European Association of Advertising Agencies; Mr Julian Bravo, chairman of the Madrid office of J Walter Thompson, the advertising agency; Ms Colette Flesch, head of the Commission's information department; Mr Sergio Guccione, head of the Parliament's information service; Mr Jacques Pilhan, deputy managing director of the Paris-based agency Havas; and Mr Mark Wossner, head of Bertelsmann, the German media group. The Italian government yesterday announced the nomination of two new commissioners for Brussels after a much criticised delay of nearly five months, Robert Graham writes from Rome. The new commissioners are Mr Raniero Vanni d'Archirafi, the current director general of political affairs at the foreign ministry, and Mr Antonio Ruberti, an automation specialist, academic and former minister of research. They will replace Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, who left as EC environment commissioner to become an environment minister in the current government in June, and Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi.</p>

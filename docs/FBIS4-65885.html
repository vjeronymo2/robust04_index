			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Antonio Martino by Alberto </F> Flores D'Arcais during flight from Rome to Washington on 23 may:  "Dear Allies, Now We Want To Carry More Weight"]    [Excerpt] Washington -- [passage omitted] [Flores D'Arcais]  What will you tell Secretary of State Christopher? How will  relations between Italy and the United States change?    [Martino] I do not think they will change, and I can assure  you there will be no change in our essential options. As far as  Italy's Atlantic policy is concerned, let me say right away that  above all there will be continuity; in fact I am convinced that  this policy can be carried forward with substantial opposition  support. I have already had an opportunity to discus this with  opposition representatives.    [Flores D'Arcais] Two pressing problems: Bosnia and  relations with the United Nations. What changes are there with  respect to the past?    [Martino] Let me give you a specific example right away:  Bosnia. Our position is clear-cut: Italy must be involved in  decisionmaking processes from the outset; we cannot accept our  exclusion. For geographical and also military reasons, Italy  has a substantial interest in Bosnia.    [Flores D'Arcais] But we have been excluded from the  "contact  group" in the peace negotiations, which is comprised of the  United States, Russia, Germany, France, and Britain.    [Martino] Our exclusion is unacceptable.    [Flores D'Arcais] Will you request admission to the "contact  group"?    [Martino] Yes, I will state clearly that our country must be  a member.    [Flores D'Arcais] Are you in favor of sending Italian Blue  Helmets to Bosnia?    [Martino] I am not opposed to it, on the following  conditions: 1) that Italy take part in the decisionmaking  process; 2) that it takes place as a UN initiative and under  NATO military command; 3) that it genuinely be a peacekeeping  operation; 4) that the aim of the operation be observance of an  agreement accepted by all the sides involved and that the  presence there be confined to the absolute minimum necessary. I  say this because I believe that adventurism in foreign policy is  very dangerous.    [Flores D'Arcais] Croatian President Tudjman has reaffirmed  his anxieties about border issues.    [Martino] And I reaffirm our position: We are not raising  any issues about borders; let them remain as they are. We have  no intention of regarding treaties as mere pieces of paper.  What we do have are some bilateral problems, and we will deal  with them.    [Flores D'Arcais] What are these problems?    [Martino] For instance, property, the possibility of  purchasing real estate, and freedom of movement.    [Flores D'Arcais] Will you reconsider the Osimo Treaty?    [Martino] The Treaty will be observed; in fact some parts of  it have yet to be implemented. If there are any points that  need to be reconsidered, we will deal with them.    [Flores D'Arcais] When people accuse you of being  "anti-Europeanist" you reply it is inconceivable that the son of  Gaetano Martino could be opposed to European ideals. However,  on some points of the Maastricht Treaty -- the single currency,  for instance -- you disagree with the previous government's  policies. So what is your vision of Europe?    [Martino] It seems to me that the Community made the mistake  that people often make when they buy a computer. First they buy  one, then they decide what to do with it. I think that you must  first think what you want to do and then choose the means,  define a program. Recently in Europe we have wondered in an  abstract fashion which are the best institutions, and only  afterward decided what to do with them.    [Flores D'Arcais] What would you like to do with the  European  "computer?"    [Martino] I would proceed from an obvious observation. A  political institution justifies its existence on the basis of  objectives that cannot be achieved equally effectively at  another level of government. We have a national government with  national objectives. Then we have Europe, which has objectives  that cannot be pursued at the national level.    [Flores D'Arcais] What are these objectives?    [Martino] They are few, but of huge importance. The first is  political: We must have a European foreign policy. Not in  order to return to the old concept of European civilization, but  in order to grant Europe a common voice. Also, we need a joint  European defense; we must not delude ourselves that the United  States will always take care of defending us. Of course, there  are also economic objectives. The first -- which has been  almost completely achieved, and whose importance is  underestimated -- is the single market, which is a European  asset. We cannot allow national states the possibility of  impeding the free exchange of goods.    [Flores D'Arcais] Is this the point over which you differ  most from the so-called "Eurobureaucrats?"    [Martino] Keep in mind that this is not a purely economic  thing and that economic liberalism alone will not guarantee  peace. However, the maxim "where goods do not pass, armies pass"  applies, and it is a fact that when countries communicate more,  there are fewer conflicts. Let me quote to you something some  one else said: "Trade unites, politics divides."    [Flores D'Arcais] So are you opposed to any kind of  intervention in the markets?    [Martino] Yes, because if we grant Brussels the ability to  intervene, we will then have various "milk wars," because prices  must be determined by the market, not by a centralized  bureaucracy at the European level. Let me give you an example:  There is a Community directive that even states how large the  pea in a whistle should be.    [Flores D'Arcais] Is it true that you have in mind a  Rome-London axis to set against the European policy of France  and Germany?    [Martino] No, that is not the right way to consider the  matter. I believe in the enlargement of Europe because I think  that, just as we can no longer talk about a West Germany, it no  longer makes any sense to talk about a West Europe -- either  politically or economically.    [Flores D'Arcais] Would you open Europe's doors to the  countries of the East, too?    [Martino] Yes, if we want to give the countries of the East  the chance of opening up their markets, this is necessary. If  we close our doors to them, we will force them into an economic  stagnation that could lead to serious political difficulties.    [Flores D'Arcais] Does this include an opening up to Russia?    [Martino] In the future, yes. Above all, we must not give  any of those countries the impression that anything is being  done against anyone else. Of course, the liberalization of the  markets of the East could in some instances disadvantage some  industrial groups to the benefit of others. However, until  those countries produce as much as they can, they will never  develop.    [Flores D'Arcais] The next appointment is in Corfu. Will  there be an Italian candidate for the presidency of the European  Commission?    [Martino] No, partly because after 10 years of French  presidency, we do not think that another Mediterranean  presidency is possible. There are several candidates...    [Flores D'Arcais] Will you support [Leon] Brittan?    [Martino] We have not yet decided; we are discussing it.  What we want is a greater and more incisive Italian presence in  the various international bodies. For instance, the elimination  of the deputy chairmanship of the European Bank of Research and  Development is a blow to countries such as Italy which are major  shareholders in the Bank.    [Flores D'Arcais] The Middle East: In the past Italy has  been accused of having an excessively pro-Arab policy.    [Martino] I hope that the present situation will lead to a  genuine peace. We must not criminalize anyone, and we must also  avoid condemning the Islamic world.    [Flores D'Arcais] Will you be going to Israel?    [Martino] Yes, soon, and I would also like to visit Cairo.    [Flores D'Arcais] The presence of neo-fascist ministers  worries Jerusalem in particular.    [Martino] I have already explained that the National  Alliance  minister belongs to a center government. The new electoral  rules led to the formation of an alliance that opposed a  left-wing bloc. Many people abroad have understood this, too.  The major criticisms come from countries where there is an  internal problem -- France, Belgium, sometimes Germany.    [Flores D'Arcais] Do you too accuse the press of having  whipped up a campaign?    [Martino] What I think is that since the European elections  are about to take place on 12 June, the presence of National  Alliance ministers is being manipulated for domestic political  ends. Furthermore, while the French press has been very  critical, in other countries such as Britain or even the United  States -- with the exception of the NEW YORK TIMES -- things  have been different.    [Flores D'Arcais] What seems to worry the Americans more  than  this is the issue of the separation of powers. In other words,  the Berlusconi problem.    [Martino] As a liberal, I have always believed that the  greatest danger comes from concentration of power. But I do not  think there is a problem with [Prime Minister] Berlusconi. If  he had wanted to enter politics for the sake of his own vested  interests, he would not have submitted himself to so much public  exposure. Now the slightest suspicion that a decision made  within the government sphere could benefit his private interests  would whip up both the press and the opposition. As an  economist, I believe that everyone must behave in accordance  with his own interests. It is in Berlusconi's interest to  behave extremely carefully, not to give rise to any suspicions.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["km"-signed report: "Experts See a Greater Risk in the </F> Former USSR Than in Bosnia"]    [Text] If there is any external threat to the Czech  Republic, then it is, above all, the developments in the former  Soviet Union. The International Relations Institute experts, who  prepared the documentation for the government concept of  security policy, believe that even the present conflict in  former Yugoslavia is less dangerous for the Czech Republic than  the ethnic, political, and economic conflicts in the post-Soviet  countries.    According to the document, which the government experts used  when drafting the security concept, the most perilous disputes  in Europe are the Polish-Russian, possibly Polish-Ukrainian,  Polish- Lithuanian, and Russian-Baltic conflicts.    In the context of the war in former Yugoslavia, the Czech  experts point out particularly the possibility of the  penetration of militant Islamic fundamentalism into Europe.  Another security hazard in Central Europe could be the  nationalist attempts at revision of the borders and the  so-called disputable territory -- Greater Germany, Greater  Hungary.</p>

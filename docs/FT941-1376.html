			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Arts: Maxwell Davies and the RPO - Concert The desire to be seen to support new music has prompted various British orchestras to offer house room to composers-in-residence. How far this will work to the composers' advantage is not yet clear, but the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra is showing signs of taking its responsibility seriously. As from last season, it has had Peter Maxwell Davies as its Associate Conductor/Composer. With an eye to the future the orchestra has already commissioned from him a Sixth Symphony (even though he has not yet finished his Fifth) and has started to schedule existing works in its concerts. Usually 20th-century pieces are sprinkled among the popular classics, but on Wednesday the RPO was more ambitious and presented an entire concert of Maxwell Davies. Later this year he will be 60, which could be the occasion to look back over his changing interests. From being a composer impelled to write by the creative urge within, he has matured into one whose music seems guided as much by external factors, such as the specific requirements of commissions. In Wednesday's programme there were two main works, one early, one late. Although the Second Fantasia on John Taverner's 'In nomine' is built on a Tudor foundation, it is a wholly 20th-century piece of musical architecture with its angular themes, its complex structure, its abstract form of expression. The orchestra is large, but used sparingly in the Mahlerian manner. At 40 minutes the work tests an audience's concentration, for as the composer remarked, it demands much of players and listeners alike. The RPO sounded tentative in it. The Strathclyde Concerto No 4 for clarinet (1990) is one of ten in an ongoing project. Instigated by Strathclyde Regional Council, it shows us a different Maxwell Davies, working in a relatively approachable neo-classical style. The Clarinet Concerto is a very polished example of concerto writing. It has plenty of virtuoso passages for the soloist and makes good use of traditional features such as the cadenza, but is always music of substance, not empty note-spinning. Dimitri Ashkenazy caught its sensitive, sombre mood nicely. To end Maxwell Davies conducted An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise, a Boston Pops commission. The vigorous Highland flings, a tipsy violin solo, raucous brass guests and bagpipes at dawn, all make this a vivid showpiece, which the RPO might consider using more widely. Responsibility and fun can usefully be combined there.</p>

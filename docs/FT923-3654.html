			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / U-turn on pay deal expected THE LEADER of the NUCPS Civil Service union is expected next week to advise acceptance of a controversial pay deal that his members had previously rejected. If Mr Leslie Christie's advice is accepted by the union's executive, it will mean that all Civil Service unions have concluded pay deals this year that will lead to significant extensions of performance pay. Mr Christie was unavailable for comment yesterday but it is thought that after meetings with Treasury officials this week he has concluded that continued rejection of the offer might result in the loss of a long-term pay agree-ment.</p>

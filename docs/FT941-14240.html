			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Pensions rule withdrawn in tendering row The Department of the Environment has climbed down over new regulations which would have forced private companies taking over local authority contracts to offer employees 'broadly comparable' pensions. Contractors claimed the ruling would make it impossible for small companies to bid for council business, as they would not have the resources to match public-sector pensions, which are usually index-linked. After meeting contractors on Wednesday, Mr Tony Baldry, the environment minister, decided to withdraw the department's pensions advice, which was issued to the press on Tuesday, and was due to be announced in the Commons today. Mr Baldry will now restrict his statement to the Commons today to the Transfer of Undertakings (Public Employees) regulations, known as Tupe, which also affect local authority contracting. The department's change of heart was attacked by contractors, local authorities and unions. Mr Cliff Davis-Coleman of Clause 26, a contractors' lobby group, described the position as 'chaos', and predicted that the pensions provisions would eventually be enforced, as similar rulings had been made regarding contracting out from the National Health Service. The Association of Direct Labour Organisations said competition would be distorted if contractors were not required to offer the same employment package to employees, and claimed the environment department's original guidance was correct. The department said that the decision had been taken because it needed to consult other departments over the pensions issue, which is covered by the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act of 1978. Mr Gummer will also announce today that where a local authority believes that Tupe applies but a contractor does not, the authority can, after taking legal advice, properly decide not to proceed with the tender. Mr Davis-Coleman said this ruling would mean 'the end of compulsory competitive tendering'. If Tupe applies to a particular contract, a contractor taking over council work is obliged to keep the existing workforce, on the same pay and conditions, and cannot save money by cutting pay.</p>

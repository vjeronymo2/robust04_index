			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / France announces partial pull-out of troops from Bosnia France said yesterday it planned to withdraw more than 2,000 of its troops assigned to the United Nations in ex-Yugoslavia by the end of this year, while still remaining the largest single provider of peacekeeping forces there. The decision was abruptly announced by Mr Francois Leotard, the defence minister, on French radio yesterday before UN commanders and allies had been informed. The foreign ministry was quick to add that the partial pull-out might be reversed if there was a diplomatic breakthrough in the desultory peace talks in the region. These were being further threatened yesterday. Amid reports of heavy fighting between Serb and Moslem forces in north-eastern Bosnia, and a Serb artillery attack on Tuzla airport, Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg, the international mediators, met President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia in Belgrade to try to push forward the peace process. After discussing Gorazde, a UN 'safe area', and the Bosnian Serb refusal to comply with the terms of the Nato ultimatum calling for their withdrawal from the zone, Lord Owen and Mr Stoltenberg headed off to meet Bosnian Serb leaders in Zvornik, a Serb-held town in eastern Bosnia. France had already announced in March the departure next month of 900 troops from the Glina region of Krajina. But Mr Leotard disclosed yesterday that the 1,350-strong French battalion around Bihac in western Bosnia would leave in November, leaving some 4,500 French 'blue helmets' on the soil of ex-Yugoslavia. In advance of last Friday's meeting with US, Russian and European Union peace mediators, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, warned that 'the moment of choice is approaching', and that France would only maintain its effort 'if all our main partners show the same determination and are ready to make a sufficient commitment'. A defence ministry official said yesterday the latest French announcement was directed not only at the warring parties but also 'the American and Russians who do not seem to share the sense of urgency which we and the British have, because of our sizeable forces on the ground'. France's general military strategy has been to reinforce, for reasons of safety and efficiency, its presence in Sarajevo, where in fact it added a third battalion in March. But the defence official said there was a further specific reason to pull out of Bihac. 'There, we have found ourselves diverted from our original humanitarian mission because we have been caught in the middle between two factions of Moslems,' he said. Meanwhile, Serbian radio said there was heavy fighting to the north-east, with Moslem forces suffering heavy losses. But local witnesses said Moslem forces had launched an offensive, with the Serbs taking serious casualties. They said that Moslem forces had seized two out of three strategic heights from where Serb forces previously used artillery to bombard Tuzla, the second biggest Bosnian government stronghold in the north-east. UN monitors yesterday reported Serb shelling of Tuzla and its airfield.</p>

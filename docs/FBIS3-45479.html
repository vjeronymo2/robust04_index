We  must make specific work arrangements; adopt feasible measures;  and strive to achieve tangible results in all fields. Moreover,  it is necessary to seize each and every excellent opportunity to  vigorously expand opening up to the outside world and raise  opening up to a higher level, larger scope, and in an in-depth  manner.    The enlarged plenary session noted: Building a socialist  market economic structure is definitely an onerous, grand, and  lofty undertaking. Thus, party committees and governments at  all levels should make overall arrangements and carry out work  in accordance with the party's basic theory and basic line;  concentrate more efforts on in-depth reforms; judge reforms  outcome using the three beneficials criterion; make constant  efforts to emancipate the mind; seek truth from facts; boldly  draw upon experiences of all countries in the world, including  developed capitalist countries, in respect of conducting  socialized big production in accordance with the law of market;  resist old traditions and outdated concepts which have proved  not to conform with a market economy; heighten vigilance against  both the right and left deviations, but mainly the left; be  brave in exploring new ways, trying out new measures, and  implementing new systems; strive to maintain social stability;  make reform, opening up, economic growth, and social stability  promote and unify one another; respect the pioneering spirit of  the masses and show concern for their immediate interests; guide  the broad masses of the people to correctly view the reform and  actively support it; bring into full play creativity among the  masses; and strive to turn reform measures into actual actions  on the part of the broad masses of the people.

Successfully carrying out work in 1994 is of great  significance to grasping the excellent opportunities,  accelerating reform and development, and attaining Henan's  second-stage strategic goal by the end of the 1990's. As we are  confronted with hopes, difficulties, opportunities, and  challenges at the moment, we should develop a strong sense of  historical responsibility and a strong sense of epochal urgency;  firmly bear in mind that poverty is not socialism and  development is the last word [fazhan cai shi ying daoli 4099  1455 2088 2508 4289 6670 3810]; adhere to the guiding ideology  of grasping the excellent opportunities to speed up development;  continually adhere to the new train of thought of promoting  development by virtue of in-depth reforms and expanded opening  up; continually adhere to the ideological line of emancipating  the mind and seeking truth from facts; focus on ideological  transformation, this being a key link; judge reform's outcome  using the three beneficials criterion; comprehensively promote  socialist modernization building; unswervingly uphold the  principle of firmly and simultaneously grasping two key work  aspects; place all types of work under the guidance of the  theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics as  well as the party's basic line; take the Third Plenary Session  of the 14th CPC Central Committee decision as a program of  action; strive to attain the strategic goal of raising Henan's  GNP to a level higher than the country's average and lowering  Henan's population growth rate to a level lower than the  country's average; continually grasp the excellent  opportunities, deepen reform, expand opening up, and accelerate  development; take a real step forward in building a socialist  market economic structure; and strive to achieve phenomenal  success in accelerating technological transformation, improving  economic efficiency, and optimizing economic structure to step  up party building and spiritual civilization, deepen the ongoing  anticorruption struggle, consolidate social and political  stability, and bring about a faster and healthier national  economic growth in Henan.    The enlarged plenary session stressed: In order to build a  socialist market economic structure and expedite modernization  building, it is necessary to step up party building and improve  party leadership.

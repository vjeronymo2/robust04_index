He Zhukang, secretary of the provincial party committee,  conducted investigations and study in the two cities of Hunjiang  and Tonghua from 3 to 8 January. He pointed out: The tasks for  1994 are very heavy, and how we carry out our work is a very  important matter. We must thoroughly implement the guidelines  of the third plenary session of the 14th party Central  Committee, arm our minds with the theory of building socialism  with Chinese characteristics, emancipate our minds, and seek  truth from facts. We should not only change ideas, but we  should also solve problems, explore new ideas, and carry forward  the spirit of creation to implement to the letter the various  tasks defined at the second plenary session of the sixth  provincial party committee and to win greater success.    In the six-day period, Comrade He Zhukang inspected the  Hunjiang city cement plant, Hunjiang city aluminum corporation,  Hunjiang city no. 1 plastics plant, Hunjiang city (Hualian)  commercial building, Hunjiang city sugar and wine corporation,  Hunjiang city (Dongyuan) agriculture-industry-commerce group  company, Hunjiang city's (Sanchazi) District coal transport and  market corporation, Tonghua Iron and Steel Company, Tonghua city  textile mill, Tonghua city artificial leather and fur product  plant, Tonghua city radio plant, Tonghua city pharmaceutical  plant, Tonghua county (Baiyunshan) pharmaceutical plant, Tonghua  county leather product plant, Tonghua county paper board mill,  and Tonghua city plastics plant. Some of them are state-owned  large- and medium-sized enterprises, and others are shareholding  enterprises, joint ventures, or private enterprises. He visited  the production workshops of these enterprises, inspected their  products, and heard briefings by their responsible persons on  their production and business. He held several discussions with  city, county, and district leading cadres and enterprise  managerial personnel and heard work reports by the party  committees and governments of Hunjiang and Tonghua cities and by  the Tonghua county party committee.    During the past few years, especially in 1993, Hunjiang and  Tonghua cities conscientiously paid attention to their work and  showed much creativity in some aspects. They achieved fairly  great steps, rapid development, and notable results in reform,  opening up, economic construction, and other undertakings. A  number of very convincing examples have emerged. Comrade He  Zhukang fully affirmed this. He said: I am very much inspired  by your achievements, which prove that we have great potential  for economic development. As long as we adhere to the party's  basic line, emancipate our minds, and seize the opportunity to  work in a down-to-earth manner, accelerate reform and  development, and pool the efforts of all fields to work in  unison, the province will successfully attain the goal of  promoting its economy to a new height.    Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: The third plenary session of  the 14th party Central Committee made a decision of the CPC  Central Committee on the several issues concerning the  establishment of the socialist market economy system. The  second plenary session of the sixth provincial party committee  put forward clear arrangements and specific requirements for  implementing the guidelines of the third plenary session of the  14th party Central Committee, promoting Jilin's reform focusing  on establishing the socialist market economy system, and  accelerating the development of its economic construction and  other undertakings. Our current basic task is to implement the  arrangements with great efforts. By doing work in a creative  manner, we mean chiefly implementation in a creative manner. We  should give full play to our subjective initiative, carry out  all work in a down-to-earth manner, and fulfill our tasks at  high standards. We are currently in an important period for  great development and great change. Faced with the new  situation in which opportunities and difficulties exist  simultaneously and changes are rapid, leading cadres at all  levels should diligently use their minds to analyze the  situation, study new conditions and new problems, understand in  a timely manner people's state of mind, be clearheaded to  estimate favorable and unfavorable factors, and distinguish the  essentials from the nonessentials. In the condition of the  market economy, sources and geographical position are not  absolute conditions, and they all depend on human effort.  Regarding the endeavors we think are worthwhile, we should  develop bravely as long as we have the basic conditions for them  and never lose the opportunity. Those who understand this early  and take action early will gain the initiative. Reform will be  carried out across the board this year in a range and quality  unprecedented in history. If we can correctly estimate the  situation, think over some issues in advance, and accurately  seize the opportunity, we will acquire more foresight in doing  work, adopt realistic measures, and make correct policy  decisions. It is totally possible for us, the latecomers, to  attain our goals and surpass the old-timers.    Our general demand is emancipating the mind, seizing the  opportunity to accelerate reform and development, promoting  development with reform, and continuing reform in the process of  development. Faced with the new situation and tasks, leading  cadres should further emancipate their minds, embrace new  concepts, form new ideas, and have more spirit of exploration  and creation. Work compatible with the three advantages should  be bravely experimented and explored so that reform, opening up,  and economic construction can be facilitated continuously.    Comrade He Zhukang said: Favorable conditions are numerous  for this year's work. When making work arrangements, we should  adopt a higher starting point, higher goals, and quicker steps.  We should tap potential, fully develop our advantages, boost  the enthusiasm of all fields, and pool the efforts of all people  to achieve great development bravely. On the premise of this,  we should carry out meticulous work and adopt different measures  to resolve different difficulties, contradictions, and problems.    Comrade He Zhukang pointed out: We should further change  leadership methods. When carrying out economic and other work,  we should focus on priorities, achieve breakthroughs in  resolving difficulties, and avoid vague generalization. We  should coordinate the effort to change concepts with that to  solve specific problems, both noting that new conditions are  unavoidable in the process of reform and resolving new  contradictions and new problems in a timely manner. In line  with market demand and the principle of improving efficiency, we  should adjust the ownership structure, the industrial  composition, and product mix. We should strengthen  macroeconomic regulation and control as well as enterprise  management, step up efforts in scientific and technological  advance, bring in advanced technology through the market to  carry out technical transformation, and establish our superior  industries and highly competitive products amid competition. We  should strengthen marketing and actively open up the market. We  should appoint able and virtuous people, improve leading bodies,  and do a good job in training workers to improve their overall  quality.    Comrade He Zhukang said: In developing the socialist market  economy, we should also rely on the masses. The more arduous  and heavier our tasks are, the more we should boost the  enthusiasm of workers. We should intensify the ideological and  political education of enterprises to enhance workers' sense of  masters. We should firmly rely on the vast number of workers  and pool their wisdom and efforts to operate enterprises  successfully. We should encourage them to participate in  management in a democratic manner to suggest ways and means,  rely on the collective wisdom to surmount difficulties, and  create a new situation.    Comrade He Zhukang urged: Cadres at all levels should remain  clearheaded in the excellent situation and properly handle the  relationship between reform and development on the one hand and  stability on the other. They should have a full understanding  of the uneven development, show concern for the people's life,  give heed to their opinions and voice, succeed in  comprehensively improving public security, and safeguard social  stability. In rural areas, we should greatly develop the  collective economy. There should be collectively operated  projects at the village level in order to reduce the burdens on  peasants. To resolve the difficulties in the life of the  workers of the enterprises whose production is suspended totally  or partly, we should have a long-term viewpoint and establish a  social security system. Governments and enterprises may further  relax policies and systems to encourage the masses to open up  broad avenues for employment. Meanwhile, we should adopt  effective measures to ensure the basic life of the workers of  suspended enterprises. Leading cadres at all levels should make  it a system to make contacts frequently with the workers and  peasant households who have temporary difficulties in their  life. We should fully develop our political advantages, the  role of party organizations as fighting bastions, the role of  party members as vanguards and models, and the role of trade  unions, Communist Youth League, and women's federations as  bridges and channels.    Also participating in the investigation and study activities  were responsible comrades of the general office of the  provincial party committee, the provincial trade union council,  and the provincial commission for restructuring of the economy.</p>

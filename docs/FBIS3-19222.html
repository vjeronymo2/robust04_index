The reference was to  previous summits and meetings in which the leading seven  industrial powers have put their names to declarations urging  certain macro-economic targets or generic forms of economic  convergence.    Here in Detroit, however, the whole agenda revolves round  the  very real question of what should be done about workers whose  qualifications are now becoming irrelevant as their jobs are  eliminated by technological advance.    According to Italian Treasury Minister Piero Barucci,  however, macro-economic policies concerning interest rates and  so on should not lose sight of objectives such as balanced  growth and tangible advantages for those who work in the various  economies. Following this line of thinking, Italy will be using  the conference to urge the G-7 to create a task force "on the  problems of the real economy," one Italian official disclosed.    Filling in the background to the Italian position, the  official said there must be improvements in real cooperation  between the G-7 nations in all fields and sectors. At the same  time, budget adjustments needed to fight inflation should not be  seen as a justification for "indiscriminate cuts in welfare."    According to this official, the G-7 must seek to develop  policies and institutions to ensure a balanced spread of new  technologies and improvements in efficiency to "reduce the  inequities of international trade."    "One question is to avoid one area such as the United States  being in the middle of an economic boom when another area such  as Europe is still getting to grips with the recession," said  Labour Minister Gino Giugni. He also argued for a new European  Union pact to avoid discharging the costs of convergence between  the European economies onto the "real economy," with an  increasing gap between welfare and the indicators for the real  economy.</p>

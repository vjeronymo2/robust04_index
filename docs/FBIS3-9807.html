			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hungarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Janos Latorcai, industry and trade minister </F> and a member of the Christian Democratic People's Party, by  Dezso Pinter; place and date not given: "I Made the Necessary  Step at the Right Time"]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Pinter] According to a  leading official of the European Union, it is difficult to  imagine Hungary's membership and development without a strong  middle class. What are your views on the chances of this  fledgling stratum of society?    [Latorcai] Well-functioning democracies and economies base  themselves on the bourgeoisie, and the middle class is an  essential part of this. Our conditions are still confused, we  cannot yet talk about an organized market economy, and the  middle classes are still missing. However, we can already see  how and where they will be established. One way of establishing  them is through the economic policy creating more opportunity  for domestic entrepreneurs. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] A strong middle class cannot exist without a  proprietor group that is becoming richer and more efficient. In  your view, does a group like this exist in Hungary?    [Latorcai] Yes, it does. To make it bigger, loans have been  and still are needed because the personal savings have proved to  be too small. In spite of all this, partly as a result of the  role of foreign capital, some 35 percent of Hungarian industry  is in private ownership and, in 1993, this 35 percent produced  50 percent of the output. This is important and encouraging  data when it comes to formulating the ideas of the Christian  Democratic People's Party [KDNP] aimed at economic growth.    [Pinter] What is the essence of these ideas?    [Latorcai] First of all, the stimulation of enterprises. We  would particularly like to continue and to expand the support  for small- and medium-size enterprises. One method of this  would be a new regulation of tax and credit policy and the  expansion of help for new enterprises. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] In this program, which components criticize the  current economic policy?    [Latorcai] A change of philosophy is most important in our  view. It should be the economy, rather than the budget, that  determines the situation of the country and, as far as possible,  which also determines the budget. Therefore, it is necessary to  prepare a new regulation of state finances. In the interest of  a more proportionate share of the burdens, we want to move from  an income-type taxation toward a consumption-type taxation;  taxing the accumulated large assets and, in personal taxation,  giving greater weight to family taxation are unavoidable. And  while we are talking about the criticism of the current  practice: A change of direction has to be implemented in  economic policy that will give greater scope to the state's role  to the extent that is necessary, but not work against the market  processes. A lasting industrial growth is impossible without  developing its dynamic branches, therefore, we want to improve  the investment conditions, we are planning to change the  amortization system, we would like to give tax allowances for  investments, and we would expand the preferential loan packages.  It is essential to draw up a nationwide program of  infrastructure development because this development creates an  additional demand in the economy, creates work opportunities,  and boosts the domestic market. In privatization, we want to  extend the proprietor groups in society, to ensure that the  privatization of the state assets is done in a planned,  controllable, and visible way. The revenues from privatization  should not be used to restore the short-term budget balance  because these amounts are needed in the reorganization of the  economy, industry, or the given company. We find it necessary  to increase the involvement of foreign working capital.    [Pinter] Are you not afraid that even your own voters will  accuse you of selling off the country? Such comments cannot  only be heard from the supporters of parties that are said to be  extremists.    [Latorcai] I know about this, I can hear it, and I am  sufficiently annoyed about it. My reply is that 10 to 12  percent of the national assets are in question. In the vast  majority of privatizations and investments with foreign capital,  technologies, and factory and labor managements that are more  modern than the domestic ones have been implemented, and they  have helped our domestic products gain access to the markets of  developed countries. The favorable influence the joint ventures  have on their suppliers when they insist on deadlines and  regular good quality is worth noticing. Having said all this, I  must say that, in the interest of increasing the domestic  entrepreneurial willingness, the KDNP does not want to  differentiate between domestic and foreign investments. This is  one of the reasons it is important to involve a large proportion  of domestic savings in the economy. A better offer of credits  and bank privatization implemented while a modern banking system  is established is a short step away from this. [passage omitted]    [Pinter] You are also probably familiar with the view that  the KDNP's current behavior is like a political conjurer's trick  because the party is showing a striking flexibility regarding  its participation in a coalition after the elections. Do these  views offend you?    [Latorcai] The KDNP has become one of the most important  factors in Hungarian politics, and it would be strange if its  behavior was not surrounded by speculations. The KDNP will  certainly not govern together with forces that do not accept the  civilized value system that has been established in Europe. In  the interest of raising the nation, the KDNP lays great emphasis  on creating consensus. I agree with this, and as an economic  expert, I know that those who create and implement the economic  policy that is our future will need an as broad as possible  consensus. Since the KDNP has many values, we can certainly  assess the values of other parties, too. We can determine how  suitable these values, together, are for serving the nation. To  remain in my professional area, the KDNP certainly will not join  a partner that lets inflation loose, increases unemployment, and  further increases the country's indebtedness, because these  kinds of conditions would make the futures of our children and  even our grandchildren uncertain.

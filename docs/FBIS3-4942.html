			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he and his cabinet will  not do anything, including reversing the decision to ban British  firms from new government contracts, until the British press  learns to speak the truth. He said it is very difficult for the  British press to report the truth.    He said Malaysia is not asking British Premier John Major to  apologize or anyone else to do anything to solve the existing  relations between the two countries. However, the prime  minister said this is the time for the British press to do the  right thing.    He was replying to questions posed by newsmen after  attending  the breaking of fast with the orphaned and handicapped children  in Kuala Lumpur. Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said that the decision  made in the cabinet meeting last Friday has nothing to do with  the British Government, people, and its businessmen.    When asked about Major's statement that Malaysia is  shortsighted and unjustified in banning British firms from new  government contracts, Datuk Sri Dr. Mahathir said he will find  out whether Major's statement was true or just misreported by  the British press.</p>

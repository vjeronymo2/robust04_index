			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Pakistan successfully has test-fired its first long-range, surface-to-surface  missiles, its army chief, Gen. Mirza Aslam Beg, said. Quoted by the official  Associated Press of Pakistan, Beg told military officers that two versions of  the missiles, with a range of 185 miles and 50 miles respectively, were tested  recently. "These missiles, including their guidance systems, have been  developed indigenously," he said, adding that Pakistan would also be able to  roll out its first homemade tanks within two years. Beg called the missile  production a "landmark achievement" by Pakistan. The development, however,  could signal renewed tension between India and Pakistan, which have fought  three wars since independence from Britain in 1947.  </P></p>

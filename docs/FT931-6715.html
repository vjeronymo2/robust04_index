			<p>930227 FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: A wealth of reading - Bernice Cohen picks her best books for DIY investment A CRUCIAL element in being a Dimi (do-it-myself investor), running a share portfolio based mainly on my own research efforts, is deciding on my underlying philosophy. Building a library of books on systems developed by successful investors was one of six practical steps for improving my investment skills. But reading books on other people's philosophy was a good route for discovering what type of investor I am (although during this learning process it was hard to stick to Jim Slater's excellent advice of finding and adopting a good system and then working with it to improve results). Some of my costliest mistakes arose from trying to copy someone's method without realising it conflicted with my own attitudes. To minimise this mismatch, I make notes on key points in these how-to-invest books. The summaries then form a synopsis of my personal approach to investing. Every library needs at least one basic reference guide to cope with the jargon and other technicalities of investment. My choice is the Investors Chronicle Beginners' Guide to Investment by Bernard Gray (Business Books Limited, 1991). It is up to date and comprehensive enough to answer almost every relevant question. I found Jack Schwager's Market Wizards (Harper &amp; Row, 1989) an ideal choice for an introduction to the many different investment approaches. His interviews with 17 top traders contain plenty of philosophical worth. I was attracted instantly to some and wanted more information: in particular, about investing along the lines suggested in the William O'Neil interview. Later, I discovered his book, How to Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill, 1991), at Parks, the London specialist finance and accounting bookseller. (It also has shops in Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow and a catalogue service). O'Neil is a growth investor par excellence and this book still ranks as the one that has influenced me the most. Another instructive read is John Train's The Midas Touch (Harper &amp; Row, 1987). It discusses the methods of Warren Buffett, one of the most successful value investors of our time. Buffett's grasp of company fundamentals is legendary: he buys undervalued situations and waits for the market to catch up. I do not trust my abilities enough to identify such situations (and lack funds to exploit them, anyway). But this has allowed me to concentrate on investment philosophies that suit my temperament. This has given me the confidence to be a Dimi, relying totally on my own research and analysis efforts to find good growth stocks. Peter Lynch is another exceptional value investor: for many years, he managed Fidelity's highly successful Magellan fund. His book, One Up On Wall Street (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989), is subtitled, 'How to use what you already know to make money in the market.' He suggests that anyone can ferret out good investment opportunities ahead of the professionals by observing local businesses and industries. But my greatest benefit was derived from his analysis of how to pick winners, and his simple explanations of the crucial numbers that make up the basics for stock selection. His attitude to research is exemplary, and he writes: 'Investing without research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards.' In One Up On Wall Street, Peter Lynch introduces the term 'diworsification' to describe companies that stray from their core businesses in search of extra profits - often a disastrous move. I have adopted this word to describe my difficulties in holding a large, diversified portfolio. I have found that nurturing a few growth stocks with giant potentials (which I call KPPs - King Penguin Potentials) has been more successful than tending a larger clutch which, by the law of averages, must contain some mediocrities. It is difficult to discover six really good growth situations, so attempting to find 10 is my idea of diworsification. Stan Weinstein is a growth investor whose book, Secrets for Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets (Dow Jones-Irwin, 1988), deals exclusively with American stocks. I have learnt a great deal from his chartist approach. US investors get more company and chart information than those in the UK, but the book is packed with material that applies anywhere, to any stock market. He also gives detailed guidance on indicators for spotting the start of a major bear or bull market. The Zulu Principle (Orion, 1992) by another growth investor, Jim Slater, gives good tips on picking growth shares, but I found the chapter on recovery situations to be most interesting, especially since many such opportunities should arise this year if the economy emerges from recession. Finally, Blood in the Streets (1988) and The Great Reckoning (1992) by James Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg (Sidgwick and Jackson) give excellent overviews of the political and economic forces which increasingly affect investment strategies. Although some financial books have a reputation for being hard to read and expensive, I enjoy building my library and feel it amply repays the time involved.</p>

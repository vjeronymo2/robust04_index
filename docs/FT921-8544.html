			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / Survey of Portable Computers (11): More power for the palmtop - Handheld Computers LITTLE MORE than a decade ago, the only 'portable' computers were the size, shape and weight of luggable sewing machines, and IBM PCs, with 64K of memory, were just beginning to grace office desktops. Since then, technology has enabled computer manufacturers to pack more and more power and memory into ever-smaller boxes and make the computer-on-a-chip all but a reality. Laptops replaced the early transportable computers, and then came the clam-shell notebook computer. The latest notebook portables boast colour screens, massive hard disks and Intel 80486 processors, giving them the power of the fastest desktops, all in a package smaller and lighter than an average telephone directory. For some users, however, it seems that even the notebook computer is too big to carry around. Enter the palmtop, or handheld computer, some of which are little bigger than a large sardine can and weigh less than half a bag of sugar. A growing number and variety of palmtop computers are now available. Some offer little more than the features of an electronic organiser, while others cater for specialist niche markets such as on-site data collection. But many of these are now beginning to mimic the full-function desktop computer. According to some analysts, the worldwide market for hand-held computers will be worth Pounds 3bn by 1994. At the same time, palmtop machines are already taking a larger share of the portable computer market. Zenith Data Systems has estimated that palmtops' share of the portable market will reach 10 per cent by 1995. The palmtop computer market was pioneered in the late 1980s by Sharp, the Japanese consumer electronics giant which claims to have invented the electronic organiser, and Psion, the UK-based manufacturer of the successful Psion Organiser. Some machines, such as the Casio SF9500 and the Sharp IQ range, clearly derive from the early electronic organisers which began to replace the calculator and paper-based personal organisers a few years ago. One, the Kyocera Refalo, actually comes in the form of a ring binder. Typically, these machines are equipped with built-in functions such as calculator, clock, address book, scheduler and notebook usually accessed via a set of dedicated menu keys, that are now near-standard. More sophisticated machines, like the Sharp IQ 8000, use plug-in flash E-Prom cards to expand memory and provide other tailor-made programmes including spreadsheets, translators, and specialised scientific and business calculators - thus, one for the Sharp will calculate the size of radiators needed in a central heating installation. Although they generally do not run industry standard software, most palmtops can also exchange data with a desktop computer via software and a hard-wire link or over the telephone line using a modem. Since most of them have small and difficult-to-use keyboards, downloading data from the office machine for use while on the move is a particular attraction. A second group of machines has begun to appear on the market in the last year or so. These can lay claim to be more like shrunken full-function desktops - although nearly all have some limitations in terms of absolute compatibility. This group includes Sharp's recently unveiled but not-yet-released PC3000 video cassette-sized palmtop, the Hewlett-Packard 95LX, the Poqet PC, the dip Pocket PC, the Psion Series 3 and the Microwriter AgendA. The first four run MS-Dos or an equivalent from Rom memory chips and can therefore run standard PC software - but with some limitations due to Ram memory size and the physical limitations of keyboard and screen. Though most of the new batch of machines resembles each other, all have some special features. The British-built Psion Series 3, the successor to Psion Organiser, uses a PC-style processor but does not run MS-Dos. Instead, it can be programmed in a Basic-like language that Psion calls OPL. Its powerful built-in applications, which include a spreadsheet compatible with Lotus 1-2-3 and a word processor compatible with Microsoft's Word, can share data with programmes on a PC and files are saved to its two Flash E-Prom memory card slots in MS-Dos format. The AgendA is distinctive for several reasons, including its innovative rapid entry microwriting language - substituting just five keys for the usual 26 needed to produce the full range of letters, and its screen which unlike all the others is not in a hinged lid. As for the Sharp 3000 and the Poqet PC, their liquid crystal screens, while still not of VGA standard, are able to display a full 80 columns by 25 lines. However none of the screens is backlit, which saves battery power, a precious commodity. In general, the new palmtops manage to run for between 40 and 120 hours on small AA batteries or Lithium packs aided by a high level of integration, low power consumption chips and advanced power management techniques. With the exception of the AgendA, all come with somewhat cramped Qwerty keyboards, but of strikingly different qualities and are generally more appropriate for short memos than for producing large documents. All provide built-in functions such as address books, calculators, diaries and notepads or slimmed down wordprocessors, often under a dedicated menu key, while some boast additional features including tone telephone dialers, communications programmes, databases and spreadsheets. The Pocket PC, with its single expansion card slot, is equivalent to the Atari Portfolio and can run all the Portfolio's software cards. With eyes clearly on the individual business user several offer Lotus 1-2-3-compatible spreadsheets and the HP 95LX comes bundled with a version of Lotus 1-2-3 itself. Most either produce files which are compatible with desktop applications or will convert files into formats that can be used by other machines. Removable memory cards are also a common feature, together with software and cables to allow them to be hooked up to modems, printers and desktop PCs. Most of the machines still use proprietary slot-in cards for memory and additional software applications but a de facto palmtop PC standard is emerging. The Hewlett-Packard, Poqet and Sharp palmtops all come with new Flash Ram memory card slots conforming to the PC Memory Card Interface Association and an optional PCMCIA card adapter is available for the Pocket PC. These lightweight cards, the size of a small stack of credit cards, can be read-only or read-write and hold up to 2Mb of data at present although larger capacities, up to 64Mb, are on the drawing board. PCMCIA cards are expensive at around Pounds 350 for a 1Mb card, but prices should begin to drop as more manufacturers adopt the standard. An external card drive can be bought for about Pounds 165 and plugs into the parallel interface, allowing data to be exchanged with a desktop - or another palmtop. A third specialist group of hand-held computers - some derived from machines mentioned above - is designed primarily as data collection devices or for use in industrial or other non-office environments. Psion, Tandy's Victor Technologies/Grid subsidiary and Husky Computers among others manufacture hand-held machines used as portable input/output devices mainly by meter readers, market researchers or for stocktaking, using a bar code reader or other input device. The market for this type of machine is growing rapidly. Prudential Insurance has just placed what it claims is the world's largest order for hand-held computers, spending an estimated Pounds 7m for 7,600 Husky Hunters to improve the reliability of data capture and reduce the time between collecting data and sending it back to a local or central office. The computers will replace the old paper-based collection book carried by the insurers' door-to-door salesmen. Overall, the palmtop computer market is becoming increasingly competitive, but it is also still a young and diverse product market with few established standards. It may therefore be some time before it matures and becomes a cut-throat commodity-type market like those for larger computers. Inevitably, the human body imposes limitations on the workable size of screen and keyboard which designers have so far failed to overcome. As a result, palmtop computers, even the latest generation, are designed around a series of compromises. Some analysts predict that notepad computers will grab 20 per cent of the portable market by the mid-1990s - overtaking palmtops themselves. Communication between computers, including palmtops, is also likely to become simpler and more automated. Several manufacturers, including NEC and Poqet, have already developed radio communication versions of their portables and Hewlett-Packard's palmtop includes an infra-red 'window' in its casing which allows it to communicate without wires with other HP machines. The prospect of combining the palmtop with a cellular telephone or other wireless transmitter raises the possibility of computer-to-computer communications anywhere without any cables. The latest palmtops are already a far cry from their earlier portable cousins, but there is still some way to go before the dream of real pocket-sized computing power becomes a reality. What is certain is that this, too, will come sooner rather than later.</p>

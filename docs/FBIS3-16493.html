			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Candidate of Technical Sciences A.S. </F> Golovizin, general director of the "Partner" Crimean association  for economic cooperation and chairman of the Economic Council of  the Union of Entrepreneurs of the Crimean Republic, by V.  Savchenko; place and date not given: "How Long Will We Continue  To Operate Outside the Law?"]    [Text] A day hardly goes by now when there is not a report  in the newspaper, or over radio and television, on the shutdown  of one enterprise or another, on energy supply problems, or on  failure to make payments. Things are bad everywhere in  industry, in agriculture, and in the business structures engaged  in production. They are very bad. How can we overcome this  crisis in the economy? Is it not time to stop destroying our  production? These and other questions disturb Candidate of  Technical Sciences A.S. Golovizin, general director of the  "Partner" Crimean association for economic cooperation and  chairman of the Economic Council of the Union of Entrepreneurs  of the Crimean Republic, who speaks with us today.    [Golovizin] When you analyze crisis situations in other  countries, you see that the one thing that survives is  transnational companies--which have a diversified structure of  production and trade, and powerful investments in scientific  development. But we, unfortunately, in essence primarily a  transnational company, have initiated the destruction of all  economic ties with partners in the former USSR.    [Savchenko] But this is not the only factor that led to the  collapse of the economy.    [Golovizin] Yes. The state also failed to concern itself  with drawing up state orders. Whereas in the West a powerful  struggle ensues to obtain these, up to and including bribing  members of the parliament, we have no experience at all in  incorporating them. Having declared that it would pursue the  option of defense industry conversion, the state should have  determined priority programs, presented them on a competitive  basis as state orders among enterprises, allocated financing on  preferential terms for production development, and afforded tax  privileges, and as they say, move on from there. But nothing of  the kind took place either in Ukraine or in Russia.    We have reached the point today when 70 percent, on the  average, of the equipment at enterprises is physically worn out,  and a full 90 percent are obsolete; and no efforts are under way  to replace it. We see a degradation of our entire production.    Following in Russia's footsteps, Ukraine repeated its  serious  mistake and announced the liberalization of prices under  conditions of deeply entrenched monopolism. Everyone is now  getting a personal sense of what this alienation of the state  from price regulation has brought about. Incidentally, not one  recognized economist in the West suggested that we carry out  such proposals.    [Savchenko] Also characteristic of Ukraine is the fiscal  system of taxation. Crimean producers have been screaming about  this for the past two years, but, alas, no one is listening.    [Golovizin] In a speech that I delivered before the Third  Ukrainian Congress of Entrepreneurs, attended by the president  and the deputy prime minister, I stated that the Government of  Ukraine was the chief racketeer in Ukraine, the state racketeer.  Under the present system of taxation, it is at times necessary,  for every ruble of trade production output, to hand over 1.6 in  the form of taxes. Where else do you see that? And this is  happening at a time when our wage standards have dropped  significantly, although you constantly hear it said that reforms  are being conducted for the benefit of the individual, for the  sake of improving his life, done for his benefit, while actual  results show that the individual is becoming impoverished,  plants are shutting down, production is being curtailed, and  incomes are diminishing.    [Savchenko] The system of taxation has also hit  entrepreneurial structures quite hard. Where have the stock  exchanges gone, for example?    [Golovizin] In 1991 we saw a boom in their establishment.  There were 76 of them in Ukraine, 15 in Crimea. But on 10  February 1992, the parliament of Ukraine adopted the Law on  Taxation, which prescribes that income obtained from stock  exchange activity is subject to tax at a rate of 75 percent. So  you complete a transaction for R1,000 [rubles], but all you have  left is 15--the state collects the rest. Therefore, all the  stock exchanges virtually died. We continue to say that they  are lying on the bottom, like a ship that has suffered colossal  damage.    Knowing, however, that not a single state with any economy  can survive without a stock exchange, we have now decided to  join the Crimean Universal Stock Exchange with the Agricultural  Stock Exchange and begin operations. This is how we are  thinking about getting around the system of taxation.    Can it possibly be a victory for the state when it forces  the  stock exchanges and other entrepreneurs to withdraw into a  shadow economy? After all, we know that something on the order  of 12 trillion karbovantsy are in cash circulation right now.  This money does not go through the banks or help augment the  budget. It is corrupting businessmen and contributing toward  the emergence of racketeering.    [Savchenko] Instead of civilized trade on the stock  exchange, we now have a middleman.    [Golovizin] It is easy to find someone for a soft job.  Thanks to the middlemen who purchase commodities two, three,  and four times from one another, the commodity goes up 1.5- or  2-fold in price. I am convinced that if we return the stock  exchange and wholesale purchase bases to a civilized course and  afford them low-interest credit, the standard of living of the  populace will rise tomorrow. There will be a sharp drop in  prices. And the middlemen will go back to civilized work.  Today many people say they do not want to work on the edge of  violating the law, but otherwise they have to eat bread crumbs.    [Savchenko] How do you feel about the introduction in Crimea  of the system of an open economy?    [Golovizin] With its available potential, Crimea has to be  an international business center. It is situated at a  crossroads--of trade, political, cultural, and spiritual paths.  This is a unique position. In the West they determine the  optimal zone of economic relations using a compass. They draw a  circle with radius of 600 km. Some 22 independent, highly  developed states find themselves neighbors with Crimea in such a  circle. Where else in the world could you find such a unique  position?    [Savchenko] What is the best possible thing for our  structures of authority and entrepreneurial structures to do?    [Golovizin] They must enter into direct ties with other  states, including Russia, create joint enterprises, and act more  boldly. Here in Crimea we have all the conditions for  establishment of a business center, including suitable buildings  that could house the headquarters for economic reform of Crimea.  Here we must attract the entire scientific potential of the  republic.    [Savchenko] All possible kinds of funds and joint-stock  companies have recently been sprouting up everywhere. Readers  are constantly asking: "Can they be trusted?" How do you answer  them?    [Golovizin] There is not a single fund, not a single joint-  stock company advertising itself in the newspapers or on  television that carries out its main practical functions.  Stockholders do not know what kind of charter fund they have,  how accumulation of funds takes place, in what specific  undertaking funds are invested, or what safeguards are in place.  On the other hand, "the guys" are very good at manipulating  money while having nothing to do with the production that  results in accumulation of the country's basic wealth.    [Savchenko] We will soon elect a new parliament. What  should be the starting point of its work?    [Golovizin] It should start by adopting three laws: one on  the credit and finance system, one on the budget of Crimea, and  another on taxation. This is the basis of development of the  economy. When this is done, we will be able to stand on our  feet and move forward rapidly.</p>

			<p><P> May 23, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> EDUCATOR ADMITS OBSCENE CALLS  </P> <P> Richard E. Berendzen, who has resigned as American University president,  pleaded guilty today to two misdemeanor charges of making obscene telephone  calls from his university office.  </P> <P> Fairfax County General District Court Judge J. Conrad Waters Jr. sentenced  Berendzen to 30 days in jail on each charge, but suspended all the jail time,  provided the Harvard-trained educator stays out of trouble for one year.  </P> <P> "I deeply regret all of this," Berendzen told the judge in his only comment.  Commonwealth's Atty. Robert Horan said Berendzen received the standard  sentence.  </P> <P> Berendzen, 51, resigned April 8 as president of the Washington, D.C.,  university, saying he was exhausted. He was charged May 11 with two misdemeanor  counts of making indecent calls to a day-care provider who is married to a  Fairfax County police officer.  </P> <P> Fairfax County police filed the charges a week after Berendzen left Johns  Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore where he was treated at the Sexual Disorders  Clinic.  </P></p>

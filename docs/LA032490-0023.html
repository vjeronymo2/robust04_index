			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'TENANTS' A CLEVER SOCIAL SATIRE THAT MAY BE METAPHOR FOR IRAN  </P> <P> Darioush Mehrjui's "The Tenants" (Monica 4-Plex) is a fresh breeze from Iran,  of all places. Social satire is not what one would expect from the Iranian  cinema just now, and it's all the more enjoyable as a result. What's more, the  humor of this film, said to be the most popular in the history of the Iranian  cinema, couldn't be more universal.  </P> <P> On the desert-like outskirts of Tehran there stands, virtually in the middle of  nowhere, a seedy apartment house that gives fresh meaning to the concept of  shoddy construction. Ceilings are falling, pipes are bursting, but Abbas  (Ezatolah Entezami), the paunchy, middle-aged manager, has reasons of his own  for not only not making repairs but also forbidding the tenants to do so  themselves.  </P> <P> Sure enough, the fur starts to fly, with much shouting and fisticuffs and lots  more people getting into the act, such as disgruntled repairmen who discover  that no one is willing to pay them and several unscrupulous real estate  wheeler-dealers.  </P> <P> Yet, amid the almost nonstop bombast, we realize that Mehrjui is viewing all  these people in the round, with compassion and without passing judgment. That  the tenants are in the right and Abbas is in the wrong does not prevent Mehrjui  from illuminating the foibles of human nature in one and all and, beyond this,  celebrating everyone's fundamental humanity. The film runs a bit long for a  comedy, but its extra time is well spent.  </P> <P> On the surface, "The Tenants" is a surprising film for Mehrjui, a top Iranian  filmmaker for two decades, considering the somberness of the two films, "The  Cow" (1968) and "The Cycle" (1974), for which he is known in the West. The  first deals with the dependency of a peasant (also played by Entezami) upon his  cow, and the second, a masterpiece in the Neo-Realist style, tells of an old  man and his grandson who come to Tehran in the last years of the shah's regime  only to become destroyed by its corruption.  </P> <P> If in that film the old man becoming forced to sell his blood takes on a  clearly critical symbolism, can we not then take the apartment house of "The  Tenants" (Times-rated Family) as a symbol of the state of contemporary Iranian  society? Master of allegory that he is, Mehrjui shrewdly leaves the answers up  to us.  </P></p>

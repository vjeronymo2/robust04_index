			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Focus on Africa" program] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On the preparations for the  weekend, Sola Odunfa reports from Lagos:    [Begin Odunfa recording] The inspector general of police,  Mr. Ibrahim Commassie, today warned Chief Moshood Abiola not to  allow himself to be sworn in as president of Nigeria or to form  a parallel government to that of General Sani Abacha. Mr.  Commassie told a special press conference in Lagos this  afternoon that if Chief Abiola went ahead with his plans, it  would amount to an act of treason and he would be arrested and  charged to court. Mr. Commassie, who is in Lagos to personally  direct police operations against planned protest demonstrations  by opponents of the government of Gen. Abacha, said that the  security forces were well and fully prepared to deal with any  persons who might try to foment trouble in the next few days.  He described the prodemocracy activists as unpatriotic  Nigerians and enemies of peace, who are seeking to take over  power by creating a state of anarchy in the country. The law,  he warned, has fangs for those who cross it. [end recording]</p>

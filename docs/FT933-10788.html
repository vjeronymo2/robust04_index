			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Moslem leader threatens to quit Bosnia talks: Izetbegovic calls on Serbs to halt Sarajevo attacks BOSNIA'S President Alija Izetbegovic yesterday threatened to pull out of peace talks in Geneva unless Serb troops halted their attacks near Sarajevo, the capital, and at Brcko in the north-east of the republic. Mr Izetbegovic said he had warned international mediators Lord Owen and Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg that he would abandon the talks if the Serbs continued to tighten their stranglehold on Bosnian cities. His threat came as Serb forces were reported by the Belgrade-based Tanjug news agency to have seized control of Bjelasnica, a mountain overlooking the south-west of Saravejo. Serb forces now control all but part of one hill surrounding Sarajevo, which has been under siege for 16 months. Bosnian Serbs, however, denied that their forces were on the offensive. The warning from Mr Izetbegovic came after a day of negotiations in Geneva during which representatives of Bosnia's Moslems, Serbs and Croats met under United Nations auspices to try to hammer out agreement over the borders for a new 'union' of three ethnic republics. Under a news blackout, the peace mediators were understood to have tried to put pressure on Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, to hand over land to Bosnia's Moslems, who control just 10 per cent of the republic's territory. Mr Karadzic at the weekend offered to cede 15 per cent of the 72 per cent of the republic controlled by Serb forces, but there appeared to be no tangible concessions in the talks. The international mediators have set a target of 30 per cent of the land for Moslems, a figure they see as a minimum for the functioning of a viable state. Mr Izetbegovic at the weekend endorsed ethnic partition. 'Compared to what was planned for us, I hope that we fared rather well because we survived,' he told Sarajevo radio. However, in an effort to prevent the republic's carve-up, three members of the Bosnian presidency joined opposition deputies in protest against what they saw as the west's abandonment of Bosnia. They painted a dark picture of betrayal and an uncertain future under 'fascist' ethnic mini-states. As the talks continued, snipers shot dead three people and wounded another five as they tried to flee Sarajevo by crossing the UN-controlled airport, said UN officials. In a sign that a settlement would fuel the 'map-war' between Moslems and Croats, Bosnian radio reported intense fighting in central and northern Bosnia as mainly Moslem forces tried to secure more territory. The US said yesterday it was prepared to act alone militarily to stem violence in Bosnia. A State Department spokesman, speaking in Ireland while accompanying Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, who was en route to the Middle East, said however that Nato soundings indicated support for US air strikes. These would be possible 'within days'. Breakthrough for a broken land, Page 12</p>

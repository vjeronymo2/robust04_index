			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INCORPORATION DRIVE SNARES RELUCTANT DEVELOPERS;  </P> <P> CALABASAS: CITYHOOD PROPONENTS ARE JUBILANT AS LAFCO EXCLUDES ONLY ONE OF NINE  BUILDERS FROM THE PROPOSED BOUNDARIES.  </P> <P> Six developers were rebuffed Wednesday in their attempt to win exclusion from  the boundaries of the proposed city of Calabasas.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Local Agency Formation Commission, the government panel  charged with overseeing incorporation proposals, agreed to exclude only one of  nine developers who sought to be outside the city boundaries.  </P> <P> Two other developers withdrew their requests.  </P> <P> The successful developer was the Los Angeles-based Johnston Group, which has  one more office building to construct in a business park off the Ventura  Freeway.  </P> <P> Cityhood supporters hailed the decision as a victory.  </P> <P> "I believe we're over most of our severe hurdles and don't anticipate any  problems will show up," said Bob Hill, president of the Calabasas Cityhood  Committee.  </P> <P> The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which sets the election date, is  expected to hold a hearing on the issue in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> If approved by the supervisors and by area voters, the new city of Calabasas,  population 27,000, would be about 11 square miles located in the Santa Monica  Mountains west of the San Fernando Valley.  </P> <P> Hill and other cityhood advocates finally allowed themselves to laugh, shake  one another's hands and even hug on Wednesday -- the most emotion they have  shown since commission hearings began July 11.  </P> <P> Because their cityhood drives failed in 1981 and 1988, they have said they do  not want to celebrate prematurely.  </P> <P> The Johnston Group tempered the otherwise jubilant mood.  </P> <P> Not only was the company's Malibu Canyon Business Park/Corporate Center exempt  from the proposed city, but on Tuesday it filed suit against the commission for  approving Calabasas' independence without first conducting an environmental  review.  </P> <P> Calvin H. Johnston, the company's general partner, said he filed the Superior  Court lawsuit out of concern that a new city would block construction of roads  crucial to a regional transportation plan.  </P> <P> But cityhood proponents said they did not consider the lawsuit a serious threat  and expected incorporation to be placed on the March, 1991, ballot for voters'  approval.  </P> <P> Most of the developers seeking exclusion said they were already applying for  building approvals from the county and were loathe to begin the process with a  new bureaucracy.  </P> <P> They also said they feared that a new City Council would enact a building  moratorium, delaying their projects and costing them substantial sums of money.  </P> <P> Commission attorney Clark Alsop acknowledged that newly incorporated cities can  freeze construction for as long as 30 months while they adopt a general plan.  </P> <P> During the last few weeks, the cityhood committee -- concerned that the  exemptions would leave town fathers with little control over local land use --  met with the builders to persuade them otherwise.  </P> <P> In rejecting most builders' requests, the commission agreed with cityhood  advocates that the properties' exclusion would carve up the proposed city,  leaving Calabasas without cohesive boundaries.  </P> <P> Commissioners also noted that several of the developers had already received  county planning approvals that would be difficult for a city to challenge.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, two developers -- Ring Financial, and a joint venture between Cabot,  Cabot &amp; Forbes and the Currey-Riach Co. -- delighted cityhood champions by  withdrawing their exclusion requests.  </P> <P> "This is a very classy group of people you have here seeking incorporation,"  said attorney Douglas Ring, who represented his uncle Ellis Ring's company. "I  am genuinely impressed with them."  </P> <P> Johnston, who owns four shopping centers in Calabasas, said the only purpose of  his lawsuit was to ensure that Calabasas wouldn't thwart regional  transportation plans.  </P> <P> He said Ventura Freeway alternative routes were crucial to his properties and  his tenants.  </P> <P> But cityhood advocates noted that they had worked out a transportation  agreement with the county that would provide an alternative to the freeway.  </P> <P> And committee member Dennis Washburn suggested that the suit was really  designed to stall incorporation until Johnston wins approval for his business  park's eighth and final structure.  </P> <P> Planned at eight stories -- five above the level of the freeway and three below  -- the mid-rise office building would be the tallest in the business park,  Johnston said.  </P> <P> Washburn said its height would be precedent-setting in the area and bound to  stir controversy.  </P> <P> Although Johnston denied that approval of the final building was his true goal,  his attorney, Rogert L. Stanard, acknowledged that delays could be "a side  benefit" of the suit.  </P></p>

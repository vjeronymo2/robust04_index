			<p>940221 FT  21 FEB 94 / EU environment laws will 'cost companies billions' The costs to British companies of complying with European Union environmental policy are continuing to rise and will run into billions of pounds, says a report published today. Mr Adrian Wilkes, author of the report by Environmental Policy Consultants, a London-based consultancy, says: 'A torrent of policy proposals is about to be unleashed, presenting British business with an unprecedented challenge.' The survey, which identifies 96 environmental policy proposals in the pipeline, says all companies will be affected by tighter controls on pollution, the need to use energy more efficiently and requirements to disclose information. The report argues that phasing out HCFCs - chemicals that deplete the atmosphere's ozone layer - could cost the UK food industry Pounds 500m. 'Britain's political campaign to stop the momentum of Brussels policy-making has failed,' says Mr Wilkes. Ten days ago Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the environmental commissioner, repeated his refusal to give the UK more time to comply with water directives. Environmentalists yesterday attacked the report's conclusions. Mr Andrew Lees, campaigns director of Friends of the Earth, the pressure group, said: 'It is the member countries and the European Council of Ministers who are driving this regulation along - it is wrong to blame the (European) Commission.'

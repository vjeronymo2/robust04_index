			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Liu Huaqing, a top  leader of China's armed forces, today urged officers and men of  the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to provide a "powerful  security guarantee" for China's reform, opening up and  modernization drive.    In a group discussion with PLA deputies about the government  work report, Liu, vice-chairman of the Central Military  Commission, said that PLA must also redouble their efforts to  modernize China's national defense.    He said that PLA must help fulfill the overall task of  seizing development opportunities, deepening reforms, opening  China wider to the outwide world, promoting economic development  and maintaining stability as outlined by premier Li Peng in his  government work report.    The leader called on officers and men to make their due  contributions to reform, opening up, economic growth and  national defense.    He said, "ours is a socialist country. Our endeavor to  modernize national defense serves solely to defend ourselves,  defend our motherland's territory, territorial waters and  territorial air space from being infringed, and maintain China's  unification and stability."    The amount of China's annual military expenditure is very  small in the world, said Liu, who is also a standing committee  member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party  Central Committee.    "The Chinese people are a peace-loving people. They have  suffered enormously from invasions by foreign powers over the  past century," he said.    The Chinese people, who have stood up, will never allow any  aggressor to stamp underfoot China's sovereignty and interests,  he said, adding that they will neither seek hegemony nor want to  occupy an inch of land of another country, he stressed.    "China will not pursue an arms race, nor participate in any  military block or seek spheres of influence. This stand of ours  has been consistent," he said.    For a long time to come, China will concentrate on  developing  its productive forces and improving people's living standards,  he said.    "That conforms to the interests of China and those of Asia  and the world at large," he said.    Liu said that last year the Army made new progress in  military training, national defense research and logistic  service.    Speaking of main tasks for the Army at present and in a  period to come, the general said the Army should strengthen its  ideological and political construction, develop modern arms and  equipment, train commanders and professionals with skills needed  in modern warfare and obtain the best combination of men and  weapons through scientific arrangements and strict training in a  bid to raise comprehensively the combat capacity of the Army.    The Army should carry on the fine tradition of hard struggle  and building the Army thriftily and work hard to improve  military and economic efficiency and march forward by overcoming  difficulties ahead, he said.    He also urged the Army to firmly carry forward the fine  tradition of maintaining unity between the Army and the  government and between the Army and the people and make positive  contributions to promoting economic development and social  stability.    The People's Liberation Army should always be modest and  prudent and respect local party committees and governments, Liu  said, adding that officers and men of the Army should always  keep in mind the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly  and implement the party's policies and state laws and decrees in  an exemplary way.    The Army should support and participate in local economic  development and help local people solve difficulties, do good  turns to them and bravely fight against social evils.</p>

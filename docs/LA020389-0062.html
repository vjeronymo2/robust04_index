			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> FELANDO ANNOUNCES HE HAS CANCER  </P> <P> Veteran Assemblyman Gerald N. Felando (R-San Pedro) disclosed Thursday that he  is undergoing radiation therapy to treat cancer.  </P> <P> "It's another battle, and that's what I do best. I'll fight it," declared  Felando, whose reputation as a savvy political street fighter was bolstered  last year when he defeated a well-financed Republican primary challenge and  coasted to reelection in November.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview with The Times, Felando said he plans to remain in the  Legislature and to run for reelection in 1990.  </P> <P> Felando, 54, who has not been in the Capitol this week, said that he began  receiving radiation treatment Tuesday for mycosis fungoides, a form of lymphoma  that affects the skin and occasionally spreads to the internal organs. He said  the cancer is similar to leukemia.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prospects Reasonably Good  </P> <P> Felando said the treatment could cause excessive fatigue, weight loss and  increased metabolism. He said his doctors have told him that after he completes  the 10-week treatment program, the prospects for normal life expectancy are  reasonably good.  </P> <P> A cancer specialist at UCLA who asked not to be identified said Thursday that  if the disease is detected early, "it's something that can be cured or  repressed for long periods of time."  </P> <P> While undergoing treatment, Felando said, he will continue to oversee his staff  in Sacramento and at his Torrance office. Felando said he plans to spend part  of each week in the Capitol to attend hearings and Assembly floor sessions.  "I'll do that as long as I can," Felando said. "If this fatigue thing is worse  than I imagine, then I'll cut back."  </P> <P> Another South Bay lawmaker, Assemblyman Curtis R. Tucker (D-Inglewood), was  discovered last year to have a liver lymphoma. He died in October. During 1988,  at least three other Assembly members were under treatment for various types of  cancer.  </P> <P> </P> <P> High Political Profile  </P> <P> Felando, first elected in 1978, has had a high political profile since the end  of 1987. First he announced that he would run for the congressional seat held  by then-Rep. Daniel E. Lungren (R-Long Beach) after Lungren was nominated as  state treasurer. But Felando later withdrew from the contest, citing the  potential strain on his family life.  </P> <P> When he jumped back into the race for his Assembly seat, Felando faced a  challenge from Deane Dana III, son of Los Angeles County Supervisor Deane Dana.  The younger Dana accused Felando of having a cozy relationship with the  Assembly's top Democrat, Speaker Willie Brown of San Francisco. Felando  defeated Dana by an 8% margin and went on to win the November general election  in the 51st District, which stretches from Hermosa Beach to San Pedro.  </P> <P> When the Legislature reconvened a month later, Felando again found himself on  the political hot seat. Republican legislators and party officials sought to  pressure him into supporting Assemblyman Charles Calderon (D-Whittier), who was  challenging Brown's speakership. Felando, however, announced that he would not  support any Democrat.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Embarrassment for Republicans  </P> <P> Instead, he and two other Republicans believed to be sympathetic to Brown cast  their votes for Assembly Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra, a move  designed to embarrass those Republicans who ultimately supported Calderon.  </P> <P> At the same time, Felando, a dentist, was privately seeking a diagnosis for his  symptoms. He said he first spotted lesions on his skin about 18 months ago.  However, he said, the cancer was not diagnosed until last September or October.  </P> <P> The lawmaker said the toughest part of having the malignancy has been telling  his family. "I'm handling it pretty well mentally, but when you tell people you  really love, they become extremely emotional, and that becomes even harder on  me."  </P></p>

			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / US producer prices down 0.5% in month: Fall in energy costs holds index back US producers' prices fell by 0.5 per cent last month, as a sharp drop in energy prices offset more expensive metals and intermediate goods. The Department of Labor said the core producer price index, excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose by just 0.1 per cent in September, much less than most private sector economists had predicted, leaving a year-on-year inflation rate of 1.9 per cent. Prices for crude materials, meanwhile, fell 1.6 per cent, while intermediate goods prices rose 0.3 per cent, much less than in recent months. That helped to soothe the financial markets' fears of a surge in inflation, as many economists watch producer prices as an earlier indicator of inflationary pressures. But the core indices for crude and intermediate goods, again excluding food and energy, rose more sharply in September. Core prices for crude materials rose by 1.3 per cent in September and have climbed 13.7 per cent in the last 12 months, while prices for core intermediate materials rose by 0.6 per cent in September and by 3.5 per cent over the last year. However, Federal Reserve economists tend to regard both the producer price index and the consumer price index, which is due to be published today, as more backward-looking measurements than advance warnings of inflationary pressures. Although analysts had generally predicted a sharp drop for energy prices, which fell by 2.9 per cent in September, they miscalculated badly on car prices. These fell by 1.1 per cent in September, whereas most analysts, expecting smaller than usual discounts as dealers sold off vehicles from the last model year, had expected another increase on top of August's 0.7 per cent. Tobacco prices, on the other hand, rose by 2.0 per cent after a 1.4 per cent increase in August and price increases also accelerated for prescription and over-the-counter drugs, books, mobile homes and household furniture. Economists disagreed on the implications of the Labour Department's price data. Mr Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch described the producer price index as 'terrific'. 'It doesn't mean that there is no inflation pressure. Does it mean that people have exaggerated the extent of inflationary pressure? I think so,' he said. But Mr Joseph Liro of SG Warburg warned: 'As reassuring as the headline number were, dark clouds remain on the horizon.' He pointed to the rises in core crude and intermediate goods prices as signs of increasing pressure on producers to raise their prices.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has declared that the only  reason for the deadlock in the proximity talks concerning the  implementation of the confidence-building measures package  consists of the changes in favor of the Greek Cypriots  introduced into the original package. Denktas said: If the  Greek Cypriots had remained loyal to the original package and if  the UN Secretariat General had not agreed to any changes, as  demanded of us, then these difficulties would probably not have  arisen.    Denktas held a news conference this afternoon following the  announcement by Joe Clark, UN secretary general's special envoy  in Cyprus, that the negotiating process with regard to the  implementation of the confidence-building measures package has  broken down, after a meeting with Denktas. Explaining that the  Greek Cypriots asked for a change, were granted this wish, and  did their utmost to undermine the package, Denktas said: They  can rejoice that they have succeeded in doing this. Anyway, no  Greek Cypriot leader was in favor of this package in the  beginning. Kliridhis himself had accepted the package, because  it suited his tactics.    The change introduced to the package allows planes from  Greek  Cypriot airlines to use the Lefkosa [Nicosia] International  Airport, while the use of the airport by Turkish Cypriot planes  is based on the condition that all writings and logos be removed  from the planes, Denktas remarked. He noted that Kliridhis is  pretending to accept the package, knowing that it will be  rejected by the Turkish Cypriot side and this will make it  easier for the Greek Cypriots to become a member of the European  Union [EU]. Expressing the hope that the EU will approach the  Cyprus issue in a more positive light in the future, Denktas  said that if the matter is approached in a realistic way, the  Greek Cypriots will resort to every possible maneuver to remain  the legitimate Cyprus government on the island and will continue  to deceive the world.    Denktas declared: We displayed a sensitive and constructive  stand, but the Greek Cypriots' tactics led this matter into an  impasse.</p>

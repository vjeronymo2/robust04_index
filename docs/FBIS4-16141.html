			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS correspondent Sergey Ostanin] </F>   [Text] Moscow 13 April, TASS -- Russian Ambassador at Large  Yuriy Dubinin and Russian Navy Commander Admiral Feliks Gromov  failed to reach Odessa on Wednesday where they planned to probe  into the recent incidents.    Dubinin and Gromov are currently staying in Sevastopol as  the  Ukrainian side refused to allow them to enter Odessa, the Black  Sea Fleet press centre quoted both men as saying at a joint news  conference in Sevastopol on Wednesday.    "While one side is studying the situation on the spot the  other has been denied such a possibility, it is extremely hard  to establish the truth," Gromov said.    At the same time, he said that the research ship Cheleken  which brought radar equipment from Odessa to Sevastopol did not  violate Russian-Ukrainian agreements. However, the incidents in  Odessa, including the seizure of a Black Sea Fleet reserve unit,  "violate the spirit and the letter of the Massandra and other  agreements," he added.    He stressed that a Navy personnel department official has  been sent to Odessa to find out the composition of the unit, how  many sailors have taken the Ukrainian oath of allegiance,  conditions of life and work in the unit and other circumstances.    The participants in the press conference said that the  incidents will be discussed at the upcoming round of  Russian-Ukrainian talks on the Black Sea Fleet due to take place  in Moscow at the end of April.    Gromov believes "it is necessary to do everything possible  in  order not to whip up tension in the fleet." He said the Russian  Navy is determined to "resolve all disputes over the fleet on a  legal basis within the context of strengthening state relations  between the Slavic states."    He expressed the hope that the forthcoming talks will  facilitate the implementation of the previously reached  agreements to hand over Ukraine's part of the fleet to the  Russian Navy. He regretted that since September 1993 Russia has  been financing the fleet alone, although under the agreement  Ukraine is supposed to cover 50 per cent of the expenses.  Moreover, Ukraine has imposed customs duties, fines and even  tax on land on the Black Sea Fleet, while exempting its own  Armed Forces. "If the Black Sea Fleet is fully financed by the  Russian Federation, it should become Russian," Gromov concluded.</p>

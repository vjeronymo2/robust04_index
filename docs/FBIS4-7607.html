			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by SRNA journalist Mirjana Kusnik] </F>   [Text] Charles Redman, the U.S. President's special envoy  for the former Yugoslavia, and Radovan Karadzic, president of  the Srpska republic, met in Pale today. In a statement for SRNA  after the meeting, Redman pointed out that he had come to reach  political and territorial arrangements, albeit without concrete  offers. We are making efforts to solve territorial borders in  Bosnia in a new way, because after the creation of the  Muslim-Croatian federation, we want to hear what the Serb side  intends to do, Redman said and added that borders are a great  problem that will not be easy to solve. These are extremely  great problems as the war has been waged for two years already  and I do not think that the situation will improve soon, Redman  said.    Karadzic reiterated the readiness of the Serbian side to  (?support) every proposal for solving the crisis in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina which would not be contrary to the interests  of the Serbian people.    Redman and Karadzic hailed the efforts Russia, the European  Union, and the United Nations made with a way to solving the  crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    Speaking about the ceasing of clashes between the Croats and  the Muslims, Redman said that a united Croat-Muslim army will  probably be formed, as, in his opinion, this is the best  solution to establishing peace between Croats and Muslims on  their territories.    This afternoon in the Muslim part of Sarajevo, Redman will  meet Alija Izetbegovic and convey to him the stands of the  leadership of the Srpska republic.</p>

			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / International Capital Markets: Eurobond clearing houses in agreement CEDEL and Euroclear, the two Eurobond clearing houses, have agreed to exchange clearing information in a move that ends two years of dispute. The new 'bridge' system, to come into force in October, will save about Dollars 30m a year and increase efficiency. A long test period is needed because of the technical complexity of the change, which involves Cedel shifting to a system of overnight processing. The agreement, signed in Paris on Friday, incorporates the concept of delivery versus payment, which Cedel had resisted until now. In 1990, the two firms agreed to renegotiate their 1980 'bridge' agreement on the exchange of information, but until now have failed to resolve the problem.</p>

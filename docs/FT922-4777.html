			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Falls in drug stocks check advance TRANSATLANTIC pressures on the big pharmaceutical stocks, together with Wall Street's failure to maintain its overnight momentum, yesterday undermined early gains on the London stock market. UK stocks opened strongly after Wall Street's overnight rise to a new peak, and received a further boost when Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation increased its offer for Midland, the UK clearing bank, to Pounds 3.9bn. At mid-morning, the FT-SE Index was nearly 20 points up, although trading levels were not much higher than in the previous session. There was little support behind the early advance, however, and London was already drifting off when Wall Street made a disappointing start to the new session, reversing its early gain to show a fall of several Dow points in UK trading hours. By the close of business, the gain on London had been smartly trimmed for a final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,705.9, a gain on the day of 8.3 points, with traders sounding unconvinced by the recovery of the Footsie 2,700 mark. The weaker showing of the second half of the session was a reflection of Wall Street, where the implications of disappointing quarterly trading figures from Bristol-Myers Squibb quickly reached London and helped reverse early gains in Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, both of which closed the day on the downside. The attention of the trading desks was focused on shares in Midland Bank, after the new terms from Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank were interpreted in the London market as a possible knockout blow. Dealers believe that it will be difficult for Lloyds Bank to unveil a counter stroke at its meeting on Friday, if only because of the timetable imposed by the UK Monopolies Commission inquiry into its proposed offer for Midland. Shares in Lloyds Bank eased yesterday as the stock market awaited news from the bank's boardroom. Midland shares were heavily traded in London, recording 29m of the day's 493.8m shares total, which compared with 425.3m on Monday. Traders believed that yesterday's activity in Midland reflected arbitrage buying by brokers building positions ahead of the expected close of the bid struggle rather than speculators expecting fresh developments. The cash element of Hongkong's new terms were regarded as the key factor. Success for the Hongkong bid has positive implications for equities since the new banking group would be quoted in London, almost inevitably as a Footsie stock; institutions would take stakes in the new stock, and the input of investment fund cash would help a market looking for signs of encouragement. While the mood of the stock market remained cautious, optimism was expressed by fund managers attending a Global Investment Strategy Conference held in London by Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK merchant bank. The managers predicted a rise of 12 per cent in the UK market over the next 12 months, bringing the Footsie to around 3,035, although they expect a gain of only 2 per cent on Wall Street.</p>

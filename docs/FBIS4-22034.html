			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Sinan Yilmaz: "PKK Lies in Ambush"] </F>   [Text] Among all the commotion over the local elections,  the coalition and the stability package, the problem of Turkey's  Kurds and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has been forgotten.  Certain Army and government officials, declaring that the PKK  has been rendered ineffective, have hinted a certain victory  this summer.    Despite repetitive attacks by security forces, the PKK  survived last winter with losses in personnel but little loss of  support and new recruits.    Reports from sources close to the PKK are that once more the  organization is preparing for a series of spring attacks.  Observers had mistakenly expected, on the basis of PKK  statements, that the local elections and Newroz would be  eventful. Instead, the PKK has not done what it threatened to  do. Sources close to the organization argue that the reason for  this partly lies behind PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's call for a  cease-fire to the Kurdish Conference held in Brussels last  month. This, however, is not the whole aspect of the case. The  main reason for PKK's silence is the unexpected deployment of  new troops and security forces in the troubled region.  Approximately, 400,000 soldiers, police officers, special  teams, intelligence units and village guards are on duty in the  area.    The PKK currently is trying to avoid drawing any attention  to  itself and in the process is avoiding organized attacks. It is  aware that the smallest attack would face a large military  operation. The organization, not wanting to suffer any further  losses, chooses to stay inactive or, rather, to lie in wait for  the time being.    The second reason behind this passive mood is that there has  been an international diplomatic reaction to the issue of  Turkey's "solution" for the Kurdish problem. Especially the  lifting of the immunity of pro-Kurdish Democracy Party (DEP)  deputies, followed by their arrest, has caused concern in  Western Europe and the United States. It should not be ignored  that PKK attacks at such a time would not have done the  organization any good.    The fact that the DEP deputies who were expelled from the  political arena tried to solve the problem through political  means with contacts with Europe and the United States was also  effective.    When DEP members caused attention to focus on Ocalan's  proposal for a political solution and the arrest of their  deputies, the Western world placed more emphasis on their  demands that a political solution be found to the problem. The  view of the Western world that Kurds seeking legal solutions  faced oppression strengthened.    Prime Minister Tansu Ciller, who claims that she influenced  the West in its banning of the PKK, missed one aspect of the  issue: The Western countries, while stating the reason for the  banning of the organization, recommended that a political  solution be found as soon as possible. Recent developments  imply the time given to Turkey for this is expiring.    The lack of violent attacks by the PKK in southeastern  Turkey  also implies that the legal and illegal Kurdish movements want  to boost their "diplomatic drive." The PKK is waiting in  ambush, ever ready to return to violence. But while waiting, it  is also planning new tactical policies.    Although the PKK claimed that the election results were as  they had expected them to be, this organization's call for a  boycott of the March 27 elections was not as successful as it  predicted. But it has to be admitted that the participation in  the elections was not as high as the state had thought it would  be.    The PKK is now trying to establish a dialogue with the newly  elected mayors. According to reports coming from the region,  the PKK is relaying its demands to the newly elected mayors and  telling those who refuse to meet these to leave the region.  Sources claimed this week that Diyarbakir's newly elected  Welfare Party Mayor Ahmet Bilgin actually wanted to withdraw his  candidacy before the elections but was prevented from doing so  under pressure from Regional Governor Unal Erkan.    In conclusion, it can be said that despite the blows it has  received, the PKK has managed this year as well to survive the  winter.    The organization is now laying in ambush, trying to avoid  the  blows delivered by Turkish forces. But the Kurdish problem is  still there, needing more than ever to be solved.</p>

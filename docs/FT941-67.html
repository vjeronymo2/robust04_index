			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Slimmer Tilbury achieves Pounds 21m Tilbury Douglas, the construction group, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 20.9m for last year, compared with a restated loss of Pounds 1.9m in 1992, writes Andrew Taylor. The figures were flattered by profits on disposals and the impact of provisions which under FRS 3 were required to be written off previously-stated 1992 profits. Tilbury said pre-tax profits excluding exceptional items would have fallen from Pounds 15m to Pounds 13.6m. The final dividend is again 22.5p, maintaining the total for the year at 33p. Earnings per share after exceptionals rose to 46.2p compared with restated losses of 2p. Group turnover fell from Pounds 382m to Pounds 361m. Mr Michael Bottjer, chief executive, said the decline was attributed mainly to the group's decision not to pursue lossmaking contracts, unlike some of its competitors. He said last year's profits had been enhanced by a Pounds 7.3m surplus on the sale of its Douglas Concrete &amp; Aggregates and Douglas Plant businesses. Construction profits had fallen from Pounds 13.2m to Pounds 7.6m on a reduced turnover Pounds 302m (Pounds 322m), in part because of the company's refusal to price work at unviable levels. The value of the group's construction order book of Pounds 225m at the December 31 year end was 47 per cent higher than a year earlier, in spite of its pricing policy. Its specialist piling and interior contracting operations, however, have continued to suffer, reflecting the downturn in the UK building industry. Heavy electrical contracting and process engineering, which are seeking to expand overseas, produced satisfactory performances, while the construction equipment division increased pre-tax profits by 35 per cent to Pounds 1.64m. Scottish housebuilding profits dipped from Pounds 4m to Pounds 3.78m as the number of homes sold declined from 353 to 278. The group is withdrawing from its commercial property and English housebuilding businesses. COMMENT Tilbury, with its emphasis on specialist contracting, continues to command above average margins in a highly competitive UK construction market. Its lack of housing exposure, in spite of a quality Scottish business, however, means that this is a late cycle recovery play. There is also a feeling that the group may be too cautious in using its strong cash balances of Pounds 14.9m at the year end. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 18m should more than cover the dividend, which is on a handsome yield 5.7 per cent. Tilbury has shown that it is one of the safest pairs of hands around, and the shares on this basis are a solid hold but the short-term outlook for profit recovery looks dull.</p>

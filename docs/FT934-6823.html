			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Delors and Clarke in row over work-sharing: Brussels' chief appeals for open-minded approach Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, last night clashed with Mr Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, over the principle of work-sharing to combat the unemployment crisis in Europe. Mr Delors accused Mr Clarke of being 'unconstructive' and rejected the chancellor's charge that a short working week and job-sharing would lead to even higher unemployment. At a meeting of EU finance ministers in Brussels, Mr Delors appealed for an open-minded debate on how to save jobs and create new employment. He said there were 'no miracle cures' but made clear he would resist efforts to water down his proposals ahead of next month's European summit in Brussels. Although the majority of finance ministers agreed broadly with the Commission's analysis of why there are more than 17m people out of work in the EU, they voiced doubts about some of Mr Delors' prescriptions. These included reductions in employment taxes, work-sharing and a general desire for lower short-term interest rates. Mr Clarke delivered an outspoken attack on work-sharing as a means of saving jobs. This provoked an angry retort from Mr Delors who said: 'There is always a question of winners and losers (for him). Why this obsession of Mr Clarke?' The row between Mr Delors and Mr Clarke erupted after Mr Delors submitted a 25-page summary of the white paper on competitiveness, growth and employment. The paper is expected to be the centrepiece of the December 10-11 meeting of heads of governments. German officials attacked the explicit notion that a 2-3 per cent cut in interest rates would speed a recovery on the grounds that it could be seen as an attack on the Bundesbank. Mr Clarke said 10 out of 12 ministers had raised objections to shorter working hours. These ideas were more likely to increase unemployment rather than save jobs, because they presumed there was a need to ration employment in Europe. After hearing Mr Clarke's prediction that the white paper would require substantial revision ahead of the summit, Mr Delors accused Mr Clarke of ignoring work-sharing developments on the Continent. The French government was discussing similar measures with trade unions and so was Volkswagen in Germany. A leaked copy of the employment section of the white paper stresses the central importance of work-sharing in combating high unemployment and holds up the Netherlands as a model. It cites Commission figures on the apparent link between reducing hours and creating jobs. Between 1983 and 1991 the average hours worked per person per week in the EU fell by 3 per cent - just over one hour. But in the Netherlands the reduction was 13 per cent, an average of five hours per week. The Netherlands experienced a rise in employment of 30 per cent, 'more than half of which seems to be attributable to the fall' in working time.</p>

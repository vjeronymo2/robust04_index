Butrus-Ghali said that Argentina has become a leading  country  in Latin America and, despite his request, noted the efforts it  has been making to ratify the nuclear weapon non-proliferation  treaty. Menem, in turn, promised to hold talks with Brazil to  this end.    This information was disclosed by Media Communications  Secretary Raul Burzaco at the conclusion of the meeting held  between Menem and Butrus-Ghali at Government House. [passage  omitted]</p>

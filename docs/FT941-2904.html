			<p>940318 FT  18 MAR 94 / Leading Article: Programmed for failure Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, has been put in an impossible position by the group of seven leading industrial countries. He is in Moscow to decide whether to release the second Dollars 1.5bn tranche of funds aimed at assisting reform. If he does not release them, the IMF will be blamed for the deterioration in the economy. If he does, the economy will deteriorate, nonetheless. His is a doomed mission. So what should the west be doing, instead? First, it must remember that Russia is both a nuclear power and Europe's most threatening neighbour. Its problems cannot be approached as if the country were the Philippines, or even Brazil. Second, it must understand the roots of the disaster, which are the collapse of the communist economy and the attendant moral and fiscal bankruptcy of the state. The claims inherited from the Soviet Union greatly exceed the resources upon which the government can lay its desperate hands. The budget deficit is supposed to be 10 per cent of gross domestic product. In fact, it is at least 15 per cent, before meeting the defence minister's demand for a doubling of the military budget. Third, the west needs to provide enough resources to allow Russia to rebuild both its economy and its bankrupt government, delivered in ways that actually allow it to do so. This means currency stabilisation and funds sufficient to close the budget deficit, conditional upon the establishment of private property, price reform, industrial restructuring and tight control over subsidies. The funds required will be large, but their duration need not be that great. With credibility restored, money could pour into the country, some of it as returning flight capital. But the IMF's Dollars 1.5bn  -roughly half a per cent of Russia's GDP - is neither here nor there. Fourth, the principals should themselves be present in Moscow. The IMF is not even the ideal agent, partly because it is obliged to treat Russia as just another member country, partly because it does not possess the necessary political authority and partly because it does not have the needed resources. If the G7 is to act, it should send someone of the stature of Mr Larry Summers, US treasury undersecretary for international affairs, to talk to those who matter, decide whether reform is feasible and then cajole the G7 into offering the assistance that might make it work. Finally, the west must decide whether now is the time. The government of Mr Victor Chernomyrdin has made a greater effort to hold the budgetary line than many expected. Mr Victor Gerashchenko, the central bank chairman, has even started to behave like a monetarist. But the perseverance of the government is highly uncertain and the support of the parliament still more so, particularly when President Yeltsin has withdrawn from the scene. For all that, it is both right to explore the possibilities of today and essential to prepare for the fresh opportunities for radical reform that may, given Russia's economic plight, emerge tomorrow. What makes no sense at all is to prefer the certainty of failure to the chance of success. At present, the G7 has no policy for Russia. It is just making gestures.</p>

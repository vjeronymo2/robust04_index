			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / UK Company News: LIG repays most of Pounds 50m bond issue LONDON International Group, the condoms, rubber gloves, health and beauty products company, has repaid almost all of a Pounds 50m convertible bond which had a put option. Holders of Pounds 49.9m of the 4.5 per cent bonds exercised their option to put the bonds back at a price 20.7 per cent above the principal amount, giving them a yield of 8.5 per cent. LIG has paid Pounds 60.3m. The bonds are in bearer form so LIG does not know who holds the outstanding Pounds 70,000. LIG expected the bonds to be put because the shares are well below the conversion price.</p>

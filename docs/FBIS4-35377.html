			<p>BFN     [Text] Amman -- AL-BAYAN has learned that the EC has  adopted a plan to solve the Palestinian refugees problem in  Lebanon, and that the EC member states have proposed this plan  at the refugees committee meetings within the framework of the  multilateral talks.    Palestinian sources in Amman told AL-BAYAN that the Italian  ambassador to Lebanon has briefed the leaders of the opposition  factions on this plan, which includes the absorption of  approximately 100,000 Palestinians academicians in the EC  states, and granting them the nationalities of these states.  The plan also includes settling the reamining refugees in  Lebanon and granting them Lebanese nationality, but without  granting them the right to participate in elections, in order to  avoid the disruption of the sectarian balance in Lebanon.    These sources added that the actual implementation of the  plan has begun, and that the Lebanese Government has begun to  grant citizenships to a number of refugees.</p>

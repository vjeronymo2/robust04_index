			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / IBM appoints RJR Nabisco's chief to top post INTERNATIONAL Business Machines yesterday gave the challenge of reviving its fortunes to Mr Louis Gerstner, the chairman of food and tobacco group RJR Nabisco, by naming him as its new chief executive. Mr Gerstner is one of America's most highly regarded managers but has no direct experience of the computer industry. The announcement ended a high-profile, two-month search by IBM's board for a successor to Mr John Akers, the chairman and chief executive, who is retiring early because of the group's financial problems. Mr Gerstner, 51, will also become chairman. Mr Gerstner, a former president of the American Express financial services group, was brought in as chairman and chief executive of RJR four years ago by its owners, the buy-out specialists Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts, who had just acquired the business in a ferocious Dollars 25bn (Pounds 17.60bn) takeover battle. RJR acted quickly yesterday to dispel uncertainty about its own management, appointing Mr Karl von der Heyden, finance director, and Mr Lawrence Ricciardi, general counsel, as co-chairmen and chief executives. The two are part of the small corporate office team put together by Mr Gerstner after the buy-out, and will retain their existing financial and legal responsibilities. Earlier in the week, there had been speculation that Mr Gerstner would take Mr von der Heyden with him to IBM. Analysts were concerned that this might trigger an internal battle between the heads of RJR Nabisco's operating units, for the chairman's job. Analysts yesterday hailed Mr Gerstner as a tough, effective manager and good strategic thinker who could do much to slash IBM's bloated cost structure and rid the company of its slow-moving bureaucratic style. However, some expressed concern about his lack of knowledge of computer science at a time when IBM needs to make important choices about its future technology. Mr Gerstner, who was closely involved in the development of computer systems at American Express, said: 'I don't pretend to understand all of the science underlying information technology - and you know what? - I don't think I have to.' Mr James Burke, the IBM director who led search for a new chief executive, agreed, saying that high-technology knowledge was only one of 11 characteristics pinpointed by the board as desirable. The others all related to general management skills. Several leading high-technology industry executives had been on IBM's short-list and well-placed industry officials said yesterday that some had been approached about the job before Mr Gerstner. However, Mr Burke dismissed suggestions that Mr Gerstner had been low down the candidates' list and added: 'We made one specific offer for this job, and only one, and that was to Louis Gerstner.' Mr Gerstner, who takes over as chief executive next Thursday, would not be drawn on his plans for the company, saying his first priority was to 'listen and learn' about the business. He saw 'no quick fix' for IBM, but said the company had 'the greatest reservoirs of management talent in the world'. IBM shares, which have plunged from over Dollars 100 last year to a recent low of under Dollars 50, rose Dollars  7/8 to a Dollars 51 3/8 close in New York as the market weighed the positive news of the appointment against a decision on Thursday by Moody's, the credit information agency, to cut IBM's rating.

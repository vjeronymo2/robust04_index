			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICAN FARM TRADE MAY MOVE ON 2-WAY STREET  </P> <P> For the past seven or eight years, Cardinal Distributing Co. in Coachella,  Calif., has contracted with growers in Mexico to produce the asparagus and  green onions -- crops that require a lot of field work -- that the U.S. company  then sells on this side of the 2,000-mile common border.  </P> <P> "We're taking advantage of the labor market in Mexico," explained Nicholas H.  Jarrett, Cardinal's general manager.  </P> <P> Jarrett is not crazy about buying from Mexico produce that grows up and down  the Coachella Valley. But, he explained: "Labor is the biggest part of the end  cost, and to stay competitive we have to grow in Mexico. We're in it for the  economics -- but we'd just as soon not be."  </P> <P> Cardinal is not alone today among U.S. agricultural concerns exporting part of  their operations to Mexico to benefit from that country's ample supply of cheap  labor. Several competitors are moving their carrot-packing operations from  Coachella to Mexico -- shipping California-grown produce south for handling,  then bringing it back for sale in the United States. And other firms, such as  two-year-old Andrew &amp; Williamson Sales in San Diego, capitalize on Mexico's  trade advantages: They import seasonal crops, such as tomatoes and  strawberries, that ripen earlier in Baja and therefore command premium prices.  </P> <P> But, although such moves may increase Mexico's agricultural sales to the United  States at the expense of California produce, many trade specialists think that  Mexico's long-depressed and highly protected market for foreign food is about  to swing open once again. They maintain that agricultural trade in both  directions is on the brink of significant expansion for the first time since  Mexico's oil boom collapsed.  </P> <P> In fact, farm trade between the two countries, which had been flowing modestly  in Mexico's favor since 1986, is near equilibrium and will probably shift to a  U.S. surplus this year -- and possibly a strong one at that. U.S. farm exports  last October and November, the first two months of the government's new fiscal  year, soared to $533.6 million. For the same months a year earlier, sales  totaled $181 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Focus on Opportunities  </P> <P> Meanwhile, Mexico's shipments north increased modestly to $190.9 million, up  from $184.3 million, according to the government figures.  </P> <P> So Western growers, these experts maintain, might well focus less on fears of  an invasion of the United States by low-cost Mexican produce and processing,  and more on increased export opportunities for themselves.  </P> <P> "Mexico appears to be moving into the position of becoming a larger market for  U.S. agricultural products," Leon G. Mears, agricultural counselor at the U.S.  Embassy in Mexico City, wrote in a recent assessment. "Anticipated changes in  Mexico's agricultural production and trade in the next few years are likely to  have a considerable effect on the quantity and composition of its agricultural  imports."  </P> <P> California, at least, appears to anticipate significant growth in two-way trade  across its southern border. Gov. George Deukmejian, who last year opened state  trade offices in London and Tokyo, will dedicate a third foreign outpost next  month -- this one in Mexico City.  </P> <P> In his analysis, Mears pinned his optimism on anticipated economic growth and  increased income in Mexico. That, he calculated, should boost consumption of  meat, dairy products and eggs, which declined by up to 30% from the  pre-recession high in 1981. U.S. food exports to Mexico reached a record $2.7  billion that year before plunging to less than $1.5 billion in a year. After  bottoming out at $1.1 billion in 1986, however, they are again approaching the  $2-billion mark.  </P> <P> Mexico's population is growing rapidly, and a larger proportion of it is young,  which translates into a hungrier country, Mears said. In addition, urbanization  continues at a rapid pace: Although 30% of the country's inhabitants lived in  cities in 1950, 60% had moved to town by 1980. That is significant in terms of  agricultural trade, he said, because urban consumers tend to buy more animal  products and processed foods than do rural residents, many of whom also grow  some of their own food.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Tourist Trade Boom  </P> <P> Moreover, migration, particularly to the United States, is expected to slow  because of changes in immigration laws. And Mexico is experiencing a boom in  the tourist trade, which attracted 5.5 million visitors last year and is  expected to draw 8 million by the mid-1990s.  </P> <P> That dynamic backdrop adds significance to the fact that Mexico traditionally  buys 70% of its food imports from the United States and has greatly liberalized  its trade policy over the past five years, Mears said.  </P> <P> This start on reducing tariffs, licensing requirements and other import  barriers was a precondition to Mexico's joining the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade in 1986. A year later, Mexico signed a bilateral pact with  the United States that, Mears said, "should provide for further trade  liberalization."  </P> <P> The question is what form future liberalization might take, said Scott D. Morse  of Morse Merchant Agribusiness, a San Francisco consulting firm that  specializes in trade finance and regulation. It will likely require U.S.  producers to give up some of the tariff protection that they enjoy on a wide  range of commodities, he said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Potential for Growth  </P> <P> A further significant reduction in food trade barriers, Morse said, could  quadruple California's farm trade with Mexico. This accounted for only about 2%  of the state's $3.34 billion in total agricultural exports in 1987, but the  potential for growth is considerable, he said.  </P> <P> Mears said significant export opportunities for U.S. farmers exist for a  variety of "high-value agricultural products." These include almonds, walnuts,  cherries, apples, peaches, pears, sweet corn and dried fruits. In addition,  high-quality beef is needed to meet the tastes of Mexico's expanding tourist  trade. And wine, beer and other alcoholic beverages are in demand; also wood  products, animal skins and hides, and prepared animal and poultry feeds.  </P> <P> Mears is not alone in his optimistic outlook for growth in Mexico's food  market.  </P> <P> Jimmye S. Hillman, an agricultural economist at the University of Arizona, told  the American Farm Bureau Federation last month in San Antonio that "healthy  economic tendencies" are in the wind. Mexico, he noted, already is the United  States' third-largest agricultural trading partner (after Japan and Canada),  and the U.S. market is Mexico's largest outlet for its farm exports.  </P> <P> Hillman said he expects Mexico to become more dependent on the United States  for food imports.  </P> <P> But that will not happen without encouragement, Rep. E. (Kika) de la Garza  (D-Tex.), chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, told the U.S. farm  group. "Mexico is in a very difficult situation, and we have to help them out."  </P> <P> For now, however, the disparity in labor costs represents a major Mexican  advantage in terms of its agricultural trade with the United States, as the  Coachella firms tapping into that resource demonstrate. And that worries some  farm groups, which complain that government policies -- federal and state --  often magnify foreign competitors' trade advantages by unnecessarily increasing  domestic costs.  </P> <P> "Our growers just can't be expected to compete with Mexican growers paying  daily wages equal to our hourly rates," said David Moore, president of  Irvine-based Western Growers Assn., which represents 2,700 produce growers,  packers and shippers in California and Arizona.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Move 'Off Shore' Feared  </P> <P> The danger, spokeswoman Barbara Buck said, is that domestic farm interests, as  happened earlier with automobiles, steel and textiles, will move "offshore,"  attracted by lower production costs elsewhere.  </P> <P> "It may be that, economically and with no emotions, that wouldn't be a bad  thing," Buck acknowledged, "but these are families, living on family farms --  for four generations, some of them. It's going to be difficult to have it be a  purely economical decision."  </P> <P> On the other hand, increasing Mexico's standard of living to reduce the labor  imbalance may be impossible without long-term U.S. aid, suggested Henry J.  Voss, a Ceres rancher who heads the California Farm Bureau. "There is no reason  why Mexico someday should not be as big a trade partner as Canada is," Voss  said, "but there is a need for a great amount of California investment in  Mexico to bring that about.  </P> <P> "We're giving a lot more aid to other countries than to Mexico right next  door."  </P></p>

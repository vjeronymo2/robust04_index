			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Single Market Watch: Danish stores in frontier fightback DANISH retailers have launched an offensive to try to stop their customers exploiting the European single market to buy goods more cheaply south of the border in Germany. Service-Ringen, a Copenhagen-based stores chain specialising in electrical goods, is leading the campaign to circumvent a 10 point difference in German and Danish rates of value added tax. The group is inviting customers to choose goods at one of its Danish stores. Delivery is then made from one of its outlets in Germany, where VAT is only 15 per cent, against 25 per cent in Denmark. The purchases carry normal Danish guarantees and service contracts. Mr Ken Zillmer, the group's managing director, said customers making typical purchases were saving between DKr300 (Pounds 32) and DKr600 in VAT. Sales are 'excellent', he said. 'We know that our customers will run hard just to save DKr100. Now that they can save DKr300-500, they are running even harder.' The customer has to pay for transport. Under EC rules, laid down to prevent mail order houses exploiting VAT differences, German stores are not allowed to provide transport to a Danish address. However, transport companies are displaying advertisements in Service-Ringen stores offering to bring back purchases from Germany to Denmark for DKr170, including VAT at the German rate. Other leading Danish stores selling furniture, carpets and electrical goods are watching Service-Ringen's venture with a view to starting up their own German supply systems. The Fleggaard group, which operates stores just south of the border with Germany, will accept orders for electrical goods by telephone. It is also offering to sell yacht sails made by one of Denmark's top-flight sail-makers, allowing thousands of kroner in VAT savings. Fleggaard plans to offer Danes savings on goods purchased at any store in Denmark, provided they spend at least DKr20,000. A Fleggaard company in Denmark will buy the goods from the Danish store, re-sell it to its German store, and invoice the customer from Germany. The legality of this system is still being discussed. Danish retailers' aim is to persuade the Danish government to lower the VAT rate. However, Mr Peter Brixtofte, minister for taxation, said, 'We are keeping an eye on the situation, but we have no plans to change the VAT rate.'</p>

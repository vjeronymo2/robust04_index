			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by New York correspondent Yoshiharu Muto; sixth and </F> last in a series entitled "Structure of North Korea's Suspected  Development of Nuclear Weapons -- North Korea and the  International Community": "UN Arguments Over Sanctions"]    [Text] "The UN Security Council [UNSC] will function only  until it adopts a resolution. After that, it will do nothing."  Strangely, this rumor -- or jest -- is convincing. Of course,  "after a resolution is adopted," the United Nations and its  member nations will begin their struggles toward recruiting  personnel to participate in peacekeeping activities, abiding by  restrictions imposed by the resolution, and financial juggling  to deal with steadily increasing expenses. However, as far as  the issue of the DPRK's suspected nuclear program is concerned,  it is before the resolution is adopted that diplomacy and  politics can have their say.    In early June, a diplomatic source in New York said: "No  nation wants to vote for a resolution to impose sanctions  against North Korea. Everyone hopes to avoid it somehow. To  tell you the truth, they are looking for ways to postpone  adopting the resolution."    Truly, it remained unclear whether or not the UNSC would be  able to adopt a resolution even when the United States proposed  its draft sanctions resolution to UNSC member nations on 15  June. China and Russia opposed the U.S.-proposed resolution,  claiming they were not consulted about a ban on arms exports  included in the resolution. Even if China abstains from voting  and as a result, the resolution is adopted, the severe sanctions  measure of halting remittances to the DPRK and the oil embargo,  which is even more severe, would be thwarted. This is no  surprise if remittances through a third country and the long  PRC-DPRK border are taken into consideration. In short, it is  possible that after adopting a resolution, the UNSC will realize  that it has exhausted every means possible to resolve the  nuclear issue, and that its chance to settle the issue occurred  before adopting a resolution.    An official at the UN Administration Office said: "The UNSC  is a place to discuss political matters, not an organization to  carry out policies. Washington knows that sanctions against  Iraq after the end of the Gulf war have not been carried out  satisfactorily. The United States has proposed a 30-day grace  period in its draft resolution. Also, unofficial negotiations  before the adoption of a resolution will take up two or three  weeks. These facts indicate that the United States is fully  aware that political performance before the adoption of a  resolution holds the key to resolving the nuclear issue."    There is another issue of concern. An opinion shared among  Western nations' ambassadors to the United Nations is that  Chinese and North Korean ambassadors to the United Nations "seem  to have no right to decide, because they only repeat the same  thing no matter how long we talk with them and no matter what we  propose." Instead, they inform their home countries of the  detailed moves of the United Nations.    In such a situation, the United States announced its draft  resolution. Although for diplomatic reasons, Madeleine  Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, did not touch  on the details of the resolution at a news conference in the  United Nations, the full text of the resolution was disclosed by  a British source a few hours later. It was just a couple of  hours before former U.S. President Jimmy Carter began his first  round of talks with North Korean President Kim Il-song.    Just a week before that event, Hisashi Owada, Japanese  ambassador to the United Nations, said: "It is almost common  knowledge in Japan that the sun is better than the north wind,  as a tale from "Aesop's Fables" tells us. But in the  international arena, the north wind is sometimes better than the  sun." The United Nations will have to continue using a "carrot  policy" and a "stick policy" by turns to resolve the nuclear  issue.</p>

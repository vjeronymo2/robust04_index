			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: BUDD DENOUNCES APARTHEID ON TV  </P> <P> South African runner Zola Budd strongly condemned apartheid in a television  interview in Johannesburg, telling viewers that she "always hated" any form of  racial discrimination.  </P> <P> "I have always felt in my heart that I hate apartheid and always resented it,"  Budd said. "I do not believe in the superiority of one race above another based  on the color of a person's skin."  </P> <P> Budd said she did not speak out strongly against apartheid in her prime running  days in Britain because she did not want to "get involved in the hypocrisy of  the anti-apartheid wagon."  </P> <P> Budd returned to South Africa last May after a heated controversy in Britain  regarding her links with South Africa.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 9, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAEZ RETAINS IBF FEATHERWEIGHT TITLE WITH DRAW  </P> <P> Jorge Paez didn't agree with the decision. He did, however, like the result.  </P> <P> Paez retained his International Boxing Federation featherweight title Sunday  with a 12-round draw against Troy Dorsey, a fighter he beat five months ago on  a controversial split decision.  </P> <P> "If the judges don't think I'm a winner, it's not my fault," Paez said. "The  only thing I can say is I've got my belt and I'll take it home."  </P> <P> Paez bloodied Dorsey and closed his right eye, but the relentless Dorsey pulled  out the final round on all three scorecards to salvage a draw.  </P> <P> It was the third consecutive close decision for Paez, who won his last two  title defenses by split decisions before narrowing the margin even more with  the draw.  </P> <P> "What can I say?" the Mexican champion said. "You saw the fight. I don't think  the judges saw the fight."  </P> <P> Dorsey, 125 3/4, of Dallas, won most of the early rounds and was leading on all  the scorecards as late as the seventh round. He also thought the judges were  seeing the wrong fight.  </P> <P> "I don't see how he got the (draw)," Dorsey said. "He was throwing punches, but  I was throwing punches and I had him on the ropes."  </P> <P> Paez, 126, making the eighth defense of his IBF 126-pound title in 23 months,  said the fight may be his last at that weight.  </P> <P> Paez appeared stronger than the challenger and landed the more effective  punches, but Dorsey threw far more punches in an all-out assault for 12 rounds.  </P> <P> Judge Dalby Shirley agreed with Dorsey, scoring the fight in his favor,  116-112. Judge Jerry Roth had Paez winning, 115-113. Judge Keith Macdonald saw  it 114-114.  </P> <P> The Associated Press had Paez ahead, 118-110.  </P> <P> Paez (35-2-3) earned $110,000 for the bout, which drew 4,421 to the Las Vegas  Hilton. Dorsey (11-3-3) was paid $50,000.  </P></p>

			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / UK Company News: ABI Leisure ahead PROFITS of ABI Leisure Group, the caravan manufacturer, improved from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 2.31m pre-tax for the year to end-August 1992. The 11 per cent advance came from turnover Pounds 3.9m ahead at Pounds 56.2m. However, with difficult trading conditions continuing it was felt prudent to trim the final dividend to 2.19p making a 3.76p (4.7p) total. Earnings per share were little changed at 5.8p (5.7p). Directors said stocks had been reduced by 9.5 per cent and that full time working would resume in December. They added that the 'benefits of our involvement in five major markets is clearly reflected in current trading'.</p>

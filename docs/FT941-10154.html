			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt mounts post-bourse recovery On a day for the tacticians, the strategists still had their say, writes Our Markets Staff. Overnight in New York, a UK house, SG Warburg, said it liked equity prospects in Italy, and Sweden in particular. In London, Merrill Lynch, of US fame, continued its support for European commodity-sensitive stocks, on prospects for gains in both commodity prices and in the US dollar. FRANKFURT rebounded in the post-bourse after the DAX index fell 21.92 to 2,085.29 on the session, closing the afternoon 31.14 to the good at 2,116.43, its best of the day. Mr Nigel Longley, of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said that the bund future had moved from 98.94 on Tuesday, via a 98.58 low yesterday, to a close of 99.20  -'huge volatility', he said, in this area. In addition, equities were lifted by the upswing in New York. Turnover rose from DM9.8bn to DM10.6bn. Banks were weak on the session, but carmakers were outstanding on the day. At the official close, Volkswagen was up DM5 to DM447 on American buying. In the afternoon, however, BMW was the real star, responding to a Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade of its commercial paper by rising from DM777 at the close to a final DM814. The prospect had been in investors' minds, said Mr Longley, they had bought on the 'bad news' and BMW - not as liquid as some car stocks - had rocketed on short covering. MILAN put in a restrained performance on a day of technically driven trading, which saw the expiry of options ahead of tomorrow's end of the February account. The Comit index added 2.4 to 680.12. IMI, making its debut, was quoted at L14,400 in pre-opening trade, compared with the L10,900 privatisation price, prompting speculation that a broker had been short in the stock. The shares later turned back to finish at L13,430. BCI, up for privatisation at the end of the month, added L37 to L5,523. Montedison traded L38 or 3.2 per cent lower to L1,159 in continued response to Tuesday's news that a little known Gibralta-based investment firm was buying a 6 per cent stake. PARIS was little changed on the day with the CAC-40 index rising just 2.2 to 2,302.06. Peugeot, down FFr7 to FFr847, had attracted attention from a number of brokers; Merrill Lynch, yesterday, moved its recommendation a notch lower, from buy to hold. Mr Keith Hayes commented for Merrill that this move was partly the result of the stock's strong performance in recent months: it has outperformed the CAC-40 index by some 25 per cent. He was concerned at a possible hole in the group's model range, with strong competition coming from Renault and Fiat, and added that Peugeot lacked exposure to the lucrative north American market. Among other automotive stocks Valeo, the components manufacturer, advanced to a new year's high, up FFr46 to FFr1,520, taking its gains since the beginning of the year to 18 per cent. Michelin gained FFr2.40 to FFr262.30. ZURICH finished 1.4 per cent lower, although Wall Street's firmer opening enabled shares to pick up from the day's lowest levels. The SMI index shed 43 to 3,054.2. Banks, in demand until recent days on expectations of good results later in the month, remained under pressure. CS Holding shed SFr20 to SFr710. UBS, which said it had sold its 19 per cent stake in Grundig to Philips, dipped SFr16 to SFr1,465. Roche saw SFr90 of its recent gains erased as it finished at SFr7,090. AMSTERDAM recovered from a midsession low to close modestly higher. The AEX index added 0.98 to 437.52. Fokker, which has seen volatile trading recently, was one of the day's best performers, up Fl 1.90 or 8.6 per cent to Fl 23.80, following a report in the domestic media that it was planning a major restructuring package to include job cuts. The aircraft manufacturer had no commment to make on the article. ISTANBUL fell another 8.1 per cent as investors switched further holdings into cash, taking advantage of high interest rates as the central bank continued to defend the lira. The composite index, bouncing from a daily low of 15,478.14, ended at a provisional 15,695.71, its lowest since November 17 and down 1,385.44 points from Tuesday. The index has lost 45.7 per cent since its all-time high of 28,883.61 on January 13. TEL AVIV hit a new 1994 low, the Mishtanim blue chip index losing another 8.55, or 3.5 per cent at 235.87 after a similar fall on Monday and a small, intervening rally on Tuesday.

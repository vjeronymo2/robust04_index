			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SURPRISING NEWS ABOUT JUNK BONDS  </P> <P> Investors who've held on to their junk bond mutual funds this year, despite the  bonds' winter crash, can proudly say that they didn't sell at the lows: Junk  bond values have climbed back surprisingly over the past month.  </P> <P> The average junk bond fund had a total return of 2.10% in May, according to  Lipper Analytical Services. Total return measures interest earned, plus any  appreciation in the bonds' prices.  </P> <P> The May gain helped erase much of the damage from the winter plunge, after junk  bond king Drexel Burnham Lambert collapsed. Year-to-date through May 31, the  average junk fund now is off 2.01%, measuring total return.  </P> <P> That may not feel very good when the average stock mutual fund is up 3.3%, and  the average Treasury bond fund is up 0.13%. Still, things looked a lot worse in  early March, when many junk funds were down 7% or more from Jan. 1. And if bond  prices just stay level, interest earnings could soon put junk funds back in the  positive column.  </P> <P> What happened in May was that more bargain hunters got serious about buying  junk. Convinced that the economy wasn't going to collapse, and lured by junk  bond annualized yields exceeding 15%, buyers chased junk as market interest  rates fell. It also helped that many of the companies that had borrowed via  junk bonds in recent years decided to buy some of them back, given the  depressed prices.  </P> <P> Despite the strength of the May rally, however, many junk experts are wary  about calling this a sustainable surge. The reason: Buyers fishing for  depressed bonds have mostly concentrated on the biggest, safest junk issuers  only. Trading in most corporate junk bonds remains treacherous at best.  </P> <P> "There are 50 or 60 names that everybody's jumped on," said James Caywood, head  of San Diego-based Caywood Christian Capital, which owns about $1.2 billion in  junk. "But there are another 600 names that nobody has a clue about."  </P> <P> Tom Nugent, who runs the $12-million (assets) Pacific Horizon High Yield fund  in Los Angeles, has been a victim of that two-tiered market. His fund, heavily  invested in higher-yielding, lower-quality issues, eked out only a small gain  in May. It was hurt in part by a plunge in the value of bonds issued by Divi  Hotels Corp., which operates Caribbean hotels. When Divi said it was unable to  make its interest payments, the bonds tumbled to about $250 apiece from about  $550.  </P> <P> Besides worrying about a continuing dearth of buyers for most bonds, junk fund  managers warn that if fears again mount that the economy is crumbling, many  junk owners are likely to bail out. Most investors won't want to stick around  and see how many more financially weak junk debtors will end up in bankruptcy  court.  </P> <P> "The market remains very vulnerable to a full-scale recession," said Bill  Veronda, manager of the $46-million asset Financial Group High Yield fund in  Denver.  </P> <P> Even so, Veronda and his peers admit that they were surprised by the sum of  money that flowed back into junk in May. "We literally saw some of the same  people coming back who had sold out in a panic" last winter, Veronda said. His  fund saw a small net inflow of money from investors in May, after a long string  of monthly losses.  </P> <P> He also is encouraged by investors' reaction to the troubles of issuers such as  Donald J. Trump and Macy's. Though those bonds have plunged recently, "Their  troubles haven't carried over to the general market," Veronda said.  </P> <P> How Wells Fargo Picks Stocks: Among L.A.'s money pros, one of the quiet giants  is Wells Fargo Asset Management, which actively manages about $30 billion in  investor funds.  </P> <P> San Francisco-based Wells Fargo probably is best known for its "passive" stock  management division, which essentially attempts to replicate market performance  by exclusively owning the stocks in major market indexes, such as the Standard  &amp; Poor's 500 index.  </P> <P> While that Wells division now runs about $70 billion for investors, the active  management arm has been gaining notoriety for its stock-picking prowess. Over  the past five years, Wells' model growth stock fund has beaten the average  stock mutual fund by about 2 percentage points a year.  </P> <P> Wells veteran Robert Bissell was named to oversee all of the firm's portfolio  operations in 1989. Bissell, based in L.A., describes Wells' active management  strategy as aggressive on individual stocks but growing cautious overall on the  market.  </P> <P> "Our thinking is, you may not want to throw a lot of money in at the 2,900  level (on the Dow Jones average)," Bissell said. "The market could go forward .  . . but you're into territory where it becomes a lot more volatile," he said.  </P> <P> As for individual stocks, Bissell said Wells' style is "different than just  trying to pick this quarter's winner." In searching for stocks that have the  potential for big gains, Wells' goal is to be into the story early, he said.  The firm's 30 portfolio managers are rewarded for spotting ideas before the  rest of Wall Street spots them.  </P> <P> Indeed, Wells emphasizes that its portfolio managers have to be good at doing  their own homework on stocks. The firm employed analysts to assist the  portfolio managers until 1986, then jettisoned the analysts. Bissell said his  experience is that analysts tend to "filter out information, rather than  develop new ideas."  </P> <P> Operating independently, Wells' portfolio managers can tap ideas from a wide  range of sources, including analysts employed by Wall Street brokerages. Wells  has a reputation for demanding a lot of those analysts. "We manage Wall Street  a lot harder," Bissell admitted. "We make them jump through little hoops" for  Wells' business, he said. The reason simply is that "really good stock ideas  are hard to come by," he said.  </P> <P> Along the same lines, Wells doesn't spread its dollars over a wide universe of  stocks, despite running $30 billion. "We tend to focus in on about 300  companies," Bissell said. "If we're going to take a position in a stock, we'll  make it meaningful."  </P> <P> The firm's best ideas show up on a 20-stock focus list. Some of the stocks on  that list now include Bank of New York ($37.625 Thursday), North Carolina  banking giant NCNB ($41), heavy equipment makers Harnischfeger ($20.25) and  Caterpillar ($67.125), computer maker Tandem ($25) and insurance firm Aon Corp.  ($40.625).  </P> <P> Technology stocks are "notably absent" from the stock list now, Bissell said,  because Wells' portfolio managers no longer see much value in the group, which  has soared this year.  </P> <P> Briefly: The Greenwich Associates poll of 1,500 money managers once again named  Goldman, Sachs the best brokerage for stock research, Investment Dealers'  Digest reports. The Greenwich poll isn't released publicly but usually is  leaked. Merrill Lynch came in second, and First Boston was third. . . .  Allergan, the Irvine-based eye-care products firm, has picked up another  recommendation. Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards recently initiated coverage with  a "buy" recommendation. Allergan closed at $18 Thursday.  </P> <P> THE RETURN OF JUNK  </P> <P> Junk bond mutual funds rallied sharply in May, as bargain-hunters chased after  selected depressed bonds, bidding the prices up significantly. But most funds  still are down for the year.

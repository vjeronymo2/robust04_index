			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: No good on the button Sir, Your report, 'MEPs back more funds for Ulster' (September 28), tells us that four Euro-MPs 'inadvertently pressed the wrong button'. It does not take much intelligence to be a Euro MP, but they ought to be able to press the correct button. A chimpanzee has a 50 per cent chance of getting it right. Let us hope they never get their fingers near a button which matters. K M R Price, Shepherds Barn, Shelfield, Alcester, Warwickshire B49 6JW</p>

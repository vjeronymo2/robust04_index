			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / London Stock Exchange: UB doubts Strong rumours that United Biscuits had lost its bid for Royal Brands, the Spanish food group put up for sale by the state-owned Tabaclera, weakened the shares, already suffering from the fading bid talk. Nabisco was the company said to have been successful in its bid. The US group had already lodged an offer, said to be in the region of Pta17bn, for a 50 per cent stake in January. While this was being considered by the Spanish authorities, a consortium led by United Biscuits also tabled an offer. A counter-offer from Nabisco was then made and talk in the London market yesterday suggested it had been successful. UB wanted Royal Brands' biscuit division, which represented around 40 per cent of sales, and which would have cost the company in the region of Pounds 70m. Its unnamed European partners would have taken the other parts of the business. A UB spokesman said the company had also heard the story but had no confirmation. One analyst suggested that a UB failure would not be seen too negatively in the market, given the increase in gearing and the worrying state of the Spanish economy. UB shares weakened 7 to 411p.</p>

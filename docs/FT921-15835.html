			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem may sue in order to obtain Pounds 12.25m award JOHN MOWLEM, the construction group, said an arbitrator had awarded it Pounds 12.25m, plus costs, in the latest round of its dispute with Carlton Gate Development Company, a London development concern which went into receivership in November. Mowlem claims that Eagle Star, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, has a 50 per cent stake in CGDC and put the company into receivership to avoid its financial obligations. Mr John Marshall, joint managing director of Mowlem, said his company would seek to obtain the sum awarded, plus costs, by suing Eagle Star and the banking consortium - led by Security Pacific EuroFinance - which owns the rest of CGDC. He also intended to pursue the behaviour of the insurance company and the banks with the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bank of England. Eagle Star said it continued to dispute Mowlem's claims and would strongly defend any court action. It considered the result of the arbitration was largely meaningless, because CGDC was in receivership at the time of the hearings and so its criticisms of Mowlem were not presented. CGDC was set up to build luxury flats on the site of the old St Mary's Hospital near the Regent's Canal on the edge of Maida Vale.</p>

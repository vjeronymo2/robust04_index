			<p><P> October 3, 1990, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SUN SETTING ON THE FLEET;  </P> <P> FISHING: A WAY OF LIFE FOR FOUR GENERATIONS HAS COME TO AN END FOR THE ZOLEZZI  FAMILY. THEY AND OTHER TUNA FISHERMEN HAVE RELUCTANTLY BOWED TO ENVIRONMENTAL  AND ECONOMIC FACTORS.  </P> <P> The old fisherman died in the spring and his son and grandson agree on one  thing:  </P> <P> It would have broken the old man's heart -- San Diego harbor without a Zolezzi  family tuna fishing boat, a harbor with only a handful of tuna vessels  remaining in what once was a thriving tuna fishing community.  </P> <P> John Zolezzi, who was 81 when he died in April, a believer in the family  tradition, never would have believed this.  </P> <P> "He'd probably be glad not to be around to see it," says John Zolezzi III.  </P> <P> "No question, I don't think he would have wanted to see it," adds John Zolezzi  Jr. "He wouldn't have believed it."  </P> <P> After four generations, beginning after the turn of the century, like many of  the tuna fishing Italian- and Portuguese-American families in San Diego, the  Zolezzis have sold their tuna seiners. Those are the boats with the huge purse  seine nets that major tuna canners have said they no longer will accept as a  method of catching tuna because it also can kill dolphin that follow schools of  tuna.  </P> <P> When the purchase papers were signed Friday after months of negotiations,  another bit of San Diego tradition died.  </P> <P> The government of Yap, an island nation in the western Pacific, bought the Mary  Antoinette from John Jr. and John III and the Marietta from Julius Zolezzi,  John Jr.'s brother.  </P> <P> From a high of more than 250 tuna boats years ago, the number of San  Diego-based vessels has dwindled as the U.S. tuna fishing and canning industry  dies, taken over by foreign fishing fleets and canneries as a result of  environmental and economic factors.  </P> <P> About 45 tuna seiners still are owned by San Diego entities, but only a few  actually use San Diego as a base of operation, and those vessels are expected  to be sold soon.  </P> <P> From a business that supported generations of Portuguese and Italian families,  tuna fishing in San Diego has been reduced to this: a few boats, plain, simple,  weathered workhorses of the ocean, tied up at the Embarcadero.  </P> <P> "It's no longer economical for these guys and their  </P> <P> families," says August Felando, president since 1960 of the San Diego-based  American Tunaboat Assn. "All the jobs are going overseas. . . . It bothers me  that the tuna fishing history here is ending."  </P> <P> As with other tuna fishing families, the economic hammer has fallen hard on the  Zolezzis and they have little choice but to leave the business, Felando said.  </P> <P> "I have known them for years, of course," Felando said, "and it's a shame, but  it's happening all over. The chances are not too good" that tuna fishing will  survive in San Diego.  </P> <P> Like countless men before them, four generations of Zolezzis have spent their  lives at sea. The old-timers stood in the racks along the sides of the boats on  the open ocean, rolling waist-deep in the sea, using bamboo poles like pistons  -- dip and pull, dip and pull -- to snatch the fish from the chum-baited  eastern Pacific until the schools fled into the deep or filled the ship's  holding tanks and the cycle started anew with someone climbing into the crow's  nest to search for new schools.  </P> <P> And the younger generations, using the giant nets (purse seines) developed in  the mid-1960s, working as hard as their great-grandfathers but in different  ways, still weathering storms, sharks and tedium for months at a time when the  only thing on the horizon was more horizon and a sun overhead baked their skin  and etched deep wrinkles in their necks.  </P> <P> The Zolezzi family story is a blue-collar tale rich with hard work, laughter,  pain and pride, like those of other San Diego tuna families.  </P> <P> John Zolezzi Jr.'s great-grandfather, a fisherman who had emigrated from Italy,  moved from San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake to San Diego, where he took  up rock cod fishing and eventually tuna.  </P> <P> Rearing a family in Point Loma, he went to sea, as did his son, John, and  John's son, John Jr., and his son, John III. John IV, age 9, never got the  chance.  </P> <P> "He loves fishing and he might have gone into tuna fishing, but who knows?" his  father says. "I'd support him in whatever he does."  </P> <P> From humble beginnings after the turn of the century, many local Portuguese-  and Italian-Americans have earned a good living from tuna fishing, enough to  reside in affluent Point Loma, whose hills overlook the harbor from which they  departed.  </P> <P> In his Point Loma house last week, John Jr., retired since 1981, is sitting in  his home with the view of the bay spread out like a 3-D painting, the brown  mountains beyond the city, sailboats down in the harbor.  </P> <P> A private man, big and strong, Zolezzi, 58, is typical of many tuna fishermen  -- a close-knit bunch, made even tighter by the dolphin controversy, angry at  being driven out of business (unfairly, they say), still a little shell-shocked  at losing their way of life, wary of outsiders.  </P> <P> Zolezzi talks about the old days of bait or pole fishing when you worked around  the clock, catching bait, preparing feather flies that resembled squid, using  bamboo poles and a lot of muscle to catch, move and store the tuna.  </P> <P> He and his brother, Julius, 59, fished when they were boys and started going on  their father's tuna runs during their high school summers. While they ended up  captaining their own boats, brother Michael owns a helicopter service that  spots tuna schools for the big modern boats.  </P> <P> "My family's always owned boats, and I always thought I'd be a fisherman," John  says. "I liked fishing, but not the time away at sea. Still, it was the best  way for me to support my family."  </P> <P> He looks like he could tell a million tales, but you can see it on his face:  He's not much of a talker and he's not a man who dwells on the past, so he  doesn't know where to begin, how to explain in an hour what it took him a  lifetime to learn.  </P> <P> "It's a real loss to San Diego, this heritage, all the families that came from  Europe and settled here," Zolezzi says. "It was hard work, but we stuck with  it; lot of ups and downs, a lot of sacrifice, but good pay. Now it's all dying  out."  </P> <P> He skips around a lot, touching on memories here and there, the advantages of  purse seining, with the great nets scooping massive amounts of fish, versus the  old one-at-a-time bait fishing ("God, more volume!" he says).  </P> <P> "I miss going to sea, but deep down, I don't miss it. If you know what I mean?"  he says. And later: "Tuna fishing is kind of like farming; you've got to feel  it, it's got to be in your blood . . . but you've got to learn it, too."  </P> <P> In the end, a little frustrated, he shows an old video of tuna fishing. It  shows men in crew cuts, maybe early 1960s, wiry arms, breaking their backs with  bait fishing, slapping the surface with the tips of the long poles, jerking the  feeding tuna up and over their shoulders onto the boat, filling the belly of  the ship with tons of fish, one at a time.  </P> <P> Zolezzi stands there, smiling. "There," he says, pointing at the screen, "look  at those guys work. They work hard today, don't get me wrong, but do you think  you get guys to do that kind of work today? Do you see what I mean?"  </P> <P> Down at the docks, the Mary Antoinette sits empty. The great black nets are  piled on the back. Most of the crew has gone, some to tuna fishing jobs with  foreign or U.S. flagged vessels based in the western Pacific, some taking  land-based jobs.  </P> <P> The boat's gangplank is not up; despite two big dogs and warning signs,  tourists try to come aboard as if the seiner is another aquatic museum  gathering dust. The boats will leave for Yap in 60 days after being remodeled  to handle heavier loads.  </P> <P> Zolezzi's son, John III, 34, the boat's captain since 1980, has cleared out his  cabin. The 14-man crew's cabins are empty. The tuna storage tanks are empty.  The pilot house is empty. The engine room is empty.  </P> <P> The dock is empty, too, except for a few fellow tunamen who come to shoot the  breeze awhile, everyone waiting for the sale of the boats to go through.  </P> <P> John III, whose brothers also are in the fishing industry, plans to stay in  tuna fishing, working in the western Pacific with other West Coast tuna-men,  making the long flight home between fishing trips. He has no specific job lined  up, but something will turn up, he says.  </P> <P> "Yeah, I'll probably go to the other side (of the Pacific)," he says. "Less  pay, more time away from the family, but you have to make a living."  </P> <P> He holds a cigarette in his hands, which look like meat hooks, like all tuna  fishermen's hands -- calloused, beaten up, the fingers a little crooked, the  fingernails battered. He talks about the lure of the sea a little more  expansively than his father. But not much.  </P> <P> "You've just got to like being out at sea. It's a strain on the family, but I  have a good wife. You've got to have a good wife," he says.  </P> <P> Down the dock is the Mary Antoinette's sister ship, the Marietta, owned until  Friday by Julius Zolezzi, John Jr.'s brother. The 165-foot vessels were built  in 1969. Julius also owns three tuna boats in the western Pacific. Like his  fishermen brethren, he complains about environmentalists and the public not  knowing "the real story" about the number of dolphins killed in purse seines,  how the tuna-men are the true protectors of both of the tuna and dolphin  stocks.  </P> <P> But his heart does not seem in the argument in the days following the sale of  his boat.  </P> <P> "Our family's been in it for 90 years. When the (sale) papers were signed, I  was really just kind of numb. . . . It brought back a lot of memories," he  says.  </P> <P> And then a few more memories jump up in his face, and the middle-age fisherman  chokes up again.  </P> <P> Excuse me, he says. "I'm getting a little emotional. . . . I'm not really  jumping for joy now that the boat's sold, I'll tell you that."  </P></p>

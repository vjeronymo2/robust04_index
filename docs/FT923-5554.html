			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Travel: The sound of tour buses - James Henderson traces the hallowed footsteps of Julie Andrews BARE mention of Salzburg is enough to send some people into a spin. They hear the intoxicating strains of Strauss and see a host of waltzers processing around a baroque ballroom. And Salzburg is Mozart's birthplace. My sophisticated friends made a pilgrimage there last year to honour the bicentenary of his death. Rightfully, the town has a special place in the heart of every music lover. So why was it that the first thing I discovered in Salzburg was The Sound of Music minibus tour? I could feel my sense of the absurd twitching at once. I scuttled to the back of the bus and surveyed my fellow passengers. Up front were three college girls from Ohio on a lightning tour of Europe; next were two Australians, who looked as though they had been on the road for a couple of years (their rucksacks were emblazoned with flags from almost every town between Athens and Glasgow); next to me was a timid South American who hid behind his camera bag. Gingerly, we sounded each other about Sound of Music knowledge - director (Robert Wise); date (1964); how many Oscars (five). Spontaneously the bus began to hum. Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes, snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes . . . As we drove, scenes of the film appeared before me. We passed the suspension bridge, now ageing, beneath the castle. I half expected to see Julie Andrews race by with a crowd of children. Pieter, the tour guide, was a fount of information. Although the story is based in truth, The Sound of Music was adapted from an earlier German film, sanitised for family consumption, then turned into a musical. He corrected a few of the most flagrant myths: the butler, the arch-baddie in the film, was not so bad in reality, as he helped the family to escape from the Nazis; sorry, but the Baron was not against the family singing, either. He had been bankrupted and the septet was his main earner. We headed off, through the alley of trees where the children played in their clothes made from bastardised curtains, to the Leopoldskron Villa, one of a profusion of palaces built by the prince-archbishops of Salzburg and used in the film as the Von Trapp family home. Now it is owned by an American business school, so it cannot be visited, but the view across the lake is as attractive as ever. The gazebo is gone, though. Obviously too many couples were creeping in there at night and singing cloying duets. Pieter even took us to the original Von Trapp family villa in the suburb of Aigen. It was taken over by the SS as a communications centre during the war. Although the family returned there briefly afterwards, it is now the headquarters of a Catholic mission to South America. As we drove up into the mountains, Pieter snapped The Sound of Music soundtrack into the tape machine. The bus burst into song. The Salzkammergut, in the mountains above Salzburg, is a remarkably beautiful region of lakes, alpine peaks and gorges, where we were given a chance to practise our yodelling. Finally, we came to the spot where the film opens, with Maria chasing across the hills, turning circles, arms flung wide. It is not surprising that she was late for prayers when she heard the bell ringing - it must be 10 miles back to the abbey. The college girls danced and skipped down the hillside. The Aussies sauntered off and bought a Salzburg sticker. Occasionally a vast lens emerged from behind the camera bag. It makes me squirm just to think about it. But somehow it suited me better than a couple of hours of Mozart. Even if my smile was not entirely innocent, there was an infectious joy about The Sound of Music minibus tour.</p>

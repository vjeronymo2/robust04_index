			<p>BFN     [Text] We have just heard that, according to a Belgian  Foreign Ministry spokesman, there are no plans to evacuate  Belgian nationals from Rwanda. Belgian Foreign Minister Willy  Claes who is currently visiting Romania is staying abreast of  the situation in Rwanda. He would like the UN mission in Rwanda  to be stepped up. When we spoke to him a while ago, he  confirmed to us that there were not any Belgian casualties:    [Begin recording] [Claes] Our ambassador has confirmed that,  for now at any rate, our compatriots are not in any danger  either in the capital or elsewhere in the country, where things  appear to be calm.    Nevertheless, I must add that regarding our peacekeeping  forces, who number some 480, everything is in order, although  our blue helmets, who are responsible for the protection of the  airport, are staying in the airport. They are not taking the  risk of returning to their barracks. I would say that  everything is calm for the moment concerning our compatriots.    [Unidentified correspondent] Have you taken measures for a  possible evacuation?    [Claes] Absolutely: We have set up a crisis unit at the  department in Brussels. It will stay on alert over the weekend.  All our embassies in neighboring countries are on standby,  everyone is ready.    [Correspondent] Will our Belgian UN forces take part in such  an operation?    [Claes] Not as things stand at the moment. You know that the  UN mandate is extremely limited, but it is quite clear that we  cannot accept that, even though the Belgian soldiers are under  Canadian, UN command, they should stand passively by if any of  our compatriots were in difficulty. We are taking steps in New  York and in Washington to see, if it became necessary, if we  could obtain the immediate go-ahead for our blue helmets to play  a more active role. [end recording]</p>

			<p>921015 FT  15 OCT 92 / Surplus may prompt US trade review US TRADE officials in Tokyo believe the next US administration will have to push for further measures to open the Japanese market in the light of Japan's ever growing trade surplus, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo. Japan had a record surplus of Dollars 52bn in the first half of this fiscal year to September, a rise of 32 per cent from the same period last year, according to figures for customs-cleared trade published yesterday by the finance ministry. The trade figures show a record surplus last month, of about Dollars 12.1bn, a 24 per cent rise from last year. The rise in the surplus is largely due to the stagnation of the Japanese economy, which has choked off imports, and aggressive exporting by Japan's manufacturers. One explanation for the relative lack of controversy in the US over the growing Japanese surplus may be that its surplus with Europe is growing faster. Japan's trade surplus with the EC in September was Dollars 3.5bn, with exports up 19.3 per cent on a year before, to Dollars 5.9bn, and imports up 9.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.4bn. In the first half of the fiscal year, Japan's trade surplus with the EC was Dollars 16.3bn, fuelled by an 11 per cent rise in exports from the same period last year. In contrast, exports to the US grew at 5.8 per cent last month to Dollars 9bn, the same rate as the growth of imports, to create a September trade surplus with the US of Dollars 4.8bn. Exports to the US in the first half of the fiscal year grew by 6.6 per cent to almost Dollars 47bn, while imports into Japan fell by 0.8 per cent to Dollars 21.1bn.</p>

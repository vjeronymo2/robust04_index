			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PORT TAKES ON CENTER ISSUE AS MANY STILL PROTEST NAMING IT FOR DR. KING  </P> <P> The furor over whether to rename the new bay-front convention center for the  Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. moved to the San Diego Unified Port District on  Thursday, and a majority of port commissioners said they were inundated by mail  and telephone calls from residents opposed to the change.  </P> <P> Although the City Council voted Tuesday to rename the San Diego Convention  Center for the slain civil rights leader, the Port District, which is building  the $160-million center, has final say on naming it. No date has been set for a  vote, but Port District Chairman Louis Wolfsheimer said the controversial issue  could come before the board sometime in February.  </P> <P> Despite the fact that the issue is now in Port District hands, City Council  members said Thursday that they continued to receive public input two days  after their vote to adopt the name San Diego Martin Luther King Convention  Center. Public opinion ran strongly against naming the center after King, as it  had before the vote was taken, most of the council members said. However, Wes  Pratt, the only black member of the council and a leader of the drive to honor  King, said calls to his office favored the decision.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Initiative in the Works  </P> <P> In another development Thursday, at least one San Diego resident was working to  mount an initiative to overturn the council action and keep the current name of  the center. Robert L. Pruett, a retired businessman, said he does not intend to  wait until the port commissioners vote before beginning to collect signatures.  </P> <P> Port District attorney Joe Patello said that, although commissioners are not  elected officials, the public does have the right to overturn their actions  through the initiative process.  </P> <P> The seven members of the Port District board are appointed by the councils of  the five cities that have bay-front property: San Diego (which has three  representatives on the board), Chula Vista, National City, Coronado and  Imperial Beach (which have one each). A ballot initiative to overturn a Port  District decision would have to go before voters in all five cities, Patello  said.  </P> <P> To date, three port commissioners have publicly stated that they are leaning  toward backing the decision to name the convention center after Dr. King, and  two have said they are opposed.  </P> <P> "I'm appointed by the City Council, and I certainly listen mightily to what  they want," Wolfsheimer said. "This is a building that they're going to be  leasing from us for 25 years. They should be able to name it what they want to  name it."  </P> <P> Wolfsheimer also said, however, that he received about 100 phone calls Thursday  from the public, and all but one of the callers opposed the name change.  </P> <P> "We still ought to look into this a little bit before we vote . . . hear the  pros and cons," he said.  </P> <P> Other commissioners polled Thursday said they, too, had received a surprisingly  heavy outpouring of opinion on the issue, most of it against renaming the  facility for Dr. King.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'They're the Tenant'  </P> <P> Commissioner Daniel Larsen, who also represents San Diego, said that, although  he has heard opposition to changing the center's name, he would also lean  toward following the council's wishes. "Even though we own the building,  they're the tenant, and it's up to them what they want to name the building,"  Larsen said.  </P> <P> Raymond Burk of Coronado is the sole commissioner who has said he will vote  against naming the center for King. Although Burk was ill and unable to comment  Thursday, his wife, Ramona, said a large number of phone calls have come to  their home in support of Burk's position.  </P> <P> National City representative Delton Reopelle said he wants to do more research,  but is leaning toward objecting to the name change.  </P> <P> Commissioner Milford Portwood of Imperial Beach remained undecided, repeating  his previously stated opinion that he needs more information before coming to a  decision.  </P> <P> "The only mail I've received was against renaming it, and it was mostly from  hotel owners and from the convention center community, saying that it's real  important that the name identifies the location of the convention center,"  Portwood said.  </P> <P> Commissioner Robert Penner of Chula Vista is also undecided. "I'm going to  listen to all the arguments all the way up to the last moment, and then I'll  make up my mind," Penner said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Waiting to See Split  </P> <P> Penner had previously said that his decision would be influenced by the council  split on the issue. He said Thursday that the 7-2 vote approving the name  change "tells me that the great majority of people on the council would like  it, but there is still a minority opinion. It's not a straight and absolute  100% mandate.  </P> <P> "In the end analysis, it is not the paramount issue for this city. There are  other issues that should command our attention. Whatever way we vote, the  convention center will still be a nice thing for San Diego."  </P> <P> Commissioner William Rick, who represents San Diego, was unavailable for  comment Thursday, but has said he would support the council's decision.  </P> <P> Pruett, a three-year resident of San Diego who has maintained a boat in the  area for 25 years, said he started work on the initiative before dawn Thursday.  His newly formed committee, Citizens to Keep the Name "San Diego Convention  Center," has already drawn some support, he said. He declined to name the  backers.  </P> <P> Pruett said he opposes "the City Council's blatant disregard for the  community," and denied that racism is involved. "It is an issue about the name  of the convention center, period."  </P> <P> Controversy developed last May over the name of the center -- under  construction on West Harbor Drive and scheduled to open in September -- when a  citizens advisory board recommended using it to honor Dr. King, who was  assassinated in 1968.  </P> <P> A 1986 council decision to change the name of Market Street to Martin Luther  King Way was overturned by voters in November, 1987, after a bitter campaign by  Market Street merchants opposed to the change. In response, the council  appointed an advisory board of community and business leaders to find an  appropriate tribute.  </P></p>

			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Scots 'parliament' to be scrapped SCOTLAND'S parliament-that-never-was, a debating chamber built in Edinburgh in the late 1970s, is to be scrapped, the government said last night. The Scottish Office said it had 'no foreseeable need' for the building beyond next year. It will then be decided whether to sell it or offer it to other government departments. In recent years the debating chamber has been occasionally used for meetings of the Commons Scottish Grand Committee.</p>

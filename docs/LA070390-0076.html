			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO ARRESTS 4 IN KILLING OF HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST;  </P> <P> CRIME: THE LAWYER WAS SLAIN MAY 21. HER DEATH PROMPTED THE CREATION OF A  NATIONAL PANEL TO PROBE ABUSES.  </P> <P> Two former state police officers and two other alleged gunmen have been  arrested for the murder of a prominent human rights activist whose death  brought Mexico international condemnation, Sinaloa state officials announced  Monday.  </P> <P> The suspects gunned down Norma Corona Sapien, a lawyer and president of the  independent Human Right Commission of Sinaloa, in downtown Culiacan on May 21,  officials said. But they conceded that the so-called intellectual authors of  the crime have not been found.  </P> <P> State police indicated Corona's death was ordered by a drug kingpin because she  had uncovered information connecting him to the murders of three Venezuelans  and a Mexican lawyer last February.  </P> <P> "She had touched powerful interests," Fernando Torres Gomez, an investigator  for the state attorney general's office, told reporters at a press conference  here.  </P> <P> But Jorge Higuera, Corona's colleague in a Sinaloa lawyers association, said  the motive for and the mastermind of the killing were still unresolved.  </P> <P> "There is great uncertainty about who and why. We have the material authors,  but we want the intellectual authors, the ones who paid. The motive has not  been established," Higuera said.  </P> <P> He noted afterward that Corona had told her colleagues she was "very concerned  and afraid" of the Federal Judicial Police, whom she suspected in the four  earlier killings.  </P> <P> In response to national and international pressure, President Carlos Salinas de  Gortari created a national human rights commission last month to pursue this  case and other alleged abuses. His government's human rights record has come  under sharp attack from the U.S.-based Americas Watch and other rights groups.  </P> <P> Eager to show progress, the federal attorney general's office flew dozens of  reporters to this northwestern farming state for the press conference with Gov.  Francisco Labastida Ochoa and state police officials.  </P> <P> Two of the suspects -- Jacobo Chavez Lafarga, alias "The Horse," and Jorge  Rosario Quintero -- are former police officers. The other suspects are Camilo  Beltran Gastelum and Fermin Beltran Murillo.  </P> <P> A fifth suspect, Santos Arellano Bazan, also a former state police officer, was  killed in a shoot-out in Tijuana last Friday, police said. Higuera said he  believes that Santos was slain when police tried to capture him.  </P> <P> Several other suspects remain at large.  </P> <P> Officials said the charges are based on the suspects' confessions but that they  do not have the murder weapons or evidence such as ballistics tests connecting  them to the killing. Police said they have found the blue pickup truck that  witness said was used by the gunmen and that police uniforms were found in a  safehouse used by the suspects.  </P> <P> Authorities assert that alleged drug trafficker Luis (El Guero) Palmas is  behind the four killings in February and Corona's murder.  </P> <P> The victims of the February killings were abducted from their homes at  gunpoint, and their tortured bodies were discovered nearly three weeks later.  Family members said the kidnapers identified themselves as Federal Judicial  Police.  </P> <P> No one has been arrested in connection with those killings.  </P> <P> Corona had been investigating the murders. She was gunned down in the street as  she tried to flee from gunmen who followed her when she left her office.  </P></p>

			<p>920131 FT  31 JAN 92 / Survey of World Industrial Review (6): In confusion and disarray - Computers THE computer industry enters 1992 in confusion and disarray. The major hardware manufacturers are all in difficulties. International Business Machines (IBM), the largest manufacturer, and Digital Equipment (DEC), the leading minicomputer supplier, are among the companies reporting declining sales and losses for 1991. IBM, the bellwether of the US industrial economy, had the worst year in its history - the first time growth had fallen on a year-on-year basis since 1946 and the first pretax loss in living memory. Apple Computer, the largest personal computer manufacturer, made pretax profits of only Dollars 310m after a Dollars 224m restructuring charge in the third quarter to finance a 10 per cent cut in its workforce. Compaq, the skyrocket of the US personal computer industry, ran out of sparkle and fell heavily to earth, deposing its chairman and founder, Mr Rod Canion, on the way and bringing in a European, Mr Eckhard Pfeiffer, to engineer a change in the company's fortunes. The surviving European owned manufacturers, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, Bull of France and Olivetti of Italy, all lost money last year and have put in place wide-ranging recovery plans. The Japanese manufacturers, Fujitsu, Hitachi and NEC, which have hitherto grown strongly on the back of a buoyant home market, faltered as problems with the powerful Japanese banks and hints of scandals in Tokyo shook business confidence. Some manufacturers - Sun Microsystems, a US supplier of high performance workstations, for example - seemed relatively unaffected. For many software and services companies, too, 1991 was a good year. Microsoft, the leading personal computer software supplier, posted its eighth consecutive quarter of growth at the end of January, boosted by strong demand for its 'Windows' family of products which make IBM's design of pc easier to use. The industry is in such a confusing state because it is at the confluence of three seemingly irresistible forces which are forcing large and small companies to reevaluate their market strategies. These forces are: technological change, which by reducing barriers to entry and stimulating price competition is reducing hardware manufacturers' profitability. the recession in the US, Australasia and much of Europe which is damaging customers' ability to pay for new computer equipment and forcing them to delay decisions on new computer-based projects. customers' disenchantment with the benefits of computerisation, which is reducing their willingness to invest further in data processing equipment. There is also the effect of the growth of 'open systems' on the market. This has to date made more impact in Europe than the US or Japan but is becoming a worldwide phenomenon. Open systems imply hardware and software that obey industry-wide standards; computers obeying these standards can be connected together easily, while most manufacturers' traditional proprietary designs can be interconnected only with great difficulty. Because most large corporations have over the years built up a diverse collection of computer systems, they can see obvious advantages in moves to open systems. The open systems movement centres around an operating system called 'Unix' developed originally by AT&amp;T. Two rival camps have sprung up, with each promoting its own 'flavour' of Unix. Unix International has as its principal member AT&amp;T; the Open Software Foundation is led effectively by IBM. The signs are that the two sides this year will call a truce and agree a single Unix standard. Hardware companies are reacting in two principal ways to the problems besetting the industry. First, they are restructuring on a grand scale. Their most pressing need is to bring their staff numbers into line with reduced profit margins. IBM, for example, is going through the most profound change in its 66 year history; some 29,000 jobs went last year and a further 20,000 job cuts are planned for 1992. The idea is to shrink to about 350,000 people or less worldwide without forced redundancies. IBM's approach has been to offer attractive severance packages. The cost has been huge. Last year, it took a restructuring charge of Dollars 3.4bn and a further Dollars 2.3bn for the future cost of health care benefits for IBM pensioners. The company is increasingly attempting to turn itself from a monolithic dinosaur with a cumbersome, centralised decision-making procedure into a series of self-contained, entrepreneurial units, each responsible for its own profit and loss. Second, they are merging or forming marketing agreements or technological collaborations. In Europe, only Siemens Nixdorf has the capacity to survive alone, chiefly through the financial strength of the parent company. (And Siemens has found it expedient to collaborate with IBM on the next generation of high capacity memory chips.) The performance of the computer industry in 1992 will depend heavily on rejuvenation of the world economy. But no matter how strong the recovery, industry observers agree that the boom times of the 1980s will not be repeated.</p>

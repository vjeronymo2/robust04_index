			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Chemicals join drugs on downgrade THE decline in pharm-aceuticals continued yesterday, joined by caution about the imminent chemical companies reporting season, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT saw a drop of 19.16 in the DAX index as turnover rose from DM5.4bn to DM5.8bn. The biggest falls were in Mannesmann, and the big three chemicals as the results season approached. Mannesmann said that 1992 profits would be sharply down on 1991, and the shares fell DM7.70 to DM247 after a string of downgrades from analysts. Bayer had the worst fall among chemicals, DM7.80 to DM273.80, with Hoechst DM5.40 lower at DM264.90 and BASF down DM5.30 at DM228.70. For European chemicals as a group, Goldman Sachs expected a generally poor 1992 final quarter and warnings over prospects for 1993. The brokers expected dividend cuts from BASF and Hoechst: 'Bayer has no financial reason to cut', they wrote, 'but may feel the need to make a gesture for socio-political reasons.' One of the team, Mr Mark Tracey, added that stocks with drugs exposure were catching a cold from the Clinton reforms and their consequences in the US market. STOCKHOLM saw further heavy US selling of Astra which left the B shares down another SKr20 on the day at SKr655 for a fall of 5.7 per cent since the group announced its 1992 results on Monday. Mr David Longmuir of James Capel said that Astra was likely to remain volatile over the next few days. US investors, he said, were concerned at the effect President Bill Clinton's proposals to regulate healthcare pricing, due to be announced in May, would have on the sector. The Affarsvarlden general index lost 8.1 to 987.9 with turnover in Astra accounting for some SKr425m of the SKr1.1bn total. Handelsbanken clawed back some of an early fall on a heavy 1992 loss, the B shares closing SKr2.50 lower at SKr45.50 after a day's low of SKr41.00. Loan losses of 2.8 per cent of total lending compared well with an average of some 6 per cent for the sector as a whole. PARIS eased on a rise in short term interest rates, triggered by a weaker franc, and sporadic profit-taking. The CAC-40 index declined 15.10 to 1,944.13, after a high of 1,966 and a low of 1,938, as turnover remained resilient at FFr2. bn. LVMH was downgraded by brokers James Capel after announcing that it had cut the retail price of some of its champagne labels in France, Switzerland and Germany. Mr Louic Morvan of Capel, in Paris, said that he had lowered his EPS estimates from FFr212.50 to FFr203.00 for 1993, and from FFr239.20 to FFr229.60 for 1994. The shares dipped FFr86 to FFr3,265. He added that the change in pricing policy was an attempt to maintain market share and to counter imports, particularly of Italian sparkling wines, which benefited from devaluation. ZURICH continued to be undermined by sales of pharmaceutical stocks as domestic investors took a lead from their US counterparts, and the SMI index shed 45.4. or 2.1 per cent to 2,050.4. Sandoz was among the hardest hit, falling SFr150 or 5 per cent to SFr2,990. Roche shed SFr180 to SFr3,830 while Ciba-Geigy was SFr18 lower at SFr628. Banks and insurers also declined in spite of further reductions in domestic interest rates. Union Bank fell SFr7 to SFr936, CS Holding dipped SFr20 to SFr2,140 and Zurich Insurance declined SFr30 to SFr2,200. MILAN was again overshadowed by political worries but an unexpected rebound by Fiat, as investors shrugged off Monday's arrest of two executives, helped the market ahead. The Comit index rose 1.02 to 502.94. The decision by the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, to call a confidence vote later in the week did little to assuage the uncertainty which has left the lira sinking against the D-mark. Fiat dominated trading with domestic buyers turning out in force. The shares fixed L45 lower at L5,305 but then bounced back to L5,440 in late business. MADRID's equities followed Monday's slide in Spanish bonds, as pressure mounted against the peseta. The Bank of Spain's decision to leave its benchmark interest rate untouched at 13.00 per cent at a securities repurchase tender early in the day failed to reassure investors, and the general index closed 4.46, or 1.9 per cent lower at 227.92. AMSTERDAM was flat on the day with the CBS Tendency index at 100.1, but Philips closed off 90 cents at Fl 22.60 after the group said that it was to consolidate Grundig, the German electronics company, in its 1992 accounts. Unilever advanced Fl 3.10 to Fl 199.40 after its 1992 results were well received. COPENHAGEN saw a fall in the biotechnology group, Novo, and higher domestic money market rates. The KFX index lost 0.87 to 83.38. Novo fell DKr16 to DKr580, in line with the lower trend in European pharmaceutical issues.  --------------------------------------------------------------------                    FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- February 23                                       THE EUROPEAN SERIES  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes            Open      10.30      11.00       12.00  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1132.06    1130.89    1129.78     1125.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1193.02    1190.29    1189.40     1184.82  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes           13.00      14.00      15.00       Close  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100    1124.88    1123.42    1122.25     1119.41 FT-SE Eurotrack 200    1184.34    1181.47    1181.10     1178.69  --------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 22    Feb 19    Feb 18    Feb 17    Feb 16  -------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1132.76   1136.60   1132.95   1121.77   1123.14 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1190.84   1191.09   1191.03   1173.51   1179.54  -------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  -------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1132.06; 200 - 1193.31 Low/day: 100 - 1119.09 200 - 1177.11.  --------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO MARKET WATCH  </P> <P> Investors' Intelligence, in the most pessimistic outlook that it has published  since June, 1982, recently reported that 57.3% of market analysts are bearish,  12.8% predict a correction, and 29.9% are bullish, according to Irving Katz,  director of research for Thomas Green/San Diego Securities.  </P> <P> Contrarians think this is a positive sign for stocks because there is a pile of  cash now sitting on the sidelines that is available to fuel the next rally,  Katz said.  </P> <P> On Monday, however, the market continued to fall, and investors remained on the  sidelines. Most San Diego stocks continued their meandering, moving a point or  two either way, Katz said.  </P> <P> A new low was recorded by Great American Bank at $4.875 on Monday volume of  287,800 shares. The stock was down $1.125 for the week. Investors are concerned  about the delay in Great American's quarterly earnings statement, which was  scheduled for two weeks ago.  </P> <P> HomeFed Corp., on the other hand, moved up and down $1 during the week and  closed unchanged.  </P> <P> There was some good news helping some stocks rise. Cubic Corp. gained $1.125 to  $17 for the week after reporting first-quarter earnings that rose 84% to 92  cents a share, up from $.50 during the like quarter the year before.  </P> <P> International Totalizator reported $.20 in fourth-quarter net income, and $.45  for the year, as the stock gained $.5625 for the week.  </P> <P> The best point gainer for the week was Mail Boxes Etc., which gained $3.25. The  only new high was recorded by Magma Power at $33, which closed the week at  $31.50.  </P> <P> Other upward moves were made by First National, up $1.125 and Maxwell  Laboratories, up $1.  </P> <P> On the downside, San Diego Gas &amp; Electric reacted to the unfavorable report  of the staff of the Public Utilities Commission that came out against the  merger with Southern California Edison. The stock closed down $1.25 for the  week.  </P> <P> X-Scribe hit a new low of $.3125 as losses continued. The company lost $.06 a  share in its latest quarter, compared to a $.65 loss during the like quarter  the year before.  </P> <P> Annual meetings scheduled this week include Cubic on Wednesday, Psycor and  Wavetek on Friday and DECOM Systems on Saturday.  </P></p>

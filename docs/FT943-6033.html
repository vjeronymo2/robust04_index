			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / World Trade News: Asia-Pacific pledge urged on trade curbs Leaders of the 17 countries of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum should commit themselves this year to eliminating by 2020 all barriers to trade and investment in the region, an international advisory panel has recommended. The panel's report says liberalisation should not be confined to Apec countries, but should seek to reinforce the multilateral trade system by simultaneously extending the benefits of freer trade to non-members. The report is the most detailed effort yet to draft a blueprint for the development of the five-year-old organisation. It was drafted by a 16-member eminent persons' group at the request of last year's Apec summit in Seattle. The authors call on Apec leaders to agree at their next meeting, in Jakarta in November, to launch the liberalisation programme in the year 2000 and to pledge themselves to completing it over the next 20 years. Though the report's recommendations are unan-imously backed by its authors, some have admitted that they do not expect all their proposals to win political approval quickly. Mr Neville Wran, Australia's representative on the eminent persons' group, said yesterday that the liberalisation timetable yesterday was some-thing of a vision, and that over-hasty efforts to turn Apec into a more formal organisation could damage confidence in it. Apec members have already displayed sharp differences about the pace and direction of future development. While the report's findings seem likely to be broadly favoured by industrialised countries such as the US and Australia, reactions in Asia are expected to be more mixed. The report says more advanced Apec members should dismantle all their trade and investment barriers by 2010, and developing countries by 2020. As well as tackling border obstacles, liberalisation should extend to such matters as government procurement and technical standards. The authors say the programme should aim for 'open regionalism' by building on - and in some cases going beyond - the principles of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. They emphasise that Apec should not become a customs union and should avoid the 'over-institutionalisation and over-bureaucratisation' typified by the European Union. 'Without any reservation whatsoever, we strongly oppose the creation of a trading bloc that would be inward-looking and would divert from the pursuit of global free trade,' the report says. Individual Apec countries should instead be encouraged to liberalise trade unilaterally as fast as possible, while the organisation should be ready to negotiate concessions with non-members on a reciprocal basis. However, the report says that unless Apec leaders move rapidly to launch a liberalisation drive, the group's achievement could be jeopardised by fragmentation and discrimination caused by a proliferation of sub-regional economic groupings. To prevent this happening, the authors call on groupings such as the North American Free Trade Area to undertake to extend to the whole of Apec the trade preferences enjoyed by their members.</p>

The DP said in  a statement that the increases were outrageous and asked the  commission for administration to rescind the decision  immediately. The DP spokesman on the public service, Mr. Roger  Burrows, criticized what he called the secretive manner in which  the increases had been handled. Earlier at a conference on the  reconstruction of the country the ANC decided to ask that the  increases be frozen, and that the Transitional Executive Council  [TEC] investigate the matter.    The minister in charge of the public service, Mr. Sam de  Beer, says that only 1.5 percent of the 850 million rands made  available in May last year for salary increases was set aside  for senior officials. He said about 35 percent of the money had  been earmarked for lower qualified public servants. Mr. de Beer  said he would comment further on the issue at a news conference  on Thursday [27 Thrusday].</p>

			<p>931028 FT  28 OCT 93 / International Company News: Base metal price decline pushes Cominco into red THE DECLINE in base metals prices and inventory write-downs pushed Cominco, the Canadian metals group, into losses for the third quarter and first nine months of 1993. The quarter's loss was CDollars 70.2m (USDollars 53.1m), or 89 cents a share, against profit of CDollars 51.8m, or 64 cents, a year earlier on sales down to CDollars 213m from CDollars 357m. The sales decline partly reflected a reduced interest in Cominco Fertilisers. In addition the 1992 figures included a CDollars 39.1m special gain. In the nine months, the loss was CDollars 123.3m, or CDollars 1.58, against profit of CDollars 65m, or 79 cents, on revenues of CDollars 730m, compared with CDollars 1.1bn. Cominco said technical changes reduced zinc concentrate output at the Red Dog mine in Alaska but mill throughput and recovery rates will soon improve. Mr Patrick Mars, analyst with Bunting Warburg, Toronto, says some recovery is expected in lead and zinc prices next year following production cuts in Canada and elsewhere and in view of potential smelter shutdowns. TransCanada PipeLines earned CDollars 87.8m, or 40 cents a share, in the third quarter, up from CDollars 83.9m, or 39 cents a share, on revenues of CDollars 1bn, against CDollars 853m. Nine months' profit was CDollars 267m, or CDollars 1.22, up from CDollars 244.4m, or CDollars 1.17, on revenues of CDollars 3.1bn, against CDollars 2.6bn.</p>

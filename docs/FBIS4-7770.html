			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Wieslaw Dominik, acting director of the </F> State Treasury Agricultural Property Agency in Wroclaw, by  Krzysztof Debek; place and date not given]    [Text] [Debek] Are you here to save the state farms [PGR]  or to liquidate them?    [Dominik] I am here to restructure the state sector in our  agriculture. Our agency is a fiduciary organ, whose principal  brief is to privatize state assets by selling them or renting  them out.    [Debek] So, in the final account, it amounts to liquidation,  does it not?    [Dominik] You could say so, although a special section,  Section XIV, of the agency has been set up in Warsaw to  represent agricultural enterprises of particular significance to  the national agriculture, such as stock-breeding farms, plant  nurseries, and seed-production centers. These will either  remain under state administration or be transformed into joint  ventures, with the State Treasury as the dominant shareholder.  On the whole, however, local divisions of the State Treasury  Agricultural Property Agency take over the PGR's in order to  liquidate them. Here I should add that, during the transition  period, the agency, as the owner, extends financial assistance  to at least some spheres of the PGR's operation, such as  housing, or, in justified cases, helps with the purchase of seed  material or crop-protection products. After all, we must not  allow freshly sown crops to go to waste, and banks no longer  provide credits for the PGR's.    [Debek] You could get the impression that this is an  ideological policy. Even the good PGR's are to be sacrificed  because they are children of an ideologically incorrect system.  The unfairness is compounded by the fact that most state farms  suffer financial difficulties not because they have been  incompetently or wastefully managed but as a result of the  financial reform introduced by [former Finance Minister]  Balcerowicz and the resultant astronomical interest on bank  loans to agriculture, loans that are temporarily "frozen" in  crop production and stock-raising ventures.    [Dominik] Agreed, but, in the first place, these debts are  very real, and no one will relieve the PGR's of them.  Agricultural farms in lower Silesia owe almost 1.5 trillion  zlotys [Z] to the banks, the state budget, and their  contractors. And, even if interest constitutes the lion's share  of that debt, that does not change the picture. Second, there  have always been farms that are more successful and those that  are less so--and this not only because of differences in soil  quality, equipment, or location but because of different  management systems, varying degrees of care taken over their  assets, or prudence in making major investment decisions. It is  no coincidence that, even in these difficult times, certain  PGR's, mostly in Walbrzych Voivodship but also some in Wroclaw  Voivodship, manage quite well on their own. The worst situation  is currently with PGR's in Jelenia Gora Voivodship: All of them  have by now lost their creditworthiness.    [Debek] That is because they operate under the most adverse  climatic and soil conditions. The previous authorities in power  deliberately subsidized such farms in order to provide work for  people in the area and utilize land that, on ideological  principles, could not be left uncultivated. In addition, in the  last analysis, attention was paid to the output obtained from  those farms--that is, to the tons of livestock and grain--rather  than to their cost-effectiveness. In addition, certain capital  investments that still place great financial burden on state  farms today are the result of earlier decisions imposed on them  by the central administration. Ambitious powers-that-be would  stipulate, quite arbitrarily, that a dozen poultry farms be  built in one place, a huge dairy farm in another--more often  than not in the middle of nowhere--and a massive stock  production unit for 5,000 beef calves. They gave the orders and  provided the funds....    [Dominik] Even so, some farm managers were also very eager  for their farms to be earmarked for such major investment  projects. They were brilliantly skilled at justifying the  financial and general economic profitability of such  undertakings, and, later on, at manipulating the results so as  to justify allocation of high bonuses for the economic effects.  I was employed in such PGR's for 10 years, and I know only too  well how things were.    [Debek] Such were the times and such were the conditions to  which the PGR managers had to adjust. However, you are also  aware that, regardless of the statistical manipulations of which  they were guilty, given their trained cadres, their access to  modern agrotechnology, and their financial resources, the PGR's  provided models of modern agricultural technology and  organization in Poland's rural sector. They were the first to  introduce new varieties of crop plants and new stock-feeding  systems; they persuaded the traditional peasant farmers that it  was in their interest to apply fertilizers, to use  crop-protection products, and so on. Who will assume the  state's leading role in this capacity now, in our impoverished  and fragmented rural sector?    [Dominik] The PGR's are being transformed, but they will not  disappear from the map of Poland's economy. Only a proportion  of our agricultural land will go into the hands of individual  farmers and be submitted to fragmentation. The general  principle is that whole farming complexes should be sold or  rented in their entirety, together with the land, which should  go with them on a rational basis. In this way, our rural sector  will retain large and modern farming complexes. The only  difference will be that they will be owned privately and managed  in a better way. And, in general, they will be able to remain  whole precisely because they will be transformed: This is  because they will be handed over by us to new owners without the  burden of debts. That is precisely the chance they need! The  debts will be taken over by the agency, and it will pay them off  with money obtained from the profits it makes from the  privatization scheme.    [Debek] But where are you going to find those hypothetical  new owners? The book value of the assets of the PGR's under  liquidation in Lower Silesia is estimated at Z5 trillion--and  that is without the value of the land. Where are all the  capitalists with enough spare money to put into such an  uncertain financial proposition? Is it not symptomatic that,  out of the 163 agricultural complexes taken over by the State  Treasury, your agency has to date managed to liquidate only 18?    [Dominik] A vast proportion of our time is taken up with  preparatory work: stock-taking, preparation of estimates,  sorting out ownership documents and related paperwork, and so  on. I can say that this year the process of ownership  transformations will be definitely speeded up because we have  already completed the documentation stage for many agricultural  complexes. And there are enough prospective buyers already:  More than 80 percent of auction sales we have organized  recently ended with successful sale transactions. This also  furnishes an answer to your other question: where to find the  new owners with sufficient money. Prospective renters at PGR  auctions are usually people who are already associated with the  PGR's. They most often form employees' joint ventures, and they  find the necessary funds by borrowing money--sometimes even  against the expected harvests. This is because they must, of  course, have the required 10 percent for the initial down  payment and for the first installment, just as they must produce  for us guarantees that they will be able to pay the following  installments. Apart from that, we are willing to help them by  negotiating the terms with them. This is, after all, in the  common interest of the agricultural complexes, the agency, and  the PGR work forces....    [Debek] Precisely. There are 12,000 people employed in the  PGR's. For them, a PGR is not only a place where they work but  also provides them with a whole environment--they live in PGR  housing, their children used to go to PGR kindergartens, the PGR  gave them the sheds in which they kept their hogs and the strip  of field where they could grow their own potatoes, and each  family was given its quota of milk from the farm's dairy.    [Dominik] Of course. And it was such social welfare schemes  that finished off the state farms.    [Debek] But what will happen now? A new owner will take  over the farm. He will work out that it would not be worth his  while to raise cattle, and so he will dismiss his farm workers.  He may at best promise them some seasonal work during the grain  or potato harvest....    [Dominik] Not at all. One of the terms of the rent  agreement is that all of the farm employees must have their jobs  guaranteed for at least one year. What is more, the amount of  rent payment offered by the potential leaseholder does not  necessarily have to be the decisive argument in his favor  against other candidates. It is equally important whether he  can offer guarantees of maintaining the farm's full production  profile. We will sign lease contracts only with those  candidates who can offer us fully credible assurances that they  will keep these terms.    [Debek] In other words, they have to guarantee that they  will cultivate the land, grow crops, and refrain from  slaughtering all of the livestock on their farms and viewing the  land solely as a profitable capital investment?    [Dominik] Precisely.    [Debek] Thank you for talking to us.</p>

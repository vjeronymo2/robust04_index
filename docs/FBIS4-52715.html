			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Yun Pyong-son: "The Provokers Will Pay a </F> Dear Price"]    [Text] According to news reports, the U.S. imperialists  and the South Korean puppets recently mobilized the puppet  Marines and U.S. imperialists' aggressive Marines to the East  Sea of Korea to once again conduct a provocative exercise for  strengthening joint air transportation and night exercises.    During the military exercise, which was conducted under a  signboard of a so-called exercise for improving  interoperability, the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean  puppets exercised as if in actual combat by landing Marine  troops with transporters and helicopters in assumed enemy  territory; bombing major facilities and obstacles, including  dams and bridges; and eliminating the opponent's troops after  infiltrating special Marine troops and helicopters.    This dangerous fire game [puljangnan] aimed at attacking the  inland of the Northern half of the Republic clearly shows how  the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets are  frantically running to provoke a new war.    As everyone knows, an extremely grave situation is being  created on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists are  gathering aggressive forces on a large scale in South Korea and  the adjacent areas in order to put in actual practice the  northward invasion war plan dubbed "New Operation Plan 5027,"  which they devised with the puppets.    Apache attack helicopters and new Patriot missiles have  already been deployed for mobile warfare to South Korea.  According to data, in case of an emergency on the Korean  peninsula, the U.S. military is devising a plan to deploy  600,000 soldiers, over 200 ships, and 1,600 aircraft from the  mainland of the United States within 80 days.    On the other hand, the war maniacs, including the U.S.  defense secretary, are making a series of ruthless remarks that  a preemptive attack against North Korea would not be ruled out  and that they would even risk a war.    Along with the U.S. imperialists, the Kim Yong-sam clique is  also running wild in war exercises to harm fellow countrymen  putting the entire puppet Army under an around-the-clock alert  posture. At present, large-scale wild war exercises are being  jointly conducted by three services of the puppet Army, Navy,  and Air Force in the sky, on the land, and in the sea of South  Korea.    Apart from this, another military exercise is being  conducted  and South Korea is literally turning into an actual combat  exercise field for northward invasion war exercises. There, the  day dawns with war exercises and the night falls with war  exercises. As we can see, the U.S. imperialists and the South  Korean puppets are trying to kindle a war on the Korean  peninsula by all means and their war mania is reaching extremes.    Due to the provocative maneuvers of the U.S. imperialists  and  the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique for a new war, the situation on  the Korean peninsula is developing into a phase of a dangerous  war that could explode any minute.    What is making us more outraged is that the puppets are  describing the provocative northward invasion war exercise as  contributive to the peaceful settlement of the Korean peninsula.  They are indeed shameless.    War exercises and peace can never be parallel. Peace cannot  be achieved when war exercises continue. How can one say that  it is contributive to peace to join outside forces to sharpen  the sword to harm fellow countrymen and to lead the situation to  a crisis of a brink of war? The puppets cannot conceal the  provocative character of the war exercises or their bellicose  nature by any deceptive talk.    The U.S. imperialists and their hunting dog the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique are trying to shake our socialist system with a  reckless war commotion, but it is as foolish and stupid as  trying to break a rock with an egg.    We want peace, but will never beg for it. We do not want  war, but will never fear it. If the rascals dare to kindle the  fire like a puppy not knowing of a tiger's threat, our people  and People's Army, who have a firm self-reliant national economy  and strong national defense power, will pay back with  retaliatory strikes [pobok tagyok] that are thousands and  hundreds times more severe [hodoen].    The U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets, who are  stirred up by northward invasion war fever, must clearly know  that provokers will pay a dear price and must not run recklessly.</p>

			<p>930915 FT  15 SEP 93 / IMF lends less to members THE International Monetary Fund promised much reduced financial support for member countries last year in spite of a massive increase in its resources. In its annual report, the IMF disclosed yesterday that the Fund made financial commitments to members with economic problems of 3.2bn Special Drawing Rights (Dollars 4.54bn/Pounds 2.94bn) in the year to the end of April, down from SDR8.1bn in 1991-1992. The IMF's members increased their quotas, or capital backing the Fund's operations, to SDR144.6bn at the end of April from SDR91.2bn the year before. The Fund said the drop in commitments mainly reflected improved economic performance in many developing countries, particularly in Latin America. At the same time, demand for IMF resources from new members in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union was less than expected. Although the IMF has been expecting a surge in demand for its resources for some time, the total outstanding credit that it provided increased only moderately to SDR28.5bn in the past financial year from SDR26.74bn in 1991-1992. It was therefore well below the recent peak of nearly SDR40bn recorded in 1984-1985. Support for former Communist countries made up most of the SDR2bn promised by the IMF under its usual stand-by facilities last year: the remaining SDR1.2bn committed was longer-term financing to Peru, Jamaica and Zimbabwe. The flow of IMF funds to former Soviet countries and eastern Europe is set to gather pace, however. In the Fund's current financial year, Kyrgyzstan and Russia have made drawings of nearly SDR1.1bn on a new, temporary 'systemic transformation facility' (STF) set up in April to help former communist countries adapt to market-based economic systems. According to IMF officials, a loan for Moldova is pending under the facility, and Kyrgyzstan is expected to qualify for a second loan. Others interested in STF assistance include Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Slovak Republic and Russia. The IMF has a very strong liquidity position to deal with these rising demands. The report disclosed an increase in the IMF's usable liquid resources to SDR52.2bn in 1992-93 from SDR20.9bn the year before. The ratio of liquid liabilities to usable liquid resources - the liquidity ratio - increased to 155 per cent from 81.6 per cent. The IMF also reported a decline, for the first time in a decade, in the members' arrears, from SDR3.5bn to SDR3bn. Peru successfully eliminated its arrears to the IMF in the past financial year.</p>

This is stated in a communique issued by the  Office of the President of the Republic.    According to the communique, the head of state regretted  that  high-level leaders like them continue to make multi-faceted  statements unlikely to help the establishment of the broad-based  transitional institutions and described the statements as a show  of force.    According to the same communique, the president said that it  is (?inconceivable) that the country is ruled through  communiques while there is another perfectly adequate way to  rule the country: in the spirit of the fundamental law which  recommends consultations within the Council of Ministers.    The communique, which reached us today, is signed by the  principal private secretary of the president of the Republic,  Enoch Ruhigira.</p>

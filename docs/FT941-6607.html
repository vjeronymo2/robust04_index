			<p>940301 FT  01 MAR 94 / The Lex Column: UK pensions Yesterday's holding statement from the Securities and Investments Board inspires little confidence in its clamp-down on mis-selling of personal pensions. It can only be hoped that the vague promise of proper information for investors and better control of salesmen heralds tough measures later this month. Neither the proposed fact sheet for investors nor the mooted 14-day cooling-off period are likely to afford much protection unless the sales process is bought under close control. A mandatory comparison of the benefits under different pension schemes - and a clear written statement of the reasons why any transfer should be made - would be good places to start. Still, SIB is not acting alone. The new training and competence standards promised by the Personal Investments Authority - should it ever get off the ground - might help start the necessary revolution in the education of salesmen. Full disclosure of commissions paid to sales agents - forced on a reluctant industry last summer by the government - should make the sale of pensions more transparent. Moves to tighten methods of calculating the cash value of pension benefits should help ensure a fair deal for consumers determined to transfer out of occupational schemes. That thorny issue is, rightly, in the hands of the actuarial profession. Since pension transfers are still being made despite the evident pitfalls, though, a sense of urgency is clearly required.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The chairman of the IEC [Independent Electoral  Commission], Mr. Justice Kriegler, says the commission will be  ready on the 26th this month to take special votes. It will  also be ready to receive thousands of voters at the  approximately 9,000 voting stations on the following two days.  Mr. Justice Kriegler said the location of at least 99 percent  of the voting stations had already been determined. Mr.  Kriegler said two plane loads of ballot papers had arrived in  South Africa from London yesterday and have been taken to places  of safe-keeping. He called on people, particularly in isolated  places, to make themselves available to act as monitors at  voting stations.</p>

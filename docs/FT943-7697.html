			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Economic gloom continues to fade Public opinion about employment prospects and the state of the economy continues to improve, according to the latest FT/MORI Mood of the Nation index. While the nation would appear still to be pessimistic overall, the index has risen since April, its lowest point this year and only one point off the lowest level since the index started in April last year. That low point of 79 was reached in October. The belief that the mood can only get better, at least in the short term, has led to some changes in the way the index is being presented. While national pessimism was reflected previously in a rising index, using a 100 base set in April 1993, the graph has now in effect been flipped on its head so that that the gloom factor is represented by a depreciating figure and higher spirits by a rising one. While there is some stirring of optimism, it would be more accurate to say that people are slightly less pessimistic than they were a year ago. The results of the survey show that nearly one in three managers and executives are concerned about losing their jobs in the next 12 months, a marginally smaller ratio than a month ago. The changes in attitudes remain quite subtle and a further analysis of managerial anxiety shows merely that the depth of concern among some is not quite what it was. Concerns deepen when the 35-to-44 age range is considered. Some 40 per cent of people in this grouping are worried about losing their jobs. Professor Robert Worcester, chairman of MORI Financial Services, the index compiler, said: 'What these findings reflect most of all is a middle-class, middle-aged malaise.' Some 26 per cent of this class think the economy is going to deteriorate and only 35 per cent of them think it will get better. However, pessimism remains even deeper among manual workers. Only 20 per cent of them can see any prospect of improvement. Prof Worcester said: 'While things appear bleak to the middle classes, they still look worse to the working class.'</p>

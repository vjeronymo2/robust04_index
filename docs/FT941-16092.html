			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / Why MPs used to get away with it: Ivor Owen recalls the 1950s when papers were required to be 'respectable' Conventions, and particularly the ways newspapers maximise their sales, have changed more since the 1950s than the behaviour of politicians. Advocates of the Conservative party's 'back to basics' campaign have drawn heavily on nostalgia for this post-war 'golden age'. In those days MPs - and ministers - did engage in extra-marital affairs. They may have been more discreet, but in many cases their activities were known to political journalists. They were not exposed in print because the social climate required popular newspapers to be 'respectable' as well as entertaining. Another factor was that the prominent newspaper proprietors of that time (only the Communist Daily Worker was able to boast 'Not a lord on the board') judged it more important to retain personal contacts with leading politicians than to publicise their sexual mores. The second Viscount Rothermere was branded the 'pornographer royal' when his ailing Sunday Dispatch published what would now be regarded as an innocuous serialisation of the novel Forever Amber. Politicians whose marriages broke down sought to avoid the stigma of being named the 'guilty party' in divorce proceedings, and Tory MPs were expected to inform party whips well in advance of the court hearing. Minimising embarrassment to the party and government was the prime objective, and those involved in 'messy cases' were left in no doubt that they should resign as soon as it became politically opportune to do so. Some of the older Tory grandees still active at Westminster believe that, if this practice had not been abandoned, many of the government's current difficulties could have been avoided. For example, they believe that the initial message conveyed by the whips to the prime minister about Mr Tim Yeo, the former environment minister, should have been that he had already decided to resign his post. There is little doubt that under earlier regimes Tory whips would have played no part in encouraging suggestions that avoiding resignation was a feasible option. Ministers in successive administrations have not found it easy to satisfy calls to lead by example in any area of social policy. Labour and Tory ministers urging restraint in wage claims have been discomfited by the realisation that they resembled the fat man telling the thin man to tighten his belt. Lord Eccles secured only a marginal response in the 1950s when, as education minister, he cited the benefits gained by his grandchildren when urging better-off parents to send their children to the local primary school rather than to a fee-paying establishment. One example from the past which members of Mr Major's cabinet might do well to bear in mind is the response by Mr Iain Macleod, then leader of the Commons, when on returning from the US he was questioned about the Profumo affair. He said: 'Jack Profumo was, and is, my friend.'</p>

			<p>931123 FT  23 NOV 93 / Markets Report: D-Mark firms on M3 The D-Mark firmed against the US dollar and most European currencies after the Deutsche Bundesbank's higher than expected M3 money supply numbers dampened hopes for near-term monetary easing, writes Conner Middelmann. M3 grew at a seasonally adjusted, annualised 6.8 per cent in the year to the end of October, unchanged from the September rate and at the upper end of market forecasts. Some market participants had expected M3 to return into the Bundesbank's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range. The monetary aggregate has missed its target all through this year, undershooting it in the first three months of 1994 - largely due to statistical distortions - and overshooting it every month since March. The data put a damper on interest rate cut hopes and pressured the December three-month Euromark futures contract, which closed at the day's low of 93.87, down 0.06 point from Friday. Nevertheless, the data prompted few analysts to revise their near-term interest-rate outlook. 'The Bundesbank is so concerned about real growth in Germany they will continue easing,' said Mr Klaus Baader, European economist with UBS in London, who expects the Bundesbank to cut its official discount and Lombard rates by another 50 basis points before the end of the year. The Bundesbank's policy-making central bank council is scheduled to meet again on December 2 and 16. In Germany the focus is now on November consumer price data, due to be released later this week. The year-on-year inflation rate is expected to have eased to around 3.7 per cent from 3.9 per cent through mid-October. In the German money market, the rate for call money rose as high as 6.45 per cent in early trading after monthly tax payments drained substantial liquidity. The Bundesbank was reported to have injected emergency funds at 6.40 per cent via its so-called Paragraph 17 facility to ease the liquidity squeeze, pushing the call rate down to around 6.40 per cent. Trade in the US dollar was subdued ahead of today's national holiday in Japan and Thursday's Thanksgiving vacation in the US. It closed at DM1.7035, down from DM1.7150 late on Friday. In late London trading it slipped as low as DM1.6980. Many traders say the dollar may have to fall further before its next upwards move. The Italian Lira dropped following the crushing defeat of the Christian Democratic party and its allies in Sunday's municipal elections. It fell to a low of L988.80 against the D-Mark, but recovered slightly to close at L987.70, down from L979.0 on Friday. According to Mr Julian Jessop, European economist with Midland Global Markets, it was 'quite encouraging that the lira did not fall further towards L1,000 to the D-Mark, given the focus on political uncertainty.' This indicates that the currency is being supported by economic fundamentals, he said. Moreover, most political scare stories are already built into the currency, and there is little pressure to take profits before the end of the year, Mr Jessop said. This contrasts with Italian government bonds, which slid nearly two points yesterday. The French franc eased slightly against the D-Mark following the German M3 data, which also dampened hopes for any near-term rate cuts by the Bank of France. The French central bank left its intervention rate unchanged at 6.45 per cent at its latest repo operation, and is not expected to undertake any easing moves independently of the Bundesbank. Disappointed easing hopes pressured the Pibor futures, with the December contract falling 0.11 point to 93.52 and the March contract sliding by 0.14 point to 94.29. In Spain, market participants will be eyeing today's seven to 12-day repurchase tender by the Bank of Spain for a possible small cut in the 9.25 per cent benchmark rate, although some felt the currency's continuing weakness against the D-Mark would make that unlikely. Over the weekend, Bank of Spain Governor Luis Angel Rojo said there was still room to cut Spanish interest rates, albeit moderately and slowly. Moreover, he argued it would be a mistake to stimulate the economy by loosening monetary policy without tightening fiscal policy or tackling the structural roots of high inflation. The peseta ended at Pta80.70 against the D-Mark, barely changed from DM80.75 at Friday's close. But traders warn that Thursday's general strike in protest against the government's plans for a social pact may weigh on the currency, and one London trader said he saw scope for the Peseta to weaken to around Pta82 against the D-Mark by the end of the week. Sterling lost about a pfennig against the D-Mark after breaking technical support at DM2.5180. It closed at DM2.5130, down from DM2.5250 on Friday. In the money market, the Bank of England forecast an early shortage of Pounds 1.5bn, later revised to Pounds 1.65bn. After purchasing a total of Pounds 37m band 1 and 2 bills at 5 7/8 in the morning, the Bank bought a further Pounds 1.092bn of bills in the afternoon and provided late assistance of around Pounds 550m. The December short sterling futures contract declined 0.05 point to 94.58.  -------------------------------------            POUND IN NEW YORK  ------------------------------------- Nov 22         Close    Prev. close  ------------------------------------- Pounds spot   1.4755      1.4735 1 mth         1.4722      1.4703 3 mth         1.4678      1.4661 1 yr          1.4536      1.4528  -------------------------------------</p>

			<p>920612 FT  12 JUN 92 / Warning on Glaxo drug for migraine IMIGRAN, the Glaxo migraine treatment thought to have potential sales of Dollars 1bn a year, is possibly dangerous in patients with certain heart conditions, according to the Committee on Safety of Medicines. The committee, which advises the Department of Health, warned doctors that it had received 34 reports of patients who suffered pain or chest tightness after being injected with the drug. Glaxo's shares fell 27p in a weak market to close at 711p. In the latest issue of Current Problems, its occasional newsletter, the committee said studies had shown that Imigran might cause constriction of the coronary arteries. It called on all doctors to report adverse reactions to the drug. The warning comes after a letter last month in the British Medical Journal described heart problems in two patients after being given Imigran. An average of 15,000 prescriptions a month had been recorded since the medicine's launch in September. The company started marketing an oral version in the UK this month. Glaxo said yesterday that clinical trials had demonstrated that the drug could have adverse side effects in a small minority of patients. The number of adverse reactions reported by British doctors was not greater than expected. The company said it had received similar reports from other countries, although these had not been in large numbers. Imigran constricts the brain's blood vessels, but there are fears it may act systemically throughout the body and could affect the heart. Imigran's sales during the last half year were only Pounds 13m, but it is described as one of Glaxo's three potential 'blockbusters' - defined as capable of generating Dollars 1bn (Pounds 545m) of sales a year. One US analyst has estimated that Imigran's sales could reach Dollars 10bn a year by the end of the decade. Others have scaled back their predictions, but view it as important for the company's future. Imigran is available in 18 countries but its high price has caused controversy. France refused to licence it because of its high price and safety fears. Glaxo claims there is no alternative effective treatment for migraine. British pharmaceuticals exports increased by 29 per cent during the first three months of the year to Pounds 698m, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said yesterday.

			<p>920217 FT  17 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Barclays moves on pay penalty BARCLAYS BANK has offered to delay until next year plans for withholding pay rises from staff whose work the bank thinks is unsatisfactory. The offer is part of an effort to win support for one of the lowest proposed pay deals for several years among the big four banks. In talks with union leaders last week Barclays raised the amount of money on offer in its original proposals tabled in December. Rises for the non-managerial staff covered by the proposed deal will range from Pounds 230 to Pounds 535 a year against the previous Pounds 200 to Pounds 470 a year. Barclays Group Staff Union estimates that this translates into rises of between 2.5 per cent at the top of the scale to 4 per cent at the bottom. The Barclays talks will have an influence on pay negotiations in many financial services companies. They might even have a more general effect on white-collar pay, which has been held up in recent years by generous rises in the financial sector and may might now be pushed down by very low rises. Lloyds Bank has settled its 1992 pay negotiations with one of the two unions with which it deals. The 4 per cent offer there will probably prove unusually high for the sector because it was made in part to settle a separate dispute over pay restructuring. In its latest offer, Barclays told staff it could ill afford to increase costs in current economic circumstances. The staff union is balloting its members on the revised offer. A survey of 100 companies by Industrial Relations Services, the pay research group, shows that more than half have a formal policy on smoking restrictions and a further third have informal restrictions. Two fifths of the companies have banned smoking in shared or open-plan offices and just under two thirds provide employees with access to designated smoking areas.

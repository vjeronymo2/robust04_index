			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / VIPs ponder environmental costs JAPANESE prime minister Kiichi Miyazawa and two of his predecessors yesterday opened an 'eminent persons' conference in Tokyo called to work out ways to foot the bill for preventing worldwide environmental destruction, Reuter reports from Tokyo. Some 30 business and political leaders will meet for three days to consider how to pay for projects approved at the Earth Summit in Brazil. 'Japan has both the responsibility and capacity to play a leading role in constructing a society which can co-exist and co-prosper with the global environment,' former premier Noboru Takeshita told the conference of VIPs. Hopes were running high that the conference would come up with a specific figure for environmental funds. Conference officials denied this, but agreed billions of dollars would be needed and said that the developing world would be asked to foot much of the bill. Former US President Jimmy Carter told yesterday's opening session rich nations were to blame for environmental woes.</p>

			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Portable pension proposals PROPOSALS to encourage the extension of pension coverage to employees of smaller businesses have been put forward by the Bush administration. The aim is to assist the 42m US workers, out of a total labour force of 93m, who are not covered by private pension or savings plans. The package from new labour secretary Mrs Lynn Martin would also encourage workers who change jobs to transfer benefits rather than cash them in for lump sums. The proposals received a cautiously positive welcome from business and pension groups, but some suggested that, even if fully enacted, they would have a limited impact since they would do little to encourage employers to make more generous pension contributions to ordinary employees. Critics argue that the main effect would be to give a tax benefit to higher paid workers who would anyway probably be saving. In detail, the package would try to encourage small companies with fewer than 100 workers - representing about 26m workers without private pensions in the US economy - by exempting them from federal regulations barring discrimination in favour of better paid employees and by eliminating most official forms. To obtain favourable tax treatment, owners of small companies would have to contribute 2 per cent of an employee's pay, up to Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,180) a year. Similar retirement plans would be made available to 12m employees of tax-exempt institutions and state and local governments, a quarter of whom have no pension coverage at all.</p>

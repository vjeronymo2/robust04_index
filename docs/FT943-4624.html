			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Nigerian minister denies role in decrees Nigeria's minister of justice said yesterday his ministry was not party to controversial new laws giving the military rulers sweeping powers of arrest, Paul Adams and Reuter report from Lagos. 'The ministry has to clear the air in that it has no knowledge, no copy or any information about the promulgation of these decrees which sweep away our liberties,' Mr Olu Onagoruwa, the justice minister and attorney general, told a news conference. He said it was possible he would resign over the issue. The three new decrees have extended the powers of Nigeria's military regime to suppress civilian opposition, after the collapse this week of a two-month strike by oil workers demanding that Gen Sani Abacha hand over power to the jailed presidential candidate Mr Moshood Abiola. They strip the law courts of the power to challenge the government's authority, extend the term for detention without charges from six weeks to three months and proscribe three independent daily newspapers.</p>

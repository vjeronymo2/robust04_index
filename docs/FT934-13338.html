			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Satellite decoder pirates to be pursued in courts BRITISH Sky Broadcasting and News Datacom, the 'smart card' decoder company, said yesterday they had decided to pursue in both the civil and criminal courts all 'hackers' producing unauthorised cards. 'Pirates are nothing more than common thieves,' BSkyB said yesterday. The decision to take vigorous action against the pirates is a deliberate change of policy by the satellite company and an indication that it is taking the threat from unauthorised cards more seriously. BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a significant stake, earns 80 per cent of its revenues from subscriptions to its scrambled channels rather than from advertis-ing. The company said injunctions had been obtained against Hi-Tech Innovation of Camberley, Surrey, and Mr Chris Cary, who is close-ly associated with the company. Permanent injunctions had been obtained against Mr Joe Ibrahim, trading as Satellite Communications of Chorley, Lancashire, and the RSD card production company of Stirling, Scotland, run by Mr John Ross and Mr Patrick McGrorty. Action has also been taken against Mr Ken Ayton of Camberley, and BSkyB has issued a writ against Mr David Lyons of Satellite Decoder Systems of Ballyegan, Ireland, and Warrington, Cheshire. BSkyB said yesterday that the use of pirate cards was a criminal offence and the company was 'determined to ensure that the pirates do not succeed either technically or economically'. Meanwhile, Marcher Sound, the commercial radio station in north Wales, has turned down advertising from Mr Lyons and Satellite Decoder Systems.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Debbie Kuo] </F>   [Text] Taipei, June 10 (CNA) -- The Swedish aircraft  manufacturer Saab has decided to make Taiwan a maintenance  center for Saab airplanes operating in the Asia-Pacific region,  Chairman Hans Kruger said Friday [10 June].    During a meeting with Mao Chih-kuo, director-general of the  Civil Aeronautics Administration, Kruger said he is confident  that Taiwan is capable of becoming an Asian aircraft maintenance  center with its skilled work force and increasingly upgraded  facilities.    Saab is cooperating with Formosa Airlines in expanding and  upgrading a Formosa maintenance shop in Taichung to use as a  base for the maintenance center, Kruger said.    Several Formosa technicians have received a Collins' license  for overhauling engines and navigation systems, certifying them  capable of doing the maintenance work here rather than sending  the machinery abroad for overhaul, according to an official of  the Taipei-based airlines.    Saab will also help Formosa acquire sophisticated equipment  for aircraft safety inspections, such as X-ray systems and eddy  current systems, the official said.    Formosa Airlines, with seven 37-seat Saab-340b's in domestic  flight service, is expanding its fleet with three 67-seat Saab-  2000's and three 107-seat Fokker 100's, the official added.</p>

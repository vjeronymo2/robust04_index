			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Phosphates aim for clean bill of health Phosphates, thought to be environmentally criminal ingredients in detergents, might get a reprieve if efforts to clear their name are successful. Initial concern about phosphates in detergents - which act primarily as a water softener - dates back to the late 1960s when Lake Erie in the US 'bloomed' with an unusually strong growth of algae. Detergents were blamed. Similar blooms now occur throughout the world and are part of a process called eutrophication (rich in nutrients). These blooms have been blamed on unusually high amounts of phosphates getting into rivers and lakes via sewage systems and from farms. The algae consume the oxygen in the water and deny it to other water life, such as fish, which then die. Sometimes the algae rot and can be poisonous if eaten by animals. Most 'green' detergents exclude phosphates and declare this on the label. The phosphates are replaced with higher levels of surfactants (the cleaning agent) or alternatives are used. Italy and Switzerland have banned phosphates from household detergents but the UK government has called for more research before it makes up its mind on the subject. In Stockholm, on the other hand, city authorities encourage citizens to use detergents that contain phosphates. At the heart of the argument is the EC's directive on municipal wastewater treatment which should be implemented by 1998. This stipulates that sewage works in areas suffering from eutrophication must install strippers to remove most of the phosphates from the treated water. Phosphate supporters argue that detergent-based phosphates contribute only a small amount to the total quantity of phosphates in the water supply. Most comes from agriculture and other constituents of sewage. Furthermore, the substance is more efficient than alternatives. Zeolite, a substitute, tends to form a sludge which can reduce the efficiency of sewage works. If phosphates in sewage can be removed by stripping - and possibly re-used as a fertiliser - then it makes sense to use the substance in detergents. This argument is backed by evidence which shows that phosphate bans in Switzerland and Italy have not solved those countries' eutrophication problems. The amount of detergent used in Switzerland has increased since the phosphate ban because householders have used more to compensate for reduced cleaning power. Those who argue against phosphates say the EC directive will take nearly a decade to be implemented and then strippers will only be sited in some areas. They point to evidence gathered by the National Rivers Authority in the UK which identifies eutrophication as a big problem in an area of southern England which was previously unaffected. There is no clear winner in the argument. The UK government commissioned a report on the issue which concluded that there was insufficient evidence to ban phosphates. The government then consulted industry and environment groups and found little agreement on the issue. It commissioned more research and allowed manufacturers to continue using phosphates. But environment groups have, for the most part, abandoned phosphates as a campaign issue. Most of the confrontation on the subject is now taking place within the industry. Last year in France, for example, Rhone-Poulenc, a chemicals group, took Henkel to court for promoting its phosphate-free detergent, Le Chat, as good for the environment. The court found in Rhone-Poulenc's favour and fined Henkel FFr150,000 (Pounds 15,000) for each infringement of the judgment.</p>

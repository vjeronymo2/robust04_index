			<p>Language: <F P=105> Armenian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Report by G. N.: "State Administration for National </F> Security Is Being Restructured"]    [Text] According to a decree issued by President Levon Ter  Petrosyan on 14 January, Armenia's State Administration for  National Security [SANS] will be reorganized. According to the  decree, all functional services of the SANS have been disbanded  and the activities of their staff have been terminated, though  they will receive another 3 months of pay. The Main  Administration for the Protection of State Borders as well as  administrative, technical, financial-economic and medical  services have been retained within the SANS structure.    Eduard Simonyants has been relieved of his duties as the  head  of the SANS. His functions will be performed by Davit  Shahnazaryan who has been appointed as the acting chief of the  Administration and who will continue to serve as the president's  envoy on special assignments. Shahnazaryan has been assigned the  responsibility to evaluate the SANS staff and to present to the  government the bylaws and organizational structure of the  administration within the next 3 months.    During a briefing yesterday, the president's press  secretary,  Aram Abrahamyan, noted in connection with the presidential  decree on the restructuring of the SANS that the primary  responsibilities of the Administration must be intelligence  gathering and counterintelligence. He added that the  Administration must undergo structural changes in order to  perform those functions. According to Mr. Abrahamyan, the former  structure was created during the Soviet period and served other  purposes, mainly the pursuit of dissidents. Now that, according  to the president's press secretary, there are no such problems  in Armenia, the SANS services must concentrate on the issues  mentioned: intelligence gathering and counterintelligence.    As for the issue of who heads the SANS, Mr. Abrahamyan  stated  that the envisaged restructuring is not at all related to the  person of former chief Eduard Simonyants, whom the president  holds in very high regard and whose capabilities will be  utilized in other areas.    As is known, Eduard Simonyants is a petrochemist by training  and entered the national security apparatus in 1990 as part of  the president's team of national security advisers. In February  1993 he was appointed chief of the SANS. As for how he became  part of the national security apparatus, in Simonyants's words,  there are few people today who have had much relevant training  for their present jobs. That is what he declared in March 1993  during a meeting with reporters.    Now, approximately 1 year after his appointment, the SANS is  headed by a person who is equally inexperienced in national  security work (or at least has no directly relevant experience  in that field).    As is known, the new head of the SANS, Davit Shahnazaryan,  is  a physicist by training. He is the president's envoy on special  assignments and has considerable experience in international  mediation activities.    At one point Shahnazaryan was considered a contender for the  position of the republic's foreign minister. With respect to his  experience in national security bodies, the president's press  secretary said at yesterday's briefing that what is important is  not his experience but whether he has a clear political posture.  Mr Abrahamyan cited as an example Minister of the Interior Vano  Siradeghyan who also was not trained for or had experience in  his domain of work. Mr Abrahamyan noted that the issue of  restructuring the SANS has been under study for a long time and  that, in his opinion, it must be run by a political appointee.    Did this lengthy study also include the issue of Eduard  Simonyants as the SANS chief?    The 57-year-old former SANS chief declined to comment in any  way on his dismissal during our short telephone conversation.  When we asked him whether there were any specific grounds for  his dismissal he answered in the negative. The only positive  answer Mr Simonyants gave us was that he has genuinely been  offered another position whose details he declined to provide.    Thus, Armenia's SANS is being restructured by a presidential  decree. Let us recall that Russia's agency responsible for  national security, the Ministry of National Security, has been  restructured by President Boris Yeltsin's decree. Given that  internal developments in Russia affect events in Armenia in one  way or another, the restructuring of Armenia's SANS can,  perhaps, also be tied to the reorganization of Russia's Ministry  of National Security. Of course, one must add to that all the  known and unknown causes and preceding events in Armenia, stated  and unstated opinions about the restructuring of the SANS and  one must not rule out any relationship to the resignation of the  president's former national security adviser, Ashot Manucharyan.  One must also take into account the fact that Eduard Simonyants  is a "product of that blacksmith's shop."</p>

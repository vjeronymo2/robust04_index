			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Managements should pay for bad advice Sir, Your editorial, 'More knocks for the PIA' (26 May), is yet another example of the divergence that is taking place away from the real issue. I, for one, have become increasingly frustrated at the inability of the Treasury and Securities and Investments Board to avoid politicisation of the issues involved and at their unwillingness or inability to grasp the fundamental points which are, or should be, simple and clear. First, the structure of regulation as proposed by the Personal Investment Authority is having, and will encourage, an anti-competitive result (this being directly contrary to the Treasury's stated intention); an increasing number of independent financial advisers are giving up the business. The effect of the proposed new regulatory structure is to encourage 'bank-assurance' and the like to the obvious and long-term detriment of true independent advice. Second, protection for the individual investor could be considerably strengthened within the existing regulatory framework and without the need for a PIA. Existing regulations do already impose direct penalties on the perpetrators of bad or fraudulent advice. However, to fine an insurance company punishes the shareholders and/or the policyholders of that company and does not punish those responsible, that is, the managements which have allowed the salesman too much latitude. If the existing regulators made sure that the managements were individually fined, then the industry would see a very rapid and effective clean-up of its operations. Let it not be overlooked that most of the recent mis-selling of pension transfers was made by those employed by the insurance companies and banks, not by independent advisers. Third, while no legislation will be able completely to deter the occasional fraudster, recompense to those injured should come from a compensation fund created directly from a product levy. Perhaps it is naive to imagine that the expansion of the regulation industry (for that is what it has become) could now be slowed down when there are so many people now involved, all with their large salaries, final salary pension benefits, personal assistants, secretaries et al and, of course, individual spheres of political influence. It would be nice to see, or even hope for, a return to commonsense, rather than witness this continued expansion, knowing we in financial services have to pick up the tab and that, in the long run, the investment buying public will suffer.

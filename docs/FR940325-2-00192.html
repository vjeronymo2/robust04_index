			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The deferred option or ``Class B shares'' will be subject to a rule 12b-1 distribution fee, non rule 12b-1 service fee and a CDSC. Class B shares of each Fund would pay a service fee and a distribution fee pursuant to a shareholder services plan and a 12b-1 plan. Class B shares would be sold to all other investors.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. The Funds may in the future establish a class of shares that is only offered to the following categories of investors (``Institutional Class''): (a) Unaffiliated benefit plans; (b) tax-exempt retirement plans of the Adviser and its affiliates; (c) unit investment trusts sponsored by the Adviser or its affiliates; (d) banks and insurance companies purchasing for their own account; (e) investment companies not affiliated with the Adviser and (f) endowment funds for non-profit organizations. The unaffiliated benefit plans must meet certain asset levels as established by the Funds and have a separate trustee for the plan who is vested with investment discretion as to plan assets. Applicants will exclude self-directed plans from this category. The offerees of the tax-exempt plans in category (b) will be qualified defined contribution plans maintained pursuant to section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ``Code'') by the Adviser and its affiliates for the benefit of employees. The UITs in category (c) will, under current regulations, require a separate order of exemption pursuant to section 6(c) of the Act in order to invest in shares of the Funds. The entities in categories (d), (e) and (f) will not be affiliated with the Adviser. These offerees will have in common the essential feature of substantial assets under management and investment decision-making by institutional management on behalf of the entity with respect to the purchase of Institutional Class shares. Thus, these entities could not be used as a conduit for individuals investing in Institutional Class shares, and no individual would be the direct owner of Institutional Class shares. Investors eligible to purchase Institutional Class shares would be sold only Institutional Class shares, rather than any other class of shares offered by the Funds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Operating expenses, which are attributable to all classes, will be allocated daily to each class of shares based on the relative net assets in each class at the beginning of the day. Expenses that have a greater cost for one class than another ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> distribution fees, service fees and possible transfer agent fees, registration fees, directors fees, administrative expenses, and legal fees and expenses) will be charged separately to each class. Accordingly, the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Class B shares would be lower than the net income attributable to and the dividends payable on Class A shares.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. Shares of one class automatically may convert to another class with lower ongoing distribution or shareholder service fees after a specified period of time. Shares purchased through the reinvestment of dividends and other distributions paid in respect of a class would convert on a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> basis, determined by the ratio that the shareholder's shares converting to another class bears to the shareholder's total shares not acquired through dividends and distributions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Applicants anticipate that each class of shares may be exchanged for shares of the same class in another Fund to the extent that the shareholder would have been eligible to purchase the shares acquired in the exchange. The exchange privileges will comply with rule 11a-3 under the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The CDSC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Applicants expect that the CDSC applicable to Class B shares will be 1% for redemptions made during the first year after purchase to .25% for redemptions made during the fourth year after purchase. The amount of the CDSC will be calculated as the lesser of the amount that represents a specified percentage of the net asset value of the shares at the time of purchase or at the time of redemption. The CDSC schedule of any particular Fund or class thereof may vary. The sum of any CDSC, front-end sales charge and asset based sales charge will not exceed the maximum sales charge permissible under Article III, Section 26(d) of the NASD's Rule of Fair Practice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares derived from the reinvestment of distributions. No CDSC will be imposed on an amount that represents an increase in the value of the shareholder's account resulting from capital appreciation above the amount paid for shares purchased during the CDSC period. Furthermore, the CDSC will not be imposed on redemptions of shares redeemed after a specified period after purchase. In determining whether a CDSC is applicable, it will be assumed that a redemption is made first of shares representing capital appreciation, second of shares derived from reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions, and finally, of other shares held by the shareholder for the longest period of time. This will result in the charge, if any, being imposed at the lowest possible rate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. Applicants propose to waive or reduce the CDSC: (a) On redemptions following the death or disability, as defined in section 72(m)(7) of the Code, of a shareholder, if redemption is made within one year of death or disability of a shareholder, as relevant; (b) in connection with certain distributions from an Individual Retirement Account (``IRA''), or other qualified retirement plan; (c) in connection with redemptions of shares purchased by active or retired officers, directors or trustees, partners and employees of the Funds, the Underwriter or affiliated companies, by members of the immediate families of such persons, by dealers having a sales agreement with the Underwriter, by any state, country or city, or any instrumentality, department, authority or agency thereof and by trust companies and bank trust departments which are holding shares in a fiduciary capacity; (d) in connection with redemptions of shares purchased by beneficiaries of Aetna Life, disability and health insurance policies; (e) in connection with redemptions of shares made pursuant to a shareholder's participation in any systematic withdrawal plan adopted by a Fund; (f) for a shareholder with an account of $1 million or more; (g) in connection with redemptions effected by advisory accounts managed by the Adviser; and (h) involuntary redemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. If the Funds waiver or reduce the CDSC, such waiver or reduction will be applied uniformly to all offerees in the specified class. The Funds may provide a  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> pro rata  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> credit, to be paid by the distributor, for any CDSC paid in connection with a redemption of shares followed by a reinvestment effected within 365 days, or shorter, of the redemption.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Finance and the Family: Choose right and double your money If you want to take advantage of stock market growth but prefer the pooled route rather than direct investment, the choice of products and providers is bewildering. The latest survey of the most popular savings products from life offices shows that, with the right choice, you can double - even treble - your money. But if you get it wrong, your initial investment could be halved. In its 1994 survey* of unit-linked products, Money Marketing examines the charges and returns for maximum investment plans, single premium bonds and personal pensions, among others. Maximum investment plans and single premium bonds compete with other pooled investment vehicles - in particular with unit trusts - but there are significant differences in the way these funds are taxed. Life office funds are liable to basic-rate income tax and capital gains tax, but some 'qualifying' products can offer a fund that, at maturity, is free of higher-rate tax. This is because the product has an element of life assurance. While these products can be attractive to higher-rate tax payers, those on the basic rate have little to gain. John Jenkins, of actuary Alexander Clay &amp; Partners which co-produced the survey, says: 'Investors should note that the income tax charged on the fund cannot be reclaimed. 'The same is true of the capital gains tax which is charged on the build-up of the life fund. You cannot get a refund even if you have not used up your annual CGT allowance. In this respect, unit trusts are better, because CGT is not charged on the build-up of the fund and, when you are assessed for this liability, you can use your allowance to offset the tax.' Even higher-rate taxpayers should check, before signing up for one of these products, to see if the same result can be achieved by separating the two key elements - say, by using a unit or investment trust for the investment and simple term assurance for the life cover. Jenkins adds: 'For the more active investor, a maximum investment plan is more flexible and cost-effective for switching between funds. But if all you want to do is pay a regular amount to a managed or standard equity-based fund, then unit trusts offer better value.' Maximum investment plans These are regular premium savings plans that run for a minimum of 10 years and offer life cover worth at least 75 per cent of the total premiums paid over the term of the contract. The survey shows how the returns vary considerably. Top provider for a Pounds 70-a-month investment over 10 years was M&amp;G with Pounds 15,250. Worst was MGM, which returned Pounds 10,799. Charges also vary significantly. If you invested Pounds 100 a month for 10 years, the projected total (where no charges are deducted and assuming 7.5 per cent growth a year) is Pounds 17,659. The effect of London Life's charges would be to reduce this figure by Pounds 1,269 while the corresponding figure for the highest charger, Reliance Mutual, was Pounds 3,380. Single premium bonds These are lump sum investments that are not 'qualifying', so higher-rate tax will be charged where applicable. The top managed fund over five years was from Sun Life, with a return of Pounds 14,964 on an investment of Pounds 10,000. Choice of sector is crucial. Skandia's Gartmore Hong Kong fund returned a spectacular Pounds 37,405 after five years, more than trebling the initial investment, while MGM's special situations fund returned just Pounds 4,950 for the same period, less than half of the initial outlay. Charges are less of an issue with single premiums because this structure avoids the high up-front deductions associated with regular premium plans. *Money Marketing 1994 Unit-Linked Survey, price Pounds 3.75, from Ian Paxton on 071-439 4222.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 MIPS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                     Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Allied Dunbar               13,511 Norwich Union               13,329 Sun Life                    13,273 Prov Mutual                 13,160 Standard Life               13,141 AXA E&amp;L                     13,030 Confed Life                 13,032 Pearl                       12,942 London Life                 12,908 Legal &amp; Gen                 12,870  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 10-year past perf figs based on Pounds 70 monthly premium for non-smoking male, aged 29.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Marketing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BOTTOM 10 MIPS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                     Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Swiss Life                  10,318 Refuge                      11,010 Merchant Inv                11,406 Cornhill                    11,431 Barclays Life               11,460 Prov Capitol                11,515 Skandia Life                11,534 Laurentian                  11,567 MGM                         11,784 Guardian                    11,907  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 10-year past perf figs based on Pounds 70 monthly premium for non-smoking male, aged 29.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Marketing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TOP 10 S-P BONDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                     Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Sun Life                    14,964 Allied Dunbar               14,644 Legal &amp; General             14,617 L and M                     14,546 Norwich Union               14,334 Wesleyan                    14,292 M&amp;G                         14,211 Prudential                  14,190 Liberty Life                14,152 AXA E&amp;L                     14,128  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 5-year perf figs based on single premium of Pounds 10,000 for non-smoking male, aged 29.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Marketing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BOTTOM 10 S-P BONDS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Company                     Pounds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Swiss Life                  10,995 Guardian                    11,582 Royal Life                  11,955 Alico                       12,153 MGM                         12,179 Manulife                    12,573 Refuge                      12,601 Com Union                   12,621 Cornhill                    12,639 Albany Life                 12,695  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- 5-year perf figs based on single premium of Pounds 10,000 for non-smoking male, aged 29.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Money Marketing  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

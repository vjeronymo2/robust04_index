			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By JORDAN TIMES staff reporter P.V. Vivekanand] </F>   [Excerpts] Amman--Twenty-three people charged with plotting  and carrying out attacks aimed at destabilising internal  security will be put on trial in mid-April, official sources  said Sunday. [passage omitted]    At least six of the suspects have confessed to have planted  the explosive devices that went off at the Rivoli and Salwa  theatres as well as others which were discovered at a  supermarket outside Amman and the Zahran cinema, local reports  said. [passage omitted]    The sources said most of them are from lower middle class  families and some of them would be charged as accessories before  and after the crime.    It was not clear from the reports how many of the suspects  knew each other. They were all said to have worked separately,  as small groups, unaware of each other, under the guidance of  one or more people.    According to the reports, one of the suspects, Muhammad  'Adaribah, told interrogators that he tried and failed to plant  a bomb at the Rivoli, in downtown Amman, one week before the  Jan. 26 blast.    The device, described as a time-bomb that actually went off  inside the theatre at midnoon, was planted by another suspect,  Yasin Zahrah, the reports said. Seven people were injured in  the blast.    The youth who planted the bomb which was discovered and  defused at Amman's Zahran cinema was identified as Samir Ahmad,  who told police that he was asked to plant the bomb by Muhammad  Shihadah, a construction material salesman from the al-Baq'ah  refugee camp.    Mr. Ahmad was reported to have met Mr. Shihadah, described  as  an Arab Afghan, in front of the al-Husayni Mosque in downtown  Amman to inform him that he had planted the bomb inside the  theatre.    Mr. Shihadah, who is also under detention, was also  implicated in the al-Zarqa' bombing by the man who confessed to  have planted the device, 'Id Jahalin, a 30-year-old plumber from  al-Baq'ah.    Mr. Jahalin lost his limbs in the explosion when the bomb  exploded prematurely. His confession from his hospital bed is  believed to have been the most significant breakthrough in the  case.    The suspects also took interrogators to 'Akrush Supermarket  in Safut, which straddles the main road between Amman and  al-Baq'ah camp, and reenacted the planting of the device which  was discovered and defused there a few days before the Rivoli  blast.    Mr. Zahrah, the man who reportedly confessed to the Rivoli  explosion, was also identified as the one who planted the bomb  at the supermarket.    Another target of the suspects was the sprawling Housing  Bank  complex in the heart of Amman, according to the reports.    Some of the suspects showed interrogators how ``they cased  the joint to determine where to plant the bombs'' but no  explosives were actually placed in the complex.    Apart from Mr. 'Adaribah, Mr. Zahrah, Mr. Ahmad, Mr.  Shihadah  and Mr. Jahalin, other suspects identified by name included  Hasan Hamdan and Sulayman Biyah.    All the bombs were said to have used crude technology widely  employed by the Afghan rebels in their battle against the Red  Army and Soviet-supported government soldiers in Afghanistan.    The bombing case is the second known organised sabotage  attributed to ``Arab Afghans'' in Jordan.    In 1991, members of a group called ``Jaysh Muhammad  (Muhammad's Army)'' made up mostly of Afghan returnees were  arrested following a series of attacks and foiled attempts  against night-clubs, cinemas, liquor shops and security officers  as well as government buildings and diplomatic missions.    Eighteen of them were tried and convicted; eight of them,  two  in absentia, were given the death sentence, and others were  jailed for terms ranging from two years to 15 years.

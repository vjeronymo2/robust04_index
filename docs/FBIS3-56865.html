"Boris Yeltsin has to keep balance between various forces",  he told TASS on Friday evidently meaning that the current  government composition was a compromise of the president.    An adequate substitution for Boris Fedorov, who had resigned  as the finance minister, may be his first deputy Sergey Dubinin,  Filippov said.    Noted economist Grigoriy Yavlinskiy would hardly be invited  to fill in the remaining vacant post of the first deputy prime  minister, he added.    "I think that Viktor Chernomyrdin will try to keep Oleg  Soskovets as his only first deputy", Filippov said and added  that he personally does not believe in Yavlinskiy's ability to  reform the economy.    "I do not believe in the possibility of reforming economy on  the basis of speculative schemes like the '500 days' programme",  he explained referring to the programme which Yavlinskiy had  offered yet to former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, but  which was turned down.</p>

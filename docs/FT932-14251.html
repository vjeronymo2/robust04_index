			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Venture capital update Upheavals in the venture capital industry have made it even more difficult for entrepreneurs to find a suitable backer. Established venture capitalists have withdrawn while others have refocused their activities. The present state of the industry means it is essential for the entrepreneur to have up-to-date information. Fortunately, help is available in the shape of new editions of two established venture capital directories. The Venture Capital Report Guide to Venture Capital in the UK &amp; Europe, now in its sixth edition, provides the most thorough review of the UK industry. It lists more than 100 UK venture funds as well as 70 in continental Europe. A valuable feature of this guide is the lists of the investments that have been made by each venture fund, including those that have been written off. This allows businesspeople seeking money to judge the investments that venture capitalists actually make as opposed to those that they claim to support, says Lucius Cary, editor. Who's Who in Risk Capital 1993 concentrates on individual venture capitalists, providing thumbnail sketches, including in many cases photographs. Users value a picture when speaking to someone on the telephone for the first time or when attending conferences, says publisher Antonia Millen. To date, Who's Who has appeared annually, giving it a slight edge over the Venture Capital Report which is updated every two years. It is also more comprehensive in its continental European coverage but cannot match its rival on its wealth of detail on the UK industry.

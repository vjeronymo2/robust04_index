			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The news conference in the Moncloa palace given  by Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez and Russian leader Boris  Yeltsin, has just ended. [passage omitted] The situation in  Bosnia and the allied air strikes were obvious subjects dealt  with by Felipe Gonzalez and Boris Yeltsin. Angel Garcia reports  from the Moncloa Palace:    [Garcia] Boris Yeltsin made clear reference to the situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovia. Yeltsin expressed his discontent and  disagreement to U.S. President Bill Clinton and he also said  that only a negotiated solution could be considered and he ruled  out the use of force in Bosnia. At the same time he said that  if the conflict escalated, responsibility would fall on those  who have carried out these attacks. However, according to  Yeltsin, the most important factor in the situation in  Yugoslavia is to keep the Serbs away from the military  confrontation.    [Begin Yeltsin recording in Russian with superimposed  Spanish  translation by Garcia] Our envoy Vitaliy Churkin is already  there, Yeltsin says, and perhaps it will be necessary to send  Foreign Minister Kozyrev there the day after tomorrow to ensure  that the Serbs stay away from the military confrontation. [end  recording]    [Garcia] Yeltsin also referred to NATO's peace association  and he said that they were in no hurry to sign that document.  [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920527 FT  27 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates creep higher NEWS that the UK current account deficit deteriorated sharply in April sent a shiver through the money markets. Rates firmed after figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that the current account deficit widened to Pounds 1.06bn in April, significantly higher than the City's consensus forecast of Pounds 600m. The deficit - the result of a surge in imports and dwindling exports - followed the previous month's deficit of Pounds 591m. While the foreign exchange markets were unruffled by the ballooning trade gap, the money markets - described by one trader as 'a beacon of sanity' - reacted adversely. The key three-month interbank rate rose  1/8 percentage point to 10 1/16 per cent, while the rate for six-month money firmed to 10 per cent from a close of 9 15/16 per cent on Friday. The September sterling contract fell by eight basis points during the day. It opened at 90.37, but touched a low of 90.28, where it hovered in late trading. The downward movement in sterling futures suggests that the market is less sure of a base rate cut before September. Today's levels still allow for a 1/4 point cut in base rates, but according to Mr Nick Parsons of the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, a drop below 90.25 would mean that the market had given up any hope of a base rate reduction before the autumn. Short-term cash rates came under heavy pressure during the day because of a log-jam in the market, which meant it failed to meet the Bank of England's big shortage. In the morning the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.7bn but provided only limited liquidity in the early rounds of its operations. The forecast was later revised to around Pounds 1.6bn and morning assistance came to Pounds 791m, including Pounds 124m of band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The shortage was later revised upwards to Pounds 1.8bn. The Bank operated again, purchasing Pounds 705m of bills, including Pounds 670m of band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 35m of band-2 bills at the same rate. Late assistance of Pounds 125m brought overall intervention operations to Pounds 1.6bn. As a result overnight rates soared to 22 per cent, where they finished the day. German call money firmed slightly yesterday to 9.50/60 per cent from 9.45/55 per cent. Dealers expect the Bundesbank to hold rates stable.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, 7 Jan 1994 -- Today President Lech Walesa  received Madame Ambassador Madeleine Albright, the permanent  U.S. representative at the United Nations, and General John  Shalikashvili, the chairman of the Chiefs of Staff of the U.S.  Armed Forces, the Presidential Press Office reported in a  communique.    Greeting the representatives of President Bill Clinton,  President Walesa inter alia said: "We owe a lot to the United  States, we lack the words to express our thanks. It so happens  that the United States continues to have responsibility for the  world. We are aware of this great responsibility and we wish to  talk about this. We will do not wish to hinder these great  ideas, but we would like to present our stand.    A new order is being created in Europe. There is an  opportunity for a peaceful Europe. There is an opportunity for  all the models that the United States advocates to be realized  in their entirety on our continent. As a practical man I know  that the opportunity that has arisen must be exploited. As a  soldier I know that the best tactics are small leaps forward.  It is possible to wriggle forward and sometimes appropriate,  but observing different fields -- and as a corporal myself I  trained some people -- I know that the tactic of jumping ahead  and then crawling forward was always worthwhile. Today I feel  that there is such an opportunity for a leap in Europe. Of  course, it is possible to crawl forward, but I do not have to  prove to soldiers how far slower it is, how far less effective.  I invite everyone to take part in a discussion, so that we can  present our arguments," states the communique.</p>

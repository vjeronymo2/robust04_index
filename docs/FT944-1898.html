			<p>941217 FT  17 DEC 94 / Warburg hits out at Morgan Stanley Recriminations broke out yesterday after the collapse of merger talks between the investment banks Morgan Stanley and SG Warburg. The dispute emerged as Warburg insisted that it did not intend to merge with another bank. Sir David Scholey, Warburg's chairman, accused a Morgan Stanley executive of composing 'a subjective and selective alibi' by claiming that the US firm's motive for a merger was to gain control of Warburg's fund management arm, Mercury Asset Management. Speaking publicly for the first time about the merger attempt, Sir David said he believed the Morgan Stanley director's motive was to minimise publicly the setback to the US firm, and to reassure its 2,300 staff in Europe. 'I cannot say that I feel miffed because they have a hell of a containment job to do,' said Sir David, commenting on remarks made to the FT by Mr Stephen Waters, co-managing director of Morgan Stanley Europe. Sir David said it was 'not our natural way to charge into the attack and say all the self-justifying things we might do' after such an incident, but he believed Morgan Stanley wanted a true investment banking merger. He said that when he read Mr Waters' remarks, 'I thought to myself, what a pity, but he presumably has his own imperatives for saying it'. Warburg would not now seek another merger because Morgan Stanley had been the best fit. It would resume its strategy of building an independent bank. Sir David said it had gained from merger discussions and he denied that Warburg had been weakened by the incident. The merger discussions broke down on Thursday over demands by Mercury Asset Management that it would maintain operational independence in the merged bank. That was rejected by Morgan Stanley. Warburg shares closed 14p up at 713p.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Treasury and MoD in row over cuts Senior officials at the Ministry of Defence and the Treasury have failed to finalise plans for cuts in military expenditure following a row over the way in which compensation will be paid to service personnel who become redundant, James Blitz writes. Just two weeks before the announcement of large cuts in Britain's defence programme, Treasury officials are insisting that redundancy payments for the 25,000 servicemen and women who will lose their jobs should come from the MoD budget. However, defence officials are refusing to bow to the Treasury's demand, fearing that the payment of redundancy money would further deplete their budget in future years. Total redundancy payments following next month's review - called Front Line First - could total many millions of pounds. Mr Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, has already had to find cuts of Pounds 750m in the current financial year to meet the expenditure targets set out in the last Budget. However it is understood that the Defence Cost Studies programme, which is examining ways of reducing military support services, has cut spending by much more than this. Treasury officials, who are in the early stages of another tough public spending round, argue that the excess savings are not for the defence department to keep.</p>

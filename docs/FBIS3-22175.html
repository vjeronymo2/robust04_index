			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: ``Pesticides Coming in Without </F> Licenses'']    [Text] ``Recently one has been able to notice a trend of  uncontrolled importation of pesticides in our country, which is  confirmed by the results of the inspections carried out by  expert institutions, firms, and associations active in this  field, as well as by the Customs, the Ministry of Internal  Affairs, and the media.'' This is said in the statement issued  by the Government of Serbia regarding the uncontrolled  importation of pesticides, and traffic in dangerous chemical  substances. POLITIKA has already written on this subject in one  of the previous issues.    The statement also specifies that the sanctions, economic  difficulties, and high prices of the substances manufactured in  Yugoslavia actually encourage such an attitude of the farmers,  who are trying to cope with difficulties by obtaining pesticides  from abroad, and it is mostly pesticides that are either  prohibited or not recommended for use in the world.    In addition, there is a widespread practice abroad that the  dangerous substances and pesticides, whose date has expired, are  exported to the underdeveloped countries of the third world, and  to the transition countries of Eastern and Central Europe.    In the past several months the Ministry for Environment has  come across precisely such cases of traffic and use of  pesticides with expired dates. The latest case reported is that  of Jagodina, where 100 kilograms of such pesticides were found.    ``According to data issued by the Association for the  Protection of Yugoslav Flora, last year's needs for supplies of  substances for the protection of plants amounted to 10,000  tonnes. Some 8,500 tonnes were produced in the country, while  nearly 1,800 tonnes were imported. This year the production of  11,000 tonnes of pesticides has been planned,'' it is said in  the statement.    The government also states that the Association of Pesticide  Manufacturers of Yugoslavia, as well as the Institute for Flora  Protection in Belgrade, issued a warning to the Ministry of  Agriculture on 18 January this year, that last year, within 11  months, pesticides were imported through more than 120 agencies,  while only a part of the number had licenses issued by the  government. As for the rest, it is not known either who issued  the licenses or who carried out the analysis.</p>

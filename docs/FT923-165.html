			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Australian deficit narrows AUSTRALIA'S current account deficit narrowed last month, easing fears that interest rates would have to rise. The deficit fell to ADollars 903m (Pounds 380m) in August in seasonally adjusted terms, from nearly ADollars 1.5bn in July. The government said the August figure was in line with its budget forecast that the deficit would rise from ADollars 11.7bn last year to ADollars 15.7bn in the year to next June. Economists said the figures should end speculation that the Reserve Bank would raise interest rates from 5.7 per cent to dampen demand for imports. In seasonally adjusted terms, most of the reduction in the deficit was caused by an improvement in the trade account, which was in surplus by ADollars 338m following a deficit of ADollars 104m in July.</p>

			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / World Trade News: Growth in air traffic slows THE International Air Transport Association reported a 'disturbing' slowdown in passenger traffic growth in February among its 213 member airlines as businesses continued to cut air travel to reduce costs. The report undermines hopes of an end to three years of economic woes which have cost the airline industry collectively Dollars 10bn (Pounds 7bn). The 800 business travellers surveyed by Iata said a cut in the number of trips made was the main method of cost control. Second came the hunt for cheap deals, third sending fewer people on trips and fourth a downgrade of the class of travel. More than a quarter of companies had cut their travel budgets in the past six months, against 10 per cent which said the budget had risen. Around half the companies thought developments in telecommunications could eventually replace part of their travel. The survey results come on the heels of a business class air fares war in Europe. It intensified yesterday when British Airways cut fares until the end of June by as much as a quarter from the UK to Paris, Amsterdam and Helsinki. The moves followed similar cuts in recent weeks by British Midland, Air France, Finnair, the Dutch carrier KLM, and Aer Lingus, the Irish airline. The reductions apply only on routes from London and leave a business class return trip to Paris costing Pounds 240, compared with Pounds 318 previously. 'We are trying to persuade people to trade up into business class,' said BA yesterday.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["(jis)"-signed report: "Minister Baudys Has Approved the </F> Supreme Inspection Office's Report"]    [Text] Prague -- "I agree with the report of the Supreme  Inspection Office [NKU] and I consider it to be quite correct,"  said Defense Minister Antonin Baudys apropos the NKU report on  economic management in the Czech Army.    It is apparent from the report that the regulations on the  protection of state property were violated in the years 1990-92.  The minister said that, when he took up his post, he halted the  transfer of all property until new mechanisms were approved for  the sale of real estate and chattels and that all the  functionaries responsible for violating the regulations had been  discharged. At the same time, he suggested to the main Military  Prosecutor's Office that it consider whether any crimes had been  committed. It released a statement in which it said that the  findings were not sufficient to justify suspicion of criminal  activity. Last week, the government approved material on the  sale of real estate with the proviso that state administration  bodies be given the option of having it transferred to them free  of charge. Other property will be sold at auction by real  estate agencies or will be exchanged for apartments. Special  materials, such as weapons and munition, will be sold to  interested parties who hold a special license for trading in  these goods.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Letter from UN Secretary General Butrus Butrus-Ghali to </F> Eduard Shevardnadze, chairman of the Georgian Supreme Council  and head of state, and Russian President Boris Yeltsin; date not  given]    [Text] To His Excellency Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze; to His  Excellency Boris Yeltsin:    Thank you very much for your letter of 20 February [as  heard]  in connection with the situation in Abkhazia. I am watching  closely developments in the Republic of Georgia and so is  Ambassador Edouard Brunner, my extraordinary and plenipotentiary  representative to Georgia. We both share your concern over the  absence of progress in the talks on the comprehensive political  settlement of the conflict in Abkhazia.    The Security Council continues to look into all aspects of  the situation in Abkhazia, including a proposal put forward by  the Governments of Russia and Georgia to deploy peacekeeping  forces in the region. In its Resolution 896 of 1994, which was  adopted unanimously on 31 January, the Council acknowledges the  difficulty of the condition of 300,000 people, who, as is known,  have been forced to leave Abkhazia. However, the Council  stressed the necessity of substantial progress in the political  solution of the conflict before it would be able to consider the  possibility of deploying peacekeeping forces in Abkhazia.    The third round of talks between the Georgian and Abkhaz  sides, which is to take place in Geneva between 22 and 24  February, will have paramount importance. In advance of the  forthcoming talks, I ask your delegations to do everything in  order to make progress in the peaceful solution of the conflict.  It is very important for both sides to demonstrate the progress  that the Security Council is striving for. In this connection,  Ambassador Brunner is planning to meet Mr. Vladislav Ardzinba in  Geneva on 20 February.    Finally, let me express my heartfelt appreciation of the  support given to Ambassador Brunner by the Russian Government in  its capacity as facilitator. I would like to assure you that he  and myself will continue to assist actively the parties involved  in finding a comprehensive peaceful solution to the conflict.    Yours respectfully,    [Signed] Butrus-Ghali</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Job adverts by phone to be probed THE USE of premium-rate telephone services to advertise jobs and business opportunities is to be investigated by the industry's watchdog body after a sharp increase in complaints last year. The review was ordered by the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (Icstis) after it received allegations that some of the business and job opportunities advertised did not exist or were advertised in a misleading manner. Complainants said they had made telephone calls at 48p a minute - 36p cheap rate - in response to advertisements offering job opportunities, to find that none existed. The overall number of complaints about all premium-rate telephone services rose 45 per cent to 6,753 from 4,658 in 1990. A record number of services were removed last year. Sir Louis Blom-Cooper QC, chairman of Icstis, said complaints about employment services increased more than fivefold to 843, about 13 per cent of total complaints. In one case a service advertised in Scotland claiming to be looking for people to pack goods at home for distribution was found by Icstis to have no goods and no vacancies. Sir Louis said callers to some such services were sometimes faced with a charge for applying for the vacancy or opportunity, as well as the premium cost of the call. The employment services were only the most recent and conspicuous among a number of services that have fallen foul of guidelines for use of the premium-rate telephone services drawn up by Icstis. As the industry has grown from Pounds 67m in 1987 to Pounds 200m last year, according to industry estimates, the number of services removed or amended trebled last year to 665 and 370 respectively. Icstis ordered the withdrawal of 833 advertisements that did not comply with its guidelines. Sir Louis said persistent offenders tended to be in the adult entertainment sector. Icstis has strengthened its rules on misleading services and advertisements and has included in its revised code of practice a requirement that interactive services lasting more than 10 minutes should inform callers of the total cost of the call and give regular warnings of additional time spent connected. In addition to complaints about employment services, those relating to competitions offering prizes to callers approximately doubled while those relating to sales promotions - mailings inviting people to call premium numbers offering incentives - rose tenfold.</p>

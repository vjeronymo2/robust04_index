			<p><P> November 30, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PARADE ESTIMATES  </P> <P> I see once again that you need to be reminded of the silliness of accepting  parade crowd estimates at face value.  </P> <P> I refer to the statement on the front of the Metro section (Nov. 26) concerning  the Hollywood Christmas Parade.  </P> <P> Arithmetic reveals that "about 750,000 spectators along the 3.2-mile route"  would require packing people together 29% more densely than the mythical 1  million who have been said to linethe 5.5-mile Rose Parade route. The actual  number at the Rose Parades is really under 400,000 by more thoughtful  estimates, so your Hollywood Parade estimate is even more grossly exaggerated.  </P> <P> CHRISTOPHER LEE  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

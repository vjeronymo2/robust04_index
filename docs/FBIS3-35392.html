The first was the government situation  and the attempt to reshuffle the cabinet portfolios based on  certain plans by the president and the prime minister. These  plans have clashed with calculations by the parliamentary  speaker, who demanded the Finance Ministry portfolio for his  sect based on the principle that any reshuffle must aim at  energizing governmental work and that this can only be done by  correcting the course of the state's financial policy, which has  demonstrated its failure and sterility. While agreement between  the president and the prime minister exists because of the  indirect concurrence of interests, the sticky issue of  reshuffling the portfolios persists. It affects the Ministries  of Finance, Interior, Industry and Oil, and Labor. President  Ilyas al-Hirawi and Prime Minister Rafiq al-Hariri raised this  issue during their meeting with Syrian President Hafiz al-Asad.  The two returned with a firm response from the Syrian  leadership that it is ready to assist Lebanon in resolving  problems in government work, but that a change of government or  reshuffle is an internal Lebanese matter. Lebanese political  sources maintain that a government reshuffle is still possible  but will not be sufficient as the entire government performance  in the political, economic, and security fields is deficient.    The second issue discussed by the cabinet was the high cost  of living and economic stagnation. This is occurring at a time  when the dollar rate in the local market has been stable and the  government claims that the development and reconstruction  process is continuing. This is casting some doubt on the  state's financial policy.    The third issue was the demands of the General Labor  Federation. With the federation's demands, a crisis has been  created for political reasons. Some ministers at yesterday's  cabinet session maintained that this fabricated crisis  constitutes a crime against the worker and his livelihood and is  a dangerous step at this time.</p>

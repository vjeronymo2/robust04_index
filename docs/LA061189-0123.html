			<p><P> June 11, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Hungary's ruling Communist Party and its emerging opposition agreed on ground  rules for negotiations beginning Tuesday to lead the country to multi-party  democracy. The agreement, announced at a joint news conference in Budapest,  lays down principles under which the Communist Party would cede some of the  power it has exercised under single-party rule over the past 40 years. Opposite  the Communist Party at the negotiations will be delegates of the Opposition  Round Table, which embraces nine non-Communist organizations.  </P></p>

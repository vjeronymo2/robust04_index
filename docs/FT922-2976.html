			<p>920613 FT  13 JUN 92 / World leaders pledge backing for global clean-up: Heads of state stop short of financial commitments at Earth Summit DOZENS OF world leaders pledged their political backing yesterday for a global action plan to clean up the environment. But they hung back from making the heavy financial commitments which the Earth Summit organisers said were needed to make it work. As 117 heads of state and government gathered in the vast Riocentro to endorse a series of accords to put the world economy on a more sustainable path, their ministers were engaged in hectic last-minute negotiations to finalise agreements, including one to conserve the world's forests. The two-day heads of state gathering, the largest of its kind, marks the end of the two-week summit which was supposed to put the environment at the top of the political agenda. But all the accords which are due to be agreed fall short of their original aims, although many political leaders stressed yesterday that Rio must mark a beginning not an end. The summit opened amid expectations that industrial countries would pledge money to help the poor south improve its environment, an issue which dominated the debate. But the rich countries made modest commitments, laying most of their stress on non-financial initiatives. The first leader of these countries to speak was Mr John Major, the UK prime minister. He said he would support an enlargement of the Global Environment Facility, (GEF), the fund administered jointly by the United Nations and the World Bank to help the Third World, from its present level of Dollars 1.3bn to between Dollars 2bn and Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1bn-Pounds 1.6bn). This would imply an increase in the UK's contribution from Pounds 40m to about Pounds 100m. However, the UK had already announced that it would support an enlarged GEF. Although Mr Major said the UK would support other new aid initiatives, he declined to put any figures on them because the UK's next spending round had not been agreed. Invoking the UK's strengths in scientific research, Mr Major also announced a 'Darwin initiative' to support studies of world species and habitats. He said the UK would also hold a Global Technology Partnership conference early next year to improve access by developing countries to the UK's environmental technology. President George Bush defied the many critics of US environmental policy with the boast: 'America's record on environmental protection is second to none. So I did not come here to apologise.' He said the US 'stands by' to raise its international environmental aid, but officials said his speech marked no change from the previous US position. Mr Bush offered to host a meeting of industrialised countries to plan a 'prompt start' to the summit's treaty limiting greenhouse gases by next January. Mr Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, said Germany would support a GEF of just over Dollars 4bn. But he pleaded the heavy cost of cleaning up east Germany for not making more pledges of aid. With the exception of a handful of smaller European countries, all the industrial nations are resisting pressure from the Third World to pledge 0.7 per cent of their GNP to aid by the year 2000. Mr Kohl only said Germany would do this 'as soon as possible' - the form of words favoured by most industrial nations. Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the president of Portugal, which holds the EC presidency, said Community countries would give Dollars 4bn to finance Agenda 21, the Earth Summit action plan extending into the next century. However, EC officials were unable to say how much of this represented new money. The largest aid commitment is likely to come from Japan, whose turn to speak comes today. Japanese officials have indicated that it may make a multi-year pledge of Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn. However, all these sums fall far short of the Dollars 125bn a year which the summit's UN organisers have said the Third World needs. Page 22, Earth's leaders display Rio diversity</p>

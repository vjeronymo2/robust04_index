			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with FRG Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel by </F> unidentified correspondent in Vienna on 29 Mar -- recorded]    [Excerpts] [Correspondent] The news of the British  agreement [to the European Union -- EU -- voting compromise]  reached German Foreign Minister Kinkel in Vienna. [passage  omitted]    [Kinkel] This is an important day for Europe. We have shown  that we are capable of taking action. Of course, I am  particularly glad for Austria because its entry is more or less  settled.    [Correspondent] Apparently, it is also not easy for Klaus  Kinkel to explain the exact mechanism of the blocking minority.  As for the rest, he does not believe that the Britons will ever  have to use their veto. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Lombard: On God and democracy How should a liberal democrat react to the possible election of a government indifferent to individual human rights? Some of those who condemn the Algerian army's decision to prevent the election to power of the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front seem unaware that this is even a problem. But it is. The tyranny of the majority is still tyranny. Suppose, for example, that a party dedicated to the physical extermination of a minority were on the verge of being voted into power. Would one condemn a force that prevented its election? The answer must be no. Nor is this an academic question. Although Hitler's National Socialists did not obtain an outright majority, they did obtain power through the ballot box; they did subvert the democratic process; they did exterminate several minorities; and, not coincidentally, they did start a war in which more than 50m people died. Groups which intend either to subvert democratic politics or to suppress individual rights wholesale do not appear to be proper participants in such politics. This is the common sense view, but it is one that can be given a deeper justification: rights of individuals are prior to those of the state even if the latter is in the hands of a democratically elected government. Among the reasons for defending individuals against democratically elected governments are the inherent defects of democratic politics. No elected government can claim the informed consent of the electorate. Self-evidently, it does not possess the consent of those who voted against it. But it does not even possess the informed consent of those who voted for it. Many of the details of its programmes are, in practice, neither widely known nor generally understood, while many of the contingencies with which it has to deal are, in principle, unknowable. These points about democratic politics are at least as applicable to governments elected under proportional representation as to those elected under first-past-the-post electoral systems. Indeed, the programme of the government is even more unknowable under PR, given the horse-trading inherent in coalition politics. Yet there is a more fundamental reason for claiming the priority of the individual over even the democratic state. The case for democracy derives from that for the individual's right to choose how to vote. If a government is legitimate only if it reflects such choices, it must be because a prior right of individuals to choose endows it with legitimacy. But that principle cannot be restricted to politics. It derives from the inherent capacity of adult human beings to make choices. This right must apply with greater force where what is to be chosen is closer to the individual concerns of the chooser than are politics. If the case for democracy derives from that for individual freedom, the proper domains of government are where individuals cannot choose for themselves or where their choices will damage other individuals. A democratically elected government dedicated to the suppression of almost all individual freedom is a constitutional contradiction in terms. What then should be the proper response of a liberal democrat to Islamic fundamentalism? The question to answer, an empirical one, is whether the election of such a government would impair fundamental individual rights, including, not least, that to cast a vote ever again. If, as seems likely, the impairment would be severe, then suppression of the election is not wrong, even though a still better solution than suppression would be a constitution that entrenches fundamental rights against the government. Naturally, fundamentalists would see it differently. But this is because their claim to power is a mandate from God. Since democracy's is that of a mandate from the people, the two views are incompatible. It is doubtful whether any country in which a majority inclines towards a theocratic view of the state can be democratic. But this is not a problem that can be solved. It is a tragedy that has to be endured.</p>

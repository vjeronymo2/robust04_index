			<p><P> June 10, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHANNEL 18 TO ADD CALL-IN SHOW IN MANDARIN ON CHINA CRISIS  </P> <P> KSCI-TV Channel 18 will broadcast a live call-in show in Mandarin on the  ongoing crisis in China on Sunday as a supplement to the station's daily  Chinese-language reports on the turmoil that have been airing for the last  three weeks.  </P> <P> Intended as a forum for the nearly 500,000 Mandarin-speaking residents of the  Los Angeles area, the call-in program will begin at 7 p.m. and feature several  local experts on China, including Xiao Quing Wu, chairman of the Chinese  Students and Scholars Assn. at UCLA, and Chang-Quing Cao, a Chinese journalist  who is publishing a newspaper devoted to the crisis in China and then faxing it  from Los Angeles to more than 800 outlets throughout mainland China.  </P> <P> "Just like everyone else, (Chinese-speaking viewers) have a general interest  and concern for what's going on in China, and the majority of them are  especially hungry for any information they can get," said Karen Garces, KSCI  sales manager. "Many of them have friends and relatives in China and we thought  it would be a good idea to provide an outlet for this community to ask  questions."  </P></p>

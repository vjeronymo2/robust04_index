			<p><P> February 13, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BOYS' 2-A, 1-A DIVISION BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS;  </P> <P> LAGUNA BEACH HOPES TO EXPERIENCE A TITLE FIRSTHAND  </P> <P> When Laguna Beach High School Coach Ed Bowen talks about his school's last  Southern Section championship, his players listen. And smirk.  </P> <P> Bowen coached the Artists past Santa Clara, 58-54, to win the Division 1-A  title in 1962. That date draws smiles from his players, who probably consider  1962 ancient history.  </P> <P> "They look at me kind of funny when I talk about it," said Bowen, 57.  </P> <P> Soon, though, the Laguna Beach players of 1989-90 might get to experience a  championship firsthand. The Artists (19-5) are the top-seeded team in the  Division 2-A playoffs, which open today with six first-round games.  </P> <P> "If you ever get a team that goes to the CIF and plays in the L.A. Sports  Arena, that's a once-in-a-lifetime experience," said Bowen, whose team has a  first-round bye. "If Laguna Beach makes it again, we're very fortunate."  </P> <P> Two three-year starters, seniors Dain Blanton and John Trevino, also will have  something to do with it. Blanton, a 6-foot-4 forward, averages 17.7 points.  Trevino, a 5-11 guard, averages 15 points.  </P> <P> Lacking height, Bowen said, his team relies on pressure defense and outside  shooting. "A team that fast breaks is the one that can clear the boards," Bowen  said. "We can't do that, but (we) do try and press and create havoc, steal the  ball and go."  </P> <P> After playing bigger schools throughout the season in the Pacific Coast League,  Bowen said his team should be well-prepared for the playoffs. Laguna Beach (8-2  in league), the league's only 2-A school, finished second behind Trabuco Hills  (10-0).  </P> <P> "I'm a 2-A school tucked in with Trabuco Hills and Woodbridge, two teams that  can really play basketball," Bowen said. "When I develop my team against those  teams that play tough, aggressive basketball, it makes us a lot tougher."  </P> <P> Similarly, El Segundo (13-13) and Serra (12-11) enter postseason play with  average records, but playing against larger schools in the Camino Real League  makes them a threat.  </P> <P> Laguna Beach could meet another county team, Orange Lutheran, in the  semifinals. The Lancers hope to take the extra step they missed last season,  when they lost in the 2-A championship game to Santa Clara, 78-54.  </P> <P> Fourth-seeded Orange Lutheran (15-10 overall, 9-5 in Olympic League) has one of  the division's top players in Daryl Cole, a 6-5 senior averaging 21.3 points  and eight rebounds.  </P> <P> With every starter 6-2 or taller, second-seeded Valley Christian (19-5) will  field one of the division's bigger teams. But Valley Christian's top scorer is  the smallest starter, 6-2 guard Sam Sybesma, who averages 17 points.  </P> <P> In 1-A, Southern California Christian (13-8) of the Arrowhead League plays host  to Capistrano Valley Christian (8-15) in the first round. The Flames, coached  by Mike Murphy, face a tough draw. They meet the winner of the Chadwick  (16-8)-Glendale Academy (14-4) game and probably will have to beat top-seeded  Mission Prep (16-4) to reach the quarterfinals.  </P> <P> 2-A PREVIEW  </P> <P> DEFENDING CHAMPION -- Santa Clara (now in 2-AA).  </P> <P> TOP TEAMS -- Laguna Beach (19-5), Valley Christian (19-5), St. Joseph (16-7),  Orange Lutheran (15-10).  </P> <P> DARK HORSE -- Serra (12-11).  </P> <P> BEST DRAW -- Laguna Beach has a bye in the first round, then meets the winner  of L.A. Baptist (8-14) and Kern Valley (1-19).  </P> <P> WORST DRAW -- After a first-round bye, Big Bear (15-7) must beat Bishop (14-9)  and probably top-seeded Laguna Beach to reach the semifinals.  </P> <P> KEY PLAYERS -- Daryl Cole (Orange Lutheran), Scott Panfil (El Segundo), Sam  Sybesma (Valley Christian), Dain Blanton (Laguna Beach), Kenny Davis (Serra)  and Billy Simas (St. Joseph).  </P> <P> NOTEWORTHY -- The division includes eight teams with below .500 records and 10  teams that open with byes. Four teams (St. Bonaventure, Paraclete, Orange  Lutheran and Notre Dame) that reached the quarterfinals last season return.  </P></p>

			<p>930804 FT  04 AUG 93 / Finance shake-up urged for businesses A FUNDAMENTAL rethink of the way small, growing businesses are financed was urged yesterday by Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry. Speaking at the launch of a report by the CBI's Smaller Firms Council, he urged the development of alternatives to the bank overdraft. In the UK overdrafts account for 58 per cent of total business debt, compared with 35 per cent in Italy and just 14 per cent in Germany. One of the report's recommendations is for the creation of a smaller companies' investment network to replace the business expansion scheme which ends in December. The network would consist of wealthy private individuals - 'business angels' - willing to provide equity backing for local businesses, local investment funds and investment brokers. The individuals could either invest directly or spread their risk by investing through a smaller companies' investment fund. The investment brokers would match business angels with suitable companies or draw on the local investment fund to back eligible smaller companies. Business angels should be eligible for tax relief on their investments of up to Pounds 250,000 a year compared with the Pounds 40,000 relief currently available under the BES, the CBI says. The report also calls for more generous capital allowances on investment in plant and machinery to cover 100 per cent of the first Pounds 200,000 spent. Finance for Growth.

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / International Company News: French TV flotation imminent M6, the French television station, will be floated on the Paris stock market within the next few months, according to Mr Jerome Monod, chairman of Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utility group which is its main shareholder. Mr Monod, speaking on French radio, also voiced support for Mr Andre Rousselet, who resigned on Monday as chairman of the Canal Plus television group, in protest at the formation of a concert party by its largest shareholders, Havas, Societe Generale and Lyonnaise. Mr Rousselet has since been replaced as chairman by Mr Pierre Lescure, chief executive. 'It was an ambush,' said the Lyonnaise chairman, referring to a row that erupted at an Havas board meeting last week when Mr Rousselet was told about the deal. 'Mr Rousselet was right to lobby so strongly, and to say that he had been betrayed and rejected.' He said he had been discussing the concert party confidentially with Mr Pierre Dauzier, chairman of Havas, and had not expected the announcement to be made so soon. 'Why was there such a hurry?' he asked. He said: 'Canal Plus has lost a great deal of its independence.' The reshuffling of the Canal Plus stake and the M6 flotation form part of a general restructuring of Lyonnaise's media interests. M6, in which Lyonnaise has a 25 per cent holding, is set to join the stock market in the first half of this year, although the details of the flotation have not yet been fixed. Mr Monod said M6, which made net profits of FFr105m (Dollars 17.9m) on turnover of FFr1.2bn in 1992, was a business whose ownership 'could be and should be open to public'. Lyonnaise also plans to launch cable channels. It is teaming up with France Telecom on one project and plans to develop a home shopping format with TF1, the biggest French terrestrial channel.</p>

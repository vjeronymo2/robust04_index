At the formal talks with 57 participants, including a 25-member  opposition group led by Walesa, authorities offered Solidarity legalization if  the union endorses a package of economic and political reforms. Three working  groups dealing with that proposal are to begin meeting this week. Meanwhile,  government spokesman Jerzy Urban played down overly optimistic expectations for  the talks. "It is an event of significance . . . but one should not imagine  that . . . it is some magic wand."  </P></p>

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / Timely escape from the sidings: British Rail privatisation is getting back on track after the signalworkers' strike The little train was quite exhausted. He had only a very little coal left in his boiler. When that was gone he would not be able to travel any further. He would just come to a stop, until someone came and pushed him into a siding, where he would get older and older and rustier and rustier and nobody would remember him. Seven months after British Rail began implementing the legislation intended to privatise its activities, many travellers and some would-be investors are beginning to wonder if BR faces the same gloomy fate as the hero of Graham Greene's story The Little Train. BR privatisation appeared to have been shunted into a siding after this summer's signalworkers' strike highlighted the losses that train operators could suffer through disruption in the rail network. The lack of visible progress in shaping a railway fit for life in the private sector added further to that appearance. But appearances deceive. Talk to the BR managers busily preparing to mount management/employee buy-outs of the companies that run trains and a very different picture emerges. Visit one of the numerous conferences arranged to explain the privatisation process and the attendance list attests to the strong interest from the commercial sector. There is a lot going on behind the scenes, and continued interest from potential investors. The government has set the managers in charge of privatisation a demanding timetable. Nearly 100 businesses are up for sale over the next two to three years. These range in estimated value from around Pounds 1m, for the small manufacturers of timber sleepers and concrete bridge beams, to between Pounds 2bn and Pounds 4bn for all three of the companies that will lease rolling stock to train operators. Mr David Blake, managing director of the 20-strong BR unit in charge of the sales, acknowledges the timetable is challenging. But he hopes that the five merchant banks working on the sales will find buyers for its heavy maintenance workshops, Red Star and the Freightliner container business by next March. The 14 companies that carry out track maintenance and repairs - with combined sales of more than Pounds 1bn and a workforce of 30,000 - should all be in the private sector by December 1995. But many hurdles remain before it will be possible to describe the privatisation as a success. The profit and loss accounts of the first businesses to be put up for sale revealed some unexpected horrors, previously hidden inside BR's byzantine accounting systems. For example, when the Red Star parcels business was first put up for sale in June 1993, it revealed losses of Pounds 9m on a Pounds 43m turnover. Not surprisingly, it failed to find a bidder and has since undergone a thorough restructuring in preparation for sale by the end of December. And the signalworkers' strike has almost certainly dashed hopes of an early flotation on the stock market for Railtrack, the BR company set up to operate the track and most stations. With an estimated market capitalisation of Pounds 3bn-Pounds 3.5bn, the company would be one of the top 100 quoted companies and join the FT-SE 100 Index. The government still hopes for a flotation before the next election. But Railtrack is the part of BR that causes others in the business the most concern, thanks to its power to impose unreasonable charges and conditions on those who wish to run trains on its tracks. Mr John Swift QC, the rail regulator, is currently consulting the industry on the access agreements to be signed between Railtrack and train operators. It is clear that he sees the need for curbs on Railtrack's monopoly. He questions the Treasury's method of valuing Railtrack's assets, with 100-year-old viaducts having been valued on a modern replacement basis. He also challenges its requirement for a return on those assets of 5.1 per cent, rising to 8 per cent, when commercial rates of return have been falling in line with lower inflation. Railtrack may be charging too much for access because of these rules, he implies, burdening the train operators with higher costs. Until the framework for track charges is finalised, it will be hard to proceed with privatising BR's passenger train businesses. They are to be privatised by selling franchises to run passenger services for periods expected to run for between seven and 10 years. Franchising allows the government to bring private sector disciplines into the passenger railway while maintaining government subsidies to businesses that will struggle to make a conventional profit. But it imposes a hideously complex task on Mr Roger Salmon, the former merchant banker who is director of passenger rail franchising. He now has to negotiate the myriad contracts between the different players in the industry, including the train operators, the rolling stock leasing companies and Railtrack. Mr Peter Field, managing director of South West Trains, estimates that he has paid his lawyers for 3,000 hours of work on the 200 legal agreements he needs to operate trains services in his region. It is clear that moving from a single monolithic railway system, where procedures are controlled by memo and the rule book, to one of contracts between independent companies is proving time-consuming. Mr Salmon says his task is to ensure that the risks of running a railway are shared fairly and that the companies involved have sufficient performance incentives. His ideal is a set of 'self-policing' agreements, which encourage the parties to work together to solve problems rather than resorting to the courts. He aims to ensure that the sale of the first half dozen companies is completed by the end of 1995, with more than half of the passenger railway network in private hands by April 1996. He hopes that the train operating companies should be able to present potential investors with their first set of audited accounts, covering the 12 months ending March 1995, in the middle of next year. Although it will be some months before the passenger franchises are formally offered for sale, the current managers, for the most part long-term BR men, are eager to ensure that their companies emerge the victors when the franchises are put up to competitive bidding. After many years spent juggling their costs they now see an opportunity to exert, for the first time, a significant influence on their revenues. ScotRail, for example, has launched a promotional campaign which should provide up to 1m customers with free or reduced price travel. South West Trains has upgraded its London to Southampton service to a 20-minute 'shuttle', while Gatwick Express has signed up the airlines to sell its tickets before the plane even lands at Gatwick. But while the operators see this as a way of creating closer links with their customers, critics of rail privatisation fear it is further proof of the risk of breaking up the national network. Gatwick Express has already been taken to task by Mr Swift for favouring its services above those of its two competitors at Gatwick station. For the designers of the new railway age, one of the main aims of the contracts that they are now drawing up is the prevention of fragmentation. Their grand project is the engineering of a structure and system that will ensure that decentralisation works - that the railways perform as an effective whole. This, they hope, will remove the need for costly changes later, when the private sector makes its bids for, or is actually running, the railways. Only a system that can achieve a balance of risk and market strength between the near 100 companies that will provide railway services after privatisation will remove the danger of some parts of BR, at least, ending up rusting in the sidings.</p>

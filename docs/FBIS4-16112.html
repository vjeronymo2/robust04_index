			<p>BFN     [Text] TALLINN, Apr 13, BNS - Estonia should fill the gap  in the European joint security system, Enn Tupp, the head of the  Defense Ministry defense policy department, said at a press  conference today.    Tupp attached great importance to the adoption of the law on  service in the defense forces. He said it's a good law, but that  now several lower-level legal acts need to be passed.    The law on peacetime national defense is waiting to be  adopted and in May the government will probably pass to the  parliament a bill on national defense in wartime, the Defense  Ministry official noted. He added that legislation on compulsory  duties in wartime, military career, and military police must be  adopted.    Under defense policy, a national defense doctrine must be  worked out and the share of defense expenditures in the budget  established, Tupp told reporters.</p>

			<p>940621 FT  21 JUN 94 / Seoul signals end to curbs on Hyundai The South Korean government yesterday appeared ready to end its cold war with the Hyundai conglomerate by signalling its willingness to drop financial restrictions against the nation's largest industrial group. The Korea securities dealers' association, which receives its guidance from the government, said it would 'favourably consider' the registration of three unlisted Hyundai subsidiaries on the over-the-counter market. The government blocked the OTC listing of the three companies - Hyundai Heavy Industries, Hyundai Elevator and Hyundai Housing and Industrial Development - in 1992 and 1993, in apparent retaliation for the 1992 presidential bid by Hyundai's founder, Mr Chung Ju-yung. Mr Chung's presidential campaign was the first political challenge staged by a conglomerate against the government's traditional strict control over industry. Mr Chung, who finished a poor third to President Kim Young-sam, announced his retirement last month from the group's management in an attempt to end the government's hostility toward Hyundai. The OTC listings would be the first step in ending all state-imposed financial restrictions on Hyundai. The government has prevented Hyundai from receiving soft industrial loans from the state-controlled Korea Development Bank, issuing bonds in foreign markets, and barred the listing of two other Hyundai companies - Hyundai Merchant Shipping and Koryo Industrial Development  - on the Seoul bourse. Hyundai claims that as a result of the financial restrictions it has had to cancel or postpone some of the projects in its Dollars 5.6bn (Pounds 3.7bn) investment programme this year. Some of the projects affected include the construction of two car factories by Hyundai Motor, the completion of a 16-megabit semiconductor assembly line by Hyundai Electronics, and the construction of a Dollars 1.5m shipbuilding dock and generator and turbine production facilities by Hyundai Heavy Industries. Government critics have argued that the financial restrictions were detrimental to the economy's growth, since Hyundai is the nation's largest producer of cars and ships.</p>

			<p>930426 FT  26 APR 93 / Patten threatens teachers on tests THE GOVERNMENT would consider changing the law to stop teachers in England and Wales boycotting national school tests, Mr John Patten, the education secretary, confirmed yesterday. 'I've ruled nothing in and I've ruled nothing out,' he said on ITV's Walden programme. 'We've come to no decision whatsoever about whether to legislate.' But he stressed he would prefer not to legislate and that he favoured persuasion. Mr Patten said he would study the detail of Friday's Appeal Court judgment upholding the legality of the teachers' boycott as a lawful trade dispute over excessive workloads created by the reforms. It was important for the government to 'look and reflect' for a few days and decide on possible action, he said. 'A very good maxim in government is 'legislate in haste and repent at leisure'.' Mr Patten appealed to teachers to think very carefully before boycotting the tests and 'introducing industrial turmoil into our classrooms'. A boycott would damage pupils, parents and the professional standing of teachers, he said.</p>

			<p>920401 FT  01 APR 92 / Trust hospitals report in-patient activity increase MORE THAN half the new self-governing trust hospitals increased in-patient activity by at least 4 per cent last year, a survey by the NHS Trust Federation showed yesterday. Mr John Greetham, federation chairman, said the survey showed clearly that trusts were contributing to improved patient care. The government's health reforms and the first self-governing trusts, which are run by their own boards outside health authority control, are a year old today. In-patient and day-case activity increased in all 36 trust hospitals which responded to the survey. The increases for in-patient services varied between 0.6 per cent and 24 per cent, with 56 per cent increasing activity by more than 4 per cent. Day-case work increased by between 1 per cent and 45 per cent, with activity at 27 out of the 36 hospitals rising by more than 10 per cent. The federation represents only self-governing trusts, so that its survey does not provide comparative information on non-trust hospitals, many of which have also increased activity. In 1990-91, in-patient throughout per bed across the National Health Service as a whole increased by 6 per cent. Mr Greetham said non-hospital trusts - community and ambulance services - had also all reported increased activity. Under the second phase of the health reforms a further 99 trusts and 280 GP fundholding practices - where doctors have budgets from which they purchase patients' hospital treatment - take effect today. Mr Greetham said the development of trusts provided 'managerial freedom at the local level to make the most effective use of available resources'. Labour is committed to abolishing trusts and fundholding if is returned to power. Hospitals and health authorities are, however, close to finalising the contract negotiations for financing patient treatment in 1992-93. Even with a change of government, managers expect that these contracts would form the basis for operating the service in the coming financial year. Management, Page 19 Letters, Page 23</p>

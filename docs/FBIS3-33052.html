			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Venezuelan economic developments monitored through 15  February.    Convergence Deputy Leonardo Montiel reports the Central Bank  of Venezuela used approximately $1 billion to assist banks  experiencing difficulties due to "very probable irregular  management." The Central Bank president will be summoned  tomorrow before the Finance Commission to explain why funds were  used to help certain banks instead of depositors. (Madrid EFE in  Spanish 2049 GMT 8 Feb 94)    Venzuelan Petroleum subsidiary Lagoven Inc. dispatched a  total of 119 million barrels during 1993 from its La Salina  Terminal, on the eastern coast of Lake Maracaibo, to export  markets and local petrochemical- and petroleum-processing  centers. A total of 237 oil tankers were used, of which 168  went to the United States, 35 to Germany, 12 to Canada, eight to  Jamaica, six to Chile, three to Africa, two to Norway, and three  to the Amuay Refinery in Falcon State. (Caracas REPORTE DE LA  ECONOMIA in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 17)    The National Venezuelan Telephone Company grossed 120  billion  bolivares during 1993, twice the amount for 1992.

(Caracas ECONOMIA HOY in Spanish 9  Feb 94 p 12)    Venezuelan Petroleum subsidiary Maraven increased its level  of production and generated significant savings of 10 billion  bolivares in 1993, in addition to increasing services for  customers via its quality management program. (Caracas EL DIARIO  DE CARACAS in Spanish 9 Feb 94 p 19)    The state group Venezuelan Petroleum, via its president,  Gustavo Roosen, explains that the fall in petroleum prices on  the international markets has forced a review of the 1994 budget  and the implementation of appropriate adjustments. As a result,  the government will have a much lower tax revenue.  Conservatives place the national deficit at approximately $3.5  billion, while pessimists estimate the same at approximately $6  billion, 50 percent of the budget.

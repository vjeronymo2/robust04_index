			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / UK Company News: Howden buys fan business for Pounds 21.8m Howden Group, the Glasgow-based engineer, is to buy the fan and air handling business of the Buffalo Forge Group for Dollars 34.3m (Pounds 21.8m). This follows its recent acquisition of Novenco Industries, a Danish manufacturer of industrial fans, for Pounds 22m. Howden raised Pounds 31.4m to fund the purchase and to reduce bank borrowings. Mr Konrad Johnsen, chief executive, said the merger of the Buffalo and Novenco fan operations would reduce over-capacity in the market and give the group a bigger share of the industry. Payment for Buffalo is due at completion next month.</p>

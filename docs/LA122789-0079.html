			<p><P> December 27, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ROMANIA: DEATH OF A DICTATOR;  </P> <P> FAMILY HEARS MORE BAD NEWS FROM ROMANIA  </P> <P> As the State Department sought unsuccessfully to confirm reports of an Orange  County resident's violent weekend death in Romania, his family got word Tuesday  that the man's brother was also wounded.  </P> <P> Relatives of Ionel (John) Antimie, 21, of Fullerton, said they received word  that he had been killed while trying to bring food and medical aid to friends  and family.  </P> <P> In addition, they now think from the reports of friends in Romania that his  brother, Constantine, 32, was wounded Monday by gunfire from government  security forces while retrieving John's body near the city of Cluj-Napoca.  </P> <P> But details remain sketchy.  </P> <P> "At this very moment, we don't know how bad shape he's in, where or what,  because we haven't been able to get through to Romania ourselves," said a  family member.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: LA VERNE;  </P> <P> APPEAL FOR BIG HOUSE DENIED  </P> <P> An appeal to build what would have been one of the largest homes in La Verne  was rejected by the City Council on Monday. The council decided that an  11,000-square-foot house -- with 13 bedrooms, 13 bathrooms and five two-car  garages -- would be incompatible with the 2,500- to 3,000-square-foot homes in  the foothills neighborhood.  </P> <P> A contingent of neighbors spoke against the size of the proposed house at 5050  Emerald Ave., using such terms as "condominium" and "Ramada Inn" to describe  it. They also questioned whether it would be used for just one family.  </P> <P> Dan Wildish, attorney for applicant Janet Lopez, acknowledged that the house is  big but noted that it is on a 4.2-acre lot, far larger than the neighbors'  lots, and that trees would partially screen it from view. The house would be  occupied by seven people, he said, and the rest of the bedrooms would be used  by temporary family guests.  </P> <P> However, the council rejected the project as incompatible with the  neighborhood.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> BELEAGUERED DOE SEEKS WAY TO END LIBERIA REVOLT  </P> <P> President Samuel Doe, hemmed in by an advancing rebel army, announced today he  will not run for reelection, and he asked the United States and other nations  to help end his nation's civil war.  </P> <P> U.S. military officials said 2,100 Marines aboard four ships of the U.S. Navy's  6th Fleet stood off the Liberian coast to protect property and lives of  Americans and other foreign nationals and, if necessary, to evacuate people.  </P> <P> The rebels, from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia, are seeking Doe's  ouster. They accuse his administration of corruption, economic mismanagement  and human rights abuses.  </P> <P> More than 1,000 people, most of them civilians slain by government troops, have  been killed in six months of fighting.  </P> <P> Rebel leader Charles Taylor told the British Broadcasting Corp. that his  fighters would not stop until they had taken Monrovia, the capital, and formed  their own government.  </P> <P> Rebel troops already control the country's main port of Buchanan, 95 miles east  of the capital, and were advancing on two fronts within 35 miles of Monrovia.  Thousands of people have fled the city.  </P> <P> At a news conference today, Doe said: "I wish to announce here today my firm  decision not to stand for the 1991 general elections."  </P> <P> "Accordingly, I hereby appeal to our traditional friends, the United States  government and other friendly countries, to bring to an end this 6-month-old,  Libyan-backed incursion in order to pave the way for a peaceful, free and fair  election in 1991," he said.  </P> <P> The news conference also was attended by legislators who for months have tried  to persuade Doe to not seek another term.  </P> <P> "It's too little, too late," said one diplomat. "Six months ago, this might  have helped."  </P> <P> Doe said he had survived 35 or 36 coup attempts and would be happy to leave the  "burden of leading a country . . . the political harassment" to somebody else.  </P> <P> He seized power in a bloody 1980 coup that ousted elitist descendants of  American slaves who discriminated against native Liberians. Liberia, a country  of 2 million, was founded in 1847.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 9, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Three national newspapers in Britain were fined a total of $250,500 for  contempt of court in publishing excerpts of "Spycatcher," a book by a former  security agent that details British intelligence operations. Justice Andrew  Morritt fined the Sunday Times, the Independent and the defunct News on Sunday  $83,500 each for violating a ban imposed by the government against the Guardian  and the Observer for publishing excerpts from the book in June, 1986. Morritt  ruled that the ban applied to all newspapers. However, the House of Lords later  lifted that ban, and both the Independent and the Sunday Times said they will  appeal.  </P></p>

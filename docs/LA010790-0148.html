			<p><P> January 7, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOME ARE AMUSED, SOME AREN'T: IT'S 'WAR'  </P> <P> I am disgusted by the fact that in this day of struggle to raise the human  above pervasive barbarism, a film that is a paean to the hypocritical morality  of the Reagan era and a total putdown of people's attempts to better their  lives through the recently won privilege of ending a destructive legalized  relationship, can be not only lavishly produced but brilliantly marketed and  touted as Oscar material. Wake me up when it's over.  </P> <P> RACHEL ROSENTHAL  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

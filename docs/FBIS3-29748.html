			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Roundtable talk between Koshiro Ishida, Komeito (Clean </F> Government Party) chairman and director general of the  Management and Coordination Agency; Keigo Ouchi, chairman of the  Democratic Socialist Party (DSP) and health and welfare  minister; Masayoshi Takemura, leader of Sakigake (Harbinger) and  chief cabinet secretary; Tsutomu Hata, head of Shinseito (Japan  Renewal Party), and deputy prime minister and foreign minister;  and Tomiichi Murayama, chairman of the Social Democratic Party  of Japan (SDPJ); moderated by Yoichi Oikawa, YOMIURI SHIMBUN  political department chief; place and date not given; first  paragraph is YOMIURI introduction]    [Text] Following the enactment of a package of four  political reform bills, YOMIURI SHIMBUN has invited five  coalition leaders to discuss the merit of the bills, the  prospects for political realignment, as well as other political  issues at hand. As for the opposition Liberal Democratic Party  [LDP], we had a separate interview with Secretary General  Yoshiro Mori.  <H3>  Political Reform Legislation: What Does It Signify and How  Can It Be Assessed? </H3>   [Oikawa] What does the enactment of the four political  reform  bills signify and how do you assess it?    [Takemura] I felt that Nagatacho [the political center of  Japan in Tokyo] has finally recovered its sound thinking. Prime  Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and I were watching the upper house  reject the reform bills on television. Shortly after that I  said, "Perhaps it is better, though we did not expect such a  situation," and he replied, "Yes, you are right." The prime  minister would have great difficulty in redistricting the  nation, in choosing members of the council to be in charge of  drafting a redistricting plan, if the reform package were  enacted by only a narrow margin of two to three votes. He was  aware of that. So for him, a wide consensus was indispensable.    [Murayama] I really welcome the enactment of the political  reform bills because the Hosokawa Cabinet began by staking its  political fortunes on the implementation of political reform.  However, as SDPJ chairman, I would like to stress that the  biggest point lying at the bottom of the political reform issue  is the prevention of corruption. I regret that the fund-raising  control system was eased (to allow each lawmaker to set up one  fund-raising body to receive corporate donations for a  transitional period of five years, while each company will be  permitted to contribute up to 500,000 yen a year), because the  SDPJ has devoted itself intensely to keeping the proposed ban on  corporate donations to individual lawmakers unchanged. However,  I feel happy because the coalition government was able to  fulfill its responsibility after all.    [Oikawa] Chairman Murayama, did you not expect the failure  of  the reform bills?    [Murayama] I never had such a thought, because as a  coalition  member, the SDPJ is also responsible.    [Ishida] I am not 100 percent satisfied with the political  reform legislation. However, when I think of the difficulties  we had -- finding common ground within the multifactional  coalition, plus reaching a compromise with the opposition LDP --  I should say it was the best we could do. It was a historic  achievement.    [Ouchi] I was very anxious, because at the last minute there  were many politicians calling for a second vote in the lower  house, knowing that this scenario could lead to a dissolution of  the Diet. On 27 January, I called on the prime minister at his  official residence in the evening and said, "You should  absolutely not dissolve the Diet. Dissolution is equivalent to  ignoring the position of the public. A general resignation of  the cabinet should also be avoided, because it will lead to  great confusion. Please have a top-level meeting with the LDP  and make tenacious efforts to the end." I spoke to him as if  negotiating personally with him. A top-level meeting with the  LDP inevitably meant that the prime minister would have to make  concessions and accept some modifications of the reform package.  However, as the saying goes, "knock at the door, and it will  open;" I thought the top-level meeting would avert the worst  situation.    [Hata] The political reform legislation gives us the  opportunity to eliminate evil practices that had resulted from  the multiseat electoral system. Political parties, candidates,  and lawmakers are now able to act on their own responsibilities,  and they have to do so. We should also achieve Diet reform.    [Oikawa] Mr. Takemura, what had the prime minister planned  to  do if the Diet failed to enact the bills?    [Takemura] On 27 January, the prime minister told a meeting  of the private-sector advisory committee on political reform  that he would not cling to the post of prime minister. That was  how he really felt at that moment. If we take him at his word,  he had no intention to dissolve the Diet. I have been telling  the prime minister, "If you take responsibility for failure by  dissolving the Diet, the public will not understand, and it  would give an impression that you are acting in a high and  mighty manner." It seems that the prime minister did not think  too much about failure.    [Oikawa] How soon will the date of implementation of the new  laws be fixed? And what about the difficult task of redividing  the nation into single-seat districts.    [Takemura] As the forthcoming regular Diet session will not  be pressed for time, it was decided at the top-level meeting  that the implementation date will be fixed "before the  government's draft budget is formulated." You should know this.  As for redistricting, it has to come after (legal) amendments.  To be able to start with a clean slate, the redistricting task  will be entrusted to several experts.    [Oikawa] Concerning the redistricting plan, the adjustment  of  views inside each coalition party seems to be difficult.    [Murayama] An independent council, to be set up under the  Prime Minister's Office, will be in charge of compiling a  redistricting plan. Therefore, we are not in a position to say  we accept such-and-such but we refuse this-and-this. We should  accept the plan submitted by the council without reserve.  <H5>  The Second Act of the Political Realignment Drama </H5>   [Oikawa] What will the coalition be like in the future? Is  there a possibility of a reshuffle within the coalition?    [Takemura] We have to turn quickly to other important  issues,  such as the implementation of a new package of economic stimulus  measures and the formulation of a budget bill. There will be  neither time nor energy to spare for a change in the coalition,  until we finish compiling the budget bill, until the prime  minister returns from the Japanese-U.S. summit meeting, and,  moreover, until the Diet passes the fiscal 1994 budget bill. As  we have a tight schedule, we have to go on at full tilt until  the beginning of May when the week of consecutive holidays  begins.    [Ouchi] The coalition should have an intensive dialogue with  the LDP on important issues related to national interest, such  as the formulation of a budget bill, including such matters as  income tax cuts and a consumption tax hike, and the economic  framework talks, which are expected to top the agenda of the  Japan-U.S. summit meeting. The coalition should not always  think about bringing down the LDP by any means. However, I do  not mean that the dialogue with the LDP will immediately bring  about a reshuffle in the coalition, that is to say, a grand  alliance with the LDP. Neither will it lead to a distribution of  some cabinet posts to the LDP. The prime minister has clearly  said that the compromise with the LDP will not lead to a grand  alliance. Moreover, whether the LDP will support the government  from outside the cabinet is not the question. It is quite  normal and necessary for a government to ask a powerful  opposition for assistance and understanding. There is nothing  strange about it.    [Ishida] The current coalition will not transform into a  grand alliance, because the political reform legislation is  expected to facilitate the consolidation of existing political  groups into two big parties coming to power by turns.    [Hata] It is good if all the parties can be in friendly  rivalry with one another on the same grounds. For that, a  political realignment is necessary. There would be two big  political parties in friendly rivalry. If so, politicians will  always be keyed up, because any scandal will prove fatal to the  party. Moreover, they will have to speak out, having the  possibility of a change of regime always in mind. Such  circumstances will help develop a sound government with a sound  ruling party and a sound opposition.    [Oikawa] Are Shinseito and Komeito planning to merge into a  new party?    [Hata] People are inventing stories about a  Shinseito-Komeito  alliance as they like. Mr. Ozawa (Shinseito secretary general)  and I are on good terms with Komeito Secretary-General Yuichi  Ichikawa. However, it does not mean that Shinseito and Komeito  will merge into a new party. Once politicians pursue discussion  on what politics should be like in the future, political  realignment will take shape spontaneously, as the next general  elections draw near.    [Ouchi] The important issue after political reform is party  reform. This should be the next step for political realignment.  A new system can be good or bad; everything will depend on  political parties and politicians. If it goes in the wrong  direction, it could lead to another one-party rule or bring  about an undemocratic government. Party reform or political  realignment should be easy to understand for the public.  Political forces, which have established a democratic ideology,  are to play a major role. The new electoral system will prove  efficient only if political forces, which have a common local  policy or a common vision for the future, can join hands.    [Murayama] There might be a little reshuffle in the  coalition. However, the framework will probably remain  unchanged: The current coalition in power and the LDP in  opposition. How will political parties cooperate with one  another when the next election is held under the new single-seat  electoral system? That is the question. Depending on the  outcome of the next election, there might be a minor change in  the coalition government.    [Ouchi] We should not say, "Let's accomplish realignment of  the political map by putting the LDP aside." We are not in such  a situation. What is needed is a wholesale realignment  affecting all parties, including the LDP. For example, imagine  that you have many balls of different colors. You put them all  in a box with a small hole. You strongly shake the box, and the  balls will come out of the hole in different combinations. But  you cannot know the results in advance. Political realignment  is like this, and each party should bear this in mind.    [Hata] Yes, you shake the box and then a new combination  comes out.    [Murayama] What kind of merger or what kind of partnership?  It will depend on how parties cooperate with one another to win  an election. In any event, there is no possibility for a  political party to come into power single-handedly for the time  being. Which is the best between a two-party system and a  moderate multiparty system as advocated by Prime Minister  Hosokawa? I personally think that some form of multiparty  system is necessary, because the people's mentality is so  diversified.    [Ishida] The single-seat constituency system will  inevitably trigger a policy argument between two political  forces, excluding the Japanese Communist Party. In the case of  the current government, it was only after the election that the  seven parties and one parliamentary group reached an agreement  to form a coalition. However, the same procedure will probably  not work next time. In the next election, the coalition parties  will have to campaign as a new political force formed by  different parties capable of reaching agreement on different  policies.    [Takemura] The LDP and the SDPJ have terminated their  historic role. I do not think the current political camps --  the LDP and the non-LDP force -- will be consolidated, as they  are in the second act of the political realignment drama. The  LDP as well as the SDPJ are expecting various changes. That is  not all. All parties, including Sakigake, are going to be hit  by a severe blizzard called political realignment. Will it  produce three new parties or four new parties? I do not know.  Political ideologies and basic policies will become the pivotal  point of political realignment. My opinion is that it will not  immediately lead to a two-party system, because people's values  are so diversified. As for a possible merger of Sakigake and  the Japan New Party into a new party, we will carry on  negotiations to form a definite plan. I understand that the  time is now ripe for a merger, because of the enactment of the  political reform legislation.    [Oikawa] In terms of political ideology, coalition parties  differ little from one another, except for the SDPJ. However,  opinions might be divided in regard to the future course of  Japan. Is that the case?    [Hata] You say that the SDPJ is different. However, the SDPJ  has agreed with other coalition parties on the rice issue (for a  successful conclusion of the trade talks under GATT). It has  also accepted the outline of the eighth report submitted by the  Election System Council. Concerning the bill to amend the  Self-Defense Forces Law (which would allow the use of SDF  aircraft to rescue overseas Japanese from crises), we could also  reach an agreement with the SDPJ, although the bill has not  passed the Diet yet. Like the SDPJ, there are various opinions  inside Shinseito as well. For instance, Shinseito members have  suggested many different ways to deal with the question of  Japan's eligibility for a permanent seat in the United Nations  Security Council within the framework of our Constitution. A  party having lots of free discussions is a democratic party, and  it is the democratic way to cooperate with others once something  is decided by the majority. The parties in the ruling coalition  can work together on any issue.    [Murayama] We want people to change their view that the SDPJ  is different, because we are no longer living in an era of  ideological conflict. I often tell my party members that we  should continue to hold our own ideology on the one hand.  However on the other hand, we should see things in a flexible  manner, since policymaking requires a realistic stance. It is  important for the SDPJ to continue to cooperate with other  coalition parties, by finding common ground with them.    [Ishida] Seen from the viewpoint of Komeito, there was once  a  difference in policy between the SDPJ and the other parties.  However, when we agreed to form a coalition, we were determined  to overcome the differences, and we have been making efforts in  that direction until now. For instance, with regard to the  Uruguay Round, we had much trouble with the rice issue.  However, we were able to overcome the differences though it was  an ordeal, and we settled the issue. We should keep this ordeal  in mind. If all coalition parties are able to speak out, they  can continue to work together.  <H5>  Tax Reform and Administrative Reform </H5>   [Oikawa] From now on, the SDPJ should find the issue of a  consumption tax hike more important than political reform.    [Murayama] I do not understand why you always refer to the  SDPJ, because the consumption tax hike is also a tough question  for all parties in the ruling coalition: Komeito, the DSP,  Shinseito -- every party is concerned. A rise in the  consumption tax strongly goes against the current of the times.  People in the lower income brackets are not paying any income  tax. A consumption tax hike will become a new burden for these  people who will never share in the benefit of income tax cuts.  In this sense, when we think of the purpose and the expected  effect of income tax cuts, we cannot accept a rise in the  consumption tax aimed at covering the shortfall in revenues.    [Hata] We should soon start a debate on what the taxation  system should be like; in other words, we will have to discuss  whether it will be possible to carry out income tax cuts. My  party is having hot discussions. The SDPJ is not the only party  highly concerned with it. It is an important issue for every  party. What we need is an income tax reduction to stimulate the  economy. What should be done to cover the subsequent shortfall  in revenues? The outline of a tax reform plan is expected to be  presented in about three or four days.    [Murayama] Parties in the ruling coalition should manage to  reach an agreement after heated discussions, setting aside  differences. Such a process helps support and invigorate the  coalition government. To what extent will it be possible to  implement an income tax reduction? How should it be financed?  The SDPJ is now talking about these points.    [Oikawa] However, the SDPJ seems to have difficulties  putting  up a united front on that issue.    [Murayama] our immediate plan is to carry out a  large-scale reduction of the income tax as a way to stimulate  the economy. To cover the shortfall in revenues, we propose  revising unfair points in the current taxation system, and  cutting down operating expenses. If these measures are  insufficient to finance the income tax reduction, we will accept  issuing deficit-financing bonds as a special measure. However,  it should not be done unconditionally. Deficit-covering bonds  should be issued as a short-term revenue source, for instance,  within a time limit of three or five years. Moreover, we will  have to examine the ratio of direct and indirect taxes in tax  revenue; we will also have to look at the balance between  assets, income, and consumption. We might even consider a bold  and drastic comprehensive taxation. [sentence as published] We  propose a sweeping revision of the tax system. At the same  time, we should form a new welfare vision to cope with the aging  society. How should social welfare be financed? How far can it  be covered by tax revenue? How far will social insurance  programs be applied? We will have to give a satisfactory  explanation to the public. There is nothing irresponsible in  what we are saying.    [Ishida] Some people say that the income tax cuts and the  consumption tax hike should be handled as one unit. This sort  of argument should not exist in the first place. A tax reform  plan will never be approved by the public as long as there is no  clear vision about a welfare society and an aging society. My  party cannot readily agree to a plan to raise the consumption  tax to cover income tax cuts.    [Murayama] If the political reform bills were killed, I had  made the following suggestion: The prime minister should  neither dissolve the Diet nor announce a general resignation of  the cabinet, even if the political reform bills are killed. The  cabinet should rather fulfill its responsibility by compiling a  new package of stimulus measures, a third supplementary budget  for the current fiscal year, and a budget bill for fiscal 1994.  The cabinet should decide whether it has to take responsibility  for not achieving political reform, only after settling these  economic issues. In addition to the revision of the electoral  system accompanied by the introduction of anticorruption  measures, we will have to promote a decentralization of power  and carry out Diet reform. Political reform will only be fully  achieved when these three pillars are completed.  Decentralization of power and Diet reform are the next two  items on the political agenda.    [Ishida] Yes, you are right. The government will soon  formulate its outline on administrative reform. It will set  forth decentralization as well as economic deregulation. This  medium-term administrative reform policy will become an  epoch-making event that was not conceivable under LDP rule.  <H3>  The Treatment of SDPJ Dietmen who Rebelled Against Their  Party Leadership </H3>   [Oikawa] How will the SDPJ treat its members who disobeyed  the leadership?    [Murayama] The SDPJ Central Executive Committee has already  decided on the punitive action to be taken against those who  acted against the party's resolution. The Discipline Committee  will make the final decision. One characteristic of the SDPJ is  that the party is composed of broadminded people. However, once  something is agreed on as a party resolution, the party  leadership wants all members to act on it.    [Oikawa] Chairman Murayama, do you have any intention to  resign?    [Murayama] I have never announced an intention to resign.  SDPJ rules stipulate that such organs as the party convention  and the Central Committee are responsible for party  administration. A party convention has to be held, or a meeting  of the Central Committee has to be convened, each time as  needed, to hear and approve reports on what has transpired. I  will have to call a meeting of the Central Committee at the  proper time to report the settlement of the rice issue and the  development of the political reform issue, and get the approval  of other members.</p>

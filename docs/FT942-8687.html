			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Leading Article: Derivatives in the dock Legislators in the US Congress have long been worried that trading in derivative financial instruments such as swaps, futures and options might confront them with another financial crisis to match the hugely expensive savings and loan fiasco. Yesterday's report on derivatives from the General Accounting Office (GAO) will no doubt strengthen their resolve to control such trading. Yet the report's conclusion that there is a need for substantial tightening of the regulatory system in relation to derivatives runs counter to the more reassuring verdict of an authoritative, earlier report by the Group of 30, an influential banking think-tank. Are the politicians overreacting? The dramatic growth in derivatives trading and the losses recently recorded by such companies as Metallgesellschaft Kashima Oil, Procter &amp; Gamble and Atlantic Richfield are unquestionably eye-catching. Yet the risks involved in these novel financial instruments are the same, in principle, as those in conventional banking such as credit risk, market risk or liquidity risk. The differences are of degree. Derivative instruments are intrinsically leveraged: a small movement in the underlying cash market can produce a big change in the value of the derivative. The mathematical complexity of the more exotic instruments calls for heavy expenditure by banks and companies on appropriate systems and skills. Lack of transparency Properly used, derivatives are a highly effective tool to manage and control risk. But as the GAO rightly observes, they can be used to assume risk, notably in proprietary trading, as well as to reduce it. While most central bankers argue that the probability of a systemic shock is low, they cannot deny that there is a lack of transparency in the system. The fastest growth is in over-the-counter trade, not in organised markets. Accounting standards have been slow to capture the impact of derivative activity both on and off the balance sheet. An essential discipline in the system consists of marking derivative exposures to market value on a daily basis. Yet many of the contracts are customised for individual institutions and valued on the basis of computer models incorporating assumptions of varying boldness about the future relationship between interest rates, currencies and markets. Since the assumptions rely on past correlations, they can prove wrong. Such complexity can make a nonsense of traditional checks and balances. Losses incurred by a leading trader at Kidder Peabody, for example, went unnoticed by his fellow traders, the back office, senior management and auditors. Too often the trader's pay is related to a performance period shorter than the duration of the derivative contracts. Most players in the game are relying heavily on the monitoring provided by credit rating agencies and regulators, who are not infallible. Cross-infection The threat to the global banking system stems from the possibility that in this opaque trading world banks will make poor credit assessments of counterparties who take lethal trading risks. The GAO emphasises that, in an increasingly integrated and concentrated market, the investment banks' and insurers' mis-assessment of risk in derivatives could be as dangerous for the system as that of the commercial banks. Also that cross-infection in a global market will be hard to contain. Anything other than a global approach to regulation will be less than fully effective. The thrust of supervision should thus continue to be chiefly through the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements, whose capital adequacy regime will need constant upgrading in the light of experience of instruments that are still relatively untested. Yet it is hard to argue with the GAO's assertion that there are gaps in the domestic US system, in terms of both data and oversight, which need to be plugged. The GAO also raises a legitimate concern in questioning whether the present level of proprietary trading is appropriate in a deposit-insured banking system subject to a high degree of moral hazard. A comprehensive and consistent regulatory approach is probably beyond the art of the possible. But in the absence of that, a piecemeal approach is better than nothing at all.</p>

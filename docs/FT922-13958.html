			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Technology: A shock to the system / A look at how privatisation has affected the R&amp;D activities of Britain's electricity industry SPENDING on research and development has been one casualty of electricity privatisation in the UK. The new companies have closed laboratories inherited from the Central Electricity Generating Board, made many scientists and engineers redundant and reduced the scope of their R&amp;D. The size of the decline is uncertain, since the privatised R&amp;D arrangements are not yet fully in place and the companies have been slow to disclose their new levels of research spending. In evidence for last month's Commons Energy Committee report on electricity privatisation, the Watt Committee on Energy, an independent group, estimated that National Power, PowerGen, National Grid and Nuclear Electric spend less than Pounds 100m a year between them on R&amp;D. That compares with the CEGB's R&amp;D budget of Pounds 200m in 1988-89, the last year before it was broken up. As the Watt Committee commented: 'For a high-technology industry with sales exceeding Pounds 5bn per annum and facing both supply and market developments together with a degree of uncertainty in the medium- to long-term future, a total spend of . . . less than 2 per cent of sales seems anomalous.' Most hostility has come from bodies representing the R&amp;D staff hit by the cuts. Patrick Hanson, national research officer of the Electrical Power Engineers' Association, said the energy secretary in the government elected today should use powers under the Electricity Act to fund research in the national interest which had been abandoned by the privatised industry. However John Wakeham, the outgoing energy secretary, said that, while it was too early to be certain, 'the run-down by the old CEGB research establishments is probably being compensated for in a pretty efficient way by manufacturers of products and users of products seeking to do the necessary research in order to assist themselves in the market'. The privatised companies agree with him. 'In the long term, manufacturers, suppliers and research institutions will be stimulated to fill the gap,' predicted East Midlands Electricity. 'This will result in a healthier, more competitive and more commercially focused R&amp;D activity.' The new R&amp;D arrangements of the non-nuclear parts of the industry are: National Power, the largest generating company, is closing its main laboratories in Leatherhead, Surrey, where 200 scientists and 250 support staff worked. It is setting up instead a streamlined research and technology division at its business centre in Swindon, Wiltshire, with 100 scientists and 20 support staff. R&amp;D spending will fall from Pounds 26m to Pounds 14m a year. PowerGen, its smaller competitor, has closed the Marchwood laboratories in Hampshire and concentrated R&amp;D at its Ratcliffe Technology Centre near Nottingham. The number of scientists employed has fallen from 190 to 40. PowerGen's R&amp;D spending will fall from Pounds 14m to Pounds 8m a year. This includes a payment of Dollars 3.3m a year to the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in the US. National Grid, the transmission company, has set up a technology and science division with 210 scientists and support staff in Leatherhead. In contrast to National Power and PowerGen, its R&amp;D spending has gone up slightly - from about Pounds 6m a year when transmission was something of a Cinderella subject within the CEGB to Pounds 8.2m now. The regional electricity companies, which distribute power to consumers, support R&amp;D through EA Technology in Capenhurst, Cheshire. Collectively they underwrite about Pounds 13m of EA Technology's Pounds 20m a year budget and spend a further Pounds 4m on individual projects. Peter Chester, who retires this month as National Power's executive director for technology and environment after supervising the R&amp;D restructuring, says this was a response to the profound shift in technical strategy which accompanied privatisation. Instead of the planned expansion of large coal-fired power stations designed by the CEGB, National Power is building smaller gas-fired combined cycle plants designed by international power engineering companies. 'One consequence is a much reduced call for 'research' in support of existing plant; in future this will be supplied mainly from within the engineering function,' said Chester. National Power's slimmed-down R&amp;D staff will concentrate on: strategic studies of new options for power generation such as 'clean coal' technology; emission control techniques; cheaper fuels; waste-to-energy processes; co-generation; wind power development; and other opportunities for business development. Critics have attacked National Power particularly for running down environmental research, for which the Leatherhead laboratories had a worldwide reputation. But Chester says this was inevitable. When the CEGB set up its environmental science programme 15 years ago, 'major scientific questions were still open, environmental research in the universities and other institutions was relatively poorly supported and policy on reducing SO and NOx was awaiting better scientific understanding. Now there are clear policies, many other players in the field and much external environmental expertise to draw on.' National Power says it is making every effort to 'assist in the transfer of those skills and facilities no longer needed, to organisations that can make effective use of them'. According to Carlos Lopez-Cacicedo, research and technology director, 90 per cent of those made redundant at Leatherhead have found new jobs. The company is giving away surplus equipment that would be worth several million pounds if new. For example, Imperial College, London, has set up an Atmospheric Chemistry Research Unit on the basis of mobile laboratories donated by National Power. And the Natural Environment Research Council is acquiring special greenhouses designed to assess the effect of pollutants on plants. As the generating companies slim down their own R&amp;D activities, they are contracting out more research. The biggest beneficiary so far is EPRI, based in California, which carries out collaborative R&amp;D for the US electric utilities. Last year PowerGen became EPRI's first overseas affiliate. Its Dollars 3.3m a year subscription gives PowerGen access to a range of projects on which EPRI is spending Dollars 46m a year. EPRI has just opened a UK office in anticipation of receiving more work from the electricity supply industry in Britain and other European countries. In the UK two electricity R&amp;D organisations with similar names, ERA Technology and EA Technology, stand to benefit from any further contracting out of research. ERA Technology in Leatherhead (originally the Electrical Research Association) has been operating as a free-standing contract R&amp;D company since 1973, covering electro-technical research. EA Technology (formerly the Electricity Research and Development Centre) still depends on underwritten funding from the electricity companies but is moving to find new customers. At the same time Stuart Excell, managing director of EA Technology, suggests that the industry's regulator, Stephen Littlechild, should give the electricity companies more incentive to support R&amp;D - especially research into more efficient use of electricity - by allowing them to pass on the costs in increased charges to customers. 'Otherwise it's like asking a company to spend money reducing its own turnover,' he says.</p>

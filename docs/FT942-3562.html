			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / UK Company News: A move to regain the initiative - A look at the attractions of the Viglen purchase for Amstrad Amstrad's proposed acquisition of Viglen, the PC manufacturer which sells its machines direct to its customers, represents a significant shift in the UK consumer electronic group's strategy. Mr Alan Sugar, Amstrad's founder and chairman, acknowledged this yesterday when he said the deal represented the start of 'a new direction for the company'. 'We are looking to be in businesses where the products we are producing will be sold directly to the parties that use them,' Mr Sugar said. The Amstrad chairman, who has been a bitter critic in the past of the purchasing policies followed by the high street multiples like Dixons, said the move represented the natural outcome of the erosion of margins in the traditional distribution channels. Amstrad has seen the margins on nearly all of its traditional product lines, including personal computers, evaporate as competitors rushed into consumer electronics markets pioneered by the company. Two years ago, when Mr Sugar proposed buying back the Amstrad shares he did not already own for 30p each, he claimed he was making the proposal because Amstrad had run out of ideas and become just another 'me-too' company lacking 'blockbuster products' and destined to deliver only mediocre profits. However, Amstrad's shareholders turned down his buy-back proposal and Mr Sugar said yesterday that the group's new direct sales strategy was an attempt to steer Amstrad back towards 'large profits'. By selling directly to customers Amstrad believes it will be able to recapture the margin that has traditionally gone to retailers. Mr Sugar said yesterday that a similar direct sales approach would be taken by Dancall Radio, the Danish-based advanced digital telecommunications equipment group which Amstrad acquired last September. The Amstrad chairman added that the new distribution policy had the full support of Mr David Rogers, the senior Philips executive who was appointed Amstrad's chief executive earlier this month. Mr Rogers' job at Amstrad will be to oversee a rapidly growing group of operating companies including Viglen, Dancall and Betacom, the consumer telecommunications equipment manufacturer which is majority owned by Amstrad but which also retains a separate quote. He will also be in charge of Amstrad's traditional consumer electronics business which, among other products, also makes a range of Amstrad personal computers. Most analysts have been expecting Amstrad to abandon the PC business altogether because of its wafer-thin margins and the fast pace of technical innovation which means that manufacturers always risk sitting on stock with a declining value. However, Mr Sugar emphasised that it had never been Amstrad's intention to abandon the PC business altogether, only the low-margin retail end of the business. Explaining the decision to buy Viglen he said the company was 'not just a box shifter'. He said Viglen had developed an increasingly profitable business delivering 'made to measure' PCs mainly to corporate, government and institutional customers which distinguished it from other so-called PC 'clone' assemblers. Over the past few years the UK PC market has become increasingly competitive as clone manufacturers - many of which also sell directly through computer magazines - have cut prices in an effort to boost volumes. However, Viglen, along with a handful of other UK-based PC manufacturers and assemblers like north London-based Elonex, have managed to differentiate their products and customer service and establish themselves as second-tier PC suppliers behind industry leaders such as IBM and Compaq Computer. Mr Sugar emphasised that Viglen would continue to be run by the mainly Armenian team of young entrepreneurs who have built the business up over the past five years.</p>

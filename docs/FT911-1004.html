			<p>910509 FT  09 MAY 91 / Business Law: Self-regulation under threat A GREAT DEAL of concern is being expressed about the effects of the European Commission's forthcoming company law directive on takeovers, foreshadowed in its draft 13th directive. The fear is that the directive will force the UK's own self-regulatory Panel on Takeovers and Mergers to be formally established by statute, which would in turn threaten the informality, flexibility and speed which are the panel's hallmarks. The panel's supporters have raised the spectre of a rigid statutory scheme administered by non-expert bureaucrats causing a rash of tactical litigation and a rush for judicial review - even during the course of a takeover bid. A recent study by the David Hume Institute favours the present largely unregulated activities of the panel and compares its actions to that of a football referee, acting to control a 'fast-moving, frequently unpredictable, competitive event', where an authoritative decision needs to be made quickly, and without the impediment of formality and appeal to the courts. The panel needs to act swiftly, and in practice operates with commendable efficiency. However, its decisions are much freer of constraint than those of any footfall referee. It makes the laws it interprets, it waives its own laws, and it operates virtually free of public scrutiny. By comparison, the football referee is a model of procedural propriety. The panel has already been the subject of judicial review, first in the 1987 Datafin case. Despite its lack of 'visible means of legal support', the Master of the Rolls described the panel as possessing 'a giant's strength' and considered it amenable to judicial review because it exercises 'immense power' of a public nature. However, it was not only the panel's strength and power that convinced the Court of Appeal to subject it to judicial review. It was also the fact that the panel violated accepted norms of separation of powers being, as described in a later case, 'part legislator, part court of interpretation, part consultant, part referee, part disciplinary body'. Listening to the pleas of the panel's supporters for freedom from legal control brings to mind the time when virtually all UK administrative tribunals and inquiries evaded legality on the ground that their place was in the realm of 'administration' rather than 'justice'. The main fear of the panel's supporters is that the implementation of the directive through statutory enactment will encourage legal challenge to the panel's decisions during the course of takeover bids. Legal intervention, however, is unlikely to become more frequent simply because the panel has statutory status. As has been made clear in countless cases, judicial review never permits the courts to interfere with the 'merits' of a case. No court will lightly upset the panel's opinion that the parties have or have not been acting 'in concert', or that a party has been taking action to obstruct a bid in breach of the City code on takeovers and mergers. These are essentially matters of 'fact and degree' for the panel. The concern is that the panel will be subject to judicial review for not following the letter of the directive. The panel and its supporters cherish its privilege of eschewing the literal interpretation of its rules, and giving precedence to its set of principles. It is therefore free to waive a rule in favour of a principle, to interpret a practice that is not covered by a rule in the light of a principle, and speedily to enact new rules to cover new situations (such as management buy-outs). The panel's mix of rule and discretion displays a commendable flexibility and a willingness to consider each case on its individual merit. But the draft directive also establishes a combination of principles and rules, and permits reasoned derogation from a number of its rules. The UK statute could easily instruct the new principles to prevail over the rules. In any event, judges in the UK are these days perfectly capable of interpreting statutes 'purposively'. They have, in past cases, shown themselves to be sufficiently aware of administrative realities to recognise that laws may be enforced selectively, and that extra-statutory concessions are a fact of regulatory life. When the Court of Appeal held that the panel's decisions were subject to judicial review, the Master of the Rolls had the American experience very much in mind when he promised that the relationship between the panel and the court should be 'historic rather than contemporaneous'. Thus panel decisions, if held unlawful in the future, would not be quashed but only admonished by way of a declaratory judgment with prospective effect (although it was subsequently made clear that in the case of decisions leading to disciplinary action the court would intervene to protect the parties from the 'abuse of power'). With or without the directive, it is going to be hard for the courts to continue defending a secure zone of immunity around the panel - an immunity which could not be justified in the case of other bodies performing public functions. Normally in UK law a remedy should be provided where a right or breach of duty has been found. A blanket immunity from remedy in practice removes any incentive to litigation, thus making the opportunity of judicial review in effect a dead letter. Nevertheless, there is a key reason why the fear of 'American style' obstructive litigation is unfounded: the UK procedure for judicial review (the application for judicial review) has a built-in filtering system. Unlike US procedure, and unlike private-law procedure in this country, the application for judicial review is divided into two stages. At the first stage the decision is taken to grant 'leave' to apply. This stage is purpose-built to halt obstructive litigation in its tracks, and would mean that few unmeritorious cases would easily reach the second stage of a full hearing. Even in the absence of enforced change from the directive, a procedural audit of the Takeover Panel would find much wanting in comparison with other bodies performing public functions. Its required consultative procedures when rules are amended are minimal. Its composition looks to an outsider excessively biased towards those with a direct financial interest in creating more takeover activity. (No doubt the panel and the executive are scrupulously fair in practice but, as it is said, justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done.) Inter partes hearings in a contested matter are very much the exception  - even though these are often the best way of arriving at the truth. Nor does the panel normally allow presentation of a case by a legal advocate. The courts have blown hot and cold on whether procedural fairness includes the right to a legal adviser before domestic tribunals, and before disciplinary tribunals in institutions such as prisons. Even in those situations, however, the view has now formed that legal representation is a basic 'civil right' that should not be excluded in all but the most exceptional situations. If that is so, why should legal representation not be permitted as of right before the panel. Or, to put it another way, by what right, and on what principle, does the panel seek to protect a virtual monopoly of representation by City financial advisers? The proposed European directive is unlikely to change the relationship between the panel and the courts. Yet there seems no reason why the panel should be exempt from controls on its discretion which are routinely imposed on other decision-making bodies with far less power. Nor does there seem any good reason why a somewhat increased measure of control of the panel's 'giant's strength' should impede the undoubted efficiency and flexibility for which it is justly renowned.

The nine-truck convoy, escorted by  UN armored vehicles, was carrying 80 tonnes of food and medical  supplies and included several doctors who hoped to bring out  from the enclave some 20 people in need of medical attention.    Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for  refugees, said the relief convoy left the town of Zenica early  Saturday [19 March] and travelled the 70 kilometres (43 miles)  to Maglaj without encountering any obstacles from Bosnian Serb  troops besieging the Moslem enclave. He said the convoy reached  Maglaj shortly after 1330 GMT only to discover a devastated city  with only a few buildings left standing. "There are almost no  buildings left that have not been destroyed by the Serbs," said  Kessler. "It looks like Vukovar." Vukovar is the eastern  Croatian city destroyed by the former Yugoslav army in 1991.  [passage omitted]</p>

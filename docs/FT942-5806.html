			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / London Stock Exchange: Inflation concerns bring a renewed downturn - Market Report Inflation worries caught hold strongly on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday, prompting another savage setback in the UK equity market. Heavy losses in British government bonds increased the pressure on share prices, with the June futures contract on the FT-SE 100 Index again taking much of the strain. The first hour of official trading saw the stock market edge higher, with the Footsie moving 15 points ahead as London responded to improvement on other European bourses. But when stock index futures failed to hold initial gains and UK bonds reacted to a reversal of fortune in German bonds, share prices began to fall steeply. At the close the FT-SE 100 was down 38.6 at 2,931.9, virtually the lowest point of the session, following a final extinction of the last of two attempts to rally. The broader market followed suit, the FT-SE Mid 250 shedding 26.6 to 3,537.7 as profits were taken and share prices were marked lower. Traders commented that while selling pressure in equities had not been heavy, the marketmakers had suffered severely from the renewed volatility in both gilts and equities. The Footsie 2,900 mark remained clearly at hazard in a stock market now a long way from the nearest support levels on the analysts' charts. These charts show the market possibly unsupported above the Footsie 2,800 mark, a level still identified as a potential low point last weekend by Mr Nicholas Knight, international equity strategist at Nomura Research. Howver, many analysts continued to maintain that equities should be bought at current levels. The first half of the session appeared to confirm that selling pressure is still light, although this was counter-balanced by renewed pressure in stock index futures, which have become the first forum for fund managers seeking to change stance in the stock market. Volume in equities increased towards the close, when Wall Street was 13 Dow points lower in response to the sharp increase in the May pricing index of the US National Association of Purchasing Managers. For the full session, Seaq volume in UK stocks reached 530.7m shares, against 505.2m on Tuesday when retail business dipped to Pounds 1.1bn. There was some disappointment that the Bundesbank trimmed its weekly repo money market rate by only 5 basis points, although uncertainty was also fuelled by comments expressed by Bundesbank council members. But the first blow to confidence came when bond markets turned off as news that German industrial output had risen sharply in May increased inflation concerns. UK markets reacted badly when the September long-dated gilt-edged futures fell below par. The further blow, from the US purchasing managers' report, hit UK gilts hard again and completed the rout in share prices. The general weakness in equities overshadowed trading statements from several leading names. The market took a very bearish view of comments at the annual meeting of Kingfisher, the retail group with interests encompassing the Darty group in France and the Woolworth and Comet groups in the UK. The UK stock market appeared highly nervous at the close and traders said that the near term direction must depend on developments in UK government bonds.</p>

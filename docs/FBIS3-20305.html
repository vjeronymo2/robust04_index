			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Winners and Losers and Those in </F> Between"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, March 29 -- Forza Italia leader Silvio  Berlusconi said today he was certain his victorious right-wing  Freedom Front alliance would not "betray" the will of Italian  voters who demanded a force which will give "a majority to the  country" and "a strong and authoritative government" while a  Democratic Party of the Left senator acknowledged what he said  was the "clear-cut defeat of the the Progressives."    Berlusconi, the Milan media and publishing magnate who  joined  forces with the noisy Northern League and the neo-Fascist based  National Alliance in January, declared, "I have no uncertainty  in relations with the League" against the backdrop of rumblings  from League leader Umberto Bossi against the Forza Italia  driving force and the neo-Fascists under the Freedom Front  umbrella.    Bossi was quoted in today's newspapers as saying he opposed  seeing Berlusconi in the premier's office, as appeared more than  likely according to a reading of the tallies and projections as  he spoke, and would never go into government with the  neo-Fascist "lynch mob" in the winning coalition.    In his first interview in the flush of victory, Berlusconi  said, "I think relations are totally positive. The League  candidates will now look behind the votes they have won and  they'll be aware that the votes for the pole were in the  majority.    ``So I don't think there will be any betrayal of the voters  who indicated exactly what they want: the formation of a unified  pole which gives a majority to the country and expresses a  strong and authoritative government,'' added the  businessman-turned-politician.    Asked whether he had his gaze set on Palazzo Chigi, the  premier's office, he said the answer will come from Head of  State Oscar Luigi Scalfaro who will "read the vote and act in  consequence."    On the incomplete tallies, which show Forza Italia, the  Northern League and National Alliance with a comfortable  majority in Lower House voting in capturing 355 seats, with 316  needed for a majority, and close to majority in the Senate,  Berlusconi said the was pleased but, he added, "as for Forza  Italia, we thought it would get even a better result."    Later in the day, Berlusconi conferred for three house with  ally Gianfranco Fini, who took his neo-Fascist MSI [Italian  Social Movement] through a name-change to become the National  Alliance which flanked Forza Italia in the south. The likely  premier-designate also talked over the telephone to other  representatives in his Freedom Front, League theoretician  Gianfranco Miglio, and Centrist Union leaders Raffaele Costa,  the outgoing transport minister, and Alfredo Biondi, both  erst-while Liberals.    In the vicinity was Cesare Previti, a successful Forza  Italia  candidate, who told reporters that he thought differences with  Bossi could be patched up. "There are no problems of principle  because it seems to me that Bossi was critical of the `lynch  mob' right and Fini certainly does not belong to this category."    On the League leader's "veto" levied against Berlusconi in  the premier's office, Previti remarked, "Never say never," and  said a meeting between the two men would be set up for the near  future but had not yet been scheduled.    As the Forza Italia leader conferred, the movement's  spokesman, Antonio Tajani, said a press conference Berlusconi  had announced had been cancelled but that he will take to the  airwaves in the evening in an interview to be broadcast by the  public radio and television corporation's channel one news  program.    On the left, the Democratic Party of the Left whip in the  Senate, Giuseppe Chiarante, said that arising from the ballot  boxes is a "split between three Italies, the north, the center  and the south" and spoke of the "dangerous logic" of the  first-past-the-post system used for the first time in the  watershed general election. According to the senator, the result  of changes in the voting rules dictated by a national referendum  vote in April last year, intended to give voters clear choices  "to guarantee a stable and lasting government," will be  difficulty in forming a government because of disarray on the  right, "though they came out as clear-cut winners."    After arguing that the ballot has "led Italian democracy  into  a dangerous blind alley," Chiarante said, "As far as the  Progressives are concerned, it cannot be hidden that the defeat  was clear-cut and, in certain parts of the country, like the  North, especially heavy." He concluded his comment on the  outcome of the vote by pledging that the "electoral  understanding among the Progressives" will be further forged  into "more consolidated democratic unity to make of this line-up  a base and a point of departure for more dynamic and innovative  political proposals which will not allow the right -- as has  happened in part, paradoxically -- to present itself as a new  and more modern force."    The speaker of the Senate, Giovanni Spadolini, said today,  in  substance, the people voted and, in the coming months,  corrections can be applied to the electoral laws as required.  "But this electoral law corresponded to the indications of the  people as clearly sanctioned in the referendum, no to party rule  and corruption," he said with reference to the intentions of the  referendum proposal architects to loosen the political party  hold on public life and allow voters to vote the candidate.  Talk now of an early end to the Parliament just voted into  office, the twelfth post-war legislature of the republic, is  "out of place," said Spadolini. "This Parliament, thanks to the  seal of legitimacy received from the people, must find the  energy to face and solve its major duties: first among them the  start-up of institutional renewal in the country and the  modernization of the state machinery to the level of new  challenges," he added.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Georgian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Republican Party Chairman Vakhtang </F> Dzabiradze and Popular Front Chairman Nodar Natadze by Lili  Burbutashvili on 8 February; place not given: "Terrorist Acts  as Viewed by Parliamentarians"]    [Text] [Dzabiradze] One can say that the latest fact, I  mean the explosion that killed [Deputy Defense Minister Niko]  Kekelidze [on 3 February; see item LD0802115694 in previous  Terrorism Report], shows that a new era has begun in the country  -- that of terrorism. Prominent figures belonging to armed  formations are, to all intents and purposes, being wiped out  gradually and almost in a systematic manner. The hallmarks are  identical in almost every case. Unfortunately, the law  enforcement bodies have not uncovered a single fact concerning  this terrorism. Who could be responsible for this? Nothing can  be excluded in our troubled times. The point is that countless  armed groups are active in the country. The general public  knows that relations between these groups are far from good and,  on this basis, we could be dealing with clashes between mafia  clans or a "mafia war" similar to that in the United States in  the 1930's. The reason lies in the redistribution of spheres  and lines of action. As a result of the existing unstable  political factor in the country, it is quite possible that  certain political forces are also interested in the "removal" of  some of these people. There is also another element -- external  forces that, today, are not creating or are unable to create new  hot spots in Georgia (life is, to a certain extent, following  its course) and this method gives them the means to preserve a  certain measure of instability and create an atmosphere of fear  among the population. It is known that recent terrorist acts  have resulted in the deaths of innocent people. Therefore, such  a serious situation in the country enables both external and  internal political forces to destroy physically their main  political rivals. Unfortunately, one can expect the further  development of events in this direction: It is much easier  today to get rid of a political rival with a bomb than have him  arrested. So, if the authorities are unable to dispel these  suspicions, they should at least aim to unmask the perpetrators  of these terrorist acts in order to restore order. Otherwise,  we will have every reason to believe that the current  authorities are creating the serious situation prevailing in  Georgia.    [Natadze] I have specific information (about one month now)  that Russia is planning to occupy Georgia within six months  using several divisions. The first stage: One and a half  months will be needed to disarm bands and also, against this  background, all those left [in possession of weapons] or, in  other words, the physical removal of weapons from Georgia. The  next month and a half will be needed for the production of  meager "calories" (loans, supplies) and the final three months  will be needed for the creation of its own power structures  (troops to guard the railways...). As I knew, in order to  embark upon this operation, Russia needed an "invitation"; if  not from parliament (naturally, they would not be able to get it  from parliament) and if not from the head of state (the head of  state would never take such a direct step), at any rate, from  some kind of elite group of 200-300 persons. The so-called  proletariat is no longer suitable for such a thing as it was in  1921. That needed a clever elite. They have been unable to  muster such a group, not because there are not 200-300  unscrupulous people in Georgia, but because this potential group  of unscrupulous people has the ability to make minor forecasts.  They know what to expect by taking such a step. As can be  seen, they [Russia] have abandoned such a move and have started  to take direct action. I think that what is happening is state  terrorism; only, the state concerned is not Georgia but a  neighboring one that has countless agents in Georgia. Your  newspaper has dealt with this issue in Irakli Batiashvili's  [former head of the Information and Intelligence Service]  article [in the issue of 8 February].</p>

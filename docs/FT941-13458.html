			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / International Company News: Saab 'ready for talks' with Volvo Saab Automobile is ready to discuss co-operation projects with Volvo, its rival Swedish car maker which last month scrapped a plan to merge with France's Renault, Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, Saab chief executive, said yesterday. He said he was open for discussion on common development and production of car components, pointing out in an interview with a Swedish news agency that the two companies already shared a number of component suppliers in Sweden. Mr Butler-Wheelhouse, a Briton, said he had spoken to Mr Lennart Jeansson, a senior Volvo executive and former head of car operations, about the possibility of working together on 'a range of things. That is no problem'. He added that he would like to meet Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo chief executive, 'as soon as possible so that we can get to know each other'. The interview was quickly seized upon by Swedish media as a potentially significant overture from Saab that could bring the two Swedish manufacturers closer together. But officials at both Volvo and Saab, which is jointly owned by General Motors of the US and Sweden's Saab-Scania, played down Mr Butler-Wheelhouse's remarks.</p>

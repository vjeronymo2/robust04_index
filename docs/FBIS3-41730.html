			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with Nikolay Vladimirovich Shestopalov, </F> administrative chief, State Sanitary-Epidemiological Service,  State Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, by  Lydiya Kudinova; place and date of interview not given: ``When  it Rains, it Pours'']    [Text] An outbreak of cholera in Kazakhstan and its  importation into Moscow, anthrax in Rostov, tick-borne  encephalitis in Voronezh, diphtheria in most large cities, and  an even wider geography of dysentery, salmonellosis,  tuberculosis and pediculosis. Diseases which were a rarity just  a few years ago have now increased in frequency, and this cannot  but be alarming, since after all, these are infectious,  dangerous illnesses. Some of them are acquiring epidemic  proportions, as is evidenced by statistics of the State  Committee for Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight. While in 8  months of last year only 1,801 persons caught diphtheria in  Russia, in the same period of this year there have been as many  as 5,888 cases, including 1,459 children. Since the beginning of  the year 254 persons have died. Dysentery morbidity grew from  73,628 cases to 89,238. The number of syphilis patients almost  tripled in comparison with last year--there are 25,599 of them.  Of 194,833 gonorrhea patients registered in 8 months of this  year, 1,601 are children up to 14 years of age. And even  pediculosis--ordinary lousiness, which threatens typhus--has  gone beyond the 181,000 mark. These, by the way, are only the  cases that have been recorded by the sanitary-epidemiological  service, while in actual fact the infections may be much more  widespread.    It is clear that all of these outbreaks, foci and epidemics  are not the result of the good life. Nikolay Vladimirovich  Shestopalov, the administrative chief of the State  Sanitary-Epidemiological Service of the State Committee for  Sanitary-Epidemiological Oversight, provides a concrete  explanation for the causes of the country's epidemic danger.  [Shestopalov]The gates of neighboring and distant  countries have been flung wide open, and the number of people  crossing the federation's borders, including from countries in  which cholera is a problem, has increased considerably. I am  referring to people on business, commercial and tourist trips.  In addition many refugees, persons without a permanent place of  residence and vagrants spending the nights in terminals, cellars  and attics have appeared. Such a backdrop favors the spread of  infections.    People busy with what they believe to be the more important  problems of survival have become less responsible about their  own health, and they are not taking reasonable precautions  against infections. Public health in general and the  sanitary-epidemiological service in particular do not have  enough resources for normal preventive work: Because of  insufficient and late financing we are unable to carry out all  of the necessary measures fully--medical checkups, analyses,  disinfection, vaccination etc. But speaking in general,  political, economic and social crises inevitably lead to  complication of the epidemic situation in any society undergoing  periods of change, and what we observe in our country today  confirms this.  [Kudinova]That's true, and if we recall history,  beginning with the ``childhood of mankind,'' or the Age of  Antiquity, epidemics, or ``mory'' as they were referred to in  the distant past, always accompanied upheavals in a state. They  were viewed in cultures of different peoples and centuries in  the same way--as the vengeance and punishment of the gods, as  ``divine punishment.'' Naturally the mechanisms of monitoring  and curtailing the spread of infection can no longer work well  in connection with economic devastation, but could it also be  that the defense mechanisms of the human body also break down?  After all, pathogenic viruses and microbes exist in stable  periods of history as well, but they don't always evoke massive  epidemic disease.  [Shestopalov]If we're talking about the laws by which  epidemics arise, we should recall the well known physiologist  Selye, who justified the theory of stress. Stress is the body's  natural defense reaction to an external effect, as a rule a  response to a situation differing from normal. Stress mobilizes  the body's defensive forces. But stress has its antipode as  well--distress. This is excessive, over-the-line stress, which  lasts abnormally long and which ultimately results in inhibition  of defensive forces. The economic and political instability of  recent years, the lack of social protections for the population,  the decrease in standard of living, local wars and conflicts in  different places in our country, uncertainty in tomorrow--aren't  these enough reasons for distress? The immunity of the people is  suppressed, there is no barrier to diseases, and consequently  the individual easily catches ailments to which he is exposed,  and infections he encounters.  [Kudinova]Distress is still present, and obviously it  is threatening us with epidemics of even greater scale, since  after all, judging from your statistics, morbidity is growing.  What are sanitary-epidemiological oversight services doing to  keep the situation from getting out of control?  [Shestopalov]In order to carry out preventive work to  the fullest, we are trying to preserve the structure and  function of our services to the maximum, although this is  requiring colossal effort: There is nothing with which to pay  for gasoline, electric power and building rent, and there is not  enough money to acquire instruments, reagents, nutrient media  and equipment. We appealed to the government, and it supported  us: Local bodies of government were asked to allocate resources  as a separate item in support of regional and local or municipal  programs for supporting sanitary and epidemiological well-being.  These programs focus on different things: In some areas,  treatment of drinking water, in others, inspection of food  products, in still others, massive preventive vaccination, and  so on.    We also received permission to use, for the needs of our  service, from 50 to 100 percent of fines we impose on officials  and legal entities guilty of violating public health and  epidemiological regulations. Moreover despite the fact that this  is an extremely complex period, and perhaps the not most  suitable one, we are nonetheless reorganizing our service in  order to make it more responsive to the needs of society. We are  establishing special interregional centers--toxicological,  chemical and microbiological, which will make it possible to  concentrate our modest possibilities and fulfill a large volume  of analyses and measurements at a higher level of quality. Had  it not been for all of these measures, the epidemic situation in  the country would have been worse.    Unfortunately, we are practically unable to influence  diseases categorized as social diseases--tuberculosis,  pediculosis, venereal. As we know, they increase in incidence  unavoidably in territories where the economic and social  situation is unstable, where ``morality is on the decline.'' As  an example the statistics on gonorrhea--a disease that is  suffered as a rule by people in their time of development and  youth--are only the tip of the iceberg: Many often treat  themselves with home remedies, without seeing a doctor, causing  the ailment to assume its chronic form and dooming themselves  and others to infertility. I can't agree with what is happening  today in our country in the area of ``sex education.'' My mind  rebels at calling this a civilized development.  [Kudinova]What can each person do for him or herself  to reduce the risk of catching infectious diseases?  [Shestopalov]Save for observing the elementary rules  of personal hygiene, there is nothing that I can propose. Wash  your hands before eating and after going to the bathroom, don't  use perishable food products after their shelf life has expired,  don't buy food products, especially meat, from people you don't  know. When you buy meat (and other food products as well), do so  only after making sure that it had passed veterinary inspection.    And of course, diphtheria immunizations are a doubtless  requirement. This dangerous infection will remain prominent for  a sufficiently longer time. The sole effective defense against  it is immunization. Every immunization is mandatorily preceded  by an examination by a doctor, it is carried out only with a  disposable syringe, and the vaccine satisfies the standards of  the World Health Organization fully, such that immunization is  absolutely safe to life. Even if a person falls ill due to  particular features of his body, he will not die of diphtheria,  and he will not suffer complications. Nor should immunizations  against tick-borne encephalitis be refused in regions where this  is necessary, and at the slightest suspicion of a tick bite a  doctor should be seen at once.  [Kudinova]Nikolay Vladimirovich, you noted that urban  residents suffer more from infectious diseases. There is no  doubt that where population density is higher, the frequency of  contacts is greater and it is much easier to get infected. But  let's clarify this. The medical service has traditionally been  more poorly organized in the countryside. Could it be that  public health oversight is worse, and that this is what makes  the statistics look better?  [Shestopalov]Rural inhabitants are better protected  against epidemics for objective reasons: After all, they are  almost completely oblivious to phenomena such as refugees,  vagrants and persons without permanent places of residence. All  such people carry lice, with all of the ensuing consequences.  And in contrast from the urban way of life, the traditions of  the way of life and diet of the rural population have not  changed. Such healthy conservatism keeps them safe.  [Kudinova]Are you saying that the only way we can  overcome the epidemic danger is to stabilize the situation in  the country?  [Shestopalov]Precisely so, you can never separate it  from politics.</p>

Emphasis is placed on the need for preparedness, pre-planning,  and delineation of duties and responsibilities of the different  components of the system. Only then can the avaible human and  material resources be utilized to the fullest for saving lifes,  providing adequate medical care, and preserving an acceptable  level of public health services. Without such planning a  coordinated, timely and rational response is virtually  impossible.</p>

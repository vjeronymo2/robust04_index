			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Roundup: Suzhou Industrial Park Expected To Blaze Trail in </F> China's Market Economy"]    [Text] Nanjing, June 25 (XINHUA) -- Suzhou -- known as the  "Oriental Venice" -- in east China's Jiangsu Province, is bound  to blaze a trail in China's switch to a market economy if it  makes a success of setting up a Sino-Singapore industrial park.    The project, scheduled for completion early next century, is  the country's current biggest foreign cooperative item.    "This is a new mode of cooperation between two governments,  which has never been seen before," said Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing during a recent tour of the city.    "It is a strategic step, rather than a commercial measure,"  he said.    The establishment of special economic zones, open coastal  cities, economic and technology development zones in the coastal  areas and the opening up of border trade have greatly  facilitated China's economic development and opening further to  the outside world.    But China is not resting on its laurels.    In November last year, when Jiang Zemin, Chinese president  and general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, met with  Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong at Seattle, in the  United States, Jiang said that the Chinese Government regarded  Singapore's experience in developing its country as important,  and valued Sino-Singapore cooperation.    He highly commended the joint efforts to build and develop  the Suzhou industrial park, which "will create a new mode in  Sino- Singapore cooperation."    Zhang Xinsheng, mayor of Suzhou, said the project is  characterized by drawing a great deal of international capital  and Singapore's experience in combining economic operation with  public administration.    "Construction of the Suzhou industrial park will be in line  with Singapore's experience in urban planning, management and  social insurance," Zhang said.    So far, the two countries have set up a joint development  company to take charge of the development of the project, open  bidding and to raise funds.    The two governments have set up the Suzhou Industrial Park  Joint Coordinating Council, chaired by Chinese Vice-Premier Li  Lanqing and Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.    The council, which has two working committees, is  responsible  for major issues regarding the park.    According to the agreement concluded by the two governments,  the Suzhou Industrial Park Administrative Committee will play an  independent operational role in line with Chinese law and  regulations and the requirements of the socialist market economy.    These organizations are now operating smoothly.</p>

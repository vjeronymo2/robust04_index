General Aidid meanwhile continued negotiations in the Kenyan  capital, Nairobi, with representatives of the Group of 12  factions led by Ali Mahdi that oppose him, Aidid's aides said  here.    The United Nations, heavily criticised for getting  peacekeepers embroiled in clashes with Aidid's militia that cost  the lives of more than 70 UN soldiers, was officially involved  in neither the Nairobi, nor the Mogadishu talks. But Aidid has  met U.S. envoy Richard Bogosian in Nairobi, an American official  in Mogadishu said.    Ahmed Darman, a member of the central committee of Aidid's  Somali National Alliance (SNA) faction, urged the UN to arrange  another national reconciliation conference to bring Somalia's  warring factions together. But he said the UN should stop  meddling in negotiations and leave the Somalis to work out a  settlement without outside interference. "We hope the Nairobi  talks will pave the way for a national reconciliation conference  which might be held in Mogadishu," Darman told reporters.    About 175 members of Aidid's Habr Gedir clan and Ali Mahdi's  Abgal group held a second day of closed-door talks at the Kah  Hotel in Ali Mahdi's north Mogadishu enclave Friday. Chaired by  a prominent Islamic leader, the Imam of Hirab, the meeting  brought together traditional clan chiefs, the "Ugaasis,"  religious leaders, military officers and leaders of youth  groups, conference officials said. The negotiators were  expected to announce the outcome of the talks, which were  preceded by a month of informal consultations, when they end  Saturday [15 January].    Senior UN officials who were privately skeptical about  previous attempts to broker agreements among Somalia's 15  warring clan-based factions said they sensed a greater  willingness by the warlords to lay down their arms. "They are  under pressure from their own rank and file," said one UN  official. "The warlords themselves have done well out of the  fighting, but the fighters are tired."    Aidid's faction is estimated to have lost hundreds of men in  four months of fighting with U.S. and UN forces in Mogadishu  before the UN dropped efforts to arrest him in October.    In other developments, a UN spokesman said a Somali had been  shot dead during an anti-UN protest in a coastal town south of  Mogadishu this week. UN officials had earlier said no one was  killed and denied reports on pro-Aidid Radio Mogadishu that two  people had died when a demonstration outside a residence of the  UN Operation in Somalia (UNOSOM) in Merca, about 60 kilometres  (35 miles) southwest of here, turned violent. "UNOSOM guards  fired in the air. The demonstrators fired back, and in so doing  killed a Somali," said UN spokesman Major Tim McDavitt. The  UNOSOM guards were Somalis, he said.    In another attack on the UN, a residence of the UN High  Commissioner for Refugees in Buale, southern Somalia, came under  rifle-propelled grenade and small arms fire for several hours on  Thursday evening. There were no casualties. The attackers were  believed to be bandits, McDavitt said.    Five Indian soldiers were wounded earlier the same day in an  ambush 70 kilometres (40 miles) south of Buale, just outside  Jilib.    Five U.S. congressmen were expected in Mogadishu on Saturday  for a brief visit, U.S. spokesman Colonel Steve Rausch said.  The delegation leader is Representative John Murtha, chairman  of the House Defence Appropriations Committee, a Democrat from  Pennsylvania.    The 5,563 American soldiers in Somalia are to leave by March  31, but Washington may keep a Marine force offshore.</p>

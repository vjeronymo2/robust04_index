			<p><P> January 10, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: MOVIES  </P> <P> The "Best Picture" Oscar that producer Michael Todd won in 1956 for "Around The  World in 80 Days" will go on the auction block next month, the owner of a  Hollywood memorabilia shop said Monday. It will be the seventh such statuette  auctioned by Collector's Showcase, said store owner Malcolm Willits, who  acknowledges that such transactions are controversial. "Selling your Oscar is a  little like selling your child," he said. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts  and Sciences, which annually presents the Oscars, frowns on the auctions.  Academy spokesman Bruce Davis said, "We find this a very meloncholy turn of  events." The Academy feels that auctions commercialize the award. The Todd  Oscar could bring as much as $40,000. The six previous Academy Awards that  Willits has sold brought an average of $10,000 each. Willits' usually gets the  Oscars from relatives who have inherited them, and in most cases, the recipient  is dead. Willit recently auctioned for $17,715 the 1941 set decoration Oscar  given for "How Green Was My Valley." In March, an Oscar for "The Diary of Anne  Frank" (given to Lyle Wheeler and George W. Davis for black and white art  direction) is due to be auctioned.  </P></p>

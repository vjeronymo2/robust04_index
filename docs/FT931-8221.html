			<p>930220 FT  20 FEB 93 / Rocard steps over the Socialist debris to eye presidential prize MR Michel Rocard, the former French prime minister, showed a keen eye for history when he chose Tours, the city where the original French Socialist party was dissolved in 1920, as the scene of his assault on the party of today. His appeal on Wednesday night for a 'political big bang' amounted to a 'funeral oration' for the party, according to Liberation, bible of the French left. In his new universe, the left would jettison old-style socialism and join forces with ecologists, human rights activists and other kindred spirits in an 'open movement' to lead France into the next century. Such a call could not have come at a worse time for the socialists. Battered by scandal and gloomy economic news, they are braced for a bruising defeat in next month's parliamentary elections. But for Mr Rocard the timing could not have been better. He is concerned not with the present election campaign - he is struggling even to save his own seat - but with his prospects in the 1995 presidential election. His speech was partly to breathe new life into the floundering left, but partly to distance himself, and his presidential aspirations, from the socialists' problems. The socialists have been struggling ever since Mr Rocard was replaced as prime minister by Mrs Edith Cresson in 1991. Regional elections last spring, when the party was hammered by ecologists and the National Front, showed the electorate's disaffection with the political establishment. The left should also have been warned by the election defeats of the British Labour party and the Italian socialists. Despite these danger signs the socialists have entered the present campaign with the same tired policies. One explanation is the crisis of confidence in the party, which is weary after a decade of government and a stream of scandals. Not least of these is the Aids blood trial which has haunted Mr Laurent Fabius, appointed first secretary last year with a mandate to modernise French socialism. Another factor is Mr Fabius' political mentor, President Francois Mitterrand. He resurrected the Socialist party in 1971 and told its adherents on TV last week to strengthen the party rather than abandon it for a Rocard-type new alliance. The idea of a new alliance has been circulating in the left for some time. Mr Rocard is an astute politician who took care to warn his peers before dropping his Tours bombshell. So far most senior socialists have responded positively, as has Mr Brice Lalonde, former socialist environment minister and founder of the Generation Ecologie movement. The Tours speech was only the beginning. It will take more than such a 'funeral oration' to bury a complex institution like the French Socialist party. But Mr Rocard has the advantage of representing, to ambitious French politicians, the future, whereas the septuagenarian President Mitterrand is fading into the past.</p>

			<p>Lula   <F P=102>   PY0106015194 Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO in Portuguese 2107 GMT  31 May 94 </F>  <F P=103> PY0106015194 </F> <F P=104>  Sao Paulo AGENCIA ESTADO </F> <F P=105>  Portuguese </F> BFN     [Text] Brasilia, 31 May (AE) -- The so-called progressive  faction of the Catholic Church will celebrate on 7 September the  "National Day To Pray for Brazil -- Lula for President." This  faction of the church incluudes bishops such as Tomas Balduino,  of Goias Velho; Pedro Casaldaliga, from Araguaia in Mato Grosso  State; Augusto Rocha, of Picos in Piaui State; and Friar  Leonardo Boff and Friar Betto.    During Lula's debate, which was held today within the  framework of his electoral campaign, Friar Betto reported on the  national pro-Lula day celebration. He said that the day will be  celebrated in various forms, and in the largest possible number  of parishes countrywide. He added: "There could be prayers,  rosaries, marches, liturgical celebrations, and masses  supporting Lula's candidacy." Lula met Brasilia and Goias State  representatives of the Catholic Church.    Friar Betto said that as the Brazilian Catholic Church has  decided to give preferential attention to the problems of the  destitute Brazilians, it is clear that it must support someone  like Lula. He said: "To support the election of a worker who  was born poor is consistent with giving preferential attention  to the problems of the most destitute people." The Catholic  Church will celebrate the pro-Lula day on 7 September, on the  anniversary of Brazilian independence.</p>

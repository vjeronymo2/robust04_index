			<p>BFN     [Text] According to an ATHENS NEWS AGENCY dispatch, the  Orthodox Patriarch's quarters at Fanari in Istanbul was attacked  last night with two Molotov cocktails. According to the  dispatch, at 2200 [1900 GMT] last night, unidentified people  threw the two Molotov cocktails from the northern wall into the  yard between the central building and library. Patriarch  employees dealt with the fire before it caused any extensive  damage. The fire department did not need to intervene. Turkish  police are investigating the case. Similar incidents have  occurred at least four times in the past couple of months but no  effective safety measures have been taken at the Patriarch's  quarters.</p>

			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> DOCTORS WARN OF RISKS IN LESSONS  </P> <P> Though taking children younger than 2 out for a swim can be great recreation  and fun, local pediatricians agree that there are risks, even for those who  have had lessons.  </P> <P> Most dangerous is the false sense of security some parents experience after a  young child has undergone instruction.  </P> <P> "Lessons shouldn't take the place of vigilance," said Dr. Mark Freedenberg, who  practices in Oxnard and Ventura.  </P> <P> "Parents think that if there's an accident, they can relax and the child will  dog paddle to the side. Some children have a natural diving reflex when they  get submerged, but not all of them hold their breath."  </P> <P> Though Freedenberg enrolled his two children in swimming classes at 1 year old,  he questions whether any learning actually takes place.  </P> <P> "They may, in a supervised environment, go from one adult to another adult, but  if they fall in the water and it's a surprise, it may be different. And they  may fall in head-first or backward."  </P> <P> Harvey Harris, a pediatrician in Ventura, said even infants and toddlers who  learn to handle themselves in the water have no sense of safety.  </P> <P> "They may have some experience, but they don't have judgment," he said.  </P> <P> "They get their face in the water and they don't know that they should pull it  out," Harris said.  </P> <P> Young children also have trouble remembering what they learn.  </P> <P> Marjean Tinoco and Nancy Garrett, both instructors of swimming classes for  infants and toddlers, said that continued time in the water is important after  the initial instruction.  </P> <P> Pediatrician Donn Browne of Ventura said in most cases children can retain the  knowledge when they are in the water once a week.

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Angel Paez] </F>   [Text] The Shining Path [SL] cells in Europe have also  become divided over Abimael Guzman Reinoso's decision to reach a  peace agreement with the government. One group, headed by Luis  Arce Borja and Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, is against a dialogue  with the government, while the other, headed by a close relative  of Guzman, is in favor of laying down arms.    The Sol Committee in Paris, in a bulletin which it started  publishing recently, confirms its obedience to the self-styled  "President Gonzalo" with the argument that "the great masters of  the proletariat (also) carried out negotiations and signed peace  agreements," and accused a "small black group" of questioning  the SL leader's decisions.    According to the publication -- which unlike EL DIARIO  INTERNACIONAL, whose editor is Luis Arce Borja, does not  indicate the name of its editor -- this opposition group is  "made up of a handful of opportunists who have banded together  in a crazy and heated attempt to divide and create confusion in  lashing out against the peace agreement proposed by our  leadership."    Apparently Luis Arce Borja, who lives in Brussels, and  Adolfo  Olaechea Cahuas, who heads another "Sol Peru Committee" in  London, form the "small black group."    Arce and Olaechea have both stated through their  publications  that the peace agreement being negotiated between Abimael Guzman  Reinoso and President Alberto Fujimori is a great hoax, as they  maintain that the letters were not written by the SL leader, nor  is it he who appears in the videos, but rather an actor who  looks very much like him.    But the basis for Arce and Olaechea's argument is that there  isn't a single note from Guzman explaining the grounds for the  proposal for a dialogue with the enemy. Arce even created an  "interview" with Guzman, fabricated from old interviews and  documents, in which he is made to say that an agreement with the  regime is unfeasible.    In this regard the Sol Peru Committee in Paris states that  those who maintain "with great insolence that President  Gonzalo's letters and his proposal for a peace agreement are  false and an invention have no arguments left in view of the  overwhelming truth, (because) they will have to argue against  2,500 prisoners of war from throughout the country who have  declared through a communique that `they will not take a single  step without President Gonzalo's guidance,' also repudiating the  provocation and black campaign against the proposed peace  agreement."    The Sol Peru Committee in Paris refers to the documents  issued last December by SL members held under arrest in Miguel  Castro Castro prison in Canto Grande, which endorse Guzman's  letters to President Alberto Fujimori and uphold "the new  decision and definition to strive for a peace agreement,  (because) the people need it."    The document drafted by the SL members in France -- which  clearly refers to the groups abroad that have sided with Oscar  Ramirez Durand, "Comrade Feliciano," who is against the peace  agreement and acknowledges Guzman's leadership only until the  second SL Congress, which is when "Feliciano" will allegedly  take the reins of the organization -- asserts that "the  opportunists and alleged `upholders' of the peoples' war who  have settled in Europe will not be able to shout (...) that  2,500 prisoners of war of the Communist Party of Peru are  "crazy," "stoned," or have been declared under "psychological  pressure," and less still that they `have sided with Fujimori's  government.'"    The document goes on to state: "They will have to bite their  dirty tongues and swallow the disgusting things they have said,"  "(because) one (cannot) label fellow comrades with renowned  devotion as people who have `surrendered' or as `repentants,'  which is how the black campaign against the peace agreement  intends to describe them: Maria Pantoja, Martha Huatay, and  Angelica Salas Osman Morote, who met with President Gonzalo, and  (Comrade) Miriam (Elena Iparraguirre Revoredo) have passed on  President Gonzalo's instructions."    The bulletin is more precise: "(The members of the `small  black group') will not be able to direct their disgusting  charges against clean militants such as Edmundo Cox, Sybila  Arredondo, (Victor) Zavala Catano, Maritza Garrido Lecca, etc.,  with the purpose of creating division in the work of the  Communist Party of Peru abroad."  Cox Beuzeville ia the author of a letter to Colonel Gabino  Cajahuanca, director of the Castro Castro prison, in which he  explains his efforts to convince his comrades to struggle for  the peace agreement. He writes: "My commitment is full, total,  unconditional, public, decided, and definite, to achieve what  everybody needs: the peace agreement."    The bulletin of the Sol Peru Committee in Paris published  the  letter from Cox Beuzeville and the prisoners of Canto Grande  advocating obedience to the new guidelines of Guzman Reinoso.  The letter says: "We strongly and unavoidably adhere to our  leader, to our dear and respected President Gonzalo, with  firmness and determination for the new great decision: the  struggle for the peace agreement!"    In these terms the SL cells in Paris show their total  disagreement with the position taken by Olaechea Cahuas and Arce  Borja, known for their SL propaganda, who are at large and under  process of extradition.    The two, through DIARIO INTERNACIONAL, contend that  "agreeing  with Fujimori's `letters' means disregarding the general  political guideline of the revolution established by Abimael  Guzman, and denying the validity of the party's program, the  strategic objective of which is the seizure of power throughout  the entire country and the creation of the Popular Republic of  Peru."    The two leaders also said that "the people's war cannot be  negotiated, and there cannot be any dialogue with this  reactionary and criminal government. The decision made by the  revolutionaries is to destroy the old state and finish off the  Armed Forces and the police" and "these objectives cannot be  achieved with deals or `peace talks.' The class struggle cannot  be auctioned off."    This position is the same as that held by those who publish  EL DIARIO in Lima. Last January EL DIARIO published a  communique from the "Committee of Relatives of Political  Prisoners, War Prisoners, and Those Missing of Peru" attacking  the SL leaders who are in favor of the peace agreement. The  communique says: "We raise our voices and belligerent souls to  denounce, condemn, and reject with the deep hate of the classes  the sinister actions of that handful of known and proven  capitulators, informers, and cowards who would not sacrifice  their lives, the execrable revisionist bitches (...) who have  been mobilized through different prisons of the country to  spread the so-called peace agreement, openly crying out for  capitulation, reporting everyone, and taking refuge in the  repentance law."    This is the combat line of Oscar Ramirez Durand, Comrade  Feliciano, which consists in asserting that the entire campaign  for the peace agreement is a plot to destroy the Communist Party  of Peru-Shining Path, PCP-SL, to put an end to the "people's  war" and mainly kill Guzman. "(This sector) persists alone in  the counterrevolutionary hoax within the premeditated,  treacherous, and furious plan to murder President Gonzalo, thus  uselessly attempting to spread capitulation among our heroic  people, liquidate the party, and destroy the people's war."    And in the recent issue of EL DIARIO, February-March,  justifying the attack against the Metro commercial center and  the fire at the Callao Naval Base, among other actions, the  subversives say that the attacks "show in fact that the people's  war continues unavoidably."    But the Shining Path leaders of the Sol Peru Committee in  Paris say that the sabotage is an action of the PCP-SL with the  objective of demonstrating its capacity for negotiation, carried  out based on "the new great decision and definition" which is  the struggle for the peace agreement.    "What would be the purpose of a `peace agreement' in Peru?"  asks Arce Borja in an article in EL DIARIO INTERNACIONAL. He  answers: "The only ones who will benefit from a `peace  agreement' are exclusively the enemies of the Peruvian people,  mainly the imperialist forces."    According to the Sol Peru Committee in Paris, Arce Borja and  Olaechea Cahuas would be the "opportunists and sellouts who are  carrying out a dirty campaign with the so-called pretext of  supporting the people's war and attacking our leadership. They  are reactionary dark leaders whom the people will know how to  punish."    LA REPUBLICA was able to contact by telephone a spokesman  for  the Shining Path cells in France, who only confirmed the  authenticity of the bulletin.    LA REPUBLICA also talked with Adolfo Olaechea Cahuas, SL  chief in England and head of another Sol Peru Committee in  London, who acknowledged as real the French bulletin and  identified its writers. Maximiliano Duran Araujo, brother-in-law  of Osman Morote Barrionuevo and brother of Teresa [Juana Teresa  Durand Araujo de Morote, aka Comrade Doris], is an SL leader on  the Central Committee who has been living in France for years,  and is currently in hiding.    We asked Olaechea if he was the one.    He said: No, it is someone else. A relative of Guzman.</p>

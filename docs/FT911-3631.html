			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Kohl backs Berlin as new seat of government CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl yesterday pledged his support for Berlin as Germany's future seat of government. He said a move to Berlin, already the official capital, would need 10 to 15 years to complete and that Bonn should retain a number of important ministries, including defence. The chancellor's surprise decision will boost Berlin's chances of again becoming the seat of government. Bonn, Before his announcement, Bonn was thought to be favoured by a slim majority of members in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, and by most of the west German Lander (states). It was decided yesterday that the Bundestag will conduct a free vote on the issue on June 20. The Bundesrat, the upper house, will vote the following day. Mr Kohl, trying to regain the political initiative after his party's defeat in a state election on Sunday, said a government in Berlin would be in a better position to help overcome the division between the two parts of Germany. The announcement may help to boost Mr Kohl's flagging popularity in east Germany where many voters equate a pro-Berlin view with a vote of confidence in the east. Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and leader of the pro-Bonn, Bavarian-based, Christian Social Union, said he regretted the announcement and insisted that he had no money available to finance the move, costed at anything between DM5bn (Pounds 1.7bn) and DM100bn. Mr Waigel said he would have preferred a compromise, dividing functions between the two cities. Land claim quashed, Page 3</p>

			<p><P> May 19, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GERRYMANDERING IN CALIFORNIA AND MERITS OF PROPS. 118, 119  </P> <P> Probably one of the most important votes on the June 5 ballot will be  Proposition 119.  </P> <P> A yes vote will stop the politicians from insulating themselves from the voters  by drawing safe districts, will create a commission to draw fair boundaries for  legislative districts, will give freedom-loving Californians an opportunity to  vote out of office politicians with whom they disagree.  </P> <P> Proposition 119 was written for the people for a change, not for the benefit of  the politicians. For this reason you will find many politicians are working  hard and putting a lot of money behind defeating it.  </P> <P> It's time the voting public took control of our government. Let them know they  are working for us.  </P> <P> DODIE MURSET  </P> <P> Temple City  </P></p>

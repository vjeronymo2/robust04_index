An INTERFAX  correspondent reports from the republican capital of Groznyy  that opposition units remain in the barracks and are holding no  exercises at the moment.    The Chechen presidential office told INTERFAX that it was a  "gross provocation by certain forces in the Russian leadership  trying to disrupt the dialogue between Russia and Chechnya which  has just begun." All this is happening on the eve of the  Chechen government delegation's departure for Moscow for the  bilateral interstate talks, the same sources said.    Meanwhile, Chechen President Dzhokhar Dudayev had his usual  busy day on Monday. This morning he visited an officers'  college in Groznyy.</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / N Sea gas field project approved The government yesterday approved one of the biggest offshore gas developments since 1990, Robert Corzine writes. The Department of Trade and Industry approved British Gas's Pounds 600m plan to develop the Armada complex, which includes the Drake, Fleming and Hawkins fields in the central North Sea, close to the Norwegian sector. The fields, which will come on stream in late 1997, will produce 350m cu ft of gas a day, about 4 per cent of the UK's requirements. British Gas, one of the developers, will take the bulk of the output. National Power will take 100m cu ft a day for a variety of power stations. Yorkshire Energy, a subsidiary of Yorkshire Electricity and another Armada owner, will be entitled to take up to 30m cu ft a day for sale to households when the domestic gas market is opened to competition in 1996.</p>

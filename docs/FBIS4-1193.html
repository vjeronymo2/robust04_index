			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lorraine Braid] </F>   [Text] Cape Town April 25 SAPA -- Members of the public  should feel assured of effective protection while voting in the  election, State President F. W. de Klerk said on Monday [25  April] morning. "Contingency plans are in place for the  election. We have high manpower levels and we will not allow  the right wing or anyone else to disrupt the process," he said.    Mr de Klerk, on his way from an hour-long cabinet meeting to  a National Party caucus meeting before the special parliamentary  session, was reacting to questions about the car bomb explosion  in central Johannesburg on Sunday and its possible effect on the  election. "We have achieved virtually full inclusiveness and  are now dealing with a small handful of radicals on the right  and the left. We have maximum security deployed across the  country. This type of situation does offer a risk, but I can  assure the public of effecting protection while voting."    It is believed the brief cabinet meeting was used to discuss  the possibility of amnesty for security forces, the car bomb  blast and the events in Ulundi over the weekened where several  people were killed while putting up election posters.    Mr de Klerk said no decision had yet been taken on the  indemnity, but added the cabinet would be meeting again later on  Monday.</p>

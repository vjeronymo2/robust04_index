			<p>921003 FT  03 OCT 92 / Red flags celebrate return to tradition AFTER the glitz and electric guitar riffs that disconcerted shadow cabinet members last year, Labour yesterday went back to its roots, with brass bands and The Red Flag, the party anthem. Red flags were waved by an enthusiastic crowd and Auld Lang Syne was sung twice. The conference finale was not the only old-fashioned ingredient of yesterday's proceedings. A podium speaker asserted that: 'Capitalism contains within it the seeds of its own destruction.' There was a motion calling for policies based on 'honest socialist principles'. Mr John Evans, the conference chairman, felt moved to proclaim that he was 'as proud of my trade union heritage' as any Conservative was of his public school. Even Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, giving the day's keynote speech in powder-puff pink, played to the traditional mood in asserting 'how much the work done at local level matters'. She denounced the government's lack of competence and honesty, quoting from The Daily Telegraph - not the party's usual choice of house journal. The party authorities drew the line on nostalgia when a lilac-shirted Mr Ted Knight, the former Lambeth council leader, rushed the stage to interject a point of order. He was refused a hearing and was threatened with ejection. That incident apart, the Smith-Beckett ticket was content to preside regally over proceedings. The conference had been marginalised with the approval of a new policymaking mechanism which will concentrate more power in the hands of the ultra-loyal national executive committee.</p>

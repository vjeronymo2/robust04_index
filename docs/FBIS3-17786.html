			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev by </F> unidentified correspondent in Almaty on 29 March; from the  "Vesti" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Correspondent] How do you assess those questions  that are still to be solved in Russian-Kazakh relations? We  have signed about two dozen various agreements and treaties.  What still lies ahead? There are bottlenecks, complicated  areas, etc., but there are prospects, there are things where  further efforts -- very serious ones -- need to be undertaken.  What spheres and areas do you see in this direction?    [Nazarbayev] Since our big treaty, as it is being called,  the  Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Aid signed between  Kazakhstan and Russia in 1992, where everything that we have  accomplished today was written, it may be considered that this  is the concrete development of the big agreement that was  ratified by both parliaments. Therefore, these 24 documents --  23 documents -- which we signed, they give concrete expression  to it. I am particularly pleased, for example, that Boris  Nikolayevich Yeltsin and I agreed to set up a joint economic  commission that will be headed, from both our and the Russian  side, by deputy prime ministers who will in turn take the chair  every half-year, first in Moscow and then in Alma-Ata [Almaty].  They will be obliged, every quarter and every half-year, to  report to the governments and presidents on how these accords  are being fulfilled.    An exhaustive number of documents were signed; for example,  [the document] on defense cooperation does not require further  development; on Baykonur, we came to a final decision on this  question; on deepening economic cooperation, we still have to  solve questions of customs space and on duty quotas between our  states, setting up joint industrial-finance groups; on joint  enterprises, the shares of Kazakh enterprises may be acquired by  Russian enterprises, and vice-versa. Well, on these things the  government has been given a period of one month in which  specific agreements must be signed. But life being what it is,  an agreement must be put into operation, the mechanism must be  applied; certain problems may arise that we will tackle.    Other matters were left to one side and that is why I  invited  Russian President Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin to Alma-Ata. He  accepted my invitation and I think that it [the meeting] will  take place in the summer, and we will develop these relations  still further.    [Correspondent] Nursultan Abishevich, a very important  dimension, not only in bilateral relations, but also for every  state, is the human dimension. The priority of the individual,  the priority of the rights of the individual, and freedoms --  this is indisputable. Today, we are striving to push forward to  this, although it is complicated both for Russia and for  Kazakhstan, indeed for any country. It has its problems. How  did you see interaction in this direction -- not only in terms  of bilateral efforts but also within the CIS framework, and  perhaps to move more widely, after all our country [Russia] and  Kazakhstan are in many ways linked with the CSCE, and in many  ways we belong both to Europe and to Asia, and this sense of two  continents, how can this, let us say, take shape in terms of  forms, of tools of interaction in human terms?    [Nazarbayev] I understand what you mean. There used to be  one state -- the Soviet Union. It split up into what are now 15  states, whose people used to live in one homeland, one country,  and have found themselves the citizens of 15 states. But it  would not be correct to say that the people do not have  problems, because people are concerned, people are worried.  Previously, there was no problem about where one's son lived,  where one's father lived, where one was coming and going. Now  all these problems have arisen. We really are faced with  problems of the Russian people living in all of the Republics.  And questions have arisen of the 1 million Kazakhs living in  Russia. So, if you are speaking of our human relations, I  believe that this is one of our main questions. And in the  memorandum on citizenship that we signed -- and I would like to  answer the first part of your question and then move on to the  other part -- we said that there should be special  interrelations between Kazakhstan and Russia, as I have always  said. We did not make these up, they developed through history,  and to pass on these relations which we have had to our children  and grandchildren is a task for the politicians -- for us.    Therefore, we said that if someone in Kazakhstan moves to  Russia, he should be able to obtain citizenship there without  question, without any delays. If he comes back to Kazakhstan,  or a Russian decides to move to Kazakhstan permanently, he must  be able to obtain citizenship straightaway. In other words, an  individual must have freedom of choice as to where he wishes to  live. At the same time, there should be no obstacles in the way  of how he sells his house, takes away the property he has  acquired, and so on, during the period of the move. I think  that this worries people, and the most important thing is to  alleviate this concern.    Secondly, you correctly said that we are situated at the  meeting point of Europe and Asia, especially in Kazakhstan, in  the very center of Asia. Therefore, our sense of multipolarity  in our economic relations is clear because Kazakhs have, as we  know, have always belonged to the Islamic culture, although I do  not think we have such a strong sense of religion, so to speak.  Now, as in Russia, where there are about 20 million Turkic  Muslims, and 50 million Turkic Muslims live in Central Asia --  the Asian part -- therefore, it is also necessary for them to be  identified with and to seek out their historic culture and roots  in these states. Therefore, situated between China and Russia,  in the south of the Muslim world, we are trying to be  multipolar. I think -- this is my opinion -- and Russia's, too,  that to have equally effective relations, both with Europe and  Asia, this is, it seems to me, a correct policy that we are  pursuing.    [Correspondent] Thank you very much.</p>

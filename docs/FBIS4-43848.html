			<p>BFN     [Text] The opening of Nicosia International Airport and  free passage to the occupied areas is seen as a negative  prospect by 50 percent of the people, while the opening the  closed area of Famagusta is seen as positive by 45 percent.  Generally though, 58 percent of the people favor holding a  referendum on the confidence-building measures [CBM's].    These findings came to light after a pan-Cypriot public  opinion poll was carried out by AMER [Agency for Middle East  Research] between 21 April and 9 May. It was based on a random  sample of 898 persons 18 years old and over.    Eighty-five percent of the people said they had heard  something about the confidence-building measures, while the rest  had not heard anything or did not know anything about them.    Only 27 percent of the people consider the opening of  Nicosia  Airport to be positive. DISI [Democratic Rally] supporters were  the most positive, as opposed to EDEK [United Democratic Union  of Cyprus] supporters, who were the most negative, followed by  AKEL's [Restorative Party of the Working People] supporters.    The return of Varosha under UN supervision is considered  negative by 42 percent of the refugees and by 17 percent of the  non-refugees. Overall, 36 percent of the people were negative  and 19 percent said they did not know.    Asked whether there should be a referendum for acceptance of  the confidence-building measures or not, 58 percent of the  people said they are in favor, while 27 percent said the  government should decide.    Forty-four percent of the people said the  confidence-building  measures favor the Turks more than us. Only 16 percent said the  confidence-building measures will help our side; 24 percent said  the measures will help both communities; 9 percent said that  neither community will benefit from the measures; and 8 percent  said they do not know.    The views regarding the UN secretary general's statement,  that the confidence-building measures will help new generations  to get to know each other, are divided evenly, as 35 percent  agree and 35 percent disagree.    The financial effects of the implementation of the  confidence-building measures do not concern Cypriots, as 43  percent believe that things will remain the same as today, 31  percent say they do not know what will happen, 17 percent  believe things will be worse, and only 9 percent said things  will be better.    The provision for free movement of Turkish Cypriots is  considered the most alarming, as only 21 percent agree to it and  65 percent disagree. Thirty-seven percent said the  confidence-building measures should not be accepted, 31 percent  said they should be accepted and 33 percent did not answer.    Thirty-four percent are against a federal solution to the  conditions discussed today, 33 percent are in favor, and 33  percent said they do not know or did not answer.    Those supporting a federation included 38 percent of DISI  and  AKEL supporters, 36 percent of DIKO [Democratic Party], and 16  percent of EDEK supporters. Against the federation were 46  percent of EDEK supporters, 40 percent of DIKO, 32 percent of  DISI and 28 percent of AKEL supporters.</p>

			<p><P> September 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 2 SOUGHT FOR BURGLARIES IN MONROVIA  </P> <P> Police last week told residents to be on the lookout for two suspected burglars  who are believed responsible for robbing at least 18 homes since late July  while their victims were inside.  </P> <P> The so-called hot-prowlers, who have not harmed any of the occupants, are also  suspected of burglaries in Arcadia and neighboring unincorporated areas,  authorities said.  </P> <P> Monrovia Police Chief Joseph Santoro urged residents to report any suspicious  activity, but he warned against confronting the burglars, who he said may  become dangerous if they are startled or feel trapped.  </P> <P> "Hot-prowlers are among the most difficult of criminals to capture because they  specialize in quickness and stealth," Santoro said.  </P> <P> Most of the crimes have occurred between 8 p.m. and 3:30 a.m., and in almost  every case the prowler entered by taking off a screen and climbing through an  open window, police said.  </P> <P> The suspects frequently look for purses or wallets left out in plain sight, and  they usually take cash or jewelry.  </P> <P> One suspect, who has struck repeatedly in the western part of town, is  described by witnesses as a male Anglo or Latino in his 20s who has been  wearing black clothing.  </P> <P> A second suspect, a black male also in his 20s, has committed burglaries in the  southeastern and north-central areas of the city. On one occasion, he  reportedly simulated having a gun when confronted by a victim, but he never  actually revealed one, police said.  </P></p>

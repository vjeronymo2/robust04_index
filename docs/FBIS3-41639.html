Speaking after a meeting of EC finance ministers, he claimed  to have won considerable sympathy for his complaint that the  cost of a waste water treatment system accepted by Britain in  1991 had spiralled out of control.    British officials say the cost of the system has snowballed  to 10 billion pounds (about 15 billion dollars) currently, up  from an estimate of two billion pounds (three billion dollars)  in 1991.    Clarke said Britain wanted the European Commission to accept  that the project would be phased in over a longer period, to  lessen the effect on the water bills of British consumers.    But he used the issue to highlight the way in which EC  decisions often had ``unexpected economic consequences,'' and  urged that EC finance ministers be allowed in future to vet all  decisions carrying substantial costs.    Under the water treatment directive, all towns with over  10,000 people must add a third stage to the treatment of waste  water being discharged into ``sensitive areas'' such as the  ocean if seawater cannot clean it up naturally.    ``In health terms the directive is desirable,'' Clarke  admitted, but added that it was too expensive to be fully  implemented by the target date of 1998.</p>

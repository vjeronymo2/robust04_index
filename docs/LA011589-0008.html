			<p><P> January 15, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NONFICTION IN BRIEF: HONG KONG BY JAN MORRIS (RANDOM HOUSE: $19.95)  </P> <P> Now that the far corners of the globe have become accessible even to  middle-class Americans, travel writing, once concerned with evoking the color,  character and spirit of places few would ever see, has often come to do little  more than list hotels and restaurants. Jan Morris is one travel writer,  however, whose work maintains the vividness and evocativeness of the old  tradition. In this ambitious, detailed portrait, she sees in the British  territory, scheduled to be returned to China in 1997, "an astounding epilogue  to the (British) Empire."  </P> <P> Morris is acutely sensitive to the poetry of place, and her particular strength  here lies in capturing the city's aesthetic balances, its cultural yins and  yangs. She visits "louche and lascivious" night spots, for instance, where neon  ads cast streets "into a gaudy glow, like a nightmare disco," but notes that  these are also "festive places (where) a general sense of having a good time is  shared by all races, at all levels of wealth and poverty."  </P> <P> The city's most significant dualism, however, is between capitalism and  communism. While Chinese industrialists fled into Hong Kong after the 1949  Communist Revolution, today something of the reverse is true. Morris reports  that many Hong Kong industrialists are now returning to China at the invitation  of the Communists, who have organized semi-capitalist "Special Economic Zones,"  such as Shenzhen. Shenzhen is "like an extension of Hong Kong," Morris writes,  "very nearly a suburb, as though it is the colony that is taking over the  republic, rather than the other way round."  </P> <P> This, of course, is the key question: Will the Communists grant Hong Kong some  autonomy of its own in 1997? Morris hopes so, for she is saddened by the  possibility that Hong Kong, which has just produced its first well-educated  middle class, might be deadened of purpose and dissipated of identity when  Britain leaves. Morris' regret stems partly from her idealization of the city;  she largely glosses over the city's persistent problems, from police corruption  to gang warfare, not mentioning, for instance, the serious problems caused by  mass arrivals of boat people early last year. But Morris' regret also reveals  her sincere devotion to the place, an intimate attachment that makes this book  all the more compelling.  </P></p>

			<p>920221 FT  21 FEB 92 / Canada faces many pitfalls on its long road to unity and stability: A conference for the broadest imaginable constituency IF POLITENESS and bonhomie were enough to solve a country's political problems, the spirit at a series of conferences held across Canada over the past five weekends might suggest that the threat of a Quebec breakaway has been averted. The broadest imaginable cross-section of Canadian society - including the Bank of Montreal's chairman, a British Columbia Indian leader, the blind director of the Canadian Disability Rights Council and several dozen 'ordinary' folk chosen by lottery - gathered in a different city each weekend to swap ideas on how to prevent one of the world's most stable democracies from breaking apart. With the help of some careful behind-the-scenes planning, the conferences demonstrated the famed Canadian spirit of tolerance and compromise at its best. In an atmosphere akin to a trade convention, the 240-odd participants split into small working groups and lined up at microphones in plenary sessions to politely spell out their views on the thorniest issues in Canadian politics. Many acknowledged that the experience changed their minds, especially towards the French-speaking province of Quebec. Such open-mindedness has undoubtedly improved the climate for the tough negotiations which lie ahead in the run-up to the sovereignty referendum which Quebec is expected to hold in October. The conferences succeeded in finding broad and, in some cases, surprising agreement on some of the issues which will confront both French and English-speaking Canadians over the next few months. But Canada is by no means out of the woods. As Mr Gordon Robertson, one of the country's most respected constitutional experts, put it at the final meeting in Vancouver last weekend: 'We've achieved success by avoiding a lot of the hard questions.' The conferences, each with its own theme, were organised by Constitutional Affairs Minister Joe Clark to counter criticism that the public was not being adequately consulted in drawing up a new deal between Quebec and the country's other nine provinces. The meetings were designed to dovetail with the work of a 30-member parliamentary committee which is gathering reaction to a series of constitutional proposals submitted last September by Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government. Ottawa has suggested in essence a greater devolution of powers to Quebec in return for greater federal authority over economic policy. The package also includes concessions to numerous other disaffected groups. Western Canadians would be offered a stronger voice in Parliament, and aboriginal people would get a commitment to a measure of self-government. Judging by the conferences, English-speaking Canada is now willing to give Quebec constitutional recognition as a 'distinct society,' the issue which more than any other fuels Quebec nationalism. The conferences have cleared the way for the Senate, the upper house of Parliament, to be converted from an appointed body into an elected body, and for a more concerted drive to bring down the pervasive non-tariff barriers which impede trade between the provinces. But, in all these areas, some big gaps remain. Quebec separatists, who have had the bit between their teeth for the past two years, were among the few constituencies not represented at the conferences. Even the more-flexible Quebeckers are warning that their English-speaking compatriots may be lulling themselves into false complacency. 'On a symbolic level, we've made progress,' said one Quebecker in Vancouver. 'But we haven't begun to find a consensus on what powers should be devolved.' There is a widespread fear that the old rifts will open up again, once specifics are put under the microscope. All the bonhomie of the past few weeks could not hide a disagreement among English-speaking Canadians over whether extra powers should be granted to Quebec alone, or whether they should also be offered to any other province which wants them. The process for approving a new deal also holds many pitfalls. The federal government has so far given no indication how it plans to proceed once the parliamentary committee submits its report at the end of this month. The premiers of the nine provinces outside Quebec, who all have their own agendas, are demanding that they be consulted more closely. Some have promised their citizens a referendum, and even a national referendum remains a possibility. The only certainty is that Ottawa will avoid any proposals which involve the unanimous ratification which the constitution required for the provisions of the earlier, now scuppered, Meech Lake accord on the issue. Whatever deal is drawn up will probably need approval of only six provinces in addition to Quebec. One of the thorniest unanswered questions is how Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa will react. He has made his name as a political weathervane, rather than as a courageous leader, and may be under intense pressure to reject just about any deal which English-speaking Canada can cobble together.</p>

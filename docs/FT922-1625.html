			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / France (12): A fading reputation - Motorway Planning MOTORWAYS are one of the few areas where France's reputation for highly organised long term infrastructure planning is coming unstuck. France is currently agonising over the future of its motorway system on two fronts. First, the success of the two environmental parties in last March's regional election has suddenly placed a question mark over several new motorway projects. Second, Mr Jean-Louis Bianco, the transport minister, has called for a review of the system of financing motorways, in the wake of a critical report by the Cour des Comptes, the state financial watchdog. The report maintains that at least a third of the national network is not properly maintained and that too much investment goes to big inter-city routes at the expense of regional roads. One of the Verts' achievements in the regional elections was to gain the presidency of a regional council for the first time, when Mrs Marie-Christine Blandin, a school teacher, took control of the former Socialist fiefdom, Nord-Pas-de-Calais. One of her first steps, to the fury of her predecessor, has been to freeze two motorway schemes, raising fears over what the greens might do to motorway plans in other regions where they are influential, such as Alsace, Haute-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Rhone-Alpes. Separately, the Cour des Comptes report raised the spectre of a 'two-speed' France, with the fast lane provided by semi-private toll charging motorway operators, and the slow lane being the roads financed directly by cash-strapped central and local government. The central state budget's share of road investment has slipped from nearly 100 per cent in the early 1950s to a mere 27.5 per cent now, with the rest coming separately from the toll road operators, with 43.7 per cent, and local authorities, with 28.8 per cent. Funding for national routes is too often left to local authorities, which as a result cut back spending on regional roads, says the report. It finds the system of private operators inefficient, in that 10 per cent of tolls goes on the costs of collection. Moreover, the toll motorway system is up to 30 per cent more expensive than a simple two-lane trunk road, given that the law obliges the government to provide a toll-free road in parallel to every toll-charging motorway. The private operators borrow under a state guarantee and gather tolls, under renewable government concessions, to repay construction costs. Until the early 1980s they were independent, when the state stepped in after after a decrease in road traffic caused most of them serious financial problems. Only one, Cofiroute, has remained independent. The government usually extends an operators' concession when it agrees to build a new motorway, so that it can pay for the work. This means operators are happy to go on expanding the existing system so long as they can go on collecting tolls from existing motorways, in contrast with the government's original plan that tolls on a given route should only last until the investment, plus profit on that motorway, had been collected. In an earlier report, the Cour des Comptes condemned the system for being managed and developed without any logic.</p>

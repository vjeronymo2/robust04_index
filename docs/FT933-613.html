			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: Parmalat lifted by acquisitions PARMALAT, the Italian dairy products group, saw first-half pre-tax profits after minority interests climb to L55bn (Dollars 34.8m) from L43bn last year due to internal growth and acquisitions. Group turnover rose 54.3 per cent to L1,240bn from L803bn, helped partly by takeovers, which contributed sales of L196bn in the period. The group, which made net profits of L52bn last year, said it expected the trend in sales and earnings to be maintained over the rest of the year. The consolidation of Giglio, a dairy group in which Parmalat earlier this year bought the remaining 70 per cent of the shares not owned, would have added L175bn in turnover in the first half and raised operating profits by about L4bn to L131bn. Parmalat's growth came partly at the cost of a rise in net indebtedness to L599bn at the end of June, from L495bn last December. Net financial charges rose to L40bn in the first half from L33bn in the same period last year. Acquisitions in the first half cost the group L122bn. Sales in Italy, where takeover opportunities are limited, rose by 9.5 per cent to L726bn through a mixture of organic growth and small purchases of local dairy companies. European turnover outside Italy improved to L106bn from L13bn. South America sales jumped 177 per cent to L344bn from L124bn. Merloni, the Italian white goods group, reported pre-tax profits of L14.3bn in the first six months of this year, compared with L7bn last year.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Iraq has protested to the Arab League against the  continued violation of its airspace by the U.S., British, and  French aircraft flying from bases in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait,  noting that this poses a serious threat to Iraq's security,  sovereignty, and national unity.    In a letter addressed to Dr. 'Ismat 'Abd-al-Majid, Arab  League secretary general, Iraq's permanent representative to the  Arab League said these aircraft continued their violation of  Iraqi airspace during the period 1-8 June, carrying out 462  aggressive sorties.    Iraq's representative asked that the letter, along with the  list detailing these violations, be circulated to the Arab  member states.</p>

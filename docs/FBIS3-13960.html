			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Bhutto: `Not Enough'"] </F>   [Text] Six proposals, reports say, have been sent by India  to Pakistan in a serious attempt to have normal relations with  its neighbour. The package offered once again reflects India's  desire to resolve all bilateral issues with Pakistan amicably.  Outstanding issues have evaded a solution mainly because of the  rigid postures adopted by Islamabad. U.S. President Bill  Clinton's recent pronouncements have encouraged such an  inflexible posture taken by the government of Ms. Benazir  Bhutto. Pakistan, it would appear, has embarked on a revanchist  policy. Whether it is army rule or an elected regime,  India-baiting is the favoured game of politicians and generals.  They have used it to ascend to power. The U.S., seeking a sway  over South Asia, is another factor that continues to bedevil  relationships in this subcontinent. The present unipolar regime  has created serious difficulties for countries like India which  believe in peaceful and harmonious co-existence. But Pakistan  is a country of this region: It cannot change the geography of  its location. India rightly expects Pakistan to appreciate and  reciprocate the sincerity with which the six proposals have been  offered to defuse tensions. Broadly, the proposals relate to  disengagement of the embattled forces in the Siachen area;  demarcation of the boundary in the Sir Creek area in the Runn of  Kutch; the marine boundary in the same area; talks on Tulbul  navigation project; additional confidence building measures  relating to nuclear energy installations; restructuring the  working of the sub-commissions under the Indo-Pak Joint  Commission; and ensuring peace and tranquility along the Line of  Control in Jammu and Kashmir. These proposals were handed over  to Pakistan's High Commissioner Riaz Khokhar by foreign  secretary J.N. Dixit as promised by him at the last round of  talks with Pakistan foreign secretary Shaharyar Khan. Most of  these have been discussed with Pakistan and as a result these  have undergone some refinements. Though India controls the  entire Siachen glacier, with Pakistani positions to the west of  the Saltora range from point 9842, this country has proposed  disengagement -- India willing to pull out from Zingrulme and  Pakistan withdrawing from the Saltora ridge. Significantly,  Delhi has said that any disengagement or redeployment of forces  would be without prejudice to each other's positions. The  proposals stipulates that neither country shall re-occupy the  vacated areas or undertake any military mountaineering or other  activity in the area. On the nuclear issue, the two countries  agreed not to attack each other's installations. India has now  proposed no-first use of each other's nuclear capability;  non-attack on population centres and economic targets. This is  regarded as a step towards eventual non-use and eradication of  nuclear weapons. To ensure peace and tranquility along the LoC  [Line of Control] in J and K [Jammu and Kashmir], India has  proposed several measures to prevent violation of tranquility.  Mechanism should be devised to monitor violations by  infiltrators and checking cross-border movement of arms.  Pakistan has been urged to fix a date for another round of  talks. Delhi expects a positive response and would like  Islamabad to see the package as a sign of resilence to restore  normalcy instead of viewing it as a sign of weakness. Pakistan,  with an eye on Washington's moves, has predictably responded by  taking a negative stand, repeating the propaganda line on  Kashmir and human rights.  *</p>

			<p><P> April 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: SNEAK PEEKS  </P> <P> "Last Crusade" doesn't come cheap: Exhibitor sources tell us that theater  owners have already paid Paramount Pictures an estimated $40 million in  non-refundable guarantees for the right to show the sequel. A head film buyer  for a West Coast-based chain called the figure "the highest in movie history in  certain markets, with the possible exception of 'Return of the Jedi' ."  </P> <P> The studio also has negotiated a minimum run of 12 weeks in every theater, the  source added: "Since Paramount's debuting the film Memorial Day weekend, it  locks up those screens all summer -- and keeps out the competition."

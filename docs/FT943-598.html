			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / International Company News: Hegemann group joins bidding for Eko Stahl The Bremen-based Hegemann group has put in a formal bid to buy eastern Germany's largest steel mill from the Treuhand privatisation agency, Treuhand officials said yesterday. However, unlike Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian steel producer, which earlier this week confirmed that it was interested initially in acquiring a 60 per cent stake in the mill, Hegemann appears prepared to buy the entire Eko Stahl complex, which is based in Brandenburg state. Officials said that Hegemann, which has interests in construction, steel and shipbuilding, would guarantee about 2,300 jobs directly in the mill and invest between DM1.1bn (Dollars 710m) and DM1.2bn, but the level of investment would depend on the amount of state and government subsidies it receives. The attraction of subsidies, as well as a wish to stem foreign competition, could be one of the reasons why Hegemann is interested in Eko Stahl, a steel analyst said. The Treuhand is expected to reply to Cockerill Sambre's bid by October 10, but the agency would not say when it would be replying to Hegemann. The east German mill produced 900,000 tonnes of steel last year, a fall of nearly 1.2m tonnes since it was placed under the agency's control in 1990.</p>

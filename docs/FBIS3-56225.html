Will the Politicians Revive It at the  Russian-Belarusian Talks?"]    [Text] Undoubtedly Stanislav Shushkevich, the head of the  Belarusian parliament, who visited Moscow 12 January at the head  of a Republic of Belarus Supreme Soviet delegation left Minsk in  a mood that was far from jovial. A most grave economic  situation has developed in the republic. Since New Year more  than 20 of Belarus' largest enterprises have stopped work. In  addition, the vehicle and agricultural machine building  enterprises have not begun work. The BelAZ Belarusian Truck  Plant, MAZ Minsk Truck Plant, and "Gomselmash" plants are  standing idle. The situation is no better at enterprises in the  radioelectronics sector, which together with machine building  constitute over 80 percent of the republic's industrial  potential. The "vacation" at the "Vychislitelnaya tekhnika  [computer equipment]" republic industrial association will last  until 1 February and the "Integral" Science-and-Production  Association, BelOMO [Optical and Mechanical Association], and  other enterprises are standing idle.    One of the main causes of the economic crisis in Belarus is  the sharp rise in prices for energy resources and the lack of  cash in Russian rubles. According to certain statistics payment  for energy sources already accounts for 60 percent of production  costs in the republic.    In this situation, however, the Belarus leadership is  pinning  great hopes on the unification of the monetary systems of  Belarus and Russia: A decision on that was adopted last week.  However, even here it is not all plain sailing. For example,  in the opinion of Stanislav Bogdankevich, chairman of the board  of the National Bank of Belarus, the statement on the  forthcoming unification of the monetary systems leaves an  ambiguous impression. On the one hand it is stated that the  sides are ready to carry out this unification but on the other  there is a marked lack of agreement on a whole series of  questions. In particular, Bogdankevich stressed that from the  date of the republic's switch to the Russian ruble it is  stipulated that standard prices must be set for energy sources  and basic raw materials within the confines of the common  customs territory. Otherwise any unification becomes pointless  because Belarusian enterprises will obviously be uncompetitive  in the Russian market.    In short, the statement on the unification of the two  countries' monetary systems has produced conflicting  interpretations both in Russia and in Belarus. The opponents and  supporters of this move have considerable justification for  their view. Skeptics, for example, consider that the  unification of the monetary systems could lead to an  infringement of Belarusian sovereignty whereas the realists are  ready to forego a proportion of that sovereignty for the sake of  saving the economy.</p>

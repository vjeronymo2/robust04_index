			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / UK-US power group set for E German deal AN ANGLO-AMERICAN consortium is poised to buy east Germany's large brown coal fields, as well as a crucial stake in a power station, the Treuhand privatisation agency confirmed yesterday. Once completed, the negotiations, which started in mid-1992, will give Britain's PowerGen and NRG of Minneapolis, a subsidiary of Northern States Power, a strategic foothold in the region's utilities sector. It could also help to open up the highly regulated energy sector and to provide the consortium with a possible launch pad into neighbouring eastern Europe. A joint statement said the negotiations should be concluded within two or three weeks. A Treuhand official said yesterday he expected the consortium to invest about DM1bn (Pounds 390m) in eastern Germany. However, neither PowerGen nor NRG would confirm the purchase price. They are buying Mitteldeutschen Braunkohle (Mibrag), extensive lignite fields straddling the state of Saxony-Anhalt. The fields, owned by the Treuhand, were put out to public tender last year. The consortium recently co-opted Morrison Knudsen, the Idaho-based international mining company. It holds a 33 per cent stake and will look after the mining operations of Mibrag. PowerGen and NRG are also buying 44 per cent (the equivalent of 400MW capacity) of a power station at Schkopau, near Leipzig. Schkopau is owned by Veba Kraftwerke Ruhr, the electricity subsidiary of Veba, Germany's large energy-based conglomerate. The consortium had hoped to obtain greater access to power generation. But it has been limited by restrictions on access by outsiders to the high voltage grid, which is monopolised by western Germany's large utility companies. Investment in eastern Germany increased sharply last year despite the recession in western Germany and the high level of labour costs in the region, the Ifo institute for economic forecasting reported yesterday. But investment in western Germany continued to decline, a trend which is expected to continue all year. In the five new states investment increased by 30 per cent to DM16.6bn (Pounds 6.4bn) last year, compared to 1991; raw materials, food processing and services sector accounted for more than 70 per cent. But signs of investment in the region's uncompetitive industrial base, or indications of the growth of new industrial sectors, have yet to emerge. According to the Ifo survey, investment in industry rose 12 per cent in 1992 but will decline this year.</p>

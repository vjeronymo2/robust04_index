			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Stagecoach makes Pounds 6m Western Scottish bid Stagecoach, the provider of local bus services, has made a recommended share offer for Western Scottish, the transport service operator based in Scotland, valuing the company at some Pounds 6m. Stagecoach is offering 3.17m shares on the basis of 317 of its own shares for every 1000 Western. Accepting shareholders may elect to receive up to 36p in cash with the balance in new Stagecoach shares. Western, which since privatisation in 1991 has traded at a loss - this amounted to Pounds 372,000 pre-tax for the year ended January 2 1994 - employs some 830 staff and operates 340 coaches and buses. Directors said the acquisition would add Pounds 15m to Stagecoach's turnover and would see the company 'become the largest operator of buses and coaches in Scotland'.</p>

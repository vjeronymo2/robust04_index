			<p><P> April 14, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> RECORD TIMES LEAD TO BOSTON;  </P> <P> KRISTIANSEN AIMING AT 2:20 MARATHON BARRIER  </P> <P> Breaking the 2-hour, 20-minute barrier in the marathon has been an obsession  with the top women's runners since 1983 when Joan Benoit Samuelson became the  first to go under 2:25.  </P> <P> Six years later, the goal is still there, and Monday in the 93rd Boston  Marathon Norway's Ingrid Kristiansen may finally crack it.  </P> <P> Kristiansen has been trumpeting her intent for the past four years, after  setting the women's world best of 2:21:06 in the 1985 London Marathon.  </P> <P> But she has fallen short each time.  </P> <P> Now, she appears in the best condition of her career and ready for an all-out  assault on a sub-2:20 race.  </P> <P> "I feel I'm fit. But, I'm not thinking about 2:20 this time," she said. "This  time, I have come to Boston trying to win the race. I will try to run as fast  as possible and hope it will be my best time.  </P> <P> "If the weather conditions are nice on Monday, I will try. It is not enough for  me to beat Joan Benoit. I want to go for 2:20 and the world record. I wouldn't  be surprised if I did 2:20 Monday. It's a mental barrier."  </P> <P> Kristiansen's recent performances indicate that she might easily crash through  the barrier.  </P> <P> Last Sunday, she smashed the course record in winning the 10-kilometer  (6.2-mile) Boston Milk Run in 30:58. And last month, she set the women's world  best in winning the New Bedford Half-Marathon (13.1 miles) in 1:08:32.  </P> <P> "Too many people are saying we can't do it because it's too fast for women,"  Kristiansen said about a sub-2:20 marathon. "But people also said that about  2:30 and 2:25.  </P> <P> "So it would be very significant if I broke it."  </P> <P> The significance of a sub-2:20 marathon would be similar to Roger Bannister  breaking the four-minute-mile barrier in 1954. It would also continue to close  the gap between men and women marathoners.  </P> <P> In 1970, there was more than a 54-minute difference between the best men's and  women's marathoners (2:08:34 to 3:02:53). By 1980, the gap had diminished to  just over 17 minutes (2:08:34 to 2:25:41).  </P> <P> Now, it is less than 15 minutes (2:06:50 to 2:21:06).  </P></p>

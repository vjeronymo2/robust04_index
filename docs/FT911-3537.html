			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / World Trade News: France's export claims rise FRENCH exporters made FFr11.4bn (Pounds 1.13bn) of net claims on state-guaranteed contracts last year, equivalent to around 1 per cent of France's total overseas sales, said Coface, the French export credit guarantee agency. The figure, the balance between overall repayments on state-guaranteed exports handled by Coface and premium and other income, is a slight increase on the FFr10.9bn of claims on state-covered exports paid out the previous year. It does not include claims expected from unpaid bills related to the Gulf war, likely to be around FFr5bn this year, Coface officials said. Coface saw a 23 per cent rise in reimbursements it had to pay out on its own account, rather than on the export credit guarantees it manages on behalf of the government. These rose from FFr290m to FFr345m, with the worst performance coming from the recession-hit UK, plus Spain and Italy, said Mr Henri Baquiast, chairman of Coface. The group covers short-term credits of less than three years and political risks in the European Community, while it acts as an agency for the state for most non-EC political risks and medium-term credit guarantees.</p>

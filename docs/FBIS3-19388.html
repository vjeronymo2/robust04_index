The Netherlands infantry battalion in Bosnia is to dispatch  for a temporary time a company to the northern part of the war  zone to assist Scandinavian blue helmets.    Over 100 Netherlands UN troops will be quartered at Tuzla  airport for a couple of weeks and around 20 people will be  stationed near Srebrenica in the north.    Vermeulen has one company -- the Bravo Company -- in  Srebrenica, which, in his opinion, is not enough to do its work  properly. The Netherlands battalion originally was to have  deployed two companies to Srebrenica and one to the nearby  enclave of Zepa. In that village the Ukrainian UN troops are  expected to extend their stay.    Vermeulen says: "Bravo Company has to make a great effort to  perform its assigned security and observation tasks." In his  opinion, a second company is needed to relieve patrols and  checkpoints more regularly. In addition, the situation around  Zepa remains very tense. Therefore, Vermeulen plans to increase  the number of observation points.    The Scandinavian battalion is responsible for large parts of  northern and eastern Bosnia. In this area there are various  places where General Rose wants to eliminate the transportation  problems.    The official decision to change part of the Netherlands  battalion's location still has not been made, but General Rose's  order is expected any day now.    The reopening of Tuzla Airport is vital to provide  humanitarian aid, and it also should solve the problems of  ensuring provisions to the Netherland battalion. Right now, the  Dutch have to use a long and heavily used road to transport  provisions from Split, Croatia to eastern Bosnia.</p>

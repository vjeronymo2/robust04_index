			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 14 (AFP) -- North Korea has not  formally notified the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  of its announced withdrawal from the organization, and two IAEA  inspectors remain at nuclear sites in the communist nation, an  IAEA spokesman said Tuesday [14 June].    "Two IAEA inspectors at the Yongbyon nuclear plant in North  Korea were informed that North Korea was withdrawing from the  Agency by their North Korean colleagues," the spokesman,  Hans-Friedrich Meyer, said.    "But the IAEA has not been informed of the North Korean  withdrawal, either by that country or by the United States," he  said.    He said the two IAEA inspectors, trying to determine if  Pyongyang has a secret nuclear weapons program, "have not yet  been asked by North Korea to leave the country."    China, a close North Korean ally, said Tuesday that it had  also not been officially informed of North Korea's withdrawal  from the IAEA.    According to IAEA rules, the North Korean government must  officially inform the United States of its intention to quit the  nuclear watchdog, a decision which would presumably mean  expulsion of the inspectors.    The United States, the trustee of the Agency's ratification  treaty, must then immediately inform the IAEA board of governors  and the member states, Meyer explained.    North Korea's official KCNA news agency announced Monday  that  Pyongyang was withdrawing from the Vienna-based nuclear watchdog  in retaliation for an Agency decision last Friday to enact mild  sanctions against the communist government.    The sanctions -- cutting off technical assistance to  Pyongyang -- were taken as punishment for the government's  refusal to permit outside access to nuclear facilities and fuel  rods extracted from a nuclear reactor.    Western intelligence agencies suspect that enough plutonium  could be taken from the fuel rods to produce four or five  nuclear weapons.    The UN Security Council is due to discuss a phased series of  more serious sanctions against North Korea later this week.    Meyer said that North Korea's obligation to allow IAEA  officials to inspect its nuclear facilities does not follow from  its membership in the IAEA but from its signature of the nuclear  Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) which North Korea has not yet  withdrawn from.    Japanese and Western diplomats earlier said the real fear  now  was whether North Korea would leave the NPT, which bans members  from using nuclear energy for a military purpose.    "The point of no-return has not been reached yet," a Western  diplomat said. "The red line is whether they withdraw from NPT.  Such decision will be much more serious because it would mean  they are renouncing dialogue," he said.    Russian President Boris Yeltsin said meanwhile that he and  U.S. President Bill Clinton had agreed to link the holding of a  conference on the Korean crisis with phased sanctions against  North Korea, the Russian government's ITAR-TASS news agency said.</p>

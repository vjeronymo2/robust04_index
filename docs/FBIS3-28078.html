Kim Pyong-il, long considered a political rival of Kim  Chong-il, was removed as envoy to Bulgaria in early December  last year amid signs that his return may indicate that Kim  Chong-il has resolved the leadership succession issue. He had  been appointed to take up the post of North Korea's ambassador  to Hungary in August 1988 but was reassigned to Bulgaria in  December that year.    Meanwhile, the appointment of Kim Kwang-sop, husband of Kim  Pyong-il's elder sister, Kim Kyong-chin, as North Korea's  ambassador to Austria indicates that family members of Kim  Pyong-il failed to occupy key posts in North Korea's power  hierarchy.    Speculation was abuzz on whether Kim Chong-il's succession  to  power has come under challenge after Kim Pyong-il returned from  an overseas mission and Kim Yong-chu, younger brother of North  Korean President Kim Il-song, was named to the Politburo of the  North Korean Workers' Party.    The appointment of Kim Pyong-il to an overseas diplomatic  mission, however, showed that Kim Chong-il is still wary of his  half-brother in securing his grip on power in the country,  analysts said.</p>

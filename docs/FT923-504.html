			<p>920928 FT  28 SEP 92 / Swiss give go-ahead to SFr15bn rail tunnels SWISS VOTERS, often presented as stubbornly negative towards closer ties with their European neighbours, yesterday endorsed a bold but expensive plan for modernising trans-Alpine transport by a surprisingly large 63.5 per cent majority. Backing for the SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.7bn) scheme in a referendum has defused a row between Switzerland and the European Community over Swiss restrictions on trucks driving through the Alps. It appears to auger well for a December referendum on joining the European Economic Area, the enlarged free trade area between the EC and the European Free Trade Association (Efta). The Swiss also hope that the plan, for two rail tunnels totalling 50 miles running south towards the Italian border, will be the forerunner of a trans-European trend to transfer freight traffic from road to more environmentally-friendly rail. Acceptance by voters was also a pre-condition for Switzerland joining the EEA. Pro-European Swiss leaders were worried that the EC's crisis over progress towards political unity might have soured Swiss attitudes. But the majority for the plan was more decisive than expected. Uri, the canton beneath which the new Gotthard tunnel is to be built, was one of only two small cantons where a majority opposed the plan. The other was the smaller canton of Appenzell. It is difficult to assess how much of an indication yesterday's vote is of how the Swiss will vote in the EEA referendum. But the strong majorities in the big German-speaking cantons suggest a warming towards European integration. The Swiss government made clear if the plan was rejected, the country would be forced by its neighbours to dismantle its restrictions on juggernaut lorries going through the Alps. Swiss voters also knew that rejection of the plan would disqualify them from joining the EEA. In another referendum yesterday, voters ratified by a 61 per cent margin a proposal to abolish stamp duties on many securities transactions. The financial community has been trying for years to get rid of the tax. Recent job losses in the banking industry seemed to convince the government and the people of the urgency for reform. All cantons had majorities favouring abolition.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by unidentified announcer; from the "Regional </F> News Hookup" program]    [Text] [Announcer] Housing reform is an important  component of Tibet's economic restructuring in 1994. It is also  a major reform of common concern to urban residents and the  broad masses of staff and workers.    Why do we need to conduct housing reform? How do we carry  out Tibet's housing reform in 1994 and 1995? These are the two  topics people are most concerned about at the moment.    Tibet's current urban housing system is a welfare system  whereby actual services are distributed in kind in the form of  low rent with heavy subsidies. According to relevant  statistics, during the 40 years between 1952 and 1991, Tibet  invested about 800 million yuan on housing construction projects  for urban residents. It is assumed people should be very  satisfied with such great efforts of the government when state  and local governments have been facing relatively tough  financial difficulties. In fact, it is not so. There is a very  large gap when we compare the masses' actual needs. Unfair  housing conditions are relatively common. The practice of the  past several decades has shown that not only can the current  housing system not resolve China's urban housing problems, but  it has also deadlocked the way to resolve urban housing  problems. To change the situation and get out of the current  predicament, we must resolutely conduct housing reform.

Rental reform is a first step in reforming Tibet's housing  system in 1994, and it is the beginning of Tibet's efforts in  this regard.    Second, we should comprehensively implement a housing  pension  fund system. The housing pension fund is a long-term savings  aimed at resolving housing problems of staff and workers. It is  a principal means to transform a housing unit under a welfare  system whereby actual services are distributed in kind in the  form of low rent into a housing unit maintained by wages. It  has important significance in strengthening the sense of  security in the staff and workers by having their own housing  units and in raising their ability to acquire housing units on  their own.    Third, we should actively carry out the four-pointed tasks  to  sell state housing units, including reforming Tibet's housing  system, and commercializing and socializing housing units.  Selling state housing units is one of the major reform  measures, has strong policy tenor, involves many sectors, and is  complicated. Additionally, Tibet's basic administration over the  sales of state housing units has been relatively poor, and its  preparatory work in various aspects has been inadequate. To  actively and prudently sell state housing units and to ensure a  smooth progress in related work, we should strictly implement  four measures in restricted sectors in 1994 and 1995 and will,  after gaining experience, gradually implement them across Tibet  in an all-around manner afterward.    Fourth, we should gradually establish government unit  housing  funds. While conducting housing reform, the state, units, and  individual workers should jointly make financial contributions.  How do the state and units get their funds? According to  relevant state policies, most of the funds must be derived from  existing housing funds. In other words, existing funds  currently allocated by the state and units for housing,  production, operation, and consumption should be reallocated,  straightened out, gradually lumped together, and used to form  government unit housing funds. The funds should be  rationalized, consolidated, specialized, and used only to reform  urban housing system and to construct housing projects. [end  recording]</p>

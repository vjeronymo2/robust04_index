			<p><P> January 22, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW BOOKS: AROUND HOME;  </P> <P> SUSAN DUCKWORTH'S KNITTING  </P> <P> SUSAN DUCKWORTH (Ballantine Books; 1988)  </P> <P> IT MUST BE England's chilly climate that inspires so many handsomely designed  sweaters. Duckworth uses all-over patterns (flowers, peacocks, ducks), lots of  colors -- and tiny needles. But the book is more than a series of instructions;  each chapter is introduced with a very pretty arrangement, and in the back of  the book is a colorful spread of gloves.

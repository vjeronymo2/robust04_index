			<p>920128 FT  28 JAN 92 / A mission to make the polluters pay: A look at the progress towards a carbon tax in the European Community Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European Community's environment commissioner, calls it 'a turning point in our whole environment policy'. Others see it as the EC shooting itself not just in the foot but both feet at once. Mr Ripa di Meana's plan to introduce a carbon tax as part of a package of measures to combat harmful emissions is one of the most ambitious fiscal and environmental moves that has yet been contemplated within the EC. If it succeeds, it will force consumers throughout the Community to cut back on dirty forms of energy like coal and petrol and, in the process, raise huge revenues - according to EC estimates, as much as Ecu60bn-Ecu65bn (Pounds 43bn-Pounds 46bn) - which could be recycled to reduce other taxes. Although the plan has already made much more headway in Brussels than many people had expected when it was unveiled last year, it still faces huge obstacles. Large segments of industry are bitterly opposed to it, the EC's international trade lobby has denounced it as a self-imposed handicap, and tax experts have criticised it as a regressive step, because poor people allocate a larger part of their household budgets to fuel. There is even a body of opinion which doubts that it would work at all. None the less, Mr Ripa di Meana hopes to secure political backing from his EC colleagues for a detailed plan by late spring. He is encouraged by the fact that it has already survived several ministerial councils, through which policy proposals have to pass, including those of the economics and finance ministers. Being a fiscal measure, however, the proposal will still have to go through the EC Parliament and receive unanimous approval from the Council of Ministers. An important meeting of the ministers most closely involved - the energy and environment ministers - in December gave it the green light, although with a distinct yellowish tinge. The EC had hoped to come up with a statement that the tax will form the basis for the Community's attack on global warming. Instead, the best ministers could agree was that it is likely to do so. The timing for Mr Ripa di Meana is crucial. He wants to be able to attend the UN 'earth summit' in Rio de Janeiro in June brandishing a piece of paper to prove that the EC is doing its bit to save the environment. This would put pressure on the US and Japan to adopt a similar tax and help him pacify his critics back home. But he also realises that if he fails to win international support his whole plan could, in his own words, become 'a fiasco'. Mr Ripa di Meana's proposal, worked out in conjunction with Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, marks a departure from the earlier trend of tackling environmental problems through rules and regulations. But the intention is that the tax should be based on the same principle: the polluter pays. It would take the form of a combined energy and carbon tax to be introduced in 1993 at the rate of Dollars 3 per barrel of oil - current price, about Dollars 18 a barrel - or its equivalent in other fuels. The tax would rise by Dollars 1 a year to Dollars 10 in 2000. By driving up fuel costs in this way, the tax would force users to become more efficient. The tax would be based on both the carbon and overall energy content of fuel. The carbon element would penalise fuels with high emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas widely blamed for global warming. The energy content would encourage greater energy efficiency, and tilt the balance in favour of renewable forms of energy such as hydro and wind power. Mr Ripa di Meana concedes that the tax would place a heavy burden on energy-intensive industry, so he is willing to exempt heavy sectors such as steel and cement. But special treatment would be removed if leading industrial countries outside the EC introduced similar taxes. Another sweetener is Mr Ripa di Meana's proposal that the carbon tax should be fiscally neutral - that all revenues should be used to offset other taxes. As the tax would be collected at national level, member states could decide for themselves how to spend the revenue windfall. Because of this, the plan is being presented as a 'tax shift' rather than a new tax. Mr Ripa di Meana's best chances of getting his tax lie in harnessing to the rising tide of popular concern about pollution and global warming. Not surprisingly, his strongest supporters include the environmental and energy conservation lobbies, and these could be marshalled into a powerful - if rather diffuse  - political force. But arrayed against him is a large number of the EC's powerful industrial lobbies and trade groups, which argue that self-regulation would be a better means to the same end. Among them is Euroelectric, the trade group representing the EC electricity industry which would be the sector most affected. According to the group's Brussels lobbyist, Ms Angelika Riedl, the plan would harm EC growth prospects and distort international competition by pushing up industrial costs. The competitiveness issue may prove Mr Ripa di Meana's biggest stumbling block. By his department's own calculations a Dollars 10-a-barrel tax would push up the price of industrial gas by a third and of hard coal by nearly 60 per cent. In transport, the price of petrol would rise by 6 per cent and of diesel by 11 per cent. At present, Japan and the US do not seem prepared to make more than vague commitments to follow suit, although they may dress them up in Rio so as not to appear obstructive. Japan argues that its emissions regulations already set standards that are at least as good as those that the carbon tax would achieve, so it does not need a tax. In the US, the imminent election rules out any fresh taxes by the Bush administration. The question is whether a future US president might be prepared to break the long-standing political taboo against energy taxes. Mr Rafe Pomerance of the Washington-based World Resources Institute, which specialises in climate change, believes that an EC initiative would ease the US's own concerns about competitiveness, and add credibility to the concept of a carbon tax: '1992 could be the year when this concept works its way into the political debate.' However, this would be too late for Rio. There is also dissension within the EC itself over the tax. A big concern in Spain, one of the main opponents of the tax, is the effect on its languishing coal industry. Other big coal producers, such as the UK and Germany, have similar reservations. On the other hand, the Netherlands, which has large deposits of natural gas, a relatively environment-friendly fuel, is a strong supporter. France, with the largest nuclear power industry in Europe, also stands to benefit. However, the bargaining over the details would ensure that the impact was even across member states. Opponents of the tax are likely to concentrate their fire on remaining doubts about global warming. Although fears about the greenhouse effect have gripped the popular imagination, the scientific evidence is still being reviewed. Earlier this month, the UN's Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change revised its forecasts of the greenhouse effect downwards, saying that the extent of global warming might be 20 per cent less than originally forecast. These doubts are shared at high levels within the EC Commission, including the energy directorate, which is basing its case for the tax on energy efficiency rather than environmental grounds. Mr Cardoso speaks of the need to jolt people into better energy habits. But if energy efficiency is the goal, the EC will still need to persuade people that a tax is the best way to go about it. The industrial lobbies have pointed out that there are plenty of other ways of bringing about energy savings, such as removing subsidies for coal and nuclear power, and ending tax breaks for car owners. There are also doubts as to whether the tax would deliver the promised benefits. Energy consumers have a well-documented capacity for absorbing price rises. Mr Cardoso admits that he would prefer to introduce the tax all at once so as to administer the 'price shock' he wants, rather than phase it in gradually. But this may be politically controversial, and the fact that the largest energy-consuming industries would be exempted further undermines the tax's likely impact. The record of Scandinavian countries, which have already introduced carbon taxes, is inconclusive (see below). Mr Ripa di Meana, therefore, faces a tough battle. One solution might be to soothe industry's objections with a commitment that all carbon tax revenues would be recycled into cuts in corporation tax, or in VAT on insulation and environment-enhancing materials. In the longer term, EC industry might even benefit from the changes by becoming more energy-efficient than foreign competitors. 'This is a chance to update European industry and make it a leader in a green-oriented market,' says Mr Ripa di Meana. But while broad public opinion may agree with that view, he will have to convince some powerful lobbies that his tax is an opportunity as well as a cost.</p>

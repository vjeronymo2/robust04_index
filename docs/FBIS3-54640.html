			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [New Year's address by President Mirca Snegur "to Mayak </F> listeners" -- recorded]    [Text] The Republic of Moldova ends 1993 on an optimistic  note. We have had a peaceful year. We have gathered a good food  harvest. We have moved forward along the path of economic  reforms. It is sufficient to say that privatization has begun.  A national currency -- the Moldovan lei -- has been introduced.  I think that these are good grounds for optimism and a good  starting point for the new year, 1994, on which we are placing  great hopes. Especially because recently the meeting of heads  of CIS states agreed on new ways toward economic integration and  the creation of conditions for the normal functioning of the  national economies.    On behalf of the people of Moldova, I congratulate all the  people of the world from my heart on the new year of 1994. I  wish you all strong health, great happiness, peace, and  prosperity.    Happy New Year.</p>

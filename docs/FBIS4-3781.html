			<p>BFN     [Text] Macao, April 23 (XINHUA) -- A symposium on the  transformation of Macao's industries was held here today.    Sponsored by the Macao Institute of Engineers, the symposium  invited experts and entrepreneurs from China's mainland,  Portugal, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao to explore ways for  Macao's industrial transformation from the aspects of industrial  and enterprise management.    The symposium was also aimed at enhancing scientific and  technological exchanges and cooperation between Macao and other  places in the world, according to the symposium sponsor.    Considering the fact that Macao will revert to the Chinese  sovereignty in 1999, an official from the Macao Institute of  Engineers said, it is necessary to seek ways for industrial  transformation and development of multi-facet industries to  maintain Macao's prosperity and stability.    He also said it is important to develop technology-incentive  industries in Macao, by making best use of its relations with  Portugal and other European countries and neighboring Asian  countries, to expand Macao's export market and raise its  international competitiveness.</p>

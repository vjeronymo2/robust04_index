			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 31 (YONHAP) -- President Kim Yong-sam,  speaking over the phone with U.S. President Bill Clinton  Thursday [31 March] morning, said close cooperation among Seoul,  Washington and Tokyo is important to settle the North Korean  nuclear dispute.    "I think that, if possible, we should try to invite China to  participate and that we need Russian cooperation too," he added.    In the 33-minute conversation which started at 10 A.M. when  Clinton called Kim while on Easter vacation in California, Kim  explained his visits to Japan and China, Presidential spokesman  Chu Ton-sik said.    "I think China will consider our position and will  eventually  cooperate with us in the U.N. Security Council," Kim said.    He added that Beijing would inform Pyongyang of Seoul's  policy against the German-style reunification of Korea, with the  South absorbing the North, and "my firm will to maintain peace"  on the peninsula. "The Chinese leaders said they oppose not only  the North Korean nuclear issue standing in the way of South  Korea-China economic cooperation but also a nuclear presence in  either of the two Koreas."    Clinton said he is well aware of China's concern that the  U.N. Security Council may adopt a resolution on North Korea,  while stressing the need to send a strong signal to show "our  unity" before the North Koreans and the world.    He expressed hope that China would not veto a resolution in  the U.N. Security Council, saying the Chinese are in a  difficult position but must prevent North Korea from breaking  the promises it has made.    Clinton, admitting that the Stalinist state's nuclear  program  is a sensitive problem, stressed the need to make clear "our  position on this issue."    The United States believes that settling the nuclear issue  through dialogue is most desirable, but realizes the difficulty  of talking with North Korea, he remarked.    Clinton said that because North Korea has not kept its  promises, the U.S. Government must continue pressing for full  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections and  resumption of inter-Korean dialogue.    He added that since Washington does not want the dispute to  develop into a crisis, it will opt for a gradual and prudent  approach so that North Korea can talk out a solution with South  Korea, the United States and the IAEA.    Clinton stressed the need for Seoul and Washington to  cooperate closely on the diplomatic front and take the  initiative if necessary.    Rendering ineffective Pyongyang's policy pitting Washington  against Seoul is vital, he said, adding that Japanese, Chinese  and Russian cooperation must be brought to bear.    President Kim reiterated the need for additional IAEA  nuclear  checks in North Korea and substantial inter-Korean talks, noting  that China supports "dialogue between responsible authorities of  South and North Korea."    Saying he has invited Chinese President Jiang Zemin to visit  Seoul soon, Kim said Jiang had promised to come before the  Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership meeting  slated for November.    In his two meetings with Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in  Tokyo, Kim and the Japanese leader agreed that South  Korea-U.S.-Japan cooperation is key to solving the nuclear  issue, Kim told Clinton.</p>

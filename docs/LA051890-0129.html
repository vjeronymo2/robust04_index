			<p><P> May 18, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NCAA WOMEN'S TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIP;  </P> <P> STANFORD NO. 3 GRAHAM IS NO. 1 IN NATION  </P> <P> Stanford's Debbie Graham wasn't second-fiddle in a season in which the Cardinal  was 29-0 and national team champion.  </P> <P> She was third-fiddle, behind No. 1 Meredith McGrath and reigning national  singles champion Sandra Birch.  </P> <P> But on Thursday, Graham, a graduate of Los Amigos High in Fountain Valley,  finished the year No. 1 in the nation, defeating Nicole Arendt of Florida, 6-3,  6-3, to win the NCAA Women's Tennis Championships at Gainesville, Fla.  </P> <P> McGrath lost in the tournament's second round, and Graham upset Birch in  Wednesday's semifinals.  </P> <P> Graham said her being overlooked was a motivating factor.  </P> <P> "Whenever anyone ever thinks about Stanford tennis, it's always Sandra and  Meredith and I'm sitting at No. 3," Graham said. "I'm the No. 3 player in the  middle and no one ever cares. I wanted to prove to everyone that Stanford is  not just its one and two players."  </P> <P> Graham did not lose a set during the tournament, but Arendt had a far more  difficult route to the finals. She was extended to three sets in both Tuesday's  quarterfinals and Wednesday's semifinals.  </P> <P> "I was tired, but tried not to think about it," Arendt said. "I would say  something carried over (from the semifinals)."  </P> <P> Both players remained on serve until the eighth game, when Graham recorded the  only service break of the first set.  </P> <P> "The first set was so important for me to win," Graham said, "because I started  off the match, and I don't remember a time where I've ever been so nervous. I  was thinking about so many different things. I felt that she was really nervous  in the beginning too."  </P> <P> Graham, seeded sixth, broke Arendt in the first and third games of the second  set taking a 4-0 lead.  </P></p>

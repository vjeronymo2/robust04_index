This is the message coming out of a  communique released today and signed by Jonas Savimbi.    The communique again refers to the controversial September  1992 elections issue, the UNITA leader states he is against the  judicial instruments and the methods used in the same  legislative elections. He states that the elections were neither  fair nor transparent. The number of warnings contained in the  communique is immense. UNITA states that if the MPLA continues  to bomb cities, then UNITA will react even more, because the  government party is corrupt and unable to rule the country  without weapons.</p>

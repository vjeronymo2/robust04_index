			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Belgium languishes in political doldrums: Stalemate in attempts to form a new government is testing the nation's patience NOTHING NEW, began the lead story on one Belgian news bulletin at the end of last week. The reporter was referring to the lack of information about last Tuesday's kidnapping of a Flemish textile magnate's grandson, but he could easily have been commenting on the Belgian political situation, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. Held hostage for nearly 80 days by the inconclusive result of last November's general election, Belgium is still ticking over under a caretaker prime minister - the long-serving Mr Wilfried Martens. But the patience of the king, the people and the politicians is beginning to fray. Ten days ago Mr Melchior Wathelet, the impressive leader of the French-speaking Christian Democrats, abandoned after six weeks his attempt to form a new government. He is the second politician to fail in the task entrusted to him by the king. Mr Wathelet warned it would be impossible to form a new government if the potential coalition partners did not change their stance. Belgian electors registered a huge protest vote against the feuding centre-left coalition three months ago. The fear now is that a new election may have to be held, which could further splinter the political establishment and perhaps play into the hands of extreme right-wingers who benefited from the November poll. The consequences of the stalemate are not only political: Air France and Sabena, the ailing Belgian state airline, are fretting over the delay imposed on their proposed alliance, which has been suspended since the collapse of the last government. Perhaps the last hopes of forming a new coalition now lie with Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Flemish Christian Democrat who managed to broker a deal between the parties 107 days after the country's previous election in 1988. He must report to the king on the current situation and, if there is a chance of compromise, he may be asked to form a government. Mr Wathelet had tried to bring together the former coalition of Christian Democrats and socialists from both sides of the Flemish-French language divide. His efforts were thwarted partly by the Flemish Christian Democrats' insistence on a government which could push through constitutional reforms. The coalition suggested by Mr Wathelet would not have commanded a large enough majority in parliament and the Flemish liberal party refuses to ally itself with the traditional parties, which all lost seats in the last election. But his attempt was at least imaginative: last month Mr Wathelet tried in vain to shift the debate to real issues by publishing his ideal government programme, including a citizens' charter of improvements to public services. Mr Dehaene wants to continue with the same programme, but most Belgians doubt whether much will change even if he brings the parties together. There is even a possibility that Belgium's protest vote will bring to power an identical coalition under an identical prime minister - nothing new.</p>

			<p><P> February 12, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> MATER DEI SOCCER TEAM WINS LEAGUE TITLE, 1-0  </P> <P> Mike Ammann scored the game's only goal with 13 minutes gone in the second half  to give the Mater Dei High School boys' soccer team a 1-0 victory over Servite  in Saturday's regular-season finale at Mater Dei. The victory clinched an  Angelus League championship for Mater Dei (11-8, 7-1).  </P> <P> Ammann, who was the team's goalkeeper until he was moved to the attacking line  during the Monarchs' first league game against the Friars, got his fourth goal  of the season Saturday. After taking a pass from Shawn Wyns, he dribbled the  ball into the penalty area and fired a low-angle shot that eluded Servite  goalie Dominick Sarno.  </P> <P> Mater Dei finished league play a half game ahead of second-place Bishop  Montgomery (13-5-5, 6-1-1), which was ranked eighth in the Southern Section  4-A. Servite (5-9-4, 3-3-2) finished third.  </P> <P> "It's been great seeing how these guys have come through after the adversity we  had earlier in the season," said Mater Dei Coach John O'Neil, who was  suspended, along with several members of his team, after some players drank  alcohol at a team outing in December, "Our suspension set us back two weeks,  but the kids worked hard despite that and are beginning to jell as a team."  </P> <P> Said Rich Manning, Servite coach: "How this team has come back after their  adversity tells you what kind of a soccer program they have at Mater Dei. It  shows you what kind of talent they have up and down the school."  </P> <P> Mater Dei, which kept the ball in Servite territory most of the contest, was  unable to convert on several opportunities before Ammann's goal.  </P> <P> Servite's offense was frustrated by the work of defenseman Jason Blair, who  held Servite's leading scorer, Erwin Garcia, to one shot from outside the  penalty area.  </P> <P> Garcia, who scored a goal during Servite's earlier loss this season to the  Monarchs, scored 10 of his 12 goals in league play this season. Mater Dei  goalie Chip Packard recorded the shutout. AL PRESTON  </P></p>

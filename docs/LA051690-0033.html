			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> 'Care Bare' Video: Vickie Schmerda and her husband, David, are suing a video  company and outlet over a very unchildlike video their 4-year-daughter,  Kristen, accidentally saw.  </P> <P> The Schmerdas, who live in Woodhaven, Mich., thought they had rented "The Care  Bears Storybook" from the Blockbuster Entertainment store. But Kristen actually  saw "Playboy's Farmers Daughters," which featured nude women dancing with  cartoon farm animals. The child announced she wanted to dance naked, "like the  Care Bears video with the naked ladies," Schmerda said. The couple is suing for  negligence and infliction of emotional distress.

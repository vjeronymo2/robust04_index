			<p>BFN     [Text] The Geneva talks on the settlement of the conflict  between Georgia and Abkhazia have been re-scheduled from June 9  to 15 because the problem of the deployment of peace-keepers  into the zone of the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict remains  unresolved.    The press-service for the Abkhazian Ambassador in Moscow  said  the postponement was caused by the refusal of the Russian  Federation Council to agree to the deployment of the  peace-keeping force along the confrontation line along the  Inguri River from June 10 to 15.    The Federation Council, which considered the problem last  week, decided the reasons in favor of Russian troop deployment  in the Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone as outlined in the  letter to the upper house of the Federal Assembly by President  Yeltsin were insufficient. Members of the Federation Council  also pointed to the absence of a legal basis to determining the  status of the Russian troops outside the country.    Meanwhile, following the decision of the Federation Council,  the Georgian leader Eduard Shevardnadze said in Tbilisi that  Russian president Yeltsin had assured him in a telephone  conversation of the early deployment of Russian peace-keepers  into conflict zone.</p>

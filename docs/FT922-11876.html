			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Bangkok Bank sharply higher BANGKOK Bank, Thailand's largest bank, yesterday reported sharply higher first quarter net profits as the sector continued to benefit from the differential between the fast falling cost of deposits and slowly declining lending rates. Net profit rose to Bt2.42bn (Dollars 93.7m), or Bt24.25 per share, from Bt1.32bn, or Bt17.03, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter was Bt19.0bn, up from Bt17.7bn last year but lower than in the previous two quarters. Assets at the end of March rose to Bt610.1bn from Bt531.8bn a year earlier. The Thai Farmers Bank said its net profit in the quarter rose to Bt1.05bn from Bt601.3m, with earnings per share up to Bt15.04 from Bt12.03. Revenue rose to Bt10bn from Bt9.6bn, and assets were Bt320.3bn against Bt280.1bn. The Bank of Asia and the Bangkok Bank of Commerce also announced improved profits. Thai banks have been pushing down deposit rates much faster than lending rates, although important clients can use their clout to get more favourable treatment at the expense of smaller companies and individuals. 'The bank deposit cartel is functioning again,' commented one broker, noting that mortgage rates of around 16 per cent contrasted starkly with the banks' costs of about 7 per cent. Brokers are generally bullish about the larger Thai banks, whose shares continue to trade at modest earnings multiples in an economy growing at an estimated 8 per cent a year. Although the banks may lose market share to non-bank financing as the local financial services industry develops, their shares will also benefit from the reduced need for capital after repeated calls on the market in recent years.</p>

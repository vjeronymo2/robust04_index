Tan Pyong-ho, chairman of the National Council of Trade  Unions, criticized the Kim Yong-sam regime's "reform" as an  exceptionally anti-popular mode of rule.    The Social Justice Study and Practice Society and other  organisations at a symposium on Kim Yong-sam's "reform" stressed  that though the "civilian government" hung out the flowery  signboard of "reform" it has in actuality employed the  anti-popular ruling method of the military fascist dictatorial  regimes and has reformed nothing in political, economic,  educational and all other domains.    The HANGYORE SINMUN newspaper charged that though the  "civilian government" cried for "liquidation of corruption" and  "change and reform" it keeps Kim Chong-pil, a chief culprit of  the "May 16 coup d'etat", in power and defends him. The  newspaper defined the present regime's "reform" as "a solo play  for a rule minus politics."    The opposition Democratic Party opened to the public the ten  major crimes committed by the Kim Yong-sam puppet government  over the last year since its emergence, saying that the  deceptive nature of the "reform" is proved by the soaring prices  caused by the anti-popular policy, treacherous opening of the  agro-market, suspension of North-South dialogue resulting from  the anti-reunification policy, serious pollution of the  environment and never-ceasing disasters.</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Waste cost Sir, Your report about funding packaging waste recovery was appropriately headed 'Recycling levy must fall on consumers' (April 14). The text, however, also suggested this association called for 'a levy on retailers to help pay for recycling proposals'. To avoid misunderstanding, may I make it clear that what we propose is a levy not on retailers as such but on packaged goods, collected at retailer point of sale. We believe this is the only point in the packaging chain at which a levy can be applied fairly to cover all forms of imported packaging as well as that originating in the UK. It is also the point at which the cost of waste recovery will be apparent to the consumer.

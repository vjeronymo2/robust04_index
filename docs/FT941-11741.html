			<p>940203 FT  03 FEB 94 / Surge in US housing as recovery accelerates The US housing market experienced near-boom conditions at the end of last year as the pace of US economic recovery gathered momentum, figures indicated yesterday. The Commerce Department also reported a strong rise in the composite index of leading indicators in December, which points to further robust growth this year. New home sales rose 11.4 per cent between November and December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 862,000, the highest rate since March 1986. Sales were up 30 per cent on the same period last year. Most analysts were surprised by the strength of the housing market, which appeared to reflect consumers' desire to take advantage of the lowest mortgage rates in two decades. However, the figures are volatile on a monthly basis and could be heavily revised. There were big differences in regional markets. The strongest sales gains occurred in the Midwest and the south. Sales fell on the west coast. Abnormally cold weather and the Los Angeles earthquake last month may have caused a national setback for the housing market. The index of leading indicators - designed to provide advance warning of economic conditions six to nine months ahead - rose by 0.7 per cent in December, its fifth consecutive monthly gain. The index rose 0.5 per cent in October and November. Eight of 11 indicators contributed to the rise in the leading index. The most important were increases in consumer confidence and commodity prices, and a fall in claims for unemployment insurance. Analysts are now keenly awaiting payroll employment figures due tomorrow. These will provide the first comprehensive guide to economic conditions in January. Most economists expect a solid gain of about 200,000 non-farm jobs. The Labour Department is also revising the way it calculates the unemployment rate. The new series is expected to result in jobless rates about 0.5 percentage points above previously published figures. This suggests the January jobless rate could be 6.5-7 per cent on the new basis.</p>

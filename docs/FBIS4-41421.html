			<p>BFN     [Text] After over five days of inter-Tajik negotiations,  which started on June 18 in Tehran, the parties have failed to  find any mutually acceptable decision, an expert from the Tajik  opposition reported to Interfax Thursday.    He called the proposal of Dushanbe to initiate unilateral  disarmament of the opposition's armed formations as unacceptable.    For its part, the Tajik opposition proposed to start  bilateral disarmament under the supervision of representatives  from the UN, CSCE, Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Kazakhstan,  the expert said. The opposition insists that the Interior and  Security Ministries' forces be disarmed as well. The opposition  proposes that Russian forces carry out the functions of the  republic's security bodies during a replacement of the staffs of  those bodies.    The expert added that the parties continue examining  proposals on a cease-fire brought forward by the UN General  Secretary Special Envoy Ramiro Piriz Ballon.    Meanwhile, in his interview with Interfax Akbar  Turadzhonzoda, co-chairman of the Movement for Tajikistan's  Islamic Revival, declared that the opposition "does not strive  for power" and is ready to participate in national elections.  However, as he said, it is necessary to permit the activity of  all political parties, to publish newspapers irrespective of  their political orientation, and to release political prisoners  in order to hold these elections.    A popular government, made up of those who have not stained  themselves by "the fratricide war," should rule the country  during the preparation for the elections and adoption of the  republic's Constitution, Turadzhonzoda said.</p>

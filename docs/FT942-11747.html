			<p>940504 FT  04 MAY 94 / International Company News: Capital gains help Stora return to first-term profit Stora, Europe's biggest pulp and paper group, made a strong return to profit in the first quarter after benefiting from increased demand, cost-cutting and big capital gains. The Swedish group swung to a SKr1.07bn (Dollars 135m) profit after financial items from a SKr78m loss a year earlier. Excluding one-off items, profit amounted to SKr430m compared with a SKr93m deficit in 1992. Mr Lars-Ake Helgesson, Stora president, said the market was recovering after three years of over-capacity and falling prices. He was particularly encouraged by evidence of faster-than-expected economic recovery in Europe, the company's main market. Group volume was 2.7 per cent higher than a year ago at 1.66m tonnes, but prices were generally lower than in 1993. 'Increases in pulp prices have brought price rises in most paper and board product areas, but with only a limited affect on earnings to date,' said Mr Helgesson. Disposals meant group sales fell to SKr11.46bn from SKr12.58bn. For comparable units, sales were SKr425m higher reflecting the volume growth and currency movements. Operating profit improved strongly to SKr1.39bn from SKr358m. A restructuring programme which has lowered costs by SKr4.5bn during the recession was one reason for the upturn, but the main impact came from SKr641m in capital gains. The company said all units improved operating performance. Stora Feldmuhle lifted profits to SKr127m from SKr47m, while Stora Billerud rose to SKr275m from SKr191m. The only area to record a worse performance was technical office papers, where losses deepened to SKr17m from SKr9m. Profits from printing papers climbed to SKr179m from SKr118m, and from board and packaging paper to SKr303m from SKr228m. Pulp made a SKr10m profit, turning round a SKr38m loss. Financial expenses fell to SKr322m from SKr436m, reflecting lower interest rates and reduced debt.</p>

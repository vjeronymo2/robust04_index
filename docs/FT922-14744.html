			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / Cookery: Good cod on Good Friday SALT COD is the food of Mediterranean countries. I have always presumed they rejoiced in such dishes as brandade de morue, le grand aioli, baccalao al pil-pil and salt cold fritters because the fresh cod of cold northern waters was not available to them. And we, I presumed, ate only fresh cod, not salt. Not so. Salt cod, I learnt recently, used to be important food in Britain, too. Right up to the middle of the 19th century it was regular fare in many households. The rich ate fresh fish too, when they could get it, but on certain days salt cod was eaten by all levels of society. Indeed, until the death of Queen Mary, grandmother of our present Queen, salt cod was de rigueur at Marlborough House on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. Then the salt fish was served, simply soaked, poached and flaked, with egg sauce, floury potatoes and boiled parsnips. The combination of salt cod and parsnips is an ancient one, presumably because of the way the sweetness of the roots offsets the salt of the fish, and in Lent parsnips are usually at their best. A popular variation on the Marlborough House presentation was to serve poached salt cod in the piece, garnished with chopped or sliced hardboiled eggs. In this case, parsnips appeared as a sauce. In some parts of Scotland a preference emerged for mixing cooked and flaked salt cod with parsley, shallot and creamy mashed potato. The mixture was spread in a pie dish, dotted with butter and baked until browned. This rather sloppy sort of fish pie was served with egg sauce and - you have guessed it - boiled parsnips. The Portuguese still make something similar, but they incorporate garlic and raw eggs into the fish and potato mixture, and they serve the finished dish with black olives and a green salad - a better contrast of colour, flavour and texture than parsnips. The Portuguese are passionate about salt cod. They call it 'the faithful friend' and claim to have as many recipes for it as there are days of the year. The best of this vast repertoire, in my opinion, the only salt cod recipe I really relish, is miniature salt cod fishcakes. PORTUGUESE SALT COD FISHCAKES First soak 8 oz salt cod in cold water for 24 to 36 hours depending on thickness, changing the water several times. Drain and rinse. Simmer the fish until tender (about 20 minutes) in milk and water to cover. Drain and cook 10-12 oz potatoes in the liquid. Saute a small finely chopped onion (and some garlic if liked) in a little olive oil. Mash the potatoes. Skin, bone and shred the fish. Mix both ingredients with the onion, a couple of tablespoons of chopped coriander or parsley, and 2 lightly beaten eggs. Season to taste. Use floured hands to roll the cold mixture into  1/2 inch diameter balls, and cook until golden in a frying pan containing an inch of hot oil. These are delicious served hot or cold, as a snack with pre-dinner drinks, or for dinner with rice and a salad and maybe a garlicky mayonnaise. In Britain, while the poor had no choice but to eat salt cod on fish days, those who could afford to often chose fresh fish instead. So far as cod was concerned, the head was considered the choicest delicacy. Mrs Rundell described it, in A New System of Domestic Cookery in 1806, as 'a very genteel and handsome dish', prized for its mixture of firm flaky flesh and rich jelly. 'Some,' she says, 'are fond of the palate (of the cod) and others of the tongue, which likewise may be got by putting a spoon into the mouth'. British squeamishness about fish seems to be a modern development. As recently as 1956, Dorothy Hartley recorded in Food in England that cod's head was still served in deep-sea fishing ports: 'Fishermen say it is the best part of the fish'. Cod's head is a large cut, comprising two-thirds or more of the fish, the shoulder as well as the head (a thick shoulder signals good cod). It should be gently poached in court-bouillon (so the books instruct us) and, like a boar's head, it should be brought to the table elaborately garnished and garlanded with parsley, lemon and maybe grated horseradish. Serve it (the instructions continue) with a fine oyster or shrimp sauce, and plain boiled potatoes or brown bread and butter. No parsnips. No eggs. I confess I have not tried it myself, my excuse being that cod's head was not to be found in these parts last week. I turned my attentions instead to cooking more readily obtainable thick slices or steaks of fresh cod, hake and ling, all members of the same family. First of all , I cooked hake as described by Elizabeth Ayrton in her book The Cookery of England, following an early recipe she had adapted for LING AS YELLOW AS A GOLD NOBLE. To make this, the pieces of fish are rubbed with cut onion, seasoned and thickly coated with oatmeal, fried briefly in butter, and packed into a shallow fireproof dish. Chopped onions and diced parsnips, fried in butter until soft and golden, are packed into the gaps and over the fish. Court-bouillon, turned clear gold by the addition of saffron, is poured over, then the dish is covered and slipped into a moderate oven to complete cooking. It is unusual, as she says, and I commend her advice to replace the parsnip, if you dislike this vegetable, with carrot. A generous handful of chopped parsley and a few black olives added at the end are, I think, an improvement. My own suggestion for this Good Friday is simpler still. HAKE (OR COD) WITH TARATOR is a dish which features neither parsnips nor eggs. I partner it instead with lightly boiled or steamed green beans and a floury variety of potato sprinkled with plenty of chopped green coriander. Make the tarator sauce first, a day or two ahead if you like. Whizz 4 oz of flaked almonds in a food processor to reduce them to a coarse powder. Add 1 oz bread which has been soaked in cold water and squeezed dry, and 4 to 6 garlic cloves sprinkled with salt and crushed with the back of a knife. Pour on 4 fl oz olive oil mixed with the same amount of water, processing as you pour, to blend the ingredients to a thin creamy porridge. Season with salt, pepper and lemon juice and chill until needed. For the fish, take 6 hake or cod steaks about 1 in thick, choosing whichever is fresher. Put the fish steaks in a baking dish with sea salt and pepper, 1 tablespoon of olive oil and half as much lemon juice. Turn the fish to film all over with the flavourings and leave for an hour or so, turning the fish over occasionally. To cook, cover the dish and bake at 400'F (200'C) gas mark 6 for 12 minutes, or until the fish can be pulled easily from the bone. Beat the cooking juices into the chilled tarator sauce and garnish the fish with chopped fresh coriander and wedges of lemon. If you prefer, the fish can be cooked on top of the stove rather than baked: put it in a pan, pour on hot court-bouillon to cover and poach very gently for about 8 minutes. Cod will cook a little quicker than hake.</p>

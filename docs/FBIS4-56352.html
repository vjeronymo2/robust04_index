			<p>BFN     [Text] Havana, 3 May (DPA) -- The Cuban peso's exchange  rate with the dollar plummeted today in Havana's black market  following official announcements of imminent economic adjustment  measures and an all-out struggle against black market  speculators.    The price of the U.S. currency, which was 100 pesos until  this weekend, ranged between 300 and 500 pesos on the black  market today, according to foreign tourists visiting Havana's  downtown area and the old sector. The official exchange rate is  one peso for one dollar.    A reliable anonymous source told DPA that "people today were  frantically purchasing dollars in the streets of Havana."    Apparently speculation began after parliament, which met in  a  two-day special session, authorized a package of measures to  reduce the fiscal deficit and the excess of circulating money.  The package includes increases in prices and tariffs on various  products and services, the implementation of a tax system, and a  possible change in the type of Cuban currency.    This was compounded by the official announcement of an  all-out struggle against black market hoarders and speculators,  popularly known as "macetas." These "macetas" face confiscation  of their assets if they cannot explain the source of their  fortunes.    President Fidel Castro personally announced at the  conclusion  of today's parliamentary session the imminent approval, this  week, of a decree-law on this issue.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> V. Summary of Selected Issues <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> EPA is soliciting public comment and scientific information on all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> issues presented in or pertaining to this proposed sulfate regulation. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> particular, EPA requests comments on the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Is there a correlation between sulfate concentrations, palatability and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consumption of high-sulfate water by the public?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Are there new data in support of or opposing the reproposed MCLG of 500  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mg/L? Are there new data in support of a higher MCLG?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Are there data to support or refute the hypothesis that the decrease in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available water resulting from sulfate ingestion may result in dehydration  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in adults or infants?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) Are reverse osmosis, ion exchange and electrodialysis reversal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appropriate technologies for sulfate removal?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Should a higher PQL of 30 mg/L be set in order to retain the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> colorimetric method of analysis?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Are the allotted time periods for provision of Alternative Water, i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 20 weeks for infants within the first year of life and 6 weeks for new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents and travelers, appropriate and protective?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) What should be the means of compliance for unmanned, remote campgrounds  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the national parks system, particularly in regard to the provision of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Alternative Water?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) What types of Alternative Water would be likely to be chosen by public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water systems of various types and sizes?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) Are the compliance requirements, that is, Alternative Water and public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notification, sufficiently protective of the sensitive population?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Should the target population be limited just to infants, or should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> there be different requirements for protecting infants and adults?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (11) Are the proposed options consistent with the purposes and intent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SDWA, and are they feasible?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (12) Is a provision to allow the water supply to exceed the sulfate MCL  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> while relying on public notification and self-protection appropriate under  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SDWA?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (13) Is the need for assertive action on the part of the public for self- <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> protection appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (14) Should temporary diarrhea be considered an adverse health effect in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adults or infants?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (15) Would exemptions provide a mechanism for relief to smaller systems?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (16) Should compliance be limited to central treatment?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (17) Is it appropriate under SDWA to allow the use of bottled water and POU  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices for sulfate MCL compliance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (18) What degree of flexibility is appropriate in the bottled water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monitoring requirements and delivery mechanism?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (19) In Options 1 and 4, should all the existing regulations regarding use  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of POU and POE devices be imposed in the case of sulfate levels higher than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the MCL, or are more flexible requirements appropriate?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (20) Should the generic public notice requirements applicable to variances  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under &sect;141.32 apply under Option 4 to systems who choose central treatment,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in lieu of the public notice requirements proposed in Option 1?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (21) Are the assumptions used in the analysis of the costs and benefits of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed rule reasonable?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (22) What flexibility is appropriate or practical in regard to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maintenance of POU/POE devices installed to comply with the sulfate MCL?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> What flexibility is appropriate regarding a reduction in monitoring if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain types of POU/POE devices were installed?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (23) Would most States offer the alternative option to PWS as a means of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=4 --> VI. Other Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=4 --> A. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) calls for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Agency to consider the potential impacts of proposed regulations on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small businesses, organizations and government jurisdictions. If an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis shows that regulations would have a significant impact on a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantial number (usually taken as at least 20 percent) of small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> entities, then a regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA) must be prepared.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In an RFA, an agency examines ``any significant alternatives to the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule which accomplish the stated objectives of applicable statutes and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which minimize any significant economic impact of the proposed rule on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> small entities'' (Regulatory Flexibility Act section 603).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed regulation would affect less than 2,000, or one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> percent, of the total of 200,000 public water systems (including all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community and non-community systems). Nevertheless, EPA's analysis shows  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that regulating sulfate through standard approaches that assume the need  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for central treatment would have significant economic impacts that would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fall largely on smaller public water systems. Therefore, EPA has conducted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a regulatory flexibility analysis by investigating alternative, less  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> burdensome regulatory approaches for those small systems. From these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> investigations, EPA developed and is considering the innovative options for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulating sulfate described earlier in this notice. These innovative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> options accomplish the Regulatory Flexibility Act's goal of minimizing the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> impacts of this regulation on small public water systems while meeting the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act by ensuring that drinking water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that meets the sulfate MCL will be provided to all persons within the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> target population.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

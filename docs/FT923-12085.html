			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Regional airlines warn of fares rise AIR FARES within the UK and to the rest of Europe may rise if new charges proposed by the Civil Aviation Authority are brought in, the European Regional Airlines association warned yesterday. The CAA is proposing to increase landing and take-off charges to help pay for better air traffic control equipment. Airlines overflying the UK would thus pay a lower proportion of the CAA's total income. The changes also mean greater costs for the CAA and less for the European air traffic control organisation. The CAA said any changes should be completed by the end of the year.</p>

			<p><P> December 9, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELLIS PRIDE  </P> <P> Last month when I was in New York, I took the boat to Ellis Island.  </P> <P> I imagined that I was my mother or father as we approached. They were Irish.  Sailing past the Statue of Liberty and then stopping at the Great Hall, would  they be accepted? What would await them? How would my father get to Butte to  work in the copper mines? The dedication of those who restored Ellis Island is  to be lauded. I loved every inch and was proud to see my parents' names  engraved on the immigrant wall.  </P> <P> MARY POWERS LOFTUS  </P> <P> San Marino  </P></p>

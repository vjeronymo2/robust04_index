			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / London Stock Exchange: Cadbury hints Concern that Cadbury-Schweppes might be poised to make a fresh acquisition were sharpened by an announcement concerning the food and soft drink group's stake in Dr Pepper/Seven-Up, third biggest soft drinks group in the US. Cadbury filed an amendment to Schedule 13D - an obligatory requirement for large holders of stakes in US companies - relating to its investment in Dr Pepper. The amendment is seen principally as an update but ensures that Cadbury has the possibility of changing its 25 per cent stake significantly. There are two likely scenarios, according to the market. First, Cadbury may make an outright bid for Dr Pepper because it has, so far, been unable to obtain a seat on the board. However several analysts favour the second possibility, that Cadbury will wait until the Dr Pepper shares have reached an acceptable level and sell its stake to fund an acquisition of SmithKline Beecham's Lucozade and Ribena arm. Either way, it is likely to increase gearing. Last year the company spent Pounds 476m last year on acquisitions, raising Pounds 340m of the cost through a rights issue. Nevertheless, it has said it can finance Pounds 400m to Pounds 500m of acquisitions without recourse to shareholders. Cadbury shares fell 10 to 425p. Dr. Pepper/Seven-Up shares were up around 10 per cent during London trading hours. The life assurance stocks were easier, but no worse than the wider market, after the Securities and Investments Board published its review of mis-selling of personal pensions. One marketmaker described the SIB news as 'slightly less worrying than the market had been expecting,' but pointed out that it would 'leave a shadow over the sector until the mess is sorted out.' There was heavy trading in Prudential shares, where turnover reached 7.3m, with the stock price down 4 at 298p, while Legal &amp; General dipped 8 to 428p on 1.1m traded and Lloyds Abbey Life 4 to 326p. Dealers pointed out the continuing heavy trade in Standard Chartered, where turnover reached 5.8m shares, and the outperformance of the shares, steady at 279p, following further aggressive buying by one of the City's leading marketmakers. Abbey National fell 8 to 403p, affected by the stock's inclusion in a sizeable programme trade with a block of 2m shares said to have been unloaded on the market at 401p. Worries about the impact of market turbulence, unsettled SG Warburg, which dropped 17 to 614p. Kleinwort Benson, on the other hand, edged higher to 467p. Building and plumbing products group Wolseley delivered excellent preliminary figures, including profits at thevery top end of the range of analysts' forecasts and a dividend total only fractionally short of best expectations, but its shares were hampered by the steep decline in the market. At the close the shares were 8 off at 725p, having traded between 72,2p and 730p; turnover was a relatively high 1.5m. Analysts were said to be lifting 1995 estimates from the current figure of around Pounds 230m-Dollars 240m to around Pounds 250m to Pounds 260m. Pharmaceuticals group Zeneca held firm as the group announced third quarter sales had risen by 8 per cent. The shares were 9 weaker in early trading, reflecting the weak US currency but rallied to close steady at 838p. Smith New Court's latest quarterly review of diversified industrial companies help lift Williams Holdings 4 to 339p against the market with the shares heading the securities house's best in the sector list. BTR - the day's most active Footsie stock - dipped 1 1/2 to 301p in turnover of 14m, of which 5m was a programme trade said to have been executed by Goldman Sachs. Food retailer Argyll slipped 8 1/2 to 257p as one securities house had to work hard to place a block of 2m shares. Large amounts of stock looking for a home also restrained retailer Next. Dealers said 1.3m shares were sold at below the current market price and the shares fell 6 1/2 to 235p. The recent moves by regional electricity companies to buy back stock and pay special dividends sharpened old speculation that Great Universal Stores would try and find a way of distributing part of its Pounds 1.5bn cash pile to shareholders. It holds its annual meeting on Friday - potentially an ideal time. The shares dropped a penny to 558p. Up 4 at 534p, Bass stood out in a brewery sector clouded by the failure of the Lazard Brewers Investment Trust which was to have acquired Whitbread's share stakes in a number of regional drinks groups. Wolverhampton and Dudley tumbled 12 to 512p while cider group Bulmer fell 18 to 398p. Greene King closed 3 down at 528p. Whitbread fell 4 to 548p. GKN shed 8 to 601p in fairly nominal 1.5m turnover following a trade press report that Lynx helicopters worldwide had been grounded. The company's subsequent denial of the report had little affect on weak sentiment among engineering shares. Other statistics, Page 45</p>

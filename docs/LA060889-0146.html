			<p><P> June 8, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE WORLD SERIES;  </P> <P> A WEDGE SHOT HELPS WICHITA STATE IN 7-4 WIN  </P> <P> Eric Wedge and Ricky Kimball each spent 56 minutes trying not to think about  it.  </P> <P> When Wednesday night's College World Series game between Wichita State and  Florida State was suspended by rain in the eighth inning with the score 3-3,  Wedge was at the plate for Wichita State with the bases loaded and Kimball was  on the mound for the top-seeded Seminoles.  </P> <P> "I didn't go in there (the dugout) and have a brainstorm too much," Wedge said.  "I just wanted to hit the first good pitch."  </P> <P> Once play resumed, Wedge jumped on Kimball's second offering for a two-run  single that keyed Wichita State's 7-4 victory before a crowd of 11,561 at  Rosenblatt Stadium.  </P> <P> "You get to sitting around and thinking about it," Kimball said of the delay.  "and you go over every pitch in the book."  </P> <P> Wichita State's victory avenged a 4-2 loss to Florida State in a second-round  game Sunday.  </P> <P> Florida State (54-17) and Wichita State (66-15) will meet again Friday to  decide the East Division representative for Saturday's national-championship  game.  </P> <P> Texas (53-17), which is unbeaten in the tournament, faces once-beaten Louisiana  State (55-16) tonight in a West Division game.  </P> <P> Wedge, who was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the third round of the draft,  drove in four runs Wednesday. He drove in a first-inning run with a groundout  to second base and had a run-scoring double in the third.  </P> <P> Todd Dreifort put the Shockers ahead, 3-0, in the fourth when he walked, stole  second, moved to third on a throwing error by Florida State catcher Pedro  Grifol and scored on a wild pitch by Florida State starter Gar Finnvold (10-4).  </P> <P> Brian Gilliland started Florida State's scoring in the fifth, coming home from  third on a fielding error by Wichita State shortstop Pat Meares on a ground  ball hit by Rocky Rau.  </P> <P> The Seminoles tied the score with a two-run sixth inning keyed by Buddy Cribb's  run-scoring double and Gilliland's sacrifice fly to center field that scored  Cribb from third.  </P> <P> Following Wedge's single off Kimball in the eighth, Wichita State scored its  final runs on fly balls by Meares and Dreifort.  </P> <P> Relief pitcher Jeff Bluma (3-0) earned the win while Jim Newlin pitched the  final two innings to record his nation-leading 18th save.  </P> <P> Wedge's double against Florida State gives Wichita State 199 doubles for the  season, tying the Shockers' own NCAA record set in1985.  </P> <P> Newlin's save against Florida State was his third of the tournament, which ties  a World Series record.  </P> <P> Tonight's West Division game between Texas and LSU features a matchup between  two of the best college pitchers in the nation.  </P> <P> Sophomore right-hander Kirk Dressendorfer (17-2) starts for Texas against LSU's  junior right-hander, Ben McDonald (14-3).  </P></p>

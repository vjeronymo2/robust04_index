			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Management: Down with super egos - Lucy Kellaway on tackling megalomania in the office How satisfying to be John Casablancas, head of Elite Model Management in New York. Last month he told his most famous model, Naomi Campbell, that he had had enough. He was fed up with her tantrums, fed up with her 'greedy and demanding' ways and fed up with being 'demeaned, used and abused'. Never mind the large fees she brought in - she was out. This story made world news not just because every trip of Campbell's on the catwalk is an event. The toppling of a giant ego is a rare spectacle, and one much enjoyed at a distance by everyone who has to deal with egos themselves. Tantrum throwing, foot stamping, sulking, uncontrollable super egos are not only to be found in 23-year-old models. Among writers, musicians, sportsman, actors and chefs, famous egos abound. John Osborne, Dustin Hoffman, Marco Pierre White, John McEnroe, the list goes on. Neither are big egos limited to 'creative' people. Robert Maxwell may have been the biggest, but is by no means the only example of an ego in commerce. 'You need narcissism to become a business leader. But when you get to the top, funny things start happening,' says Manfred Kets de Vries, a practising psychoanalyst and professor at the Insead business school in Fontainebleau, near Paris. 'People idolise authority figures, so senior executives tend to get surrounded by liars.' It is not difficult to spot when an ego has got too big. Super egos do not listen, they have to be in the limelight, their judgment gets wonky, they refuse to take blame, they have to be in control, they want the biggest aeroplane and they surround themselves by yes-men. Nearly every company has one, but how do you deal with them? With most super egos, the Casablancas option is not open. Very occasionally directors get together and decide that the boss's rampant ego is a luxury the company can no longer afford. But for most of the time, the problem is one of containment and co-existence. When a two-year-old child throws a tantrum, there are two possible courses of action. Either you take them on your knee and cuddle them, or you throw them in their cot and shut the door. With adult egos, the choice is a similar one. You can pacify them or you can confront them. The first route involves kowtowing, but may in some cases be the best option. 'You realise that they are on an ego trip, and you bow, scrape and tug your forelock. You play the game in the interests of a quiet life,' says Peter Honey, a psychologist and management consultant. This may work for egos you only have to deal with occasionally. One literary agent who works for some famously bad-tempered writers has become adept at avoiding conflict. 'I accept that my writers are entitled to be as difficult as they like. I look for the warning symptoms. If I am dealing with someone who I know gets upset about their royalties, I try to anticipate that. There are other people that get apoplectic if I don't ring back in five minutes, so I try to be prompt.' The other approach is to take them on. This requires more courage and needs to be handled with care. 'You have to choose when and on what issues. Work out where your bottom line is, and on everything else grin and bear it,' says Honey. Tim Halford spent 10 years with Armand Hammer, one of the biggest egos of them all. During that time he was fired four times and had back four times. His job routinely included such things as getting Hammer seats at the royal wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer in full view of the US television cameras. Yet Halford found his own way of standing up for himself. 'If you've got someone with an ego, you must never dent it publicly. With Hammer, if you were 100 per cent sure of your ground, it was possible to tackle him quietly. He would accept that he was wrong.' Some experts argue that there is little colleagues can do to soften the behaviour of office egos. The most difficult cases, says Kets de Vries, are businessmen who also own the company. 'The only possibility is for that person to have a coronary - then you have a lever and can do something with them'. In public companies, there may be other more sympathetic figures of authority to turn to, but Kets de Vries warns that this could be dangerous. 'The moment you blow the whistle, your head comes off.' He reckons that if your boss has too high an opinion of himself, your best route might be to find another job. He argues that these super egos are in need of professional help. He compares the role as psychoanalyst with that of Alcoholics Anonymous: 'I try to wean them away from their Genghis Khan characteristics.' Simply telling the truth may get nowhere. 'Very often these people are like Teflon. The truth just slips off.' While colleagues may be unable to prick inflated egos, companies can help prevent them from puffing up in the first place. Gerard Egan, professor at Loyola University, Chicago, has traced the careers of many business egos who have started out as entrepreneurial talents but have eventually brought about the downfall of their companies. He cites RH Macy, the US retailer, and Sunbeam-Oster, the household appliance manufacturer, as examples of companies where the boss's ego has contributed to a business's rise and fall. Despite the financial damage tyrannical managers can do, few companies seem aware of the problem, argues Egan. Managers and supervisors who instinctively know when to confront, when to encourage, when to leave alone, are needed, yet companies put little effort into making sure their managers have and use these qualities. All managers need someone who will be their confidant, who will quietly tell them when they have overstepped the mark. People who constantly lose their temper need a colleague to take them aside and tell them what they look like when they get really angry. Companies can also retard the growth of egos by appraisal systems in which peers and underlings as well as their superiors give their views. This all-round view may discourage damaging behaviour before it becomes too deeply entrench-ed. Not all big bosses let success go to their heads. Kets de Vries singles out Richard Branson for praise. Egan mentions Bill Gates. Those who have been bawled out for criticising Branson or have seen Gates' plans for a multi-million dollar underground bunker might not agree. Yet the point is not that these two are modest. It is, as de Vries says, that they have 'put their narcissism to good creative use'.</p>

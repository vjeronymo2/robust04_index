			<p>920810 FT  10 AUG 92 / Management: Therapy provides a counsel of hope Sheila Lyons lost her mid-level job at a top business travel company last November. As the months have worn on, she has not only doggedly chased every possible job lead but fought to keep up her spirits. 'Some days I just can't make a call,' says Lyons, normally an upbeat person, 'It's a self-esteem thing.' For middle- and upper-level executives, unemployment can be devastating. Accustomed to being in charge, busy, purposeful, they feel adrift and ashamed. So debilitating are these feelings that many have now sought psychological counselling and, in the process, spawned a new type of group therapy. Across the US, unemployment therapy groups for executives have been organised. Most are in churches, such as the one lead by Sonia Sukenick in Chicago. Sukenick says: 'As people are unemployed for longer periods, they become more desperate. Expectations don't pan out and they don't know how to plan new ones. There's a lot of pain involved.' She tries to guide the jobless 'to work through their feelings of abandonment and betrayal.' She also counsels them to adjust their expectations and re-think their self-images. 'Some will never know work as they did before, especially investment bankers,' she said. The groups not only offer the unemployed relief from their sense of secrecy and isolation, but they also help at the practical level of providing a networks of contacts.</p>

			<p>941117 FT  17 NOV 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Diffident response to Fed rate increase Equity markets throughout continental Europe reacted diffidently to the 75 basis-point rise in US short-term interest rates, with many finding it difficult to make any headway. While the absence of Germany, closed for a national holiday, may have played a small part in the day's aimless search for direction, the main cause seemed to be a feeling that the Fed might not have acted decisively enough. With fears that the US economy is still expanding more quickly than desirable, the thought in some quarters is that it might not be too long before the Fed has to act again. MILAN was preoccupied by the progress of parliamentary confidence votes on the pension package, although losses were tempered by some renewed buying by domestic funds, and hopes for a more buoyant December account, starting today. The Comit index fell 3.12 to 640.41. Ferruzzi provided a flurry of excitement, gaining L58 or 4.5 per cent at L1,347, as speculation resurfaced of a merger with Montedison, its industrial subsidiary, as part of the group's restructuring. Montedison reacted negatively to the rumours, declining L17 to L1,237, as analysts questioned the benefits for the company. Banks were mostly lower as recent bid fever subsided. BCI shed L11 to L3,557 with the expiry of its unsuccessful bid for Ambroveneto, which gave up L66 to L4,288. Credito, however, picked up L17 to L1,677 as its bid for control of Credito Romagnolo remained on the table. Romagnolo dipped L246 to L16,047. ZURICH was higher as investors switched from financials and insurance issues and into industrials, which found renewed support in the strength of the dollar. The SMI index rose 17.5 to 2,609.4. Nestle was a beneficiary of the strong dollar in the run-up to its financial year-end, gaining SFr26 at SFr1,221 and reversing the recent downward pressure. Holderbank rose SFr19 to SFr1,068, extending a long period of gains on positive expectations for 1994 results and speculation that a bank would soon issue covered warrants on the shares. BBC was SFr10 firmer at SFr1,109 ahead of nine-month figures due tomorrow which are expected to show double-figure operating earnings growth but flat sales, compared with a very strong year-earlier performance. Ciba, which confirmed on Tuesday that it was in talks to acquire a sizeable minority stake in Chiron, the US biotechnology group, rose SFr18 to SFr771, with strong demand seen from London investors. PARIS found the going hard and ended the day with the CAC-40 index off 4.33 at 1,950.20, having traded in a range between 1,964 and 1,929. Turnover remained moribund at about FFr3.5bn. Axa, the insurer, went against the trend with an advance of FFr7.30 to FFr269.00 after announcing a rise in nine-month turnover to FFr73bn from FFr69bn. However, this was among the few exceptions to the drift downwards. Confirmation that the Renault privatisation was only 1.4 times subscribed by retail investors may also have contributed to weakness - the car maker is due for listing today. Euro Disney, which could find its place in the CAC-40 threatened by Renault, dropped another 5 per cent to FFr8.80. AMSTERDAM could also barely bring itself to move and the AEX index slipped back just 0.11 to 412.10. The lack of momentum was reflected in the performances of dollar-sensitive issues such as Royal Dutch and Unilever, both of which fell on the day, by 40 cents and 70 cents respectively to Fl 189.70 and Fl 198.10. Elsewhere, Philips, which was the day's most active stock, dipped 50 cents to Fl 54.00, while Polygram added the same amount at Fl 77.00, and announced that it had acquired a US recording company for Dollars 33m. MADRID gave up early gains to end lower and the general index finished 2.48 down at 302.76. Repsol receded Pta95 to Pta3,955 after posting lower than expected nine-month earnings. OSLO was higher in lively trading on small advances in the opinion polls for supporters of EU membership ahead of the country's referendum on November 28. The polls, however, still show opponents of EU membership retaining the upper hand. The All-share index finished 1.66 higher at 605.21. STOCKHOLM turned back from its best levels on profit-taking, and the Affarsvarlden index was finally 9.30 ahead at 1,514.50. Volvo 'B' put on SKr5 at SKr142.50 as investors reassessed the group's nine-month results.

			<p>CSO     [Text] Leading domestic communications equipment makers are  all boosting production of cellular telephones. In response to  increased demand being experienced as a result of the "outright  sale system" which went into effect in April, NEC, Matsushita  Communication Industrial, Fujitsu, and Japan Radio Company plan  to double production of cellular telephones earmarked for  domestic markets over levels of fiscal year 1993. Competition in  the cellular telephone market is heating up because domestic  appliance makers have joined the competition. In response,  makers hope to gain a competitive edge by reducing costs through  volume production.    NEC will increase its current fiscal year production of  domestically marketed cellular telephones to 400,000-500,000  units, more than twice the level of fiscal year 1993. NEC  Saitama, its manufacturing subsidiary, is currently producing at  the rate of about 1 million units a year for both domestic and  overseas markets. About 200,000 units were distributed to  domestic markets and the remainder was shipped to overseas  markets, but domestic volume will be doubled because of the  sharp jump in demand occasioned by decontrol leading to outright  sales of cellulars.    Matsushita Communications Industrial boosted monthly  production at its Shizuoka plant in Kakegawa city, Shizuoka  Prefecture, to 50,000 units beginning in April. According to  President Takashi Kawada, "Sales of digital cellulars are better  than expected," and production plans were revised upward because  of a sharp rise in demand, even though they had just increased  production at the Shizuoka plant from the 30,000- to 40,000-unit  level in March.    Fujitsu has invested roughly 1 billion yen in its Nasu plant  in Otawara city, Tochigi Prefecture, to raise the capacity of  that plant to 400,000 units from the current annual level of  170,000. They also plan to increase employment commensurately.  Further, Japan Radio Company lifted production capacity at its  Saitama plant located in Kamifukuoka city, Saitama Prefecture,  twofold to a monthly rate of 20,000 units.</p>

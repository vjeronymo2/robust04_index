			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOME DESIGN;  </P> <P> UPDATING THE MAINSTREAM SHOWER  </P> <P> The demand for luxury bathtubs hasn't cooled consumer interest in showers,  designers say.  </P> <P> On the contrary, with bathtubs taking up more space in master baths, showers  increasingly are becoming separate units with their own array of luxury items.  </P> <P> In interior designer Karen Myers Ziccardi's Newport Beach home, for example, an  8-by-6-foot marble shower is tucked into a corner across the room from her  large whirlpool tub. It has a skylight, a wide bench on two sides, a steam  shower unit, a body-spray fixture and his-and-her shower heads. ("Two working  people get a chance to visit a little," she says.)  </P> <P> Hans Rindfleisch, owner of Eurobath and Tile in Costa Mesa, says Rainbars,  which sell for about $360, are much in demand, especially among athletes. The  two-foot-long bar provides a full-body spray. "You're totally immersed in  water," he says. "It's like a carwash."  </P> <P> He says there are hundreds of different shower heads ranging from $250 to  $1,000 -- many with massage units. Thermostatic valves, for $250, keep the  temperature and water pressure constant when water is being used in other parts  of the house. Steam-shower devices with timers are available for up to $1,500.  </P> <P> In spite of the popularity of oversize bathtubs, designers say showers are  still used far more frequently than tubs.  </P> <P> Some have even made entertainment centers of their showers. One of  Rindfleisch's customers has a built-in TV that sits at eye level behind a  shield of glass. SHERRY ANGEL  </P></p>

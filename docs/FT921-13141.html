			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / Letter: Something of a record? Sir, As a shareholder in Northern Developments, which went into receivership 18 years ago in the dark days of 1974, I have just received a second distribution of 6p a share, seven years after payment of a first distribution of  1/2 p a share. A further distribution is said to be likely but the administrators are unable to indicate whether it will be in this millennium or the next. Is this a record or just par for the course? R M H Heseltine, 29 Gibson Square, London N1 0RD</p>

			<p>930114 FT  14 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilian coffee exports down by 16.4% last year BRAZILIAN COFFEE exports declined significantly in terms of both volume and value in 1992, according to figures released by the Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters. Brazil exported 16.4m bags (60 kg each) of coffee last year, down by 16.4 per cent from the 1991 total of 19.6m. Earnings came to Dollars 927.7m, a reduction of 36.5 per cent from 1991. The average price for Brazilian beans on the international market fell from Dollars 74.68 a bag in 1991 to Dollars 56.68 last year. The federation attributed the lower volume to a reduced harvest. It estimated that the final tally would be between 18.8m and 24m bags, compared with 28m bags in 1991.</p>

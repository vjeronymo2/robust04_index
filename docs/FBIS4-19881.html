			<p>BFN     [Text] President Rauf Denktas has stressed that the  confidence-building measures [CBM] package must be reversed to  its original form. Mehmet Ali Yilmaz, Turkish state minister in  charge of Cyprus affairs, paid a farewell visit on Denktas this  morning.    Replying to reporters' questions after the meeting, Denktas  said that there are promises made in the first version of the  CBM package and recalled that Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos  Kliridhis accepted the package before it was changed.  Explaining that the package was eliminated as a result of  negotiations conducted subsequently, Denktas noted that  Kliridhis acted as if he accepted the package although he  actually had not. This was Kliridhis' tactics, Denktas remarked.    Denktas declared that the original package must be  reinstated, adding that work can be conducted on this version.</p>

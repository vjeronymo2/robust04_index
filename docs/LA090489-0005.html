			<p><P> September 4, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> U.S. USERS AND COLOMBIAN 'WAR'  </P> <P> As indicated in the editorial "Attack on Drug Kings" (Aug. 22), the murder of  Sen. Luis Carlos Galan has galvanized Colombians into waging all-out war  against Colombian drug lords. Let's hope they succeed. It won't be easy.  </P> <P> No body of terrorists should be allowed to control the government of Colombia.  These drug kings must be captured, extradited to the United States and put on  trial. As mentioned before, this won't be easy, but it can be done if Colombia  and the United States can work together.  </P> <P> DAN RADEMACHER, Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 13, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> GORBACHEV, KOHL SIGN PACT ON REDUCTION OF WEAPONS  </P> <P> Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed a broad  declaration today that calls for a 50% reduction in nuclear arsenals and a  worldwide ban on chemical weapons.  </P> <P> The document on common principles of both nations was signed on the second day  of the Soviet leader's first state visit to West Germany.  </P> <P> The pact signed by Kohl and Gorbachev said their countries have a common  European heritage, and that European nations should exist in "peaceful  competition with one another" and reduce their military might.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Common European Home'  </P> <P> It also said cooperation by West Germany and the Soviet Union "is not directed  against anyone" and that a special place in the "common European home" is  reserved for the United States and Canada.  </P> <P> Asked if the agreement could help resolve territorial questions stirred by the  1939 non-aggression pact signed by Adolf Hitler and Josef Stalin -- which  allowed the Soviet Union to annex three independent Baltic states -- Gorbachev  told a reporter, "I don't think we need to turn to such a distant chapter of  history."  </P> <P> He said the joint agreement was to formalize the wish of both Moscow and Bonn  to enter "a new stage in our relations."  </P> <P> The signing ceremony was carried live on West German television.  </P> <P> Earlier, Gorbachev received a rapturous reception that outstripped the welcome  given two weeks ago to Bush, who scores far below the Soviet leader in West  German opinion polls.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'A Great Joy'  </P> <P> Gorbachev said today that he does not believe opinion polls showing he is West  Germany's favorite politician, but the enthusiastic welcome he has received in  Bonn makes him very happy.  </P> <P> "I am quite pleased with the atmosphere here. For me it is a great joy,"  Gorbachev told reporters a few hours after being greeted by thousands of West  Germans in Bonn's market place.  </P> <P> "But I don't really believe in those polls," he added.  </P> <P> Gorbachev ranks higher than any other leader in West German opinion polls, the  latest of which showed that 90% of all people surveyed trusted him.  </P> <P> Thousands of Bonn residents showed their feelings today by chanting "Gorby,  Gorby" and giving the Kremlin chief the most enthusiastic welcome afforded a  foreign leader in years.  </P> <P> Gorbachev plunged into the cheering crowds, shaking hands, signing autographs  and even hoisting a young boy onto his shoulder. Smiling and laughing much of  the time, he was obviously enjoying himself.  </P></p>

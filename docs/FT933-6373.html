			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Small New York Exchanges to merge THE NEW York Stock Exchange is about to spin off its tiny 14-year-old futures arm, the New York Futures Exchange, to the New York Cotton Exchange, according to sources close to the talks in New York. The two exchanges share trading floors in New York's World Trade Centre. The deal, which could be completed as early as September 2, would be small in comparison to the merger plan under way between two other New York futures exchanges, the New York Mercantile, and the Commodity Exchange (Comex). However, the Nyfe could prove a useful addition to the 100-year-old cotton exchange. The cotton exchange trades futures and options contracts in cotton and frozen concentrated orange juice and, through its subsidiary, the Financial Instruments Exchanges, it offers dollar index futures, futures on European currency units, and a treasury note contract. The Nyfe is best-known for its futures on the Commodity Research Bureau index. Its 500 members also trade futures on the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index. As stepchild of the giant stock exchange, the Nyfe never fully developed as a futures exchange. Its memberships trade for Dollars 100. Seats at the Cotton Exchange, in contrast, sell for about Dollars 40,000.</p>

			<p>930108 FT  08 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Oil traders ignore tension WORLD OIL prices were barely changed yesterday in spite of renewed tension in the Middle East, which would usually make traders nervous and push the market up. North Sea Brent crude oil for February delivery edged up tentatively to close 10 cents higher at Dollars 18.85 a barrel after Iraq rejected an ultimatum by the US to remove missiles from a 'no-fly' zone in the south of the country. Kuwait had also reported a clash on the Kuwait-Iraq border on Tuesday. The oil market traditionally reacts immediately and very positively to any reports of clashes in the Middle East, but traders do not at the moment perceive any serious threat to supply. The market is still working off huge stocks of oil products which were built up in October and November. In spite of cold weather in Europe, demand has remained depressed as economic activity has failed to pick up.</p>

			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / International Company News: Credito Italiano bid approved by Consob Consob, the Italian stock exchange watchdog, yesterday gave Credito Italiano (Credit), the Italian bank, permission to press ahead with its L2,800bn (Dollars 1.7bn) bid to buy a 65 per cent stake in Credito Romagnolo (Rolo) of Bologna. Consob said it had approved publication of a prospectus. That means the bid  -now more than six weeks in gestation - could be launched formally next week. Credit received Bank of Italy authorisation for the operation on Tuesday. Credit has indicated it would offer L20,000 a share for 65 per cent of Rolo, against the market price of just under L18,000. Rolo's directors had rejected plans for an earlier L19,000-a-share bid as hostile. They agreed last weekend that the new proposal, backed by guarantees on management autonomy and minority shareholder rights, was an improvement on the previous plans, but left themselves room to recommend a counter-bid. Cariplo, the Milan-based savings bank, is understood to be considering an alternative offer, in alliance with IMI, the financial services and banking group, and Bank Austria. Such an offer is unlikely to be launched until the terms of the Credit bid have been published.</p>

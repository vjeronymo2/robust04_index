			<p>940513 FT  13 MAY 94 / 3i plans to offer a quarter of share issue to retail investors 3i Group, the venture capital group owned by high street banks, expects a quarter of the shares it is selling in the planned early summer flotation to be available to retail investors, senior directors said yesterday. Sir George Russell, chairman, said it had canvassed about 100 retail brokers, and believed there would be interest among more sophisticated investors in buying up to 25 per cent of the shares. The company expects to publish its pathfinder prospectus giving details of the offer later this month, along with preliminary annual results. This will disclose a net asset value figure on which the share price will be based. Mr Simon Borrows, a director of Baring Brothers, the merchant bank sponsoring the flotation, said shares would 'probably' be priced at a discount to 3i's net asset value. He said the company and its advisers had not 'got to the stage of pricing' but he emphasised that 3i's past performance had been better than comparable quoted venture capital investment trusts. Mr Borrows said brokers would target shares at individuals who would invest 'a reasonable amount for a reasonable amount of time'. 3i expects bank shareholders to undertake to hold their remaining stakes after the float for at least a year. The company has made presentations to about 70 UK institutional funds, and is to make more throughout Europe. Mr Borrows said the company and its advisers would go through 'an informal book-building exercise' after the publication of the pathfinder prospectus to gauge demand for shares at different prices. The banks are likely to sell about a third of 3i's equity, which could be worth about Pounds 500m, in the flotation. The group expects all the main shareholders to retain some holding, including the Bank of England, which has a 14.5 per cent stake. Observer, Page 17</p>

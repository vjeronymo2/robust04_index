			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Vlasimir Mijovic report from Moscow] </F>   [Text] Today's one-day visit of Bosnian Prime Minister  Silajdzic to Moscow passed without any of the spectacular  statements that usually, though without any substance, adorn  diplomatic talks on Bosnia.    They discussed peace initiatives, the engagement of the  Russian troops in Bosnia, territorial divisions, and the  Washington Muslim-Croatian agreement. During separate meetings  with Andrey Kozyrev and Vitaliy Churkin, Silajdzic also raised  the issue of establishing diplomatic relations of the government  in Sarajevo with the Kremlin.    Judging from the statements that the protagonists of today's  talks gave to journalists, nothing has happened that would give  a new, more decisive impetus to the resolution of the Bosnian  crisis. This especially refers to the meeting of Haris Silajdzic  and Andrey Kozyrev, whose talks seemed to have been primarily of  a courtesy nature.    What will influence the current peace process happened  behind  the doors of Moscow's Savoy Hotel, where Silajdzic and Yeltsin's  special envoy for former Yugoslavia Vitaliy Churkin held direct  talks. It is only natural that talks behind closed doors are  more frank; however, the public is told considerably less than  could be said. Before Silajdzic's arrival in Moscow, there was  much speculation about important messages that Radovan Karadzic  would like to convey to the Bosnian prime minister via a Russian  intermediary. Unfortunately, nothing can be said about their  contents.    The Kremlin today also learned first hand of Croatia's  views.  Immediately after Silajdzic, the head of Croatian diplomacy Mate  Granic entered one of the elite negotiating buildings of the  Russian Foreign Ministry. He would not disclose the reasons for  his hasty arrival in Moscow either, but it is hard to believe  that the reason could be a mere routine exchange of opinions.    In any case, the results of today's Moscow talks will become  more certain when Russian and U.S. diplomatic heads Kozyrev and  Christopher meet in Vladivostok next Monday. It is no longer a  secret that Washington and Moscow will shape (?importantly) the  final agreement to end the Bosnian crisis. This has been  Vlasimir Mijovic, permanent OSLOBODJENJE correspondent from  Moscow, reporting specially for Bosnia-Herzegovina Television.</p>

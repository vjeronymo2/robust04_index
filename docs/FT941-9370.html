			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: King &amp; Shaxson buys Greig Middleton King &amp; Shaxson, the listed discount house and moneybroking company, is to purchase Greig Middleton, one of the UK's largest private client stockbroking companies, in a push to create a more stable income base. The offer values Greig Middleton at Pounds 18.5m, which will be paid through the issue of 1.6m ordinary shares, convertible loan stock which could add 5.6m shares, and a further 4.8m shares to be issued three years after completion. Assuming full conversion, the acquisition will result in a 43 per cent increase in King &amp; Shaxson's issued share capital. King &amp; Shaxson has been in discussions with the broker for more than two years. It already owns a moneybroking subsidiary and has been keen to expand from its highly volatile discount business into fee-based financial services. Greig Middleton employs 300 people and has Pounds 2bn under management within its private client operations. It also has an institutional sales and research business and has expanded into corporate finance. It is 25 per cent-owned by four outside investors, who purchased their stake in 1986 for an undisclosed sum. These four shareholders are Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz Girozentrale, the Bank of Scotland, Scottish National Trust and Greig Investments. The remaining shareholders are primarily current and former employees of the company. According to Mr Ian Perkins, King &amp; Shaxson's managing director, Greig Middleton remained profitable in the aftermath of the 1987 crash. In the year to July 16 1993 it reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.9m on turnover of Pounds 19.8m. Greig Middleton is threatened with litigation from a group of investors in relation to losses in the Second Greig Middleton Enterprise Zone Trust. The fund raised Pounds 10.7m in 1991 for investment in a London Docklands office tower, the main tenant of which went into receivership, removing the fund's only source of income. King &amp; Shaxson has ensured 'as far as is possible' that any payments in relation to these proceedings will be covered by the former shareholders of Greig Middleton. The broker has shareholders' funds of only Pounds 7m, but shareholders employed by Greig will only receive their King &amp; Shaxson share entitlements if they remain with the group or leave under agreed circumstances.</p>

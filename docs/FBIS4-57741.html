			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Cristiana Chamorro Barrios: "The Sandinist Front </F> Today"]    [Text] The electoral experience in 1990 and the one in 1994  on the Atlantic coast were evidence that the Sandinist Front was  worn out, a situation that is somewhat unusual for a party that  has been comfortable in opposition. It is obvious that the two  political setbacks were caused by differences among its leaders  -- the "historic vanguard" -- and the workers and peasants they  claim to represent.    According to the Marxist-Sandinist theory implemented in  Nicaragua during the 1900's, "the masses were not cultured."  They had to be educated politically because their interests at  the "moment" did not coincide with the long-term interests of  the Sandinist revolution.    The party leadership, therefore, said it had to interpret  "the people's will" and consequently lead them down a certain  path, even if in contravention of the people's will. After all,  the Sandinist Government system had the coercive means to  "convince," warn, or exclude those who doubted the validity of  its arguments.    The fact is that the Sandinist Front lost power; this was  not  envisioned in any chapter of its doctrine. In 1990 the  government of Violeta Chamorro changed the historical tradition  from dictatorship to democracy -- destroying the adversary  through a policy of reconciliation -- and the Sandinist Front  did not have a violent or defying opponent that could justify  the preservation of its authoritarian and rigid position.    The new democratic order penetrated the party structures,  allowing its rank and file the space and means to express its  opinions freely, evidence of the contrasting interests between  the FSLN [Sandinist National Liberation Front] and its masses  until the latter, one way or another, had its interests prevail  over the messianic projects of the vanguard. Among other failed  plans was the idea of regaining power by creating revolts,  strikes, kidnappings, disturbances, social disruption, and chaos  that would supposedly topple the new system established by the  people's vote.    Finally, Nicaraguan democracy dragged the party deep into an  identity crisis. Today it is divided between the interests of  the rank and file, which is contaminated by democracy, and those  of the messianic projects. Apparently, the democrats have found  an interpreter in the self-styled "For a Sandinism that will  return to the majority" trend. They are proposing changes to  the rigid party position, making it conform to democracy. They  believe that if the party does not achieve ideological,  organizational, and structural democratization, the FSLN will be  abandoned by the popular groups that still follow it and will be  reduced to a small group of agitators.    The other current, which controls the chains of command on  diverse levels of the party's current organization, is the  self-styled "Democratic Left." Apparently it is not willing to  accept a renewal that would allow participation by the rank and  file. Recent party assemblies, convened before the special  congress that will be held today, have confirmed that the FSLN  is dominated by its inability, both structural and ideological,  to adapt to Nicaragua's existing democratic circumstances.  Majority resolutions against the Democratic Left were  eliminated and manipulated by the party, confirming that that  sector is not ready to relinquish its privileges.    The special congress today offers the FSLN an excellent  opportunity to overcome that division and emerge as a single,  strong, organized party, committed to democracy, peace, and  economic development. If this commitment is not achieved, those  who have proclaimed the renewal and democratization of the party  will have only two alternatives: to perish politically, devoid  of credibility, or to be true to their proposals, ridding  themselves of their rigid position in order to be reborn  democratically in the modern history of Nicaragua.</p>

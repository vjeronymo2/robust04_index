			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Iberia pilots to strike on pay cut Iberia, Spain's embattled state-owned flag carrier, inched closer to bankruptcy over the weekend when its pilots' union said they would strike over the peak holiday period between December 28 and January 8. The pilots have rejected a viability plan backed by Iberia's other unions to salvage the crippled airline. The plan involved pay cuts of 15 per cent for the pilots, and their union said it was only prepared to negotiate salary cuts if Iberia's management was replaced. The confrontation means the management may introduce a more drastic restructuring plan involving large-scale redundancies among the airline's 25,000 labour force and the sale of some of its subsidiaries. Iberia, which has debts of Pta424bn (Pounds 2.06bn) half of which are short term, has written off accumulated losses of Pta144bn, reducing its capital and reserves to a mere Pta69bn. The airline is on course to lose Pta44bn this year and the company said yesterday the pilots' strike would cost Iberia at least Pta10bn in lost revenue.</p>

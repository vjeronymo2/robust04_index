			<p><P> June 17, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES SHOPPER: FROM SOUP TO NUTS, THIS PARIS FLEA MARKET HAS SOMETHING FOR  EVERYONE  </P> <P> When you leave the Metro at Porte de Clignancourt to browse through Paris'  Marche aux Puces, the grande mere of flea markets, your first impressions may  be discouraging.  </P> <P> Although the streets are lined with vendors, they're offering only poorly made  leather bags and jackets, cheap jeans and gadgets.  </P> <P> Aggressive hawkers, who are mostly North Africans, shout sing-song faux French  that makes you think you've just arrived in Morocco, instead of a Parisian  neighborhood.  </P> <P> Walk a little farther. Turn off Avenue Michelet into Rue des Rosiers and you  will find about 3,000 dealers who sell their wares from permanent stalls, car  trunks, cardboard boxes and on folding tables. There is an extraordinary range  of antiques, vintage clothes, memorabilia and curiosities. This is the Marche  aux Puces that's loved by millions.  </P> <P> Although you're not likely to discover a Renoir tucked among the old prints or  a signed Galle vase forgotten at a bin bottom, you can acquire collectibles for  about one-third of what similar items cost at Left Bank antique shops.  </P> <P> For several years, Marche aux Puces suffered a bad reputation and savvy  Parisians seemed to leave the area to the tourists. But things have changed as  sellers became more responsible and prices more reasonable.  </P> <P> Marche aux Puces is so huge, seeing it all can be exhausting. Occupying four  square miles, the market is made up of seven different sections: Vernaison,  Biron, Cambo, Serpette, Paul-Bert, Jules-Valles, Malik. Each section is  independently owned, has its own entrance and specializes in merchandise that's  not sold by the others.  </P> <P> The largest of the markets, Vernaison, 99 Rue des Rosiers and 136 Avenue  Michelet, is a maze of stalls featuring a hodgepodge of antique furniture and  objets d'art from a variety of periods.  </P> <P> Although much of it is of 1950s vintage, occasionally pieces date from the  mid-19th Century and lovely Deco desks and dressers sell for under $400. Small  chests, old wooden boxes, straight-back and bentwood chairs, glass-front  bookcases and file cabinets abound.  </P> <P> Many dealers display old post cards, photos, prints and posters from the turn  of the century, priced from $1.50 to $150. There are art and theatrical  posters, plus delicate, idyllic illustration prints from antique books and  dozens of souvenir post cards, particularly from French provinces and  historical Paris.  </P> <P> The highlight of Vernaison is Chez Louisette, a cafe/bistro that has the  ambience of a Toulouse-Lautrec painting and characters in modern dress. The  food is charcuterie, with soups and daily luncheon specials selling for under  $10. A floor show by singers and accordion-playing accompanists, clowns and  jugglers is performed periodically by the waiters.  </P> <P> Marche Biron, 85 Rue des Rosiers, expensive and exclusive, has a long corridor  lined with dealers displaying elegant Napoleon III furniture, plus antique  crystal chandeliers.  </P> <P> Not much in Marche Biron costs less than $500. Left Bank antique dealers, who  prowl here in search of pieces to resell at astronomic prices in their own  shops, knowingly request the prix marchand, or dealer's price. You can try the  same and perhaps get a 10% to 15% discount. You can try for a discount in other  sections, too, but your chances of success are best in Biron, where the prices  are highest.  </P> <P> Marche Cambo, 75 Rue des Rosiers, sells late 19-Century paintings, including  canvasses by lesser known Impressionists and Post-Impressionists. The artists'  names may not set off bells of recognition, but pleasing paintings can be  bought for less than $250.  </P> <P> Marche Cambo also offers English mahogany furniture in good condition at  reasonable prices. An oval dining table with six chairs from the early 19th  Century was about $900. An elegant small chest with four drawers was $350.  </P> <P> Marche Serpette, 110 Rue des Rosiers, is good for furniture and decorative  objects from the 1930s through 1950s, as well as French provincial furniture.  Aside from handsome pine tables (from $200), chairs (from $170) and cupboards  (from $300), Marche Serpette sells vintage plastic everything.  </P> <P> Kitchen containers, clocks and radios, lamps and electric fans, modern chairs  and night tables. It's the French equivalent of things that might be found in  granny's attic if they hadn't been given away. Prices are reasonable: pretty  platters sell for $8 and complete table service for four might cost $75.  </P> <P> Marche Paul-Bert, Rue des Rosiers 96, has as wide a range of merchandise as  Serpette, but most of it is simply used furniture and household goods, without  the fashionable vintage. However, several Marche Paul-Bert dealers specialize  in bronzes, small and large. A carry-on-sized bust of a handsome but obscure  French politician might cost $80. Life-sized nudes can cost $1,000 or more.  </P> <P> Marche Jules-Valles, 7 Rue Jules-Valles, offers small items such as antique  dolls and toys and vintage art books. It has antique playing cards in worn  leather cases for $10, stuffed bears with moveable limbs for $12 and old maps  from $7.  </P> <P> Marche Malik, 23 Rue Jules-Valles, specializes in vintage clothing and costume  jewelry. Most date from the 1950s (an unusual gray flannel circle skirt with a  bright pink flannel poodle applique sells for $60), but there are several  stalls with antique lace blouses (from $45) and petticoats (from $35).  </P> <P> Second-hand eyeglass frames ($20 and up for wire), sunglasses, old recordings  by opera singers or jazz musicians ($5 and up) are the best buys.  </P> <P> Marche aux Puces dealers can be tough and aloof. They don't enjoy chatting,  particularly in English. Some will get angry if you bargain and most give you a  hard time when you request tax rebate forms. Don't be intimidated. If you can't  get an item on your terms, continue to the next stall.  </P> <P> Beware of high prices for "copies" and/or "married" pieces in which elements  from separate antiques are combined to make one piece. Although Marche aux  Puces has been cleaned up considerably, there are still many fakes.  </P> <P> Transactions are by cash or check. However, get a receipt that exactly  describes your purchase.  </P> <P> The market is open Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Early Saturday morning is the  slowest period and it's when the offerings are best. Sunday afternoon is  incredibly crowded; beware of pickpockets. On Monday some stalls close.  However, those that are open might be willing to bargain to clear items left  from Sunday.  </P> <P> While in the neighborhood, don't miss Honore Paris, 132 Rue des Rosiers, a  home-decorating store with unusual furnishings.  </P> <P> Brass tables, for example, look like giant brass crabs with claws supporting a  glass disc through which you can see a huge agate rock nestled on the crab's  back -- and the rock lights up! There are cobra lamps with brass-coiled bases  and light-bulb heads, peacock beds, upside-down bear tables and butterfly  couches.  </P> <P> Prices are subject to change due to currency fluctuation.  </P></p>

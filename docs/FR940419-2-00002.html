Eligibility for WIC is based in part on nutrition risk. Through a grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food and Nutrition Service (FNS), the NAS is reviewing the scientific base for nutrition risk criteria used in WIC. At the end of the 30-month study, NAS will publish a report and provide copies to FNS containing its conclusions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> The public meeting will be held on Thursday, May 19, 1994, beginning at 8:30 a.m. Anyone wishing to reserve a place on the agenda at the public meeting to make a 5-minute oral presentation must submit a written request to speak and a copy of their remarks no later than Friday, May 13, 1994.

The WIC program operates through a preventive approach to health care by providing supplemental foods and nutrition assessment and education to improve nutritional status and thus to improve pregnancy outcome and growth and development of infants and children (through 5 years of age). The program links food assistance and health programs by its goal of improving nutritional status through food delivery and by serving as a gateway to the public health system principally through Medicaid-delivered health services for pregnant and lactating women, for infants, and for children. Eligibility for the WIC program is based on income (185 percent of poverty level); status as a pregnant or lactating woman, an infant, or a child; and nutritional risk. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Nutrition risk criteria include biochemical and anthropometric measurements, nutritionally related medical conditions, dietary deficiencies that impair or endanger health, and conditions that predispose persons to inadequate nutrition patterns or nutritionally related medical conditions. The appropriateness of nutrition risk criteria is an issue of major interest to the WIC community and of great significance to the future direction of the program. The committee deliberations will address these issues, thereby providing a basis for establishing approriate guidance for nutrition risk criteria used to establish program eligibility. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The committee will review all WIC nutrition risk factors currently covered by the program. The committee's deliberations will begin with those risk criteria for which there is substantial scientific literature and move to those for which there is little or no scientific literature, that are most difficult to quantify, or that are not likely to be affected by the supplemental food package delivered through the program. NAS plans to identify gaps in scientific knowledge, to examine specific segments of the WIC population identified to be at risk for each criterion, and if applicable, to report its findings regarding how to determine who is at risk for each criterion, including numerical values. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Public meetings will solicit information from WIC program administrators, staff, and participants as well as from researchers in the fields related to the nutrition risk criteria under study. Two public meetings will be conducted during the course of the committee's work, both in 1994. This first public meeting will be held in Washington, DC. A second public meeting will be schedule at an upcoming meeting of the committee in 1994 at the NAS west-coast meeting facility, the Arnold and Mabel Beckman Center, Irvine, California. A report of the committee's findings and recommendations will be published by the end of the study in April 1996. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated: April 15, 1994. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> William E.

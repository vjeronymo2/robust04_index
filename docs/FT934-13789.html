			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / Leading Article: The question for Mr Clarke THE FIRST unified Budget, due in November, is also Mr Kenneth Clarke's first Budget. The chancellor must stamp his mark on economic strategy. The biggest question he faces is whether further fiscal adjustments are required, beyond those announced by Mr Norman Lamont last March. The former chancellor introduced a fiscal 'wedge', which is set to raise Pounds 6.7bn (1 per cent of gross domestic product) in 1994-95 and Pounds 10.3bn in 1995-96. Even so the public sector borrowing requirement would, according to the Treasury's forecasts, only decline from 9 per cent of GDP (excluding privatisation proceeds) this year to the still high level of 4 per cent in 1997-98. The 'green budget' put forward yesterday by the Institute for Fiscal Studies in collaboration with Goldman Sachs indicates that further action is probably needed. Indeed, it notes that on some measures the present fiscal position is worse than it has been in peacetime: the general government 'primary' deficit - the deficit less net interest - will peak at close to 6 per cent of GDP; the 'real' Budget deficit - the deficit adjusted for inflation - is higher still; and the ratio of public debt to GDP is set to double in half a decade. There are two gleams of light in this otherwise sombre picture: the first is that the inflation of the 1970s and the fiscal surpluses of the late 1980s brought the ratio of gross public sector debt to GDP to the exceptionally low level of 35 per cent in the early 1990s, from over 80 per cent 20 years before. The second is that the economy is in recovery, which should allow it several years of above-trend growth. The authors of the green budget argue that if the economy were to recover at 3 per cent a year, while public spending were to grow at 2 per cent in real terms (which is what happened at a comparable stage of the last cycle), the PSBR could fall to 3.6 per cent of GDP by 1997-98. Even this would not be low enough to stabilise the ratio of public sector debt to GDP, forecast to be just over 50 per cent at that time, if the inflation rate is also to fall within the government's target of 1-4 per cent. But the required fiscal adjustment would be modest, no more than about 1 per cent of GDP. It would be possible to argue for a higher peak ratio of debt to GDP. But this would be risky, since the primary surplus ultimately required to stabilise the ratio of public debt to GDP increases with that ratio whenever the real interest rate exceeds the real growth of the economy. The most important objection to doing nothing more is that 3 per cent economic growth, while possible, is far from certain. If things were to go wrong, the government could find itself under severe pressure to raise taxes in the run-up to the next election. Some argue that further fiscal adjustment would itself delay recovery and so make the fiscal position still worse in the medium term. That would be a powerful argument if it were impossible or unwise to use monetary policy to offset fiscal tightening. Early action on the fiscal position, offset by monetary loosening, might even make it easier to sustain the desired rate of growth. The reason for the deterioration in the fiscal position was the extraordinary tightness of monetary policy during the period of ERM membership. This needed to be rebalanced. To an extent, it has been. But the rebalancing may have to go further if growth is to be sustained without an explosive increase in the external deficit. A controlled depreciation now, when the economy has plenty of slack, would be far better than an uncontrollable one later. Taking no further fiscal action might work out, but only if everything were to turn out well. Only a foolhardy chancellor would bet on that. The probability is that a further fiscal adjustment will be required. Politics suggest the adjustment should come sooner rather than later. Economics suggest there is no great merit in delay. Mr Clarke should go for higher taxes and lower interest rates.</p>

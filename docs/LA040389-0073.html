			<p><P> April 3, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Hunt Settles Lawsuits: Multimillionaire Lamar Hunt and other defendants have  agreed to settle two lawsuits, one of them a class action, stemming from the  alleged attempt by Hunt and his brothers to corner the silver market in 1979  and 1980, Hunt's attorney reported. Hunt and other defendants, which include  the giant investment firm Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., agreed to create a  $58-million settlement pool to compensate members of the class, said attorney  James T. Seigfreid. Hunt, owner of the Kansas City Chiefs professional football  team, would contribute 4.7% of the settlement pool up to a maximum of $2.75  million, Seigfreid said. Hunt, his brothers Nelson Bunker and William Herbert,  and a number of other defendants were named in the suits filed in 1982 and 1984  by people who claimed that they lost money in futures trading because of the  alleged attempt to corner the silver market.  </P></p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> DISPUTE OVER BACTERIA DANGERS OF DISPOSABLE DIAPERS LINGERS  </P> <P> A study commissioned by the diaper service industry suggests that disposable  diapers may harbor bacteria that cause polio, meningitis and hepatitis.  </P> <P> Not so, says T. Scott Stewart, chief spokesman for Procter &amp; Gamble, a  major manufacturer of disposable diapers.  </P> <P> Stewart says the National Assn. of Diaper Services paid $15,000 for that study  and it has been discredited. Nonetheless, the suggestion continues to crop up  in news stories about the great diaper wars.  </P> <P> Environmentalist Jeanne Wirka claims that the report has not been discredited  and research is continuing.  </P> <P> However, Stewart has on his side the fact that there is no evidence that any  case of polio, hepatitis or meningitis was ever caused by disposable diapers,  and some European countries have been using them for 50 years.  </P> <P> He also says there is 1,000 times more pet fecal matter entombed in landfills  than infant leavings on the disposable diaper.  </P></p>

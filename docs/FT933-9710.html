			<p>930807 FT  07 AUG 93 / Books: The plots thicken in cold war thaw - Thrillers THIS SUMMER has brought forth the usual crop of hardy annuals in the thriller field. Tom Clancy, for instance, has produced Without Remorse (HarperCollins Pounds 15.99, 639pp). This time, an extraordinarily complex plot to do with personal errands of mercy is juxtaposed with a scheme by the Pentagon to rescue prisoners from a North Vietnamese prisoner-of-war camp. Clancy can sustain a plot, however Byzantine, and this tome, although long, does not sag. Jack Higgins' new book, Thunder Point (Michael Joseph, Pounds 14.99, 309pp.), borders on the unacceptably implausible. It is very well-worked territory - Martin Bormann's escape to South America at the end of the second world war. This is apparently Higgins' 52nd novel and the whiskers are beginning to show. But for aficionados, it is the usual racy mixture. Two other long-familiar spy writers also have new offerings. Brian Freemantle has written Charlie's Apprentice (Century Pounds 15.99, 435pp) and Ted Allbeury The Line-Crosser (New English Library Pounds 15.99. 278 pp). For a moment, in reading Brian Freemantle's book, I thought he was about to kill off Charlie Muffin, his working-class at odds with the establishment hero. I always found Charlie a poor clone of Len Deighton's Harry Palmer. But no such luck. The apprentice of the title, personally trained by Charlie, falls down on the job of trying to extract a British Agent from Beijing, and our hero has to swing back into action, much to the dismay of his superiors who thought they had got rid of him. Very much the mixture as before. It rumbles along pleasantly enough. Like Ted Allbeury, Freemantle is good on the detail of the intelligence world; Allbeury is the more solemn of the two. The ending of the cold war means the intelligence world is changing. Both Freemantle's and Allbeury's books tackle the new situation in the former Soviet Union and its erstwhile satellites. Several newish writers have set books in the former Soviet Union where the decline of the Communist Party, the army and the KGB offers fertile ground for adventure stories. The independent republics' rivalry with Russia and the dominance of mafia-style gangs should also provide give plenty of material. Nik Gowing's The Loop (Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 312pp.) is concerned with an Uzbek gang leader attempting to get control of Russia's dwindling supply of gold. It is good on the former Soviet Union and has some fine vignettes of the despair and desperation of people who have grown up within the system. But the plot does not really sing. The Third Trinity by Vitali Vitaliev and Derek Kartun (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 314pp) gives an interesting twist to the pre-eminence of the gangs in the Soviet territories by hanging the story on the discovery of a priceless icon: a third version of the Old Testament Trinity by Russia's greatest icon painter, the Black Monk, Andrei Roublev. This enables the authors to provide two tales for the price of one, since there is skulduggery in the international art market and corruption in the former Soviet Union. It is convincing - but less than compulsively thrilling. A third now-that-the-Soviet- Union-has-broken-up book is Darkness at Noon by John Hands (Harper Collins Pounds 14.99. 236pp.) This is the paciest of the three and it is all about destabilisation of the Ukraine by Russian agents. Two of these three books have been written by journalists but it is difficult to see the connection between a professional journalistic grasp of the realities of a newly-opened up Soviet Union and a good thriller. Frederick Forsyth probably has a lot to answer for - arguably he did the worst disservice to journalists since Ernest Hemingway, because his crisp style makes it all seem so simple and creates the impression that any hack can write a best-seller and be free of the daily journalistic grind with one bound. Working journalists often have problems with getting the pace right. James Adams is a case in point. His new novel, Taking the Tunnel (Michael Joseph Pounds 9.99, 404pp) combines corruption in Hongkong with a Channel Tunnel drama. Adams is described as a leading authority on covert warfare, terrorism, weapons and international relations. I am sure he is, but in this book the welter of specialist information acts as a brake on the action. James Adams as also been described as the natural successor to Forsyth, but if anybody qualifies on the evidence of the current spate of books it is David Mason. Shadow Over Babylon (Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 484pp) has been much-hyped, and deservedly so. It is about a plot to assassinate Saddam Hussein and is gripping from the word go. The writing is crisp and sharp. The mise-en-scene is terrific. Even the sex scenes are not embarrassing. Terence Strong's new book, Stalking Horse (Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 15.99, 369pp.) is also about the Gulf War. It is a pity it has to compete with Shadow Over Babylon. My find of the season. however, is Edna Buchanan. Her novel, Contents Under Pressure (Simon &amp; Schuster Pounds 14.99, 277pp) has as its heroine Britt Montero, a crime reporter for a Miami newspaper. As she pursues an apparently straightforward crime she becames embroiled in racial tensions and riots. Women detectives have become fashionable in US fiction lately. Crime and corruption in deteriorating US cities have been fuelling some excellent novelists, notably Elmore Leonard, George V. Higgins and Pete Dexter. Unlike them, Edna Buchanan's forte is not so much the ear for dialogue but the verisimilitude of her action descriptions and the almost Chandleresque bathos of her professional and personal problems. This is the first of her Britt Montero books. Good.</p>

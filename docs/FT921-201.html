			<p>920331 FT  31 MAR 92 / Canadian trawlers in fishing protest A FLEET of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia trawlers is today due to claim two areas of the high seas for Canada, in protest at overfishing by foreign vessels. The deep-sea trawlers, which left from St John's, Newfoundland, at the weekend, will anchor a fishing boat near the 200-mile limit in a symbolic assertion of rights over valuable fishing grounds. Canada's continental shelf extends beyond the 200-mile limit at two points, the so-called Nose and Tail of the Grand Banks, east of Newfoundland. Canadian officials say this has left its fish stocks, which straddle the limit, prey to the unregulated activities of foreign vessels. In February Canada reduced its quotas for northern cod in its own waters for this year to 120,000 tonnes from 185,000 tonnes, warning of environmental catastrophe unless catches were reduced and the stocks allowed to recover. Ottawa has waged a long battle against the activities of European Community vessels beyond its territorial waters, directing its fiercest criticism against Spain and Portugal. However, many Canadian inshore fishermen say their own offshore fleet must take a share of the blame for overfishing. The federal government is coming under political pressure to act against foreign vessels. Mr John Crosbie, fisheries minister, warned last week that Canada would press the issue hard at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June. Theoretically, fishing beyond the territorial limit is overseen by the North Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, of which both Canada and the EC are signatories. However, an objection procedure allows signatories to bypass Nafo quotas and set their own limits. Even these unilateral curbs are widely ignored, Canada claims.</p>

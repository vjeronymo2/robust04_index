			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / Observer: Sun stroke Not normally given to metaphorical flourishes, Chris Patten excelled himself yesterday. In a lengthy policy speech, the governor of Hong Kong opined that its final 1,000 days under British rule were not at all the same thing as the last 1,000 days of Hong Kong per se. Patten concluded: 'The sun sets, and the sun rises.' What exactly did he mean? Some imagined the metaphor might have wider application - sunset UK, etc, etc - but Patten hastily scotched that idea, though he struggled to find examples of sunrise UK. Inspiration eventually dawned, albeit from an unlikely source. 'I'm sure that those who are meeting in - er - Blackpool this week (where the Labour party has been staging its annual hand-wringing binge) would not like to think of setting suns.' Patten finally had to admit the metaphor didn't work. Piquant, isn't it, that he will be leaving his office at midnight?</p>

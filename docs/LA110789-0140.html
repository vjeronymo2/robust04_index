			<p><P> November 7, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: KNOCKING THE BIG APPLE WITH NARY AN APOLOGY  </P> <P> Tom Brokaw had to apologize to New York City for knocking the town during a  news broadcast. I am going to talk about New York today, but I have no  intention of following his example. The reason for this is that New Yorkers  never offer me an apology, so why should I apologize to them?  </P> <P> Here are some random notes about the Big Apple that I jotted down on my last  trip:  </P> <P> The first thing a visitor notices is that all the people on the street are  talking to themselves. The assumption is that they are mentally disturbed. This  is not the case. The people talking to themselves are the sane ones -- it's the  New Yorkers who talk to each other who are crazy.  </P> <P> New York City has won the Nobel Prize for potholes. What makes the potholes so  special is that they are not only in the streets but also on the sidewalks. In  New York a person has twice as many chances of breaking an ankle when walking  than when riding a bus.  </P> <P> It is not generally known, but each New Yorker averages eight fights a day with  total strangers. The fights are mostly verbal and only in rare cases do they  become physical. When he returns home at night the family is waiting to find  out how many he won. This is how it goes:  </P> <P> "So, Dad, how did you do with the fights today?"  </P> <P> "I won five and lost three."  </P> <P> "Not bad for an old man."  </P> <P> "Who are you calling an old man? Show me another New Yorker over 50 who can  still win 'The Big One' in the subway."  </P> <P> "Who did you beat, Dad?"  </P> <P> "I went up against a cabdriver who drove right through a puddle and splashed  water all over my pants."  </P> <P> "Did you give him a piece of your mind?"  </P> <P> "No, he sped off. Another cab came along and had to stop for a red light, so I  yelled at him instead. You should have seen the look on his face."  </P> <P> "Bully for you, Dad."  </P> <P> "Later on I was waiting to make a telephone call at a public phone box on  Broadway. I stood for 10 minutes while some guy made obscene telephone calls to  his ex-wife.  </P> <P> "He hung up, and I was about to take the receiver when this little old lady  pushed me aside and grabbed the phone. Being a New Yorker, I said, as polite as  can be, 'I think I was waiting longer, Shorty.' Do you know what she did? She  gave me the finger."  </P> <P> "A little old lady did that to you at a public phone booth?"  </P> <P> "They'll do it anywhere they can. So, I lost that one. Next, I went into a big  department store to buy a pair of socks. The guy at the sock counter was  nibbling on the neck of the girl selling cologne. 'Please,' I said, 'all I want  are some socks.' The girl sprayed cologne into the salesman's ear. I got  impatient and shouted, 'I want socks.' The guy didn't move, but the store  detective came over, shoved his chest against mine and said, 'Can't you see the  man is on his lunch hour?' "  </P> <P> "Fifteen years ago you would have won that one, Pop. Salespeople can smell when  a customer is over the hill and doesn't have any fight left in him any more."  </P> <P> "My greatest victory came after I saw a mugging this afternoon, 10 feet away  from me."  </P> <P> "Why was it such a triumph?"  </P> <P> "The mugger got away so no one asked me to be a witness."  </P></p>

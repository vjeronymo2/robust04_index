			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report under the "All-Russia Tatar Newspaper </F> YEDINSTVO" rubric: "Candidates Determined"]    [Text] The election race in Tatarstan is proceeding with  renewed vigor after the first round failed to produce a result.  The "Equal Rights and Legality" electoral bloc, comprising seven  democratically oriented parties and movements, is showing the  greatest initiative.    The newspaper IZVESTIYA TATARSTANA reports that the bloc  determined its list of candidate deputies to the Russian  Parliament at a routine session. They include political  scientist Vladimir Belyayev and Tatarstan Supreme Soviet Deputy  Valentin Mikhaylov. They gained the greatest number of votes in  December's election. Senior Lecturer at Kazan University  Aleksandr Shtanin is being nominated from "Russia's Choice," and  Rayon Soviet worker Yuriy Rostovshchikov from the "Yabloko" bloc.    In the meantime, the newspaper comments, the opposition has  also become active. The "Defense for the Tatarstan President"  committee has examined the question of "whether it is expedient  to conduct Russian elections on the territory of the sovereign  Republic of Tatarstan." It came to the conclusion: "Elections  to the Russian Parliament should not take place in Tatarstan as  the republic did not sign the Federation Treaty. What is more,  it has its own Constitution."</p>

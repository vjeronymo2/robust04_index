			<p>910501 FT  01 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Blackwood Hodge Pounds 17.9m in red and ceasing payouts BLACKWOOD HODGE, the international distributor of earth-moving equipment taken over last autumn by BM Group, reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.9m for the six months ended last December compared with a profit of Pounds 11.4m a year earlier. It said it would cease paying dividends on preferred or ordinary shares because difficult trading conditions were likely to result in a 'substantial deficit of distributable reserves' for the period to end-June. Turnover fell from Pounds 240.1m to Pounds 181.7m, reflecting disposals and other actions initiated by BM. Restructuring costs and the write-down of assets resulted in an extraordinary loss of Pounds 13.9m. The net loss after the charge and the last preference share dividends totalling Pounds 725,000 was Pounds 34.9m (12.74p per share) against a profit of Pounds 6m (5.09p) before. The company will continue to report results because its preference shares remain outstanding but it has changed its fiscal year-end to June 30 to match BM's.</p>

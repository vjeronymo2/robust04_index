			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By So Lai-fun] </F>   [Text] Senior Chinese official Lu Ping yesterday said he  saw no major obstacle to ending the seven-year Sino-British  dispute over the handover of Hong Kong's defence land. Mr Lu,  director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs  Office, said he hoped the two sides would reach agreement as  soon as possible. "I think there is no major obstacle," he said  in Beijing before meeting a delegation from the Hong Kong  Chinese Manufacturers' Association.    In Hong Kong, leaders of the Joint Liaison Group ended the  first day of the 16th round of formal negotiations on defence  land after progress was made in last week's informal meetings.  British team leader Alan Paul said the informal meetings  conducted since last Tuesday were "positive" and had succeeded  in narrowing differences. "Both sides are doing their very best  to bring these discussions to a successful conclusion as early  as possible," he said. His Chinese counterpart, Chen Zuo'er,  said the two sides were making progress.    Both refused to give a date for the liaison group's  forthcoming plenum, expected to be held by the end of the month.  Last month, both [as published] sides failed to strike a  long-expected deal on the military land, with China accusing  Britain of a lack of co- operation. Mr Chen said Britain had  withheld information which China had demanded for seven years.  But he did not specify what was wanted. Britain said China had  raised "new demands" including a request for a bigger naval  basin and the with holding of one of the 25 military sites it  had promised to give to the Government for redevelopment.</p>

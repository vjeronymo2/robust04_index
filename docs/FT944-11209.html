			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (26): Cultural elite are ready for change - Voices for reform versus the traditional party line / Since the mid-1980s, Hong Kong and Taiwan have become the real cultural trend-setters on the Chinese mainland In China, packaging is everything. Even cultural dissidents have learnt that with the correct marketing ploys, being on the fringe does not mean you are on the 'outside.' While Labour activists and human rights campaigners - especially those in the provinces who have never enjoyed the international media limelight in Beijing or Shanghai - are regularly harassed and jailed, the more colourful and controversial rowdies enjoy an enthralling, symbiotic relationship with the authorities. Take, for example, the case of China Through the Third Eye, the publishing cause celebre of recent months. Highly critical of the conditions of 'primitive capitalism' that many of the Communist Party's economic reforms have inculcated in China, including social inequities and rampant corruption, the book gained a wide readership over the summer. An official ban was issued and the black-market value of the volume soared. The author of the book had given voice to a number of 'conservative' opinions (this depends on your reading of the Chinese political spectrum which can mean anti-reform, pro-state authority, or leftist deviationist), and it was touted as being the incisive work of a German scholar. Yet no such scholar can be found: it turned out that for maximum publicity-value, the publisher and the real author, a man who goes under the name Wang Shan, had created the foreign persona. In the days when Party censorship was at its height, such a book would not have hit the streets. Today, as in the case of so many works (like Jia Pingwa's best-selling 1993 pornographic pulp novel The Necropolis), publishers produce and sell a book before the authorities bother imposing a ban. Subsequently, copies are withdrawn and a suitable fine - in some instances, negotiated - is then imposed. In the meantime, everyone has been able to read the offending volume and dividends are shared all around. Such a state of affairs begs some questions: Is this ironical censorship, a state where everything banned has after-the-fact quotation marks around it? Is China the first post-modern totalitarian nation? Or is it that the commissars' hearts are just not in their work any more? Meanwhile, mainstream official culture still churns out its usual product-line of stodgy propaganda pieces gussied-up in the tawdry drag of Hong Kong and Taiwan pop culture. There are endless 'soap operas' about Party officials and the good fight, the regulation number of politically-correct war movies and tear-jerkers, plus reams of printed propaganda fulfilling state quotas at every level. But strapped by limited funds and suffering from a serious image problem, the cultural authorities - a nationwide network of bureaucracies covering every aspect of cultural activity and life in the country - have been in retreat for some years. The impact of more ideologically steadfast elements is summed up in the common Beijing saying that 'their rule doesn't extend beyond the Third Ring Road (of Beijing),' since all they control is a couple of journals and newspapers, and they only have the support of a handful of officials. The real mainstream these days is the sensational tabloid press. More than 2,000 newspapers are now registered for publication, many of which have appeared in the last two years. Scandal, murder and mayhem are the stuff of popular entertainment. Starved of such pap on television - unless they have a satellite dish, or wok as dishes are called in Chinese - to receive StarTV or MTV, the masses turn to movies (mostly pirated offshore videos); pulp fiction (Mills and Boon has recently fixed a gimlet eye on the Chinese mainland market); and saccharine Canto-pop from Hong Kong and Taiwan. Since the mid-1980s, Hong Kong and Taiwan have become the cultural trend-setters on the mainland. They are modern, their communications more developed and their consumer cultures more sophisticated than those of the more stodgy and out-of-touch capital, Beijing, in the north. Even the 'underground' - non-official musicians, artists, film-makers, writers and thinkers - have increasingly surfaced to sign contracts with Hong Kong and Taiwan outlets. Younger cultural figures have noted the success of the leading film-makers Zhang Yimou and Chen Kaige, and even their own fringe colleagues such as the middle-aged poet Mang Ke, a founding editor of the non-official 1970s journal Today, whose novel Unruly Acts, a fictional account of his early literary career, was published earlier this year. They see the possibilities of using China as a backdrop for artistic endeavours that are aimed at an elite Western or middle-class Asian audience, and the exigencies of exploiting China's reputation as a repressive totalitarian state for the marketing of their work. Like their Hong Kong and Taiwan compatriots this group remains at the forefront of a process of 'Othering the Motherland,' a process of exploiting the mystique of socialist China. They still get banned and harassed, but those who have made a name for themselves are feted internationally. It should be pointed out, however, that there are still many cultural taboos. While gay themes have been exploited more readily, cross-undressing is a no-no. In mid-June, the transgressive cross-dressing performance artist Ma Liuming of Beijing stripped himself naked in his courtyard house in front of an audience of nine. He then proceeded to cook a large pot of sweet potatoes garnished with an earring and a watch. This stew was then ceremoniously interred. The coup de grace came when police detained the performer, his assistant and the entire audience. Ma may have fallen into a little bother, but his stunt has set him on the path to protective renown. His 'work' is featured in a new snazzy non-official art journal that appeared in Beijing in September. It is run by editors who commute between the Chinese capital and New York. The writer, Geremie Barme, is co-author of 'New Ghosts, Old Dreams: Chinese Rebel Voices'</p>

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Survey of Venture and Development Capital (5): The spotlight falls on 3i - Corporate Moves The most significant corporate move of the year was the flotation of 3i, valuing Europe's largest investor in private companies at about Pounds 1.6bn. The big question the flotation raises is whether 3i will change the way it does business. It already dominates smaller deals through a national network of profitable offices near the source of deals. And there are few signs it will move quickly back into the more competitive larger deals, following its unhappy investment in the Isosceles buy-in of Gateway supermarkets which led to a Pounds 72m write-off in 1992. But there is some question as to whether key deal makers in regional offices might be tempted away now that they can cash in share options. Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive, is adamant that nothing has changed - 'the flotation is not affecting the way we do business,' he says. 'We took the steps we thought were necessary to make it a manageable investment trust two to three years ago.' For other venture capitalists, 3i's move into the limelight on the fringes of the FT-SE 10 index will raise the profile of the industry to a level it has rarely enjoyed before. The flotation did not go altogether smoothly. On the day before the issue was priced in June, the FT-SE 100 index fell 40 points. While institutions over-subscribed, the public only wanted 1.1 times the shares they were offered. But from the first day, trading in the shares has been buoyant. Stockmarket analysts say there is steady institutional demand for what is still a relatively illiquid stock that is likely to join the FT-SE 100 index and that many of who bought in the float have tucked their allocation away for the long term. The 13 per cent discount at which 3i was launched has steadily narrowed. Now the debate is whether the shares are trading at a discount or a premium to a net asset value which was last assessed in March. For some institutions, 3i will be their first investment in venture capital. Unquoted investments are interesting at the moment because smaller companies tend to recover fastest during the early stages of a economic recovery. Institutional investors who want an exposure to private equity investment have had to choose between relatively illiquid investment in venture capital funds or the quoted venture capital trusts. 3i, on other hand, offers both liquidity from publicly quoted shares and a portfolio which spreads risk across 3500 companies. What is more, when 3i's last asset valuation was struck in March, the group was using the published audited earnings figures up to June 1993 for more than half its investments. This leaves a full year of company recovery for many companies which has been less than fully reflected in 3i's net asset values, analysts say. A 3i investment may not yield as much as the best performing venture funds over time. But it represents a punt on the recovery of the UK's Mittelstand companies, without the illiquidity of investing in large funds. This could be good news, not just for 3i's founding shareholders. The high street banks and the Bank of England are likely to contemplate placing some of their remaining 55 per cent stake in 3i after June next year. Other venture capitalists could also benefit. If institutions become more accustomed to private equity investment, they might consider making venture capital a recognised asset class as it is in the US. Institutions might then formally allocate a percentage of funds to the class, securing a more certain flow of capital to the industry. The 3i flotation could also bring greater transparency to the valuation of unquoted companies, for long something of mysterious art rather than a science. There have been cases where venture capitalists which were co-investing have reported different values for the same investment, each describing their approach as 'conservative'. Such anomalies are unlikely to engender confidence in wider institutional interest in the asset class. But with 3i giving a detailed description of its valuation policy in its offer document, and other quoted venture capital trusts becoming more forthright about their basis of valuation, potential investors are hopeful a standard approach will evolve. What about the way 3i does business? Some competitors question whether the group will change its approach to customers under pressure from new shareholders. In particular, they question whether 3i will break with its tradition of not interfering with management's prerogative to decide if and when they should sell their company, thus providing 3i with an exit. 3i vigorously denies there will be a change. The company says it gains a competitive advantage from the approach that leaves management in control of the timing of any sale. In any case, the portfolio turns over at its own pace, it argues, providing the necessary realisation of capital gains. Quite apart from the damage that such a shift would do to a unique selling point, 3i argues it is under much less pressure to realise capital gains than a venture capitalist that raises fixed life funds. In other respects, 3i was already changing ahead of the flotation, casting off a fusty, avuncular image that had developed since its formation as the Industrial and Commercial Finance Corporation after the war. It has pulled out of markets where it has no particular advantage - the US, property investment and consultancy. In doing so, it has cut staff from 940 to 570, with a much smaller reduction in the number of people focused on its core business - 'it didn't make sense to have a large management consultancy nor large dealing profits from property or to try to have a business in the US,' Macpherson says. But there are signs 3i is leveraging up its market position more aggressively. For the first time, 3i this year raised two funds from external investors, breaking with a tradition of only investing off the strength of its own balance sheet. The first is a Ecu 300m fund for co-investment in continental European management buy-outs and buy-ins. This was designed to allow 3i to expand faster internationally through its remaining foreign offices without putting pressure on its balance sheet. The second - a fund for co-investment in UK buy-outs larger than Pounds 10m  -will potentially have a greater impact on 3i's competition. In the past 3i has tended to syndicate chunks of its larger deals - Pounds 250m worth over the last 10 years - because it does not take majority positions on boards. The new fund will allow 3i to retain a greater amount of deals for its own benefit. The group was aiming to raise Pounds 100m from up to five institutions but, with the flotation looming, it closed the fund after raising only Pounds 75m from the Norwich Union and Australian Mutual Provident. But these two funds are only a toe in the water. Given a favourable investment performance, 3i is likely to raise more funds, reducing the supply of deals it syndicates to the market and increasing competition for new funds.</p>

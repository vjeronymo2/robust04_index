			<p><P> July 24, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> REGIONAL ROUNDUP: NO INQUIRY PLANNED IN PLAYERS' PHONE GAME  </P> <P> A congressman who had raised questions about telephone call-in games does not  plan to investigate Players International's new game, Players said.  </P> <P> Executives of Agoura Hills-based Players made the announcement last week after  meeting with Rep. Bart Gordon (D-Tenn.) and agreeing to cooperate in Gordon's  overall effort to eliminate abuses in the burgeoning 900-number telephone  services industry.  </P> <P> Gordon has questioned whether some of the games constitute gambling.  </P> <P> In June, Players announced plans for a 900 version of the "Jeopardy!" TV game  show, and it is also planning a version of "Wheel of Fortune."  </P> <P> After Gordon's concerns were reported June 13, Players' stock fell 30%, but the  stock rebounded somewhat after Players said Gordon does not plan to investigate  its show. The stock closed at $5.375 a share in over-the-counter trading  Monday.  </P> <P> Players primarily operates a club that offers discounts to gamblers at casino  resorts.  </P></p>

			<p>930401 FT  01 APR 93 / Technology: The elusive road to success - Andrew Fisher continues a series on innovation by examining the complex process of marketing an idea MIKE Watson's eyes light up when he recalls the thrill of 'the Eureka moment' that changed his life three years ago. It was then the idea for a device to send or receive information through any section of a twin-core cable came to him. 'It's a wonderful feeling when you realise that you've come up with something that's the first in the world.' But elation can soon turn into doubt and anxiety. Bringing an invention successfully to market is often a monumental task and success is elusive. Patents have to be obtained, prototypes made, legal agreements concluded and business persuaded to take an interest. 'In human terms you're very, very alone. It can be very depressing,' says Watson. Today, Watson is starting to earn money from his invention, having licensed it to two companies. Called the Watsonlinc cable coupling transformer, its potential applications cover telecommunications, computers, communication in difficult areas such as in tunnels, and medicine and science. Along the way, he has been helped by Britain's Design Council, which runs the Innovation NoticeBoard to put industry in touch with new ideas, as well as by helpful patent and licence agents, and the London Enterprise Agency. He has also won innovation awards. Yet the process has taken plenty of money, as well as effort and frustration. So far, he reckons the cost has been around Pounds 100,000 - mainly on patent and development expenses, but also in lost income. Jeffrey Woolf has also had to dip deep into his pockets, and those of friends and family. His pursuit of the hoped-for commercial breakthrough has cost some Pounds 70,000. Woolf is not so far down the road to commercial success as Watson, despite having also won innovation awards for his micromap - a miniaturised map with a portable magnifier. The idea came to him while watching skiers struggle to find their way in a snowstorm on the French slopes early in 1991, their maps flapping uselessly in the wind. He is now talking to groups of potential investors interested in some of micromap's sporting, technical, and consumer applications. In common with countless other inventors, both men's lives have been dominated by the ideas born from their flashes of inspiration. John Endacott, who has invented a new type of separation vessel to separate oil from water on floating production platforms, has found his enthusiasm dented by the struggle to gain commercial recognition. 'As an engineer,' he says of his own experience, 'you've suddenly got to become a patent expert, understand licence agreements and contracts and do your own marketing.' He now has licences with two process engineering companies. Like Watson, he took out a second mortgage on his home to help finance his idea. 'There's a lot of strain on finances, health and family,' adds Endacott. He turned for help to Inventalink, an invention sales company which seeks to match new products with partners for licensing deals. Inventalink helped Endacott with commercial negotiations, using its experience to gain access to executives. Although organisations like Inventalink, which take a share of income in return for their efforts, cannot guarantee success - some brokers are keener on taking inventors' money than helping them, say innovation experts - they are one source of guidance. 'There's clearly a desperate need for private inventors to have a platform from which to launch new ideas at any stage of development,' says Charles Dawes, Inventalink's managing director. 'The British inventor needs help, needs a more helpful bank manager with more courage and needs firms to take up the idea and re-license it round the world.' Encouragingly, Inventalink has experienced a pick-up of activity in recent months, suggesting the long-awaited ending of the recession could lead to greater opportunities for inventors and innovators. Tudor Webasto, a German-owned manufacturer of car sunroofs, is using its services to find new vehicle safety products to help future growth. 'It would be regrettable if we didn't explore new ideas,' says Alan Garnett, Tudor's chief executive. He points out that the slim profit margins British manufacturers have had to accept in recent years means many do not have the financial capacity to explore a number of ideas. 'So there is a need to be ultra-selective.' For UK inventors seeking partners to take up their ideas, the Design Council, funded by the Department of Trade and Industry, is an obvious port of call. Its Innovation NoticeBoard is free, but highly selective in the products it includes. Susan Cottam, manager of the scheme, says individuals are probably best advised to find companies to license their products and thus start earning royalties, rather than try to raise funds for their own manufacture. 'We try to find out what's happening in the market and keep in contact with enterprise agencies and TECs (Training and Enterprise Councils),' she says. 'There is a pillar-to-post effect, since the various organisations are not very well networked.' The government is trying to help and plans to set up 15 pilot One Stop Shops to advise small firms. It also has schemes to finance technological innovations, but their scope is limited. Some people prefer to go it alone. James Dyson, who has moved from designing to inventing and manufacturing, is sceptical of the value of licensing and also of the level of official help offered to promote new ideas and products. His latest product is the Dual Cyclone vacuum cleaner that has just gone on sale in the UK. 'If anyone asked me, I would say 'go and make it yourself, as it's quicker and cheaper'. It depends, of course, on the product and market area.' The first, expensive, version of the vacuum cleaner, which uses high-speed cyclone technology, is made by Silver Reed, the Japanese typewriter company, and sold only in Japan. His newer, far less expensive model, is made by his own company in the UK. He finds the attitude of much of British industry to innovation depressing. 'Companies tend to be run by accountants, salesmen and lawyers. They don't value engineers or products.' In the US and Japan, however, he says there is a large commitment to research. 'It's a real eye-opener working with a Japanese company. Their attitude is extraordinary. They're not in it for a quick buck.' British companies, he feels, are often bad at taking up and commercialising ideas. They also fear failure, though mistakes are inevitable with innovation. Illustrating the problems new products can encounter in the UK, Dyson says it was hard to buy British parts for the Dual Cyclone: the motor is Italian, the switch and accessory tools German, the ball bearings Chinese, the flex French and the plastic comes from the Netherlands. Also concerned about the UK's slowness in bringing new ideas to market is Paul Ambridge, chairman of the Institute of Patentees and Inventors. 'The UK as a nation is extraordinary inventive. However, what we are poor at is using our capabilities to produce products.' Adds Ambridge, who is also a Design Council official: 'We don't necessarily have either the people or the organisations that can take an invention and make it into an innovation.' Hilary Trudeau, who manages Support for Innovation as a national service for companies to screen new ideas, believes that lack of funding is one of Britain's biggest problems. Banks often shy away from lending to technology-oriented ventures, though National Westminster has a trailbreaking Technology Unit. So attention has turned to the encouragement of 'business angels', the US-derived definition for successful entrepreneurs willing to help new firms, as a way of filling this financial gap. Yet angels are not always easy to find. Some corporations have funded awards to help budding innovators, but recessionary cost-cutting has taken its toll of these. Trudeau, who was involved with the NatWest/BP awards, is trying to raise money for another corporate prize scheme to assist people with commercially viable ideas. 'There is a yawning need for this,' she says. Inventors desperate for funds to keep their ideas and products alive long enough to reach the marketplace are bound to agree.

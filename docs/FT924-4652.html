			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / International Capital Markets: Banamex hopes to raise Dollars 350m from debt issue BANAMEX, one of the leading banks in Mexico, is hoping to raise more than Dollars 350m with an unusual convertible debt issue. The deal, which is one of the largest convertible debt issues from an emerging market, will prove an important test of investor appetite for Mexican paper, given that conditions for Latin American equity and bond issues have been difficult recently. Banamex - otherwise known as Banco Nacional de Mexico - is issuing Dollars 350m of seven-year subordinated exchangeable debentures which can be exchanged into shares in Banacci, the quoted Mexican holding company which owns Banamex. The deal, which was due to be priced last night or today, will probably be split with around Dollars 250m for international investors and Dollars 100m for domestic investors. The debentures are expected to pay interest of about 7 to 7.5 per cent. International investors with an interest in Latin American issues are expected to watch this issue closely given the recent difficulties experienced by Latin American names in the equity and bond markets. The steep drop in the Mexican stock market in the summer forced Banacci to abandon its Dollars 1.4bn equity offering in June, and several other Mexican names which had hoped to raise new money with international share offerings have had to shelve their plans. In the international bond markets, fears of oversupply forced yields on Latin American issues to widen considerably. Investment bankers are wondering whether the structure of the Banamex subordinated exchangeable debenture, for which Goldman Sachs is lead manager, will prove more successful in wooing back investors. Banacci is hoping to obtain a listing on the New York Stock Exchange next year and has not ruled out the possibility of launching a global equity offering once market conditions improve, according to investment bankers.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Qin Xingmin, chief procurator of the Hainan </F> Provincial People's Procuratorate, to the Second Session of the  First Hainan Provincial People's Congress on 3 March 1994:  "Work Report of the Hainan Provincial People's Procuratorate"]    [Text] Deputies,    In 1993, the provincial procuratorial organs at all levels  conscientiously carried out the work deployment of the  provincial party committee and the Supreme People's  Procuratorate, put into practice the guidelines of the First  Session of the First Provincial People's Congress, effectively  performed the basic duties of procuratorial organs regarding  "cracking down on crime, protecting the people, supervising law  enforcement, and serving the economy," stuck to the work  principle of "strictly enforcing the law and taking firm control  of handling cases," firmly grasped the work focuses of  anticorruption struggle and severe crackdown on serious criminal  offenses, and intensified the supervisory work of law  enforcement and the building of procuratorial personnel, so that  new progress was made in all fields of endeavor. I should now  like to brief you on the conditions of our major tasks as  follows:  <H5>  I. Resolutely Carrying Out the Unified Deployment of the </H5> Party's Central Committee and Provincial Party Committee on  Anticorruption Struggle and Concentrating Our Efforts on  Checking and Acting on Major Important Cases of Corruption and  Bribery    In 1993, procuratorial organs at all levels across the  province accepted and heard 527 cases of economic crimes  including corruption, bribery, and so on, and placed 177 cases  on file for investigation and prosecution. Of the total, there  were 89 corruption cases, 17 bribery cases, and 49 cases of  misappropriation of public funds; there were also 134 major  cases involving 10,000 yuan or above, which accounted for 75.7  percent of the total cases filed for prosecution, higher than  the national average of 29 percent. Of the major cases  involving more than 10,000 yuan, five cases involved between  500,000 and 1 million yuan, and nine cases exceeded 1 million  yuan. In these important cases, seven cadres at and above  county departmental level were investigated and acted upon. In  addition, 13 cases of tax evasion or tax resistance and five  cases of forged trademarks were filed for investigation and  prosecution and legal proceedings were also instituted against  129 offenders. Economic losses recovered for the state and the  people amounted to 74.24 million yuan. Taken as a whole,  relatively remarkable achievements have been made by the  province's procuratorial organs thanks to their clear-cut  guiding ideology on the anticorruption struggle. After Comrade  Jiang Zemin's speech at the Second Plenum of the Central  Commission for Discipline Inspection was published, the  provincial party committee called an enlarged meeting of the  standing committee to make arrangements for the anticorruption  struggle, thus creating a favorable macroclimate for the  struggle. In light of the deployment made by the provincial  party committee and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the  party group of the provincial people's procuratorate  successively called a number of special meetings to study the  anticorruption struggle. Our general idea was: While waging the  struggle, the procuratorial organs should fight on two fronts --  1) in society, we should resolutely punish economic criminals  involved in corruption, bribery, and so on, increase the  crackdown intensity, and stop the corrupt phenomena from  spreading; and 2) within the ranks of cadres, we should  intensify education on honesty and self-discipline, concentrate  our efforts on rectifying malpractices, severely check and act  on the corrupt elements who seek personal interests by abuse of  power, and purify the contingent of procuratorial personnel. In  line with this idea, we made concrete assignments for the  procuratorial organs throughout the province to carry out the  anticorruption struggle in timely fashion. As a result, the  province's procuratorial organs at all levels took prompt action  to conscientiously put into effect the central instructions on  the campaign against corruption and, in light of the  requirements set by the provincial party committee and the  people's procuratorate, concentrated their energy on  investigating and dealing with the major important cases,  thereby starting an upsurge in handling cases. The number of  cases filed for investigation and prosecution since last August  increased substantially compared with the first half of the  year. The number of cases accepted and heard during the five  months from August to December was 159 more than that in the  previous seven months, while the number of cases filed for  investigation and prosecution and the number of major important  cases identified and dealt with were 29 and 30 cases more  respectively than those in the previous seven months. Several  exceptionally big cases which had a bearing on society were also  checked and acted upon, which included the frame-up and  bribe-taking case of Li Shanyou, former deputy secretary general  of the provincial government office; the fund misappropriation  and bribe-taking case of Jia Xiaoming, former clerk of the  international business department of the People's Construction  Bank of China, Hainan Branch; the embezzlement and bribe-taking  case of Lin Guangsen, general manager of Hainan Kanghai  Industrial Corporation; and so on. In addition, we also  organized various forces to participate in checking and dealing  with the "17 December" extraordinarily serious tax fraud and the  exceptionally big swindling case of the Great Wall Science and  Technology Industrial Company which shook the entire country.  While paying serious attention to placing cases on file for  investigation and prosecution, procuratorial organs at all  levels also took the settlement of cases as a significant aspect  which reflected the achievements of investigating and dealing  with major and important cases in that stage. They investigated  and wound up a number of cases in a timely manner and, in  coordination with the courts, prosecuted and openly dealt with a  number of criminal offenders. For example, the Haikou City  People's Procuratorate concentrated its picked personnel on  handling and winding up the most serious bribery case since the  PRC's founding at a fast speed by working extra hours, where  five principal criminals, including Xue Genhe, were sentenced to  death according to the law in late September and three other  criminals were sentenced to imprisonment for set terms. Another  criminal, Jiang Wei, former head of the provincial planning  department, who was investigated by the anticorruption bureau of  the provincial people's procuratorate for his involvement in the  extremely big bribe-taking case, was prosecuted by the people's  court and sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of his  political rights for life in mid-October.    In summing up the anticorruption work over the past year,  particularly since last August, we have adopted the following  principal measures:    1. We conscientiously intensified leadership and  guidance over the anticorruption work. At the beginning of  last year, the provincial procuratorate sent four work teams led  by members of the party group to go deep into the grass-roots  units, inspect their work, and provide them with guidance. In  the second quarter, it again enlisted four work teams to help  grass-roots units screen the accumulated cases and place new  cases on file for investigation. In April, a forum of the  provincial chief procurators was held to put into effect the  guidelines of the Supreme People's Procuratorate on the  intensification of the anticorruption struggle. The provincial  people's procuratorate issued a circular to the lower levels on  the enhancement of anticorruption work and a provincial meeting  on case reporting work was also held at the end of that month.  In July, we convened the second provincial procuratorial work  meeting, at which we adopted the "Decisions on Further Enhancing  Anticorruption Work To Serve the Socialist Market Economic  Development in the Special Economic Region" and the "Decisions  on Launching Law Enforcement Activities Among the Procuratorial  Organs Throughout the Province" with the contents of enforcing  the law in a strict, open-minded, honest, and civilized way. In  the second half of August, we called an emergency teleconference  on anticorruption work to promptly transmit to the lower levels  the spirit of the central authorities on the campaign against  corruption, proposing nine concrete measures for anticorruption  struggle in accordance with the actual conditions of Hainan,  including: Calling for provincial procuratorates at all levels  to publicize their telephone numbers for case reporting once  again; practicing a system under which mass reporting was  accepted 12 hours a day and chief procurators would receive  informants on certain days; setting up a command and  coordination center for investigating and handling major  important cases; publishing FANTAN KUAIXUN [NEWSLETTER ON  CAMPAIGN AGAINST CORRUPTION]; dividing the province into  eastern, central, and western battlefields and enlisting special  forces to give guidance to the handling of cases in the  respective battlefields; stressing the importance of chief  procurators' taking the initiative in handling cases,  particularly the major and important ones; and so on. According  to statistics, of the 25 procuratorates in the province, 31  cases involving corruption, bribery, and others were  investigated and dealt with personally by chief procurators and  59 cases were handled with their participation. By so doing,  they set a very good example for the procuratorial personnel.  In November, we again held meetings in the abovementioned three  battlefields, calling for procuratorial organs at all levels  across the province to firmly grasp the work in the last two  months of the year and concentrate efforts on investigating and  solving some more cases, prosecuting some other offenders, and  coordinating with the courts for public trials for a number of  cases to reflect the achievements at that stage.    2. We took powerful measures to mobilize the masses to  report cases. Early last year, the provincial people's  procuratorate and HAINAN FAZHI BAO jointly sponsored an "award  competition on legal knowledge of the campaign against  corruption and bribery" and comparatively good social results  were scored. In the course of implementing the central  guidelines on anticorruption since August, the procuratorial  organs at all levels throughout the province had positively  coordinated with various party committees and governments in  conducting propaganda and mobilization work on a relatively  grand scale, and various localities had made use of newspapers,  radio stations, television stations, and other media to openly  reveal a number of typical cases. Chief procurators also made  televised or broadcast speeches. In the meantime, telephone  numbers for case reporting were made public again and boxes for  case reporting increased in number. Some county and city  procuratorates also sent propaganda cars to tour villages,  factories, mines, and farms to extensively mobilize the masses  to report economic crimes of corruption, bribery, and so on,  thereby releasing the enthusiasm of the masses for case  reporting. In September alone, 173 cases were reported and  accepted for hearing, which was 3 times more than the figure for  the previous eight months, i.e., 55 cases on average. In  October, the number of cases increased by 18 percent over  September. During the five months between August and December,  788 cases were accepted and heard, 92.7 percent more than in the  corresponding period of the previous year, and 379 cases more  than those for the first seven months in 1993. This was the  peak period with the largest number of cases reported and  accepted since the founding of the reporting centers of the  provincial procuratorial organs. Moreover, there was a special  feature of "three mores and one greater," i.e., more signed  reports on cases, more clues provided for major and important  cases, and more reports concerning key departments, with a  greater value for investigation.    3. We stressed the key points and concentrated our  efforts on investigating and dealing with the criminal cases  concerning the key departments. In light of the  requirements of the central authorities, procuratorial organs at  all levels focused the crackdown on the criminal cases such as  corruption, bribery, and so on committed by personnel in party  and government organs, as well as in judicial, administrative,  law enforcement, and economic management departments. During  the five months between August and December, procuratorial  organs throughout the province placed 44 corruption and bribery  cases involving personnel from the abovementioned departments on  file for investigation and prosecution, accounting for a quarter  of the total cases on file. Of this total, there were 14 cases  that involved 20 personnel from the judicial department for  their conduct in extorting confessions from legal offenders or  government workers by torture, or of releasing them privately in  dereliction of their duties. There was a great and shocking  impact on society when these cases were checked and acted upon,  which attained good legal and social results and further  demonstrated the determination of the party and government to  punish corruption.    4) We lost no time in tracking down embezzled  money and did our utmost to recover the economic losses of the  state. In checking and acting upon the corruption and  bribery cases, procuratorial organs at all levels not only  persisted in severely punishing criminals in accordance with the  law but also surmounted all difficulties to trace and recover  embezzled money in good time. Take the Xue Genhe case as an  example. After most of the embezzled money, totaling 33.44  million yuan, had flowed out into a dozen provinces,  municipalities, and autonomous regions all over the country, the  personnel in charge of the case overcame various difficulties,  particularly the obstacle of local protectionism, to track down  and seize nearly 30 million yuan. Another 14 million yuan was  also chased after and recovered from the Jia Xiaoming and the  "17 December" extraordinarily serious tax fraud cases, which  were handled by the anticorruption bureau of the provincial  people's procuratorate. Illicit money and stolen property  equivalent to 74.24 million yuan were recovered last year, which  witnessed the largest amount of economic losses to be recovered  by the procuratorial organs since the founding of the province.    In short, since last year, and since last August in  particular, the province's procuratorial organs have taken the  initiative in firmly grasping the work to punish corruption and  check and act on major important cases so that the campaign  developed in depth in a healthy and orderly way. However,  judging from the conditions of investigating and dealing with  cases by the procuratorial organs, the tasks of the  anticorruption campaign were still extremely arduous and heavy.  Though we should affirm our achievements, we must not be  blindly optimistic. The principal characteristics of the cases  of corruption, bribery, and other economic crimes which occurred  in the province were as follows: First, the amount of money  involved in the economic crimes was increasingly larger. Over  the past few years, the proportion of major cases that involved  an amount of more than 10,000 yuan, which had been filed by the  province's procuratorial organs for investigation and  prosecution, had exceeded 70 percent, ranking in the forefront  of the entire country. This reflected the extreme rapacity of  the criminals. Second, there were a large number of crimes  committed in defiance of the anticorruption campaign, as 70  percent of the crimes were committed last year after the  crackdown began, which manifested, to a certain extent, hfow  rampant the criminals were. Third, the bribery offenses either  took the form of covert activities like "between you and me" or  the form of overt or semi-overt actions under the pretext of  engaging in the market economy. Some people took advantage of  the power in their hands to seek personal benefits, refused to  perform official duties without being paid, or even openly asked  for and accepted bribes under pretexts of every description.  Fourth, criminal cases in the economic hot spots increased and  the tactics were repeatedly changed. Some lawbreaking elements  committed crimes by availing themselves of loopholes in the  reform and opening up, the transformation from old to new  structures, and the still unsound management mechanisms. For  instance, some personnel in securities departments embezzled  money by making use of "time differences" or "price differences"  in stock trading; others misappropriated public funds for  speculation in stocks, land, houses, and so on to reap  exorbitant profits. The new situation and problems had  increased the difficulty of the procuratorial organs in their  law enforcement activities and, at the same time, set even  higher demands on them. Fifth, the corruption and bribery  criminals generally committed a variety of crimes. They usually  embezzled public funds and asked for and took bribes and so on.  After obtaining large sums of money, they squandered it by  eating and drinking extravagantly, gambling, and patronizing  prostitutes, so that the state property suffered great losses.    At present, the anticorruption struggle is developing in  depth, the masses hate the corrupt phenomena bitterly, and their  enthusiasm in the struggle is very high. However, people will  also discover that in some enterprises, there are cases which  have not been reported because they were afraid of washing their  dirty linen in public as this would tarnish their image and  affect their rating. Hence, they would rather gloss things over  within the enterprises to avoid trouble or report the cases only  after the offenders had run away with the money. Some of them  worried that they would draw fire on themselves if they exposed  such offenses, and others dared not report those corrupt  elements with power and influence, lest their own economic  interests be damaged. What is more, in investigating and  dealing with the major important cases, more often than not, the  procuratorial personnel encountered some interference and  obstruction because some people considered the anticorruption  struggle as conflicting with reform and opening up. They were  anxious that the investigation and prosecution of cases by  procuratorial organs would adversely affect reform, opening up,  and economic construction. This added manmade difficulties to  the handling of cases. As viewed from the conditions of work  performed by the province's procuratorial organs, there was  still a long distance to go from the requirements of the central  authorities and provincial party committee and from the  expectations of the people's deputies and the broad masses. In  procuratorial organs at various levels there were some major  important cases which had been placed on file for investigation  and prosecution but had not been wound up in good time; some  evidence in cases reported by the masses had not been fed back  as preliminary investigations had not been conducted; and, in a  few localities, lots of work had been done but very few results  in handling the major important cases had been scored. In  addition, the tight funds for handling cases and the backward  means of communications and investigation also restricted the  solution of cases to a certain extent, thus hindering the  progress of the anticorruption struggle. These problems should  be conscientiously resolved in out future work. We are firmly  confident that under the leadership of the provincial party  committee and party committees at various levels, under the  supervision of the people's congresses at various levels, and  with the support of governments, cadres, and masses throughout  the province, still greater achievements will certainly be  attained in investigating and dealing with the major important  cases and remarkable results will certainly be obtained in the  anticorruption struggle in our province.    II. Cracking Down Unremittingly and Severely on  Serious Criminal Activities and Safeguarding Social Stability in  the Hainan Special Economic Region    It was another work focus of the procuratorial organs to  severely crack down on serious criminal activities. Since last  year, procuratorial organs at all levels throughout the province  have persistently taken the "severe crackdown" struggle and  participation in the overall control of social security as an  important task to safeguard social stability in the special  economic region and ensure the smooth progress of reform,  opening up, and economic construction. Accordingly, new  achievements have been attained. In 1993, the province's  procuratorial organs at all levels accepted and heard 2,578  people, whom the public security organs proposed to arrest and  2,239 people of them were finally arrested. Besides, they also  accepted and heard 2,659 people transferred from the public  security organs for prosecution and legal proceedings were  initiated against 2,301 of them after examination and  investigation.    In the "severe crackdown" struggle we stuck to the principle  of dealing with crimes severely and rapidly according to the  law, with stress on cracking down on serious criminal cases and  organized underworld gangs, including murder, robbery, rape,  causing explosions, armed violence, and so on, so that their  arrests were approved and prosecution initiated in good time.  During the whole year, 519 criminals in major or exceptionally  serious cases were arrested, accounting for 23.2 percent of all  criminals arrested. In order to reflect the principle of dealing  with crimes severely and rapidly in procuratorial work, the  people's procuratorates at all levels throughout the province  persistently practiced the system of attending to major and  exceptionally serious cases ahead of time. This meant: 1)  participating in the activities of on-site inspections,  examining corpses, and so on; 2) participating in the  preliminary trials of defendants and questioning important  witnesses; and 3) participating in discussions with  investigation departments concerning the nature, evidence, and  other matters in some major difficult cases. According to  statistics, at the stage of obtaining approval for arrest, the  procuratorial organs throughout the entire province attended to  several major or exceptionally serious cases ahead of time, in  which 247 people were involved; and at the initiating  prosecution stage, they also attended to cases involving 81  people ahead of time. Take the extraordinarily serious case  committed in Haikou City as an example, the defendant Zhang  Weisen stole two submachine guns, three pistols, and 600 rounds  of ammunition from the Xiuying Frontier Station. As the Haikou  City People's Procuratorate sent personnel to attend to the case  ahead of time, it took only three days to have the case  prosecuted and lodged with the court after the public security  organ wound up the case and transferred it to be examined for  prosecution.    We intensified supervision over investigation and trial in  the work of obtaining approval for arrest and prosecution. With  regard to the intensified supervision over investigation, this  focused on the malpractices of sparing some crimes without being  investigated and dealt with and of imposing fines in lieu of  penalties. With regard to the intensified supervision over  trials, this focused on the malpractices whhereby those guilty  of crimes were acquitted, those having committed serious crimes  were given mild punishment, and those having committed minor  crimes were punished drastically. Over the past year, with the  supervision of procuratorial organs over investigation,  decisions had been made to reject applications for the arrest of  104 people, as legal requirements for their arrest had not been  met; while 64 people who should have been arrested but were not  reported by public security organs for approval, were arrested  by follow-up decisions. A total of 104 cases involving 422  people were returned to the investigation department for  supplementary evidence mainly because the facts of their crimes  had not been distinctly established and evidence was inadequate.  As regards investigation activities in violation of the law, we  made written or oral suggestions to correct them in good time.  Owing to our supervision over trials, decisions had been made  to exempt 23 people from prosecution, while 14 offenders who  should have been indicted on criminal charges but had not been  reported to the procuratorial organs, were finally prosecuted.  Besides, opposition was made to 35 cases which were wrongly  adjudicated, of which 11 cases were settled by the court and  verdicts in six cases involving 10 people were readjusted.    We took an active part in the struggle and rectification in  specific operations. Proceeding from the local reality, the  procuratorial organs at all levels across the province  coordinated with the public security organs and courts in the  unified action of "unearthing criminal gangs, striking at  convicts on the run, chasing escaped criminals, and solving  serious cases," as well as in the struggle in specific  operations aimed at combating theft, besieging "train robbers  and highwaymen," cracking down on the abduction of women and  children, prohibiting prostitution, and so on. Rectification in  specific operations was conducted in areas where problems were  numerous and public order was in chaos, to effectively safeguard  social stability in the province and ensure the safety of the  people during major festivals.    We paid serious attention to the ratification of arrest and  prosecution to guarantee the quality in handling cases. First,  we further established and improved various handling procedures  and laid firm hold of rules and regulations to ensure the  quality. Second, we stepped up investigation and study of the  new situation and problems and correctly distinguished between  crimes and noncrimes. For instance, aiming at the problems in  some localities where a lot of cases had been returned for  investigation, pronounced not guilty, or exonerated from  accusation without good reasons, we carried out investigation  and study and proposed improved measures to step up the  inspection of crucial cases and key units. The province's  subprocuratorate held a seminar to discuss the knotty problems  that had cropped up in areas under its jurisdiction in a bid to  better resolve the problems encountered in handling difficult  cases. Third, we took firm control of the work of prosecuting  criminals in court in order to elevate the overall level of  public prosecutors' ability in argument and prosecution in court.    While waging the "severe crackdown" struggle, procuratorial  organs at all levels firmly grasped the implementation of  various measures for the overall control of social security in  their work.    In handling cases, they paid attention to  discovering the hidden trouble in the management work of  relevant units, made suggestions from the procuratorial points  of view in a timely manner, and helped relevant units plug  loopholes to reduce crime. In light of the procuratorial work,  they positively conducted law propaganda in various forms and  practiced a system of paying visits to, making observations of,  providing help for, and carrying on education among the  exonerated individuals and criminals serving sentences out of  prison to prevent them from committing new crimes and to reduce  the unstable factors in society. They also handled letters and  visits from the masses in a timely manner and conscientiously  conducted education to straighten out their sentiments to avoid  sharpening the contradictions and to expeditiously eliminate  various unstable factors. In coordination with relevant  departments, they set up contact points for the overall control  of social security and launched activities to build a clean and  honest administration with concerted efforts. Moreover, they  set up prevention organs in the anticorruption departments,  placed the work of preventing corruption, bribery, and other  economic crimes as an important item on the agenda, and studied  measures for putting an end once and for all to the breeding of  corrupt phenomena.    Safeguarding political and social stability in the country  is  an important guarantee for reform and development. Generally  speaking, social security in our province is good at present.  However, we must also note soberly that the social security  situation in our province is still grim, as the occurrence of  serious criminal activities is showing a rising trend and  serious cases of violence such as murder using firearms,  robbery, and so on are still running rampant. Comparing 1993  with 1992, the number of serious cases rose by 7.3 percent and  that of extraordinarily serious cases by 8.9 percent. Criminal  activities conducted by gangs are also rather serious,  particularly by those engaging in theft and robbery along  railroads and highways and those composed of hooligans, some of  which have become underworld gangs. Along with constantly  deepening reform and the readjustment of interest relations, new  contradictions and problems will continue to crop up and factors  affecting political and social stability in our province may  increase. Since the tasks of the "severe crackdown" struggle  are still extremely formidable, we absolutely must not relax our  efforts to deal heavy and rapid blows at the serious crimes in  accordance with the law. The procuratorial organs at all levels  across the province must bring into full play their major  functional role as instruments of the people's democratic  dictatorship in safeguarding the political and social stability  in our province while persisting in implementing the "severe  crackdown" principle and closely coordinating with the  departments of public security organs, courts, and so on.  <H5>  III. Seriously Checking and Acting on Criminal Cases of </H5> "Infringing on Rights," Neglecting Duties, and Comprehensively  Performing Procuratorial Work in Various Aspects    -- Procuratorial work in respect of law and  discipline. Procuratorial departments in charge of law and  discipline at all levels across the province seriously put into  practice the principle of "strictly enforcing the law and taking  a firm hold of case handling," positively coordinated with the  anticorruption struggle, and focused their work on investigating  and dealing with the offenses of "infringing on rights" and  neglecting duties, such as practicing favoritism, committing  irregularities, extorting confessions by compulsion, illegally  detaining people, trifling with their duties, causing accidents  through negligence, and so on. Last year, 212 cases of such  offenses were accepted and heard, 24.7 percent more than 1992  and 41 cases involving 58 people were placed on file for  investigation, of which 19 cases were extraordinarily serious  and four people were involved in vitally important cases. Direct  economic losses amounting to 2.29 million yuan were recovered  for the state. Wang Shengping and Cai Yongji from the Hainan  Xinhua Accountants' Office accepted bribes to issue a false  report on asset examination for a certain investment group in  Hainan to the effect that the said "group had a paid-up capital  of $10 million," with which the group conducted an exceptionally  big swindle causing extremely serious consequences. Apart from  investigating and affixing criminal responsibility to the  abovementioned two defendants, the relevant procuratorial  department also checked and acted on the persons in charge of  the accountants' office for dereliction of duty and the case is  now placed on file for investigation and prosecution. Actions  taken by the procuratorial organs to identify and deal with  criminal cases of "infringing on rights" and dereliction of  duties according to the law have played a significant role in  intensifying the building of socialist democracy and legal  system, punishing corruption, promoting the diligent and honest  performance of official duties, and safeguarding and  facilitating the establishment and development of a market  economy.    -- Procuratorial work in respect of prisons.  Procuratorial departments in charge of prisons at all levels  across the province placed the supervision of law enforcement in  a primary position, accepted cases involving 34 recidivists, and  instituted legal proceedings against them according to the law.  Actions against the law which involved 2,726 prisoners serving  sentences in jails for reeducation through labor were corrected  in accordance with the law. Of these, 1,797 people had been  detained for longer terms and 20 people were detained without  testimony. There was a total of 77 instances of potentially  dangerous conditions in some of the detention centers and  measures were taken to correct them. Besides, 43 cases of  indictments or appeals initiated by detainees or their families  were also handled.    -- Procuratorial work in respect of indictments and  appeals. Procuratorial departments continued to conduct  activities of receiving the people in a civilized manner,  persisted in practicing the system under which chief procurators  personally attended to the letters and visits of the masses, and  further enhanced the work of case reexamination. As a result,  2,527 cases of indictments were accepted during the year of  which 2,253 cases were handled either by direct hearing and  giving replies to the persons who brought in the indictments, or  by transferring their cases to the pertinent departments.    With regard to appeals, 525 cases were accepted and 516 were  handled. The Provincial People's Procuratorate corrected the  case of Chen Taixin, a people's deputy from Ledong County, for  illegal detention and trial by the local public security bureau,  thus safeguarding the legitimate rights and interests of the  people's deputy, for which the provincial people's congress  standing committee and the province's political science and law  commission issued a special circular to affirm the correct  handling of this case.    -- Procuratorial work in respect of civil and  administrative affairs. While improving work, reinforcing  strength, and straightening out relations in organs,  procuratorial departments enthusiastically conducted work in  case handling. During last year, 55 cases of lawsuits in civil  and administrative affairs were accepted and opposition to  undeniably wrong judgments and adjudications were lodged with  the court according to the law, so that the verdicts of some of  them were revised. Although the work started late, this  supervisory function will become increasingly important under  the market economy conditions.    -- Procuratorial work in respect of investigation,  study, and information. Since last year, in light of the  comparatively weak links in the procuratorial organs across the  province in terms of investigation, study, and information, we  started deepening the understanding of personnel and took  powerful measures to change the situation so that greater  improvements have been made in these aspects. We convened the  first provincial symposium on the work of investigation and  study in procuratorial departments and proposed the missions,  demands, and measures for enhancing the work. The Provincial  People's Procuratorate began publishing the periodical JIANCHA  XIN SHIDAI [NEW ERA OF PROCURATORIAL WORK], which opened up a  new realm for the enhancement of investigation and study. In  addition, the procuratorate also started the first training  class on procuratorial information and conducted activities on  appraisal through comparison to elect advanced units and fine  workers in the information business. Thanks to the serious  attention paid to the work, a good atmosphere in investigation  and study is taking shape in the procuratorial organs across the  province so that information work has been further strengthened.  <H5>  IV. Sticking to the Principle of "Administering </H5> Procuratorates Strictly" and Taking Firm Control of Building a  Contingent of Procuratorial Personnel    Since last year, procuratorial organs at all levels across  the province have conscientiously organized the study of central  documents concerning the 14th CPC National Congress, the Third  Plenary Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee, and the third  volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," with a view to  arming the minds of the vast number of cadres and policemen with  Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. In particular, while carrying out the  instructions and guidelines of the central authorities on the  anticorruption struggle, we intensified the anticorruption work  within our ranks so that all personnel were tested and tempered  in the in-depth struggle. With regard to the building of our  ranks, in the main we fulfilled the following tasks: First, we  held a provincial meeting on political work to review and sum up  the ideological and political work performed in the  procuratorial organs in the past few years and assigns the tasks  ahead. Second, we completed the reelection work smoothly  whereby the average age of chief procurators at all levels was  reduced and their cultural and professional standards were  enhanced. Third, with the approval of the Supreme People's  Procuratorate and the provincial party committee, the pilot work  for the "Regulations on Prosecutors" was conducted throughout  the province. Fourth, we put into serious practice the  "Decisions on Launching a Law Enforcement Activity Among the  Procuratorial Organs Throughout the Province" with the contents  of enforcing the law in a strict, open-minded, honest, and  civilized way, which was adopted in the second provincial  procuratorial work meeting last year. As a result, the  consciousness of the vast number of cadres and policemen on the  honest and diligent performance of their duties, strict  observation of law and discipline, and their standards of law  enforcement were enhanced to some extent. Fifth, we conducted  conscientious education on opposing corruption and encouraging  honesty among the cadres and policemen. Meanwhile, cadres at  and above section head level earnestly made self examinations  and self rectification in accordance with the five requirements  set by the central authorities. Sixth, we reinforced the  training of cadres and policemen, through which 266 cadres were  trained in six training classes sponsored by pertinent business  departments of the provincial people's procuratorate. Ten  cadres participated in the training course at the Central  Prosecutor Management College and 240 cadres studied in courses  for professional diplomas.    Deputies, although certain achievements were attained in the  province's procuratorial work in 1993, there were still some  problems and weak links in our work. Apart from those mentioned  above, there was also the problem of uneven development in work.  In some places where working conditions were more or less the  same, the work results were quite different owing to the varying  degrees of effort they had made. In the anticorruption  struggle, they failed to reap prominent results in checking and  dealing with the criminal cases of corruption and bribery in  party and government organs, judicial departments, law  enforcement departments, and economic management departments  according to the requirements of the central authorities. In  some areas, the tasks of pursuing and capturing escaped  criminals and screening accumulated economic crimes were still  extremely arduous. The conditions of office buildings used by  the procuratorial organs and the facilities for law enforcement  also await urgent improvement. Political education,  professional training, and education on opposing corruption and  encouraging honesty still need to be repeatedly deepened and  strengthened.    Deputies,    The year 1994 is one in which reform will be accelerated in  China. It is also a year full of hope. As the reform intensity  in the Hainan Special Economic Region will be increased, the  development tasks will be even heavier. The new situation has  set still higher demands on our procuratorial work. Regarding  the work in 1994, we held a provincial conference of chief  procurators in early January this year to sum up our work  conscientiously, analyze the situation, unify thinking, and  clearly define our missions. Our general guiding idea is: This  year, procuratorial organs at all levels across the province  should put into effect seriously the guidelines of the 14th CPC  National Congress, the Third Plenary Session of the 14th CPC  Central Committee, and the Second Session of the First Hainan  Provincial People's Congress, conscientiously study the third  volume of the "Selected Works of Deng Xiaoping," persistently  seek guidance in Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory of building  socialism with Chinese characteristics, stick to the principle  of "doing two types of work simultaneously and attaching equal  importance to both," further intensify the functions of law  inspection, strictly enforce the law, take firm control of case  handling, and resolutely crack down on various criminal  activities, to create a favorable legal environment for reform,  opening up, and economic construction in our province and  provide a guarantee for the establishment and development of a  socialist market economy structure.    We must carry out the anticorruption struggle profoundly and  concentrate our efforts on investigating and dealing with major  important cases. The province's procuratorial organs at all  levels should persistently take punishing economic crime,  including corruption, bribery, and so on, as the most important  and direct service rendered to economic construction, make  mental preparations for waging a protracted battle, and focus  the work on investigating and dealing with such economic crimes  as corruption, bribery, and so on committed by party and  government organs, judicial departments, law enforcement  departments, economic management departments, as well as their  personnel. New breakthroughs should be made in the area of  investigating and dealing with major important cases. We must  seriously investigate and deal with criminal cases involving  legal persons by selecting typical examples, breaking through  key points and, in accordance with the law, investigating and  ferreting out various criminal activities including offering  bribes, taking bribes, smuggling, evading taxes, refusing to pay  taxes, making false tax reports, forging bogus registered  trademarks, and so on in organs, organizations, enterprises, and  institutions. At the same time, we must pay serious attention  to unearthing and investigating other crimes of accepting  bribes, practicing favoritism, committing irregularities,  neglecting official duties, and so on committed by government  workers in connection with the crimes of legal persons. In light  of the characteristics in our province, we must also make  serious investigation into the criminal cases committed in  transfers of land, those major important cases in particular,  and the criminal activities of using public funds to engage in  land, stock, and property speculation, to further the  anticorruption struggle in our province in a penetrating way.    We must continue to adhere to the principle of cracking down  on serious criminal activities rigorously and rapidly in  accordance with the law. Under the conditions of practicing a  market economy, political and social stability is an essential  guarantee and prerequisite for pushing forward reform and  development. The social security in our province at present is  still very grim, which is why procuratorial organs at all levels  throughout the province must continue to deal heavy blows  against serious criminal activities, stick to the principle of  handling cases in a rigorous and rapid manner, as well as the  principle of "two basic points" according to the law, and take  speedy action in arresting and prosecuting lest we should bungle  the chance of winning a battle in the procuratorial work domain.  We must also coordinate with public security organs and courts  in the unified action of the entire province to crack down on  criminal activities, particularly on those committed using  firearms and positively participate in the struggle of specific  operations and rectification of disorder in some key areas as  organized by various localities according to actual local  conditions. Combining this task with the handling of cases, we  must put into practice comprehensively various measures for the  overall control of social security in procuratorial work,  formulating detailed rules and regulations for the  implementation of "Several Stipulations on Practicing a  Leadership Responsibility System in the Overall Control of  Social Security" promulgated by the central authorities, so that  leading cadres in procuratorial organs at all levels will really  assume their responsibilities to maintain law and order in their  own localities.    We must intensify supervision over law enforcement and  conduct procuratorial business in a comprehensive way. While  paying attention to performing strict law enforcement in  procuratorial departments, we should also exercise supervision  over other departments in respect of law enforcement and,  through investigating and dealing with cases that were not  handled with strict legal procedures and through rectifying  activities in violation of laws, supervise and urge other  departments to enforce laws rigorously to maintain the unity of  state laws and ensure their correct implementation.    We must make further efforts to augment the building of the  procuratorial ranks with stress on the trial implementation of  the "Regulations on Prosecutors" and the in-depth activities of  enforcing laws in a strict, open-minded, honest, and civilized  way; repeatedly enhance the political and professional standards  of the vast number of cadres and policemen; and work hard to  build a contingent of procuratorial personnel who are powerful  politically, competent professionally, strict in discipline, and  good in style, in a bid to make new contributions to  accelerating the development of a socialist market economy and  the drive for modernization in our province.    I hereby present the above report to you for your  examination  and approval.</p>

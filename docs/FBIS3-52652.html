We say this because of the conflicting reports coming in  from  Cairo regarding the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and their  faltering over the question of who should control the crossings  leading to Gaza and Jericho.    It is clear that Israel is insisting through its delegation  that full control of the crossings remain in the hands of its  security forces, and that all it can offer to the Palestinians  is a symbolic presence limited to formalities only.    This conflicts with the stipulations of the Gaza-Jericho  agreement, which talks openly and clearly about a complete  withdrawal from these areas and their handover to the  Palestinian national authority and the security forces belonging  to it.    Israel interprets the agreement as a redeployment of its  forces in the Gaza Strip and Jericho -- that is, remassing them  in areas remote from the overpopulated towns. And it believes  that the security of Israeli settlements must remain in the  hands of Israeli forces. And it is bans the Palestinian forces  from moving close to these settlements or arresting any Israeli  settler involved in terrorist actions against Palestinians.    This Israeli interpretation conflicts completely with the  Palestinian interpretation, which understands the withdrawal to  mean evacuating all Israeli forces from the Gaza Strip and  Jericho, exactly along the lines of the withdrawal from Sinai  conducted under the Camp David accords.    If the Palestinians in the occupied territories welcomed the  agreement and supported those who signed it, this sudden support  was the result of their belief that it would lead to an Israeli  withdrawal and the restoration of Palestinian sovereignty over  the liberated areas.    And when we talk about Palestinian dignity, we mean stopping  all the insults to which the Palestinians are exposed at the  crossings at the hands of Israeli security sources, namely body  searches, confiscation, and waiting for a long time under a  burning sun or in unbearable freezing conditions.    What Israel is proposing in the negotiations is merely an  attempt to keep the painful reality as it stands, on the pretext  of preventing weapons and "subversives" from being smuggled  through the crossing points so as not to threaten Israel's  security in the future.    It is difficult for us to understand how the smuggling of  weapons to an area like the Gaza Strip can pose a threat to  Israel's security when the occupation forces are building an  electronic fence along the strip's border.    It is impossible for those whom Israel calls subversives to  smuggle tanks or heavy artillery through the crossings, which  will be watched by the other parties. What could be smuggled is  pistols and rifles, and these are already in abundance in the  strip and will be part of the armament of the Palestinian police  forces to assume security in the strip and Jericho.    Israel, which has always wagered on rejection, is in a  dilemma as a result of the Palestinians' acceptance of the  agreement, which is why it is currently trying to extricate  itself from this dilemma by putting obstacles in its way, in the  hope that the Palestinians will lose their nerve and pull out of  the negotiations. For this reason, it refused to withdraw on 13  December. For this reason also, it is making a big crisis out  of the crossings issue. We do not believe that the negotiating  Palestinian side has one option only, namely to stand fast and  to adhere to the only positive aspect in the agreement, that is  withdrawal.

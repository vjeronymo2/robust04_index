			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ben, re": "Strong Reactions to Temelin </F> Affair"]    [Excerpt] Vienna, Salzburg -- The involvement of Bank  Austria, or its subsidiary Investment Bank AG respectively, in  the construction of the Czech nuclear power plant in Temelin  prompted strong reactions over the weekend [12-13 February]. It  has become known that as recently as in December 1993, the  Investment Bank AG offered option bonds for the Czech energy  concern CEZ, to which Temelin also belongs. This transaction  was based on speculations about sizable profits if the  state-owned U.S. Eximbank should guarantee loans worth billions  for the completion of the Temelin power plant. The Investment  Bank AG confirmed the existence of such option bonds during the  weekend.    In addition, the information bulletin of the Federation of  Self-Employed Businessmen No. 212 dated 7 February 1994 leveled  the allegation that Bank Austria will assume a sizable portion  of the credit guaranteed by the Eximbank. Chancellor Vranitzky  was reportedly briefed by the manager of Bank Austria, Gerhard  Randa. The information bulletin reads: "His (Vranitzky's)  protest letter to the U.S. Senate is being dismissed as  `Balkan-like behavior' in Washington because it is no secret  there that Vranitzky has known for months about plans concerning  a credit guarantee and that Bank Austria is playing a major role  in this respect."    Vranitzky told APA [Austria Press Agency] on Saturday [12  February] that he did not know Bank Austria wants to assume part  of the loan for Temelin. He also denied reports he was briefed  by manager Gerhard Randa. The chancellor also stated he would  be very surprised if reports about Bank Austria's participation  were correct. The city of Vienna owns approximately 53.1  percent of the bank, the government owns 23.7 percent, the  Wiener Staedtische insurance company owns 10 percent, and other  shareholders own the rest.    In a radio interview on Saturday, the general manager of  Bank  Austria, Rene Alfons Haiden, denied reports about alleged  credits by his institute. He confirmed that an international  consortium approached his institute on this matter, but that  Bank Austria rejected any participation. Asked about the option  bonds, Haiden stated that if this information should be true,  this would have consequences. [passage omitted]</p>

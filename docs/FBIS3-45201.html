France and China have resumed "relations of trust," Juppe  told reporters.    According to the joint communique, the Chinese side has  reaffirmed its consistent principled position on the question of  Taiwan, while the French side has confirmed that the French  Government recognizes the government of the People's Republic of  China as the sole legal government of China and Taiwan as an  integral part of Chinese territory.    The communique says French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur  will pay an official visit to China in the near future.    Juppe said the visit will take place "in a few weeks,  perhaps  in March," when the Daya Bay Nuclear Center in the southern  Chinese province of Guangdong, which was built with help from  France, is inaugurated.    Sources close to Balladur said that former French Minister  Alain Peyrefitte will visit Beijing soon to attend ceremonies on  January 27 for the 30th anniversary of the establishment of  diplomatic relations between France and China.    The French prime minister has asked Peyrefitte to prepare  "very attentively" for his China trip, the sources said.</p>

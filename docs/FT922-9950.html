			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / What the charts don't reveal Charts do tell us something; but they can't tell us what that something is. This, at any rate, is my frustrating conclusion from trying to prepare myself mentally for a meeting with the whole fraternity last week. (Or should it be sorority? or mystery? The language is short of politically correct collective nouns.) If what they do works, why? The best evidence that it works is solidly pragmatic: it is attracting academic interest. Baffled by the refusal of prices to behave rationally, the financial market group at the London School of Economics has been experimenting with chart analysis. This effort is rather in the spirit in which doctors have tested folk remedies. They have often found drugs which work - aspirin is only the most important of many - and then spent up to a century finding out how (aspirin again). This academic work has already had some success; it has shown, for example, that talk of support levels and resistance levels, which makes no economic sense at all, does refer to something which actually exists in the markets. But that is something which every trader already knows. The greater mystery is to explain when and why markets which overshoot suddenly develop vertigo, or recover their confidence. The actual overshooting process has already generated a large literature in economics, which consists largely of tautologies. The difficulty is to model a form of behaviour which swings between mass hysteria and returning commonsense. These turning points are at bottom what chartists claim to be able to predict (but not to explain); but my own experiment last week, collecting one-month forecasts of the Nikkei index, was less than confidence-inspiring. Forecasts ranged from 8,000 to 19,000. On this showing, chartism isn't a science, in spite of calling itself technical analysis; more a form of impressionist art. In spite of this, chart analysis is a growth industry. Just about all the blue-blooded houses in the City now employ chartists to predict exchange rates (no doubt since apparently rational approaches hardly work at all); and more and more are charting equities and commodities, and especially derivatives. Indeed, some practitioners now predict not what will happen in the markets, but what rival chartists are going to predict. This tail-chasing process is suggestive; for charts are sketches of market psychology in action, and if that psychology is itself chartist, meta-chartism makes sense. In the end, though, it should be self-defeating, like trying to invest the whole market in index-following funds: either way, prices would have no connecting link either with reality or with past prices. It is saved from this danger by the fact that while index-following is precise, chart analysis isn't. Indexation only works because it is not too widespread, chart analysis because it doesn't work too well. You may see now why trying to think about chartism is such a dizzying business; you keep circling round the central mystery, without getting any nearer. What is it that the analysts are observing? Simply to say that it is market psychology gets us no further; what does it tell us about that psychology? One metaphor which appeals is that of a random walk within limits, like a drunk staggering up a road; the observer can see the drunk, but not the road. The drunk staggers, sees the ditch, and staggers the other way. A chartist tracing his path, tells you where the ditches are; which would be easy, except that the road itself twists. The chartist art is to distinguish a random lurch from a frightened stagger. If this works, the challenge to economists is to explain how and why behaviour changes near the ditches. Or try sheep-dog trials. The sheep dash hither and yon in a rather hysterical way. The good chartist collie seems able to read their minds; but he lacks the language to tell us how he knows, and we could not understand him if he tried. And that, perhaps, is how the trading houses think. They are all buying dogs because they know that their clients are sheep. Dear me.</p>

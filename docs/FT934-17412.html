			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Goode report strikes a fine balance: Pensions industry believes interests of both employers and members have been recognised THE PENSIONS industry has given a broad welcome to the Goode Committee report, saying it preserves employers' rights to abandon unaffordable pension promises for the future while ensuring that past promises are kept. 'Our overall reaction is that it has struck a good balance between the interests of employers and that of scheme members,' said Mr Ron Amy, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds and benefits manager at Grand Metropolitan. 'However, there were a couple of areas in which we felt it could have gone further,' he said. The association would have liked to see mandatory training requirements for all trustees, especially since the new regime will give them greater responsibilities. It regretted there was no specific requirement that assets be placed with a custodian. A number of schemes still act as their own custodian. The actuarial profession, while broadly welcoming the recommendations for protecting pensioners, has sounded alarm bells about a proposal for minimum solvency standards. Mr Roger Key, partner at R. Watsons and Sons, consulting actuaries, said there was a risk that the equities market would plummet because of the way the minimum solvency requirement would be calculated. The report recommends that actuaries calculate the so-called cash equivalent value of the transfer value of each member, assuming the scheme were to be wound up immediately. The sum is intended to represent the amount the member would need to purchase equivalent benefits in the market although it does not take account of actual market prices for annuities at any particular time. The actuarial profession now calculates these with reference to yields on UK government gilts, and assumes that the rate of return the member will earn on his investment is equal to those. However, more than 80 per cent of the average UK pension scheme is invested in equities, most of that in the UK. Mr Key said a sudden crash in the value of the UK equities market could leave a scheme that met the 100 per cent solvency standard on one day very far below that a few days later. Thus, for safety's sake, many actuaries are likely to recommend that schemes switch their investments to gilts which historically have yielded less than equities. That could make pension schemes more expensive to finance, he said, and discourage employers from providing defined benefit final salary schemes. Mr Bill Rayner, senior actuary at consultants William M. Mercer, said that while the effects on equity values could be dire, the profession had begun to address the matter. The Goode report directs the actuarial profession to consider ways of narrowing the diverse methods used to calculate transfer values within the industry. In July, the Pensions Committee of the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries began looking at calculation methods including whether some account should be taken of equities.</p>

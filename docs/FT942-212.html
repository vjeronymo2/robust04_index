			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / World Cup '94: Diplomatic Brazil respectful of hosts A classic mis-match? Three-times world champions Brazil are expected to meet the US in the second round of the World Cup in San Francisco next Monday - July 4 - and are trying to appear, like, humble. The Brazilians dot their comments about the American team with terms like 'much improved', 'very difficult' and 'respect.' But it is easy to suspect that the lofty Brazilians are being diplomatic about the World Cup hosts, who have reached the second round against most expectations. 'It is an opponent we respect like all the others. If they reached the final 16, they did so on merit,' said Brazil's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira.</p>

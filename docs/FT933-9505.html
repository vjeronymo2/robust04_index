			<p>930810 FT  10 AUG 93 / Ailing economy poised to trigger spending package: Finance - As Japan's coalition takes office FT writers assess the likely policy changes JAPAN will consider introducing another spending package later this year to stimulate its ailing economy, but there is no need for an immediate reduction in official interest rates, Mr Hirohisa Fujii, the new finance minister, said yesterday. Within hours of taking his post in the cabinet unveiled by Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa, Mr Fujii was forced to correct a suggestion he had made early in the day that the new government would not increase the country's controversial 3 per cent value-added tax. He later said the government was not considering an increase in the tax to fund another stimulatory spending package this year, but hinted that an increase might be necessary in the longer term as part of a restructuring of the taxation system. Mr Fujii, 61, is confronted by an economy that appears to have hit the second of the double-dips in its downturn, prompting business leaders yesterday to remind the coalition to keep an eye on growth as well as on its stated priority of political reform. The appointment of Mr Fujii has at least reassured finance ministry bureaucrats, who feared the new government might be tempted to spend its way out of economic trouble. Mr Fujii is a former official of the ministry's budget bureau, and insisted yesterday that the government would not issue deficit-covering bonds to increase its scope for spending in a budget under preparation for the year beginning next April. The finance ministry has already warned other ministries that spending will increase by no more than 3 per cent, and Mr Fujii appeared to support that low ceiling, even though the coalition has talked of increasing social welfare spending and foreign aid contributions. Mr Fujii graduated from Tokyo university in 1955 and after his stint at the finance ministry was elected to parliament in 1977. He is one of the ex-LDP officials who make up the core of the new cabinet, having left the party this year to join the Japan Renewal party. In his first press conference yesterday he handled questions deftly, but later found that his answer on the value-added tax appeared to close off all options for an increase, so he issued a statement to clarify the government's position. The coalition partners are obviously in favour of growth, but Mr Fujii will find that he must tread warily in discussing tax policy, as the Social Democratic party, formerly the Japan Socialist party, would prefer the value-added tax to be scrapped. Asked whether the official discount rate should be cut from the present 2.5 per cent, Mr Fujii said there was no need for an immediate reduction, although he did not intend to tell the Bank of Japan how to handle interest rate policy. Ms Manae Kubota, the new director-general of the economic planning agency (EPA), will be responsible, along with Mr Fujii, for guiding policy. She is also aware of the influence of Japan's bureaucrats, having worked at the labour ministry before entering politics. The EPA has been persistently optimistic in the face of signs that personal consumption is falling sharply and Japanese companies are in for a fourth year of declining profits. While private institutions forecast growth this year at around 1.5 per cent, the agency has set a target of 3.3 per cent. Ms Kubota, 68, a member of the SDP, said yesterday the economy was still digesting a Y13,200bn (Pounds 84.6bn) stimulatory package announced in April, and this spending should be completed before the government began planning another package. The government has been condemned for pumping money into public works projects, without addressing the fall in personal consumption and corporate capital spending. Ms Kubota indicated that more attention should be paid to the needs of consumers.</p>

Kalashnikov, Russian deputy minister of </F> Labor, by EIZh [EKONOMIKA I ZHIZN] Department of Social Problems  and APK [agroindustrial complex]: "Labor Legislation: New Trends  and Directions"]    [Text] V. Kalashnikov, Russian deputy minister of  Labor, answers our readers' questions.    [EIZh] Viktor Vasilyevich, in our opinion, the existing  labor  legislation is to a great extent oriented toward the former  system of economic operation. The situation has changed sharply,  however, particularly in the past year: a tremendous number of  private firms are in operation, and their development is in many  ways held back by the present labor law. What is the Russian  Ministry of Labor planning to do this year, what basically new  documents will it adopt, and what draft laws are being drawn up?    [Kalashnikov] In the course of political and economic  reforms, social processes proceed in an ambiguous way.    We are therefore faced this year with the problem of drawing  up new and revising existing fundamental legislative acts in the  sphere of labor relations. They include: the Fundamentals of  Labor Legislation, laws and edicts on the minimum subsistence  level, settling collective labor disputes and conflicts,  regulating wages and the insolvency (bankruptcy) of enterprises,  indexing the minimal amount for wages, unemployment benefits,  allotments and many others.    When drawing up labor legislation, we intend to orient the  consolidated norms and rules primarily toward achieving higher  labor productivity and strengthening the socio-economic  positions of the labor collectives. This is to be ensured on the  basis of improving the forms and methods of social partnership  and wages and removing the artificial restrictions to labor  stimulation. We are now seeking these methods of economic  influence on all the participants in the labor process. For  example, the draft of the Law on Social Insurance specifies  differentiating the rates of enterprises' withholding funds for  the social insurance fund on the basis of work time lost because  of illness, occupational illness, and other factors. This will,  of course, rouse and stimulate employers to improve labor  conditions, and, on this basis, reduce the number of sick  workers and the amount of work time lost because of their  illness.    Another point. The system of paying enterprise directors in  many ways determines the amount and nature of the wages of the  collective and hired workers. In connection with this, the  ministry has conceived the idea of determining the wage level of  state enterprise directors, even if in accordance with the  recommended procedure, by the appropriate normative acts, so  that the size of their wages is tied in with the results of  production activity.    In a word, in the process of improving the labor code,  together with the statute on labor safety and social insurance,  the main goal is to create, under the new conditions, reliable  legal protection for every worker and at the same time to  provide the prerequisites for the further growth of work  efficiency in the national economy.    [EIZh] In the developed countries, the average small  business  has a substantial influence on the development of the economy as  a whole. Russia too is moving in this direction. Let us imagine,  however, this situation: a new enterprise of 10-20 people, and  one employee has fallen ill. For four months he cannot be even  fired. Or another point: when the firing is at management's  initiative, the employee must be notified two months in advance.  Indeed, one must even ask for the trade union committee's  agreement on this. The case, meanwhile, comes to a standstill.  In the United States, for example, there is no sick list system  at all. There they have a different, simpler procedure even for  firing at management's initiative. Why does our country still  have such a conservative Labor Code?    [Kalashnikov] Yes, it is true, in the United States, only 6  states have legislation on insurance for temporary incapacity,  and the other 44 do not have it. A number of other countries do  not start paying benefits for temporary incapacity from the  first day of the illness: for example, Italy pays from the  fourth day, and Finland -- from the eighth day of incapacity.    These problems, however, must not be considered separately  from other trends in social security, wage level and other forms  of social insurance. In the United States, where there is no  social insurance by legislation, it is widely organized on  voluntary principles, through commercial insurance companies and  collective contracts.    I do not think that the time has yet come in our country  when  we could leave workers without compulsory state social  insurance. Considering the income level of the basic mass of the  population, this is fraught with many negative social  consequences.    With respect to the conservatism of the Labor Code as  regards  other social guarantees, it can be said that problems mainly  arise here not with the scale, and not with the size of the  social guarantees, but with the procedure for their  presentation. Obviously, with respect to individual social  guarantees based on improving the tax legislation and the  procedure for forming social funds, a redistribution of  responsibility between the state and the workers should be  carried out.    Therefore, the ministry now finds itself seeking improvement  in labor legislation in all directions. This includes drawing up  statutes on state support of small-scale entrepreneurship as  well. We will be grateful for all suggestions on this subject.    [EIZh] Viktor Vasilyevich, one of the problems which  constantly "scares" us is unemployment. It would appear that the  state's influence over this should be an active one. It can't  pay money to the unemployed just like that. Who will go work in  the rural areas, if the unemployment benefits are higher than  the average wage in agricultural production? With officially  declared unemployment, our country is full of vacant positions.  What can you say about this?    [Kalashnikov] According to the situation in December of last  year, the number of persons without work and actively seeking it  was 3.8 million people, or 5 percent of the economically active  population. At the same time, approximately the same number of  the population were working under conditions not constituting  full employment. Approximately 800,000 people, however, are  registered with the employment authorities, and have the  official status of unemployed. The rest are in transit, which,  according to existing legislation, does not require the payment  of unemployment benefits.    Social surveys show that, given all the existing  shortcomings  of the legislation in force on employment problems, it does not  create a striving to be unemployed. Unemployment benefits are  paid with a consistent reduction in amounts and a restriction on  periods and conditions for payment. Polls show that two-thirds  of the citizens feel: it is better to have a guaranteed wage  than to get large sums of money and not have the security of a  job.    The existence of free work places, constituting 654,000 at  the end of the 1st quarter of last year, 703,000 at the end of  the 2d, and 696,000 at the end of the 3d, is essentially  unrelated to the rise in unemployment, and mainly depends on the  lack of correspondence, by type and skill level, of the  unemployed to the free work places. In this case, women and  young people predominate among the unemployed. On the whole, the  effect of the measures taken to ease the negative processes of  unemployment is so far not great. Not much more than 2 percent  of the employment fund is spent for vocational training of the  unemployed and the financing of public works.    [EIZh] As things now stand, protecting and improving labor  conditions is only in second, and sometimes in third place among  businessmen. Many people in general feel that this is one of the  courses for saving capital. This is a short-sighted policy,  though. What is the Russian Ministry of Labor planning to do  about this in the near future?    [Kalashnikov] A critical situation is forming in the country  with respect to labor safety and conditions. Even under the  conditions of a cutback in production volumes, there are 6.3  accidents per 1,000 people yearly in the Russian Federation.  These official data, however, are obviously understated.    Over 8,000 people die in production, and about 15,000 people  a year become disabled. Production injury with a fatal outcome  is increasing.    There are a considerable number of workers in the  enterprises  and organizations of the Russian Federation who continue to work  while exposed to factors that are harmful and hazardous to their  health. Over 18 percent of all workers are employed under  conditions that do not meet the sanitary-hygienic norms.       Table 1.

By decision of the Russian Federation Government, right up  to  organizing the appropriate state bodies, the functions of labor  safety management, specified by the Fundamentals of Legislation,  have been entrusted to the Russian Ministry of Labor. In  connection with this, the ministry is taking measures to create,  in the shortest possible time, a system of state management,  state supervision and control over labor safety practices at the  federal and territorial level, to organize work on improving the  normative base for labor safety, to solve problems of personnel  training and to work out and put into effect an economic  mechanism to guarantee labor safety.    For these purposes it is specified that a Federal Labor  Safety Fund be formed and that the territorial organs of  executive power be given help in creating territorial funds and  labor safety funds for enterprises. An interdepartmental  commission on labor safety problems, attached to the Russian  Federation Government, should be set up.    The ministry has now prepared drafts of statutes on a  Federal  Labor Safety Fund, on putting into practice an economic  mechanism to ensure labor safety, on investigating and keeping  records of production accidents, on supervising and controlling  labor safety and on the status of the state inspector for labor  safety, with the necessary drafts of government decrees and  edicts of the Russian Federation president, which, after the  appropriate finalizing, should be passed and put into effect.    It is intended that the inspectors will be granted the right  to shut down enterprises and individual production facilities in  cases when their activity threatens the lives of workers and the  population; to impose fines and administrative sanctions on  employers and officials of the enterprise for violation of  legislative and other normative acts on labor safety.    Formation of an economic mechanism and labor safety funds  pursues the goal, along with creating a mechanism for financial  support of all state measures in the sphere of labor safety and  interesting employers in creating the necessary work conditions,  of achieving the independence of the offices of labor safety  supervision and control from higher organizations and  enterprises, which will contribute to the objectivity of their  decisions.  <H6>  * * * </H6>   Essentially, the questions raised with V.V. Kalashnikov  are open for discussion. For example, in developed countries,  the system of social protection is different for state servants  and workers in private companies. Why, in our country, in  Russia, is it identical? It would be highly desirable for the  system to be differentiated in the new Fundamentals of Labor  Legislation.    Another question. Up to now, our labor law has been  oriented toward identical protection for both the honest worker  and the negligent one. After all, this is unfair. The  legislation should primarily be aimed at protecting the  interests of a citizen who does good work.    This problem is inexhaustible. We will continue to  cover it in future issues. We hope that the developers and  legislators will take a professional approach to solving the  problems posed.    [Box, p 1]     -  Differentiated rates for the social insurance fund await  entrepreneurs.    -  The wages of directors of state enterprises  should be tied into the end result of the activity. This is what  the Ministry of Labor thinks.    -  The future Federal Labor Safety  Fund will be able to shut down production for violation of labor  safety practices.</p>

			<p>920814 FT  14 AUG 92 / Technology (Worth Watching): Bottled water from the tap: Bulk users of bottled water - such as hotels, restaurants, clubs and hospitals - can now produce their own drinks at a fraction of the cost with an on-site filtration system, writes Hilary de Boerr. Eaupure, of Lancashire, markets a filter system using mains water, which passes through a three-stage filtration, is chilled and then carbonated if desired. The resulting sparkling or still water conforms to all UK and EC standards and is environmentally-friendly in other ways - no bottles to transport, store or dispose of. Stage one of the process removes particulate material from tap water, like grit, dirt, rust; stage two takes out organic residues and dissolved gases like pesticides, herbicides and chlorine; stage three traps anything larger than a micron in size, including pathogenic bacteria. Eaupure installs the units free and charges on a water metering system. Eaupure: UK, 0772 815950.</p>

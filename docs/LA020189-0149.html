			<p><P> February 1, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> RYDER PLANS STOCK REPURCHASE  </P> <P> Ryder System Inc. said today it plans to repurchase up to 15% of its common  stock on the open market and is exploring the sale of its Insurance Management  Services Division and other divisions.  </P> <P> The company said its board has authorized the repurchase of up to about 12  million common shares, worth $340 million at the current market price, over two  years.  </P> <P> Ryder shares rose $1.25 to $28.25 in active trading on the New York Stock  Exchange.  </P> <P> It also said it is holding talks with an "offshore company" that it did not  identify, on the sale of its freight forwarding and customers brokerage unit,  Ryder International Freight and Customs Services Inc. In addition, it has  retained advisers to arrange the sale of its U.S. Packing and Shipping Co.  freight assembly and distribution unit and Ryder Freight System, a  full-truckload common carrier.  </P> <P> Analysts said Ryder was selling under-performing units as a response to the  past year's disappointing earnings after steady profit growth in its basic  truck-leasing business over the past decade. In the third quarter, its earnings  edged up to $55.3 million from $52.7 million in the prior quarter. Revenues  climbed to $1.27 billion from $1.16 billion.  </P> <P> The sales of the various units will raise more than $100 million, Ryder  Chairman M. Anthony Burns said in a telephone interview. The sales are not  expected to result in any earnings reductions from selling the under-performing  units at below book value, he said.  </P></p>

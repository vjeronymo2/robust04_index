			<p>930416 FT  16 APR 93 / International Company News: Lyonnaise to put FFr500m into Dumez LYONNAISE des Eaux-Dumez, the French industrial and utility group which this week announced a sharp fall in last year's profits, plans to invest FFr500m (Dollars 93m) in Dumez, its troubled construction subsidiary, through a capital increase. The recapitalisation, which has been triggered by the need to repair Dumez' balance sheet after its heavy losses last year, is expected to take place within the next few weeks. Lyonnaise said yesterday that the transaction would raise Dumez' shareholders' funds to between FFr1bn and FFr1.5bn. Dumez, one of France's largest construction companies, was taken over three years ago by Lyonnaise, which has extensive interests in water distribution and property. The European construction industry has since suffered severely in the economic slowdown. Lyonnaise' construction interests, of which Dumez forms the largest part, almost doubled its losses from FFr276m in 1991 to FFr461m on static sales of FFr45.9bn in 1992.</p>

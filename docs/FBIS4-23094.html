			<p>SUMMARY                                   As North Korea's confrontation with the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) and the United States has worsened over the  last few weeks, South Korean officials and the country's media  have backed the imposition of sanctions against North Korea.  In  their public comments, Japanese Government officials have  continued to take a cautious approach to the sanctions issue,  while both Beijing and Moscow are continuing to point to the need  for a negotiated settlement to the DPRK nuclear crisis.  Beijing,  in keeping with its general foreign policy line, has reiterated  its opposition to the use of sanctions, while Moscow is  indicating that the time is not ripe for their imposition.                              END SUMMARY      Seoul Supports UN Sanctions Against North Korea      Responding to the recent escalation of the nuclear crisis brought  on by Pyongyang's refusal to submit to IAEA inspections, the  South Korean Government has pressed for sanctions against the  North.  South Korean President Kim Yong-sam has reportedly  instructed his prime minister to take "all necessary steps" in  connection with the UN sanctions against the North (Yonhap, 3  June).  In his latest pronouncement on the North Korean nuclear  issue, President Kim was quoted as declaring that "there is no  other way now but to take sanctions" (Hanguk Ilbo, 6 June).      Most major Seoul newspapers--whose reporting is often colored by  their editorial biases--have seemed to agree with ROK Government  pronouncements that sanctions are unavoidable. Papers across the  political spectrum--from the conservative Choson Ilbo and Tong-a  Ilbo to the moderate Hanguk Ilbo and the left-leaning Hangyore  Sinmun--all approvingly reported on plans to move the North  Korean nuclear issue to the UN Security Council for a possible  sanctions vote (4 June).      On the subject of China's and Russia's stance, both Choson Ilbo  and the government-subsidized Seoul Sinmun noted the need to  persuade China to go along with a sanctions resolution, while  Tong-a Ilbo optimistically reported that although Beijing is  opposed to sanctions in principle, the possibility "cannot be  ruled out" that it may change its views on the issue.  As for  Russia's position, while Choson Ilbo simply reported Washington's  opposition to Russia's proposal for an international meeting on  the DPRK issue without criticizing Moscow's stand, the  progovernment Kyonghyang Sinmun urged Moscow to "demonstrate" its  recent commitment to the Russia-ROK "security partnership" by  supporting UN sanctions against Pyongyang.      Like the conservative and middle-of-the-road papers, the  antiestablishment Hangyore Sinmun also admitted that sanctions  against the North "will most likely" be pursued.  It cautioned  the government only against "uncritically following international  trends" and called, without elaboration, for South Korea's own  "countermeasures" to deal with further aggravation of tensions on  the peninsula (4 June).  However, Hangyore Sinmun subsequently  expressed doubts about the effectiveness of any sanctions (6  June).  Thus, the paper said sanctions against Pyongyang will not  have a decisive effect since foreign trade accounts for only  about 10 percent of North Korea's economy.      Internal "Confusion"      Despite the overall consensus between the government and press on  the sanctions issue, the South Korean government's apparent  attempts to balance its desire to appear firm against the North  with its perceived need to ease the public's security concerns is  reportedly creating some confusion among the population.  For  example, the probusiness Chungang Ilbo reported that  "conflicting" signals given by high officials on the overall  situation on the Korean peninsula are creating "confusion" in  South Korea (6 June).  It cited an unnamed National Assemblyman  as pointing out that on the same day President Kim Yong-sam said  South Korean people "do not have to worry," his prime minister  "asked the people to strengthen their alert posture" within the  country.  The paper further quoted the assemblyman as complaining  about the government's "inadequate" security measures, when, in  fact, "we are in a state of emergency requiring everybody to don  a gas mask."  It cited another assemblyman as calling for  "measures to minimize the [current] internal confusion."  The  daily had earlier expressed anxiety about the rising tension,  openly asking the ROK Government whether it has "mapped out"  measures to protect businesses engaged in North-South trade if  sanctions are instituted against the North (4 June).  In  addition, it had cautioned government officials to be "prudent"  in their remarks.      Political Concerns Limit Tokyo's Maneuverability on DPRK      The Japanese Government continues to publicly back dialogue and  negotiation to resolve the crisis over the DPRK's nuclear  program.  According to the 4 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Prime  Minister Tsutomu Hata told reporters on 3 June that Japan would  "keep [its] doors constantly open to discussions."  He added that  the international community is "still not at the stage of  imposing economic sanctions against the DPRK" and argued that it  "should not drive the DPRK into a tight corner."  The next day,  according to a 4 June NHK Television report, he told a news  conference that the international community 4,needs to do [its]  best to seek the understanding of North Korea."   Similarly, a 6  June Kyodo report quoted the coalition's spokesman, Chief Cabinet  Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai, as telling a news conference that  Japan's "basic policy" toward North Korea is to seek "resolution  of the issue through dialogue."      Japanese press reporting suggests that, in line with this guarded  stance, the Japanese Government has formulated a cautious  strategy to deal with the sanctions issue.  The 4 June Mainichi  Shimbun quoted Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) Administrative  Vice Minister Kunihiko Saito and another unnamed MOFA source as  saying Japan plans to propose that the UN Security Council take a  more moderate step, such as issuing a warning to North Korea,  before it considers sanctions.  Another unnamed senior MOFA  official told the 3 June Yomiuri Shimbun that the government  favors such an approach because it is more likely to win the  support of China, which would, in Tokyo's estimation, probably  veto a sanctions resolution.  Yet another unnamed MOFA source  told the 6 June Yomiuri Shimbun that Tokyo might propose an  embargo on weapons exports to North Korea as an alternative to  immediate economic sanctions.      Political Concerns      The major reasons for Tokyo's cautious approach to the DPRK  nuclear issue are the weakness of the ruling coalition and public  opposition to sanctions by the two main opposition parties--the  Social Democratic Party of Japan (SDPJ) and the Liberal  Democratic Party (LDP)--which together could bring down the  government with a no-confidence motion in the Diet.      The SDPJ, which the ruling coalition still hopes to lure back  into the government and which has, in the past, had close ties  with the DPRK, has repeatedly signaled that it will continue to  oppose economic sanctions against Pyongyang.  In one of the  party's most recent statements on the issue, SDPJ Secretary  General Wataru Kubo reportedly told a news conference on 4 June  that the SDPJ "opposes economic sanctions against North Korea"  and argued that the United States, Japan, and South Korea "must  be cautious" about imposing them (NHK Television, 4 June; Yomiuri  Shimbun, 5 June).  During a 5 June interview on Tokyo's FNN  Television Network, Kubo also stated that it might be a  "deviation from current constitutional constraints" for Japan to  support any economic sanctions that the United States might seek  to impose outside the framework of the United Nations if that  body fails to take action against Pyongyang.  In order to promote  a negotiated settlement to the DPRK nuclear issue, the SDPJ  reportedly plans to send a delegation to the DPRK on 10 June to  urge Pyongyang to submit to IAEA inspections (Asahi Shimbun, 4  June;  Yomiuri Shimbun, 5 June).      The LDP, the largest political party in the Japanese Diet, has  also indicated that it favors continued negotiations with the  DPRK--possibly in part because it does not want to alienate the  SDPJ, with whom some LDP members hope to form a coalition  government if the current ruling coalition loses power.  According to the 6 June Nihon Keizai Shimbun the LDP President  Yohei Kono, during a 5 June news conference, stressed the  importance of dialogue with the DPRK, arguing that "it is  necessary to exert efforts to make North Korea understand  correctly the appeals and demands of the international  community."  Possibly in an effort to weaken the coalition by  underscoring its inability to deal with the DPRK issue, the LDP  reportedly is planning to send a delegation to Pyongyang on 14  June for talks with North Korean Premier Kang Song-san to press  the DPRK to "clear up suspicions" about its nuclear program  (Asahi Shimbun, 4 June).      The government's sensitivity to the positions of both the SDPJ  and the LDP was underscored when, according to the 4 June  Mainichi Shimbun, MOFA Vice Minister Saito met with both SDPJ  Chairman Tomiichi Murayama and the Chairman of the LDP's Policy  Research Council, Ryutaro Hashimoto, shortly after he cut short a  trip to Europe and returned to Tokyo to deal with the DPRK issue.  Mainichi Shimbun quoted Saito as telling the SDPJ and LDP leaders  that Japan plans to "buy time" by urging the United Nations to  consider more moderate steps against North Korea before it  imposes sanctions.      Divisions in Coalition      The ruling coalition itself may be divided over how quickly and  to what extent Japan should publicly move to support sanctions  against the DPRK.  According to a 3 June Kyodo report, Foreign  Minister Koji Kakizawa told a Diet Foreign Affairs Committee that  if the UN Security Council fails to reach an agreement on  imposing sanctions because of opposition from China, Japan will  offer "maximum cooperation" with any multilateral punitive  measures against the DPRK initiated by Washington.  Kakizawa  reportedly added that Japan would halt cash remittances to North  Korea from Korean residents in Japan and suspend all trade with  the DPRK.      By contrast, Chief Cabinet Secretary Kumagai, speaking before  another Diet committee the same day, reportedly restated Japan's  current official position on the DPRK issue, saying that Tokyo  will "tenaciously try to persuade North Korea to reach a  negotiated settlement."  He added that Japan has "no specific  sanctions in mind" (Kyodo, 3 June).  The 4 June Nihon Keizai  Shimbun quoted officials close to Prime Minister Hata as saying  that the prime minister is concerned that some members of the  cabinet are "increasingly calling for adopting a hardline  position" against North Korea.  The officials reportedly cited  Kakizawa's 3 June comments before the Diet Committee as an  example of such a hardline stance.  They added that Prime  Minister Hata prefers to take a more moderate approach for  political reasons, hoping to convince the SDPJ to return to the  coalition government it left in April.      Beijing Calls For Talks, Rejects UN Sanctions      Despite Pyongyang's refusal to submit to IAEA inspections, the  Chinese Government continues to favor a negotiated settlement to  the DPRK nuclear crisis.  Speaking at a press conference on 2  June, a PRC Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated Beijing's  "unchanged" position favoring the settlement of the dispute  through "dialogue and consultations" (Xinhua, 2 June).  In an  apparent reference to recent U.S. calls for sanctions, the  spokesman went on to say that even though "some difficulties"  have emerged as a result of the IAEA's recent inspection, the  "key" to a settlement is for all parties to treat the issue with  "calmness" and make "positive efforts in order to leave room and  keep the possibility alive for a proper settlement."  China's  permanent representative to the United Nations Li Zhaoxing had  been more explicit in rejecting sanctions in remarks made during  UN Security Council consultations on 30 May.  According to a 31  May Xinhua report, Li reiterated the need to settle the dispute  through negotiations, saying that China "does not endorse any  action that may exacerbate" the situation.      According to the Japanese news agency Kyodo, PRC Foreign Minster  Qian Qichen has also weighed in on the question of sanctions.  A  7 June Kyodo report said the Chinese press agency "Xinhua quoted  Qian" as telling the visiting Maltese Foreign Minister at a  meeting that day that China believes imposing sanctions is "not a  good way" to resolve the problem.  Monitored Xinhua reporting has  not yet been observed to carry Qian's remarks.      The PRC-owned Hong Kong daily Hsin Wan Pao on 7 June also  discussed China's views on the DPRK nuclear crisis.  An article  by the paper's veteran commentator Yang Chu said Beijing believes  that there is still time to resolve the issue before sanctions  are "officially proposed" and that China has to "choose between  vetoing or abstaining from vetoing a decision."  He concluded  that China "will not agree" to economic sanctions against the  DPRK in the UN Security Council.  Moreover, taking note of the  DPRK's threats of war, he said China "will not dispatch" troops  and become "involved" in a Korean war.  The second article,  carried in the paper's "news talk column," also pointed to  China's desire for a negotiated settlement, noting that Beijing  is "obviously unwilling" to take a stand on sanctions and "hopes  for another way of handling" the issue.      Previous Views on UN Sanctions      Although China has generally opposed the use of sanctions, it did  vote for the imposition of UN sanctions against Iraq in 1990.  Explaining Beijing's support for sanctions against Iraq, PRC  Ambassador to the United Nations Li Daoyu said China believed  that "state-to-state relations" must be "based" on the five  principles of peaceful coexistence, that the "norms" governing  international relations must be maintained, and that resorting to  force or the threat to use force to violate a country's  sovereignty and territorial integrity "must be opposed" (Xinhua,  7 August 1990).      Moscow Advocates Talks, Conditionally Supports Sanctions      Like China, Russia has stressed the need to resolve the present  crisis through negotiations.  Speaking at a press conference on 2  June, Russian President Boris Yeltsin repeated Moscow's call for  an international conference that would be attended by Russia,  China, the DPRK, South Korea, the United States, and Japan,  saying it is the "only way to solve the problem" (Moscow  Ostankino television).  Moscow had first introduced the idea of  an international conference on the North Korean nuclear issue in  late March, claiming that bilateral efforts to resolve the crisis  had been "inadequate" (ITAR-TASS, 24 March).      However, unlike Beijing, Moscow, perhaps because its concern over  Ukrainian nuclear intentions give Russia a greater stake in  seeing that the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) is adhered  to, has not ruled out the possibility of sanctions.  For example,  although Yeltsin, at the press conference on 2 June, noted that  it is "just a bit early" to speak of sanctions, he  went on to  say that if the DPRK "digs in its heels" and withdraws from the  NPT, Russia "will be obliged, gradually, of course, to first  warn" the DPRK and then later, "probably" join with the world  community and "adopt some kind of sanctions."  Reiterating this  position on 7 June, Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, according to  Radio Rossii, told the independent press agency Interfax that the  "time is not ripe for sanctions," saying that sanctions can only  be introduced "in stages" after "all other possibilities" have  been exhausted.  In an apparent reference to a U.S. suggestion  that Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo might join together and impose  sanctions against the DPRK, Kozyrev said sanctions should be  "introduced and lifted by the UN Security Council alone."  A day  earlier ITAR-TASS had cited an unnamed "high-ranking Foreign  Ministry official" as saying that Moscow may not "support"  sanctions if they are not approved by the UN Security Council.

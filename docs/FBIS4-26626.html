			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Feature" by Zhao Renfang] </F>   [Text] New York, June 23 (XINHUA) -- Business leaders  attending the conference on business opportunities in China here  today were not just talking, many of whom had already gained  experience of doing business there.    Their successful stories, strategies to tackle the China  market, practical ways of doing business, the difficulties and  obstacles they encountered there and the cultural differences  were shared among the meeting attendants. Most of the speakers  agreed the chances were there, the challenges there, but the  important thing now was how to get down to real business.    The conference on business opportunities in China was held  with participants of big name companies in the United States and  some businesses from Asia-Pacific region.    The two-day conference, organized by World Congress Inc. and  sponsored by Nynex Company (New York telephone company) in New  York, drew some 100 representatives from business companies,  government agencies and research institutions.    Well-known names such GM-Hughes Electronics, Export-Import  Bank of the United States, Dupont Company, McDonnell Douglas and  the National Committee of U.S.-China Relations were presented at  the conference, which as the world congress said, was the first  of a series on global market.    At the conference entitled "Business Opportunities in the  People's Republic of China", companies, which have been  successful in their business there, such as GM Hughes, Dupont  and McDonnell Douglas shared their experiences and exchanged  ideas in the conference.    Different from some other meetings on China, it not only  dealt with macro topics such as building on China's past to move  into the 21st century but also micro ones such as ways to  overcome transportation obstacles in China.    Arthur Wilson, director of the Nynex's China liaison, said  that his company was very much interested in China market,  especially the extensive telecommunication needs throughout  China.    According to him, Nynex, which will turn its expertise in  northeastern America into international operation, was always  willing to help China's telecommunication companies and  organizations improve and promote the communication system there.    In an interview with XINHUA, Charles P. collins, managing  director of the International Business Network, which has  operated a China business information program on its computer  system, noted that there were great opportunities to do business  in China and the interest was still growing. So to cope with  the need of original information about China, his company  established the China program on-line service to help foreign  businessmen get first-hand information about China.    Now that with interest in China becoming more and more  specific, Vidar J. Jorgensen, managing director of the world  congress, said that his congress was planning another conference  next year.    The conference is expected to cover finance, financial  service and investment and actual operations, he said. People  were now not only satisfied in talking about opportunities but  also the real business.</p>

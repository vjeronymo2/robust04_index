			<p>940409 FT  09 APR 94 / How to Spend it: The very easy chair - A look at cardboard furniture Fun for children, for students, for week-end houses or anywhere where cheapness matters, is the cardboard chair designed by the French architect, Oliver Leblois. The chairs are sold in flat-packs and are a doddle to assemble. They are made from triple-layer corrugated cardboard and are said to be strong enough to withstand weights of up to 21 stone. In other words, in spite of being made from what is, after all, only paper, they really are meant for sitting on. These, you will have gathered, are not chairs for posh drawing-rooms - they are chairs to have fun with, to be used in nurseries, kitchens, playrooms, bedsitters. They come in plain cardboard and the enterprising can paint or decorate them as they will. There are also two sizes - the adults' version which sells at Pounds 26, the child's one which sells for Pounds 15 and includes a pack of crayons (with which to decorate the chair) in the kit. After Noah, of 121, Upper Street, Islington, London N1, (telephone: 071-359-4281) sells them and will soon have more cardboard furniture from the range - bookshelves, table and even a bed are to follow. As the chairs are flat-packed they can be ordered by mail for an extra Pounds 5 to cover postage and packing.</p>

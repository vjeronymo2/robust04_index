			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / Record damages award made to victim of RSI A MACHINE operator at Vauxhall Motors in Luton who contracted repetitive strain injury (RSI) and had to give up her job has been awarded a record Pounds 59,617 in damages and loss of earnings by a judge at Luton County Court. Judge Farnworth found Vauxhall to have been negligent in not warning Mrs Jane Inskip, 63, of the risks she faced from repetitive actions on gear-shaving machines. Vauxhall denied liability and is appealing. Mrs Inskip's union, the AEU, said the settlement might have implications for the thousands of other RSI-related cases that may go to court. Although higher settlements for RSI have been agreed out of court, Mrs Inskip's case has set a record for a court settlement - Pounds 31,500 for loss of earnings and Pounds 5,000 general damages. Miscellaneous damages and interest pushed the figure to just under Pounds 60,000. Mrs Inskip contracted D'Quervains tenosynovitis and osteo arthritis in 1984 after more than 10 years of loading and unloading machines, a repetitive action involving turning, twisting and some force. She volunteered for redundancy in 1986. A recent case involving BT keyboard operators granted damages of Pounds 6,000 but a loss of earnings award has not yet been decided. In another case nine workers represented by the GMB general union received Pounds 67,000 between them for loss of earnings. Eight journalists with repetitive strain injury have now left the Financial Times on terms that include lump-sum payments of at least one year's salary from the company, a guarantee that sufferers who recover their health can return to employment at the newspaper and ill-health pensions. A ninth person, who is not in the pension scheme, is about to leave on terms that will include benefits under a permanent health insurance policy. The settlements do not deprive sufferers of their right to seek legal redress.</p>

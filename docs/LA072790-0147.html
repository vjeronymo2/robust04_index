			<p><P> July 27, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> SKEETERS: An outbreak of the encephalitis virus among birds in the Huntington  Beach area has prompted a warning from pest control officials. . . . The virus  does not affect birds but can be transferred via mosquitoes to human beings,  where it causes brain inflammation. . . . "I don't think we need to sound any  alarm, but people should be concerned about being exposed to mosquitoes," said  one official. . . . His advice: Report concentrations of mosquitoes and drain  stagnant water. A coffee can of water can breed 1,000 mosquitoes a week. Zan  Dubin and Bob Schwartz  </P></p>

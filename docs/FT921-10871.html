			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Brussels plans to speed CIS food aid THE EC is to try to accelerate the pace and widen the scope of its Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.56bn) food aid programme for the former Soviet republics, writes David Buchan. The European Commission said it would do its best to speed aid, after several EC foreign ministers yesterday expressed frustration that EC food loans were being blocked, and echoed Russian calls for the EC to spread food deliveries beyond Moscow and St Petersburg. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, reacted to ministerial pressure by suggesting Brussels might have to withdraw its guarantee from the long-delayed Ecu500m commercial food credit being organised by Deutsche Bank, and lend the money directly to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But Deutsche Bank said last night the problem lay in Moscow, where it was unclear whether Vnesheconombank - the old Soviet foreign trade bank - had the authority to take on new loans. The bank said it was still trying 'very hard' to clarify the borrower's status. This, it added, was a problem which the EC would have to face if it became the direct lender. Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, also urged the Commission to settle quickly the dispute holding up a separate Ecu1.25bn food credit, offered by the EC directly. The Commission is demanding Russia waive sovereign immunity in any dispute arising out of the loan. Russia is refusing. Pressure to widen the geographical scope of the EC's Ecu450m food grant programme also came from Mr Hurd, who said that according to Russian President Boris Yeltsin there were several Russian cities in greater need now than Moscow and St Petersburg. These cities had been almost totally dependent on defence and now had no economic base to fall back on. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, suggested the EC devote some of the Ecu400m in technical aid still not spent from last year, or some of the Ecu500m technical assistance pledged for this year, to finding employment for Russian nuclear scientists. But Mr Hurd reported Mr Yeltsin as saying he was taking his own steps to prevent Russian nuclear know-how ending up in dangerous hands. Ministers endorsed the Commission's general approach to the CIS of offering individual republics something better than the simple trade agreement which the old Soviet Union had with Brussels, but less than the association agreements just reached with central Europe. Such 'intermediate' accords should provide for substantial political dialogue, ministers agreed.</p>

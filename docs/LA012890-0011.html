			<p><P> January 28, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LOOKS: DRY CYCLE;  </P> <P> NEW MOISTURIZERS REPLENISH THE BODY'S NATURAL PROTECTION AGAINST PARCHED SKIN  </P> <P> BY THE END of January, the effects of winter are etched only too clearly on  many Southern California faces. Changes in humidity and dramatic differences  between indoor and outdoor temperatures leave complexions lined, flaky and  rough. Even people with oily skin may suffer from parched skin and turn to  moisturizers for relief.  </P> <P> But instead of reaching for old-fashioned moisturizers that are thick and  greasy, or even the lighter creams and lotions of the past decade, people with  dry skin are seeking longer-lasting solutions. In response, cosmetics companies  are introducing moisturizers formulated to combat the causes of moisture loss.  </P> <P> Until recently, those causes have been misunderstood. For instance, an American  pharmaceutical company surveyed 440 consumers and 220 dermatologists and found  that while most of the doctors considered aging to be the major cause of dry  skin, most of the consumers listed the sun as the main offender. Ironically,  the laymen, not the experts, appear to be on the right track.  </P> <P> "Associating dry skin with aging is a major fallacy," says Peter Elias, vice  chairman of dermatology at the UCSF School of Medicine. "There is no  relationship. Dry skin can happen at any age."  </P> <P> It's easy to understand how rough, flaky skin would be so readily linked with  aging. After all, the body's natural oil production does slow somewhat over the  years. But, says James Leyden, professor of dermatology at the University of  Pennsylvania School of Medicine, "the majority of people produce approximately  the same amount of oil. The outer layers of the skin are prime (targets) for  abuse, however, and that abuse may cause dry skin, regardless of age."  </P> <P> The outermost layers of skin cells, technically known as the stratum corneum,  were once thought to be inactive and unnecessary, but doctors have discovered  that they determine the moisture content of the skin. Fats and proteins serve  as a kind of mortar that bonds the layers of cells together. An unbroken  stratum corneum serves as a protective barrier against the environment and  seals in moisture.  </P> <P> Cold temperatures, low humidity and increased sun exposure deplete the fats  between the cells, causing the most damage to the protective barrier. "The  stratum corneum tends to crack on people with dry skin, and evaporation occurs  very quickly," Leyden says. New moisturizers such as Estee Lauder's Time Zone  and Biotherm's Aqualogic are aimed at replenishing the fats, or lipids, to keep  the stratum corneum intact.  </P> <P> "It is possible to replace those lipids to help correct an abnormal outer layer  of the skin," says Santa Monica dermatologist Nicholas Lowe, a professor at the  UCLA School of Medicine. He notes that the test of an effective moisturizer is  how long it keeps the skin moist: "A superior moisturizer can have a  cumulative, more lasting effect than products that just sit on the skin,  temporarily holding moisture in."  </P> <P> "By 'regluing' those skin cells together, moisture stays in the skin where it  belongs," says Walter Smith, Lauder senior vice president of research and  development. "This keeps the stratum corneum in better condition, allowing it  to get stronger over time, so you actually have long-term benefits."  </P> <P> Keeping skin soft and pliable is easier with lighter creams that can penetrate  the stratum corneum and distribute proteins and fats throughout the protective  layer. Old moisturizer formulas need to be viscous to support heavy fats and  proteins, but new ones make use of ingredients whose smaller molecular  structures allow them to be mixed with much lighter emollients. Some, such as  Prescriptive's Simply Moisture and Rene Guinot's Hydrazone, are so light that  manufacturers say even women with oily skin can use them without fear of  clogging pores.  </P> <P> For the remainder of winter, the season for peak moisturizer sales, Lowe  suggests that consumers look for products that perform dual functions. "It's no  longer enough for a product to be an effective moisturizer -- it should also  contain a sunscreen," he says. Time Zone, Schering's Complex 15 and Stendahl's  Hydro Extreme combine sun protection with moisturizing ingredients.  </P> <P> So, while dermatologists could once recommend only messy petroleum jelly as an  effective moisturizer, the list of alternatives has grown. "Today, many of the  new products make logical sense," Elias says. "We've come a long way from  Vaseline."  </P> <P> Stylist: Mindy Hahn; hair and makeup: Max McBeth / Celestine / Cloutier; model:  Caren Goldstein / eastwest PRIMA; mirror courtesy of La Maison Francaise Inc.  </P></p>

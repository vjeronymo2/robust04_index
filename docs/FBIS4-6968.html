			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video followed by live relay; </F> from the "NHK News" program]    [Text] Here is the reaction of Diet members from the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ], which decided to leave the  coalition government early this morning:    [Begin recording] [Koken Nosaka, chairman of SDPJ Diet  Affairs Committee] We need to have a new sense of courage and  determination to face this difficult situation. It might be  tough, but if we fail to overcome this hardship, we will not be  able to meet the people's expectations.    [House of Councillors member Hajime Fukada] I think we have  the overwhelming support of the local chapters. Those who have  been distressed by the problems of the coalition in one way or  another have finally come to the end of their patience. I think  [SDPJ Chairman Tomiichi] Murayama's decision is in line with the  sentiments of our local activists.    [House of Representatives member Masao Sakon] I think it is  a  matter of course that Mr. Murayama should express such  indignation. What he did is good as an impulsive reaction to the  immediate situation, but we have to take the future outlook into  consideration and act carefully from now on. [end recording]    Here is a live relay from the Diet building on the SDPJ's  reaction:    [NHK political reporter Mikihiko Inoue] The SDPJ held an  emergency meeting of its Central Executive Committee for nearly  one hour at the Diet building from 0930 [0030 GMT] this morning.  As a result, the committee unanimously endorsed the decision by  Chairman Murayama and two other top party executives early this  morning to leave the coalition. It also reconfirmed the SDPJ's  policy of not participating in any policymaking or  decisionmaking meetings of the coalition government. Therefore,  both Chairman Murayama and SDPJ Secretary General Wataru Kubo  did not attend the party leaders' meeting going on right now at  the prime minister's official residence, which was convened by  the heads of the other ruling coalition parties which formed the  new parliamentary group "Kaishin" yesterday. Murayama returned  to SDPJ headquarters after the emergency Central Executive  Committee meeting ended to talk with officials of labor unions  supporting the SDPJ.    This morning, the biggest right wing faction in the SDPJ,  the  "Democrats" also held a general meeting. During the meeting,  the participants expressed the following opinions: The  high-handed political methods of Shinseito [Japan Renewal Party]  and the other parties are unacceptable; the SDPJ cannot possibly  return to the existing coalition framework; and the party must  seek new ways to win political power. Thus, the "Democrats"  group has also affirmed its support of the party leadership's  decision.    The SDPJ is scheduled to hold a general meeting of its  members of the lower and upper house at 1300 today to reconfirm  the party leadership's decision to leave the coalition. The  party leadership is also planning to hold a national meeting as  soon as possible to obtain the local chapters' support of its  decision. As of now, there is no possibility for the SDPJ to  revise its decision to leave the coalition. This ends the  report from the Diet building.</p>

			<p>921125 FT  25 NOV 92 / Survey of Derbyshire (7): A fresh approach - Politics DERBYSHIRE'S relations with central government have moved into a more emollient phase. It used to be one of the counties which the Thatcher government loved to hate and politicians of both parties would talk of 'the Bookbinder factor' - a testimony to the high profile of Mr David Bookbinder, the County Council's Labour leader. He was a controversial figure of firm opinions and firm expression, not least in his attacks on the Conservatives, a man who flittered across the national consciousness when he mooted property ventures in the Crimea, sold part of the county art collection and became engaged in rows about rates and Poll Tax capping. But he stepped down last April. Since then he has faded from political view and his place has been taken by Mr Martin Doughty whose approach is more pragmatic and conciliatory. Accepting the reality of the last general election result, he is reconciled to working within the system. Mr Doughty acknowledges a change of style. An example is the thorny question of local government financing where Derbyshire argues that it, like other counties of the Midlands and North, is disadvantaged in comparison with southern local authorities. The favourite comparison is with Hertfordshire which, three years ago, is said to have been spending Pounds 3m a year less than Derbyshire but which is now spending Pounds 60m more. Derbyshire complains that the way in which the county's Standard Spending Assessment is made up by the central government has deprived it of Pounds 90m over three years. 'In the past we might have said this is a Tory plot, shouted from the rooftops and not got anywhere. What we've done this time is to put the technical argument together,' said Mr Doughty, referring to submissions made to the government earlier this month. Such an approach requires patience and the county accepts that action is likely to be slow. 'Whilst the case for change is convincing, it is accepted that some of the major issues affecting local government finance for 1993-94  -in particular the introduction of the Council Tax - may leave insufficient time to look at flaws in SSAs,' the submission said. Derbyshire, in short, has learned to live with a central government of different political persuasion. It is true that since Mr John Major formed a government the attitude towards Labour local authorities has become less antagonistic. But a combination of softer attitudes both at the centre and in Matlock, the county seat, has taken the heat out of contentious issues. Thus there is a more co-operative attitude on both sides to the running of the Derbyshire police, whose standards and financing had been sharply criticised by the inspector of constabulary, and the government has backed away from its threat of a public inquiry into the running of the country's public libraries. Such an amelioration in relations between Whitehall and Matlock, however, comes against background of growing competition between the local authorities of the county. This has been set off by the presence of the county in the first tranche of authorities whose boundaries are being considered by the Local Government Commission in line with the government's policy of stripping out a tier of local government wherever it can. Each of the 10 local authorities in the county is arguing the case for its own retention, the county council no less than any of the others. Such rivalry transcends party political allegiances. And the more relaxed attitude of Labour on the county council since the departure of Mr Bookbinder seems to have lowered the political temperature. The altercations between Conservative Derby city and Labour county council have stopped. 'I've started to have meetings with the leader of Derby city,' said Mr Doughty. 'I'm particularly keen to decentralise power away from myself. 'I've also been at pains to involve opposition groups in decision-making,' he added, noting that the Conservative leader has been joining the representations to the government on the questions of the Standard Spending Assessment and the local government review. It is a comment on past political relations in Derbyshire, as distinct from some other parts of the Midlands, that such aims are worth expressing and not taken for granted. In Birmingham, for example, political squabbling has not prevented a bipartisan approach to the big issues of civic development. The political colour of the county is, in any case, mixed. Although Labour is strong at the county council level, it is less dominant at the parliamentary level. At the last general election, despite swings in its favour of between 1.96 per cent and 7.94 per cent in all but two of the seats in the county, it failed to make any gains. The two exceptions to the general swing were Chesterfield, the Labour constituency of Mr Tony Benn, where there was a swing to the Liberal Democrats, and Derbyshire West where Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the sitting Conservative member, had a swing of 6.55 per cent in his favour from the Liberal Democrats. Indeed, six of the 10 parliamentary seats in the county are held by the Conservatives. Of the two seats in Derby, which at first glance would appear a natural Labour area, one is held by the Conservatives. And the Conservatives have managed to retain control of - just - the city council. But, apart from Derbyshire Dales, a largely rural area, and High Peak, where the council is hung, Labour have control of all the other boroughs and districts.</p>

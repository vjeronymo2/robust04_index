			<p>930421 FT  21 APR 93 / UK Company News: Boosey &amp; Hawkes scores classic win THE POPULAR success of a classical symphony was cited as the most remarkable feature of the past year by Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument maker and musical publisher which yesterday reported increased sales, profits and dividend. It said the third symphony by Gorecki, a Polish composer, which entered the pop album charts, had now sold 250,000 copies worldwide which would eventually earn the company Pounds 50,000 - although none of that was included in the results to December 31. Sales rose 10.6 per cent to Pounds 59.4m while pre-tax profits increased 5.4 per cent to Pounds 4.23m. Both the instrument and publishing divisions saw an increase in sales, but only publishing contributed to the growth in profits. Mr Walter Connor, chairman, said he was pleased with the results, which were achieved 'despite the extremely tough market conditions'. Turnover in the instrument division increased 10.5 per cent to Pounds 47.7m, but operating profit was 4.5 per cent lower at Pounds 2.9m. Overheads were reduced but competitive pressures on prices cut margins. About 35 jobs have gone from the UK factory which makes brass instruments and flutes and 25 jobs have been moved from the Frankfurt area to eastern Germany, where woodwind instruments can be made more economically. The publishing division increased sales 11.2 per cent to Pounds 11.7m and operating profit 6.7 per cent to Pounds 3.9m. In spite of worldwide reductions in arts funding, the group said its serious music catalogue - contemporary works and back catalogue alike - produced significant royalty growth. Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said that although confidence in the UK was starting to recover, world market conditions continued to be tough, especially in mainland Europe and Japan. However, he expected the group to emerge from the recession with good long-term growth prospects. Earnings rose 8 per cent to 67.5p. A final dividend of 16p makes a 22p (20p) total.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by RIA-NOVOSTI correspondent Rudolf Khiltunen: </F> "Finland-NATO: There Should Be No Hurry Over Joining"]    [Text] Helsinki -- In connection with the process of talks  on Finland joining the European Union, the signing of  Partnership for Peace treaties with NATO by a number of  countries in East Europe, including the CIS, and statements on  the possible conclusion of a similar document in Helsinki by  Russia in the very near future, high-ranking military figures  are increasingly frequently expressing their attitude to the  consequences for the country's defense policy.    At a seminar held at the end of March, Lieutenant General  Matti Kopra, chief of the Finnish Defense Forces General Staff  Operations Directorate, for example, urged the Finns to be  cautious when assessing and implementing decisions in the sphere  of defense policy. "We should be in no hurry to become members  of any military alliances," he said. "Our country now has more  options in the sphere of security policy than at any time in its  history. They must all be weighed up cautiously and unhurriedly."    The general also warned against adopting decisions in the  defense sphere on the basis of "suddenly emerging notions of an  external threat to Finland." "Our defensive system," he pointed  out, "is a result of long-term planning and cannot be altered  substantially in the space of a few years."    Academician Pekka Jauho, who studies these so-called notions  of a threat, pointed out at the seminar that Finland's military  position is being consistently complicated as a result of the  changes in Europe. He voiced doubt that the country's security  can be ensured with the help of any collective system in the  event of a serious crisis.    Researcher Juha Martelius, who reported on Russia's new  military doctrine, believes that the Russian Federation is  concerned about the threat of NATO expanding to the borders of  its immediate neighbors, as well as the worsening situation  concerning the political and economic rights of Russia's  citizens in the "near abroad." He believes that, at worst,  Russia might consider Finland also to be part of the "near  abroad." Second, "the self-organization of ethnic minorities of  Russians and of Finns who have come here from St. Petersburg and  the oblast to take up permanent residence has now become  apparent in Finland, as a result of which not only a hotbed of  social tension but also a security risk might arise in time."  (Martelius is an expert on Russian affairs in the secret --  political -- police.)    One more question concerning Russia. Attention was attracted  at the end of March by a statement by Lt. Gen. Lass Vekhter  [name as transliterated], deputy commander of the Northern  Military District, who was once military adjutant to President  Urho Kekkonen. For security reasons he objects to the planned  construction of a highway from Salla in northern Finland to  Alakurtti in Murmansk Oblast. A Russian air unit is stationed  in the latter population center. But the civilian authorities  in the northern provinces of Oulu and Lappi adhere to a  different opinion, considering this road beneficial to the  economic development of both countries.    Martti Ahtisaari, Finland's new president, recently gave his  first news conference after taking up his post. He reported  that Finland's Partnership for Peace treaty with NATO might be  concluded this spring. But the time of signing will not depend  on the corresponding schedules of neighboring countries --  Sweden and Russia. There is no hurry here, the president said.</p>

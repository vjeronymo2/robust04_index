			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / Italy blames bankers in US for BNL loans AN Italian parliamentary report yesterday blamed US bankers for a scandal involving the Atlanta branch of the Banca Nazionale Del Lavoro (BNL) which helped finance Iraq's arms programme before the Gulf war, Reuter reports from Rome. By August 1989 the US branch had made unauthorised loans totalling Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) to Baghdad. The report quoted former Iraqi foreign minister Tariq Aziz as saying one reason Baghdad invaded Kuwait in August 1990 was that the loans on which Iraq depended, through BNL's Atlanta branch, had dried up a year before. The 84-page report said it was clear the US branch of the Italian bank had played a key role in an American-led campaign to help Iraq defeat Iran in their 1980-87 war. 'A large part of the financial resources - which were managed by the United States - came from BNL,' it said. The report was adopted by a committee of inquiry set up by the Senate (upper house). The committee blamed BNL Atlanta's auditors for failing to detect any wrongdoing and said the Georgia State Banking Department was also at fault, as well as the Federal Reserve, the US central bank. But it ruled out the possibility that the Atlanta branch manager had acted alone and strongly criticised BNL's management.</p>

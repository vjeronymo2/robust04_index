			<p>BFN     [Text] Bern, 8 Jun (EFE) -- Swiss Foreign Minister Flavio  Cotti said he is "deeply annoyed" by the presence of Chilean  Army Commander General Augusto Pinochet in Switzerland.    According to today's issue of LUZERNER NEUSTEN NACHRICHTEN,  Cotti said he understands the indignation of Chileans living in  Switzerland.    Cotti regretted there is no longer the juridical possibility  of preventing Pinochet from entering the country.    Pinochet's stay in Lucerne on 7 June caused protests by the  Green Alliance, the Swiss Socialist Youth, the Swiss Council for  Peace, and the Work Group for Arms Control and the Prohibition  of Arms Exports because, according to some information, the  Chilean Army is reportedly interested in buying weapons.    Green Alliance Deputy Cecile Buhlmann said Gen. Pinochet  should be considered an "undesirable person in Switzerland" and  that she would questioned the Lucerne Legislature about his visa  permit.</p>

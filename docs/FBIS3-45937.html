			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> ["Earnestly Study the `Decision' of the Third Plenary </F> Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee" column by Liu  Zhifeng, vice minister of the State Commission for Restructuring  Economy: "Speed Up Residential Housing Reform in Towns and  Cities, Promote Development of Residential Housing Construction"]    [Text] For many years past, the party and the government  have allocated large amounts of funds for urban housing  construction but this has still failed to meet the basic housing  needs of urban residents. A major reason is that there were  many problems with the old housing system. It is now necessary  to quicken the reform of the urban housing system, increase the  input to the construction of residential housing, bring about a  benign cycle in the circulation of funds for housing  construction, accelerate house construction, and raise the  housing conditions for the urban residents to a comparatively  wealthy level by the year 2000. This will: Help reduce the  social burdens borne by the enterprises and institutions and  promote the transformation of the enterprise management  mechanisms and the establishment of a modern enterprise system.  This is also of great significance in promoting the:  Development of the real estate and other relevant industries;  adjustment of the economic structure; sustained, rapid, and  healthy development of the national economy; and in promoting  social fairness and checking irregularities in the field of  housing distribution.  <H3>  I. Major Progress Has Been Made in Our Country's Housing  Reform </H3>   In 1980, Comrade Deng Xiaoping put forward a general housing  reform concept which included the sale of public housing, the  adjustment of rents, and measures to encourage individuals to  buy and build houses. According to this idea, the reform of the  urban housing system in our country has been continuously making  progress through explorations and summing up experience in  practice. In particular, since the Second National Work  Conference on Reform of the Urban Housing System in October  1992, major progress has been made in our country's housing  reform, which has advanced from the stage of pilot schemes in a  small number of cities and on a small scale to the new stage of  comprehensive and across-the-board reforms and the overall  climate for housing reform has taken shape. Some large and  medium state-owned enterprises took the lead in substantially  raising rents; selling public housing at cost price; setting up  housing development companies; separating the functions of  building, distributing, repairing, and managing houses from the  functions of the enterprises; and promoting the the three major  reforms in the enterprises and the transformation of the  operation mechanisms. At the same time, the system of housing  funds has also been adopted widely. At present, the system of  housing funds has been adopted by 104 of the 194 cities at and  above the prefectural level in the country. The housing  financial system has also been developed. The local governments  at all levels and the enterprises and institutions have  increased their input to housing construction. They attach  importance to the development of housing projects which are  affordable and functional. The funds for housing construction  are raised through a variety of forms and the projects are  started using various methods of cooperation. This has  quickened the settlement of the people's housing difficulties  and has markedly improved the urban residents' living  conditions. In 1980, the per capita floor area of living  quarters for urban residents was 3.9 square meters; in 1992,  this had increased to 7.1 square meters. Most cities have  offered housing to households which originally had only less  than 2 square meters per capita of floor space.  <H5>  II. Basic Framework of New Urban Housing System </H5>   According to the objective of establishing the socialist  market economic structure, the State Council's leading group for  housing reform set out a seven-point guideline for reform of the  urban housing system and for the new system.    1. Changing the original system, under which the state and  employer institutions bore total responsibility for the  investment in housing construction, and replacing it with a new  system whereby the state, institutions, and individuals jointly  make investments according to a reasonable ratio. That is, the  state exempts the land use fee for the construction of  affordable and functional housing projects, the employer  institutions help the employees set up housing funds, and  individuals bear the costs of construction.    2. Changing the original system whereby employer  institutions are responsible for building, distributing,  repairing, and managing residential housing and replacing it  with a new system under which specialized institutions perform  such functions in society.    3. Changing the system of distributing housing as welfare  benefit in kind and replacing such welfare benefit with monetary  wages.    4. Establishing an integrated system for the supply of  affordable and functional housing to households with ordinary  income as part of the social security program and also a system  for the supply of commodity houses to households with high  incomes.    5. Adopting the housing funds system across the board.    6. Developing the housing financial services, including  savings for housing construction, individual housing mortgages,  installment payments, and housing insurance. A housing credit  system composed of both policy-determined credit and commercial  credit arrangements should be established.    7. Establishing a regular market for housing transactions  and a market for housing maintenance and management; developing  institutions which offer housing management, decoration, and  maintenance services; and improving the related administrative  and taxation systems.    According to the requirement laid down by the Third Plenary  Session of the 14th CPC Central Committee on quickening the  urban housing reform and promoting the process of housing  commercialization and the development of housing construction,  we shall strive to basically establish the new urban housing  system in the 1990's. Localities with favorable conditions  should take the lead in doing this.  <H5>  III. Basic Conception for Accelerating Housing Reform </H5>   Although great achievements have been made in the field of  housing reform, we still face some prominent problems. In  particular, since the second half of 1992, the housing reform  has been facing two major difficulties:    First, it is hard to further raise the rents. According to  the original plan, by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan,  rents for residential housing will cover the three major costs,  namely, the costs of maintenance and management as well as the  depreciation charges; by the end of the Ninth Five-Year Plan,  rents should reflect the level of the five factors, namely, the  maintenance charges, the management charges, the depreciation  charges, the investment returns, and the property taxes.  However, at present, in the areas where housing reform has been  carried out, the average level of rents is only around 0.3 yuan  per square meter, even lower than the 1992 maintenance cost of  0.75 yuan per square meter. It will be rather difficult to  attain the planned target (the 1992 level of the three factors  reached 1.92 yuan per square meter). When considering the action  of raising rents, many city governments were facing financial  difficulties with the other local governments and the  enterprises as well as the inadequate bearing capacity of the  residents. This made it hard for them to make the decision.  Other factors making it hard to raise rents include the  wait-and-see attitude of some local governments which do not  have a firm determination to advance the reform.    Second, the policy of selling houses at the original  standard  price has poor adaptability and lacks the dynamic adjustment  mechanism for the transition to selling houses at a slight  profit. According to the existing housing reform policy, houses  may be sold at a standard price or at the market price (the  standard price includes the cost of the houses proper, the cost  of requisitioning land, and the cost of resettlement). In  practice, however, being representative of the state's unified  policy, the standard price can hardly be suited to the concrete  conditions of various localities. For example, in the northern  areas, the walls are thick and there are heating facilities  inside the houses. That is, the costs of the houses are higher.  However, being constrained by the conditions of economic  development, workers' income is not high; on the contrary, the  walls of the houses in the southern areas are thinner and there  are no heating facilities, so the costs of the houses are lower  but workers' incomes there are not low. If the price is fixed  according to the costs of the houses, it is hard to sell the  houses in cities where the house costs are high but workers'  income is low. In addition, the conditions in large and medium  cities are quite different from those in small cities.  According to some surveys, in 1992, the housing standard price  in large and medium cities was 900 yuan per square meter. A new  two-bedroom apartment unit with a floor space of 56 square  meters would be sold at more than 50,000 yuan. This is not  affordable to a worker household with average income. However,  in some small cities, the house construction costs are lower.  Being compared with workers' payment ability, the houses may be  sold at a price a little higher than the standard price but  because of the policy about the standard price, houses in these  localities are still sold at the standard price which even  excludes the costs of land requisition and resident  resettlement. This is not conducive to the transition to  slightly profitable prices. Moreover, the objective of the  housing reform is to eventually realize housing  commercialization and to form a system of selling houses at  slightly profitable prices and at market prices. The standard  price is only a transitional form but the standard prices  composed of the two factors is static and cannot be gradually  replaced with slightly profitable prices along with the  development of the economy.    According to the spirit of the Third Plenary Session of the  14th CPC Central Committee and the current conditions of the  housing reform, as well as the current financial, enterprise,  and macroeconomic situations, and in accordance with the  requirements of establishing a new housing system, the State  Council's leading group for housing reform set out the  basic concept for accelerating the reform of the urban  housing system: While simultaneously selling, renting, and  building houses, we should focus efforts on selling the existing  public housing; increase the intensity of the rental reform;  adopt the housing funds system across the board; speed up the  construction of affordable and functional houses; formulate  backup policies; foster markets; accelerate the process of  housing commercialization and socialization; establish a new  urban housing system suited to the requirements of the socialist  market economy at an early date; and strive to raise the housing  conditions of the urban residents to the level of being  comparatively well-off by the year 2000. The adoption of such a  basic concept mainly gives consideration to the following  issues.    1. The housing reform must be quickened. If  the housing reform is not advanced, a chain of serious problems  may arise. First, if the housing reform is delayed any longer  state finances and the enterprises will have to increase the  subsidies and the cost of the reform will increase. According  to the calculations, raising the rents to the sum of the five  factors in 1987 would have required 27 billion yuan in  subsidies; in 1990, this increased to 41.6 billion yuan; and in  1992, this sharply increased to 67 billion yuan, increasing by 8  billion yuan each year. [figures as published] Second, if the  housing reform is not advanced, the existing public houses will  still not be the wealth of the state and the enterprises, but  their "burdens." By the end of 1992, there was a total of 2.7  billion square meters of public housing. If its value was 350  yuan per square meter, then the 2 percent losses each year would  amount to 18.9 billion yuan. In addition, the state and the  enterprises still had to spend 7-8 billion yuan on maintaining  and managing these houses. That is to say, the state and the  enterprises would lose 25.9 to 26.9 billion yuan a year. Third,  in some cities and localities, because the rents could not be  raised and the houses could not be sold at the standard price,  some institutions made their own policies for selling houses.  Although the quantity of houses being sold was not large, more  and more localities decided to sell houses. In the course of  selling houses, the prices were not regularized and the policies  were not unified, thus institutions and localities vied with  each other in selling houses at a lower price. This was not  conducive to the long-term housing development in the same area,  nor to the healthy advances of the housing reform in the whole  country. It was also not conducive to the reinforcement and  improvement of macroeconomic control. Fourth, if the housing  reform is not quickened, it will not be possible to establish  the new housing system and this is unfavorable to the expansion  of housing construction and the improvement of urban residents'  housing conditions. This will seriously affect the fulfillment  of the plan to raise the housing conditions of urban residents  to the level of being comparatively well-off by the year 2000  and will be unfavorable to the transformation of the enterprise  operation mechanism and the establishment of the socialist  market economic system.    2. The realistic option for quickening the housing  reform is to lay stress on selling the existing public houses  and to simultaneously promote sales, rental, and  construction. The main means of housing commercialization  is to raise rents and to sell houses. However, in the last few  years, the cost of housing maintenance and management and the  construction costs of new houses have been increasing rapidly.  The increase rate of rents could not keep pace with the  increase rate of prices and the effects of rent increases were  substantially offset by price increases. Moderate rent  increases can hardly break through the deadlocked situation in  the housing reform. If stress is laid on selling existing  public houses this will, first of all, help enliven the housing  stock, quicken the recovery of the funds, promote housing  construction, and turn the public housing in stock from a  "burden" to assets in real terms. If 10 percent of the existing  2.7 billion square meters of public housing was sold at 350 yuan  per square meter, 94.5 billion yuan will be recovered. Second,  this will help increase the intensity of the rental reform.  After part of the existing public houses are sold, rent  increases will affect fewer workers and the funds needed for  subsidizing rents will decrease. This will be conducive to  substantial rent increases. Third, when house sales and rent  increases are effected at the same time in a well- coordinated  reform, the current deadlocked situation in which "rents cannot  be raised and houses cannot be sold" will be changed. If rents  cannot be raised, it is certain that nobody will be willing to  buy houses and houses will thus not sell well or will have to be  sold at lower prices. In the next few years, if the policies  for selling houses and raising rents are announced and put into  practice at the same time, and if the ratio of prices to rents  is properly adjusted every year to make workers feel that it is  more worthwhile to buy houses sooner rather than later, then  house sales will become the breakthrough point of the housing  reform and will push rents to a higher level. Thus, a favorable  cycle in which sales promote rent increases and vice versa, will  take shape. As the state built and distributed houses in a  unified way, and the monetary wages for workers' housing  consumption were deducted from the total wage expenditure and  replaced with the distribution of real houses to workers, the  public housing in stock cannot be generally regarded as state  assets. If prices are fixed reasonably, and if there are strict  rules for secondary housing transactions, then the state asset  erosion problem will not exist. Fifth, at present, urban  residents have a strong sense of property rights and also have  better financial conditions, so the sales of public housing will  be suited to their wish to purchase and own their own property.    3. In order to promote regularized housing sales in  various localities, it is necessary to readjust the policies for  house sales. At present, most localities do not sell  houses at the standard price specified by the housing reform  policy, and the prices are generally too low. To solve the  problems in the original house sales policy, the new policy  should be formulated according to workers' wage levels so that  prices may be fixed according to their financial capacity and  can be adjusted according to the differences in the level of  economic development in all parts of the country. The lowest  price for house sales should be fixed each year and favorable  unified policies should be formulated, thus preventing some  localities from selling public housing at unreasonably low  prices. It is necessary to establish the dynamic adjustment  mechanism for the gradual transition from the standard price to  the slightly profitable prices along with economic development,  thus encouraging workers to buy houses earlier. In order to  give expression to policy continuity, the term "standard price"  in the original housing reform policy should be kept but the  content of this term should be adjusted. The new standard price  should be composed of the burden price [fu dan jia 6298 2137  0116] and the transaction price [di jiao jia 2107 0074 0116].  The burden price is determined by the average annual wage  income of a working couple in a city or an area and the  transaction price is determined by the amount of housing funds  and subsidies in the institution. The standard price should be  gradually replaced with a slightly profitable price and there  are two adjustment mechanisms: First, with the increases in  workers' wage income, the burden price determined by the average  annual wage income of a working couple should be raised  accordingly; and second, the ratio of the burden price of a new  house to the average annual wage income of a working couple  should also be gradually enlarged. It is necessary to unify the  rules and policies for the discounts in house sales. This  should include the discount determined by the purchaser's  working seniority and the discount for lump-sum payment. The  working- seniority-determined discount should be based on the  number of years in which the house-purchasing worker did not  enjoy the housing fund in the past and this is, in fact, a  compensation for the short payment of monetary wages for housing  in the past. The discount for lump-sum payment is a  compensation for the interest losses of the house purchaser and  this may encourage workers to effect lump-sum payment when  buying houses.    4. Properly carrying out backup reforms. It is  now necessary to coordinate the formulation and simultaneous  adoption of the systems for selling public housing, raising  rents, and setting up housing funds across the board, as well as  the systems for arranging individual mortgages and installment  payments. The policies for developing and regularizing the  markets for housing transactions and for housing maintenance and  management, as well as the relevant tax policies, should also be  properly formulated and implemented at the same time. None of  these things is dispensable. Only thus can urban residents have  the motivation and the financial capacity for buying houses and  only thus can their misgivings be removed in the course of  purchasing houses.    The rental reform is always an important part of the reform  of the housing system. The goal is to raise rents to the level  equivalent to the sum of the maintenance charges, the management  charges, and the depreciation charges by the end of the Eighth  Five- Year Plan and further raise rents to the level equivalent  to the sum of the five factors, namely, the maintenance charges,  the management charges, the depreciation charges, the investment  returns, and the property taxes. In cities and areas where it  is indeed difficult to achieve this target, the proportion of  rental expenditure in the overall household expenditure should  still be raised to a certain level. A reasonable ratio between  the prices and the rents should be fixed in the rental reform.  In international practice, the reasonable ratio is about 1:90.  That is, the sale price of each square meter of floor space  should be 90 times the monthly rent of the same floor space. At  present, it is difficult to reach this ratio on the whole.  However, rationalizing the ratio between the sale price and the  rent should be a goal for transforming the housing mechanism.  While formulating their annual housing reform schemes, various  localities should give consideration to this point and strive to  gradually achieve the goal. The localities with more favorable  conditions should achieve this goal as soon as possible. Various  localities should announce their rental reform programs before  the year 2000. The number and margin of rental increases should  be linked to the transition from the standard price to the  slightly profitable price. In cities and areas with favorable  conditions, the sum of the rents paid by workers themselves, the  housing subsidies to workers, and the part of rents covered by  the housing funds should gradually become closer to, or equal  to, the rental level determined by the reasonable ratio between  the sale price and the rent.    The housing fund system is favorable to the accumulation,  turnover, and circulation of the funds for housing construction.  It is also favorable to the transformation of the enterprise  operation mechanism. The distribution of housing as a welfare  benefit in kind can thus be changed into the distribution of  monetary wages. All administrative institutions and enterprises  should make regular contributions to the housing funds and  establish the housing fund system according to the principle of  "individual savings, institutional subsidies, unified  management, and use for the purpose earmarked."    At present, workers who have bought or will buy houses,  generally have certain misgivings in their minds. They fear  that after buying houses, nobody will take care of house  maintenance. To solve this problem, we must reform the current  urban housing management system and develop enterprises which  offer housing maintenance and management services under various  systems of ownership. Fair competition on an equal footing  should be encouraged among them and more conveniences should be  given to the residents. Various localities should actively  explore ways to establish the market for housing maintenance and  management and the market for housing transactions. The  relevant policies and regulations should be improved as soon as  possible and the housing market brought into the legal system.    5. The reform of the housing system should be closely  linked with housing development. The purpose of the  housing reform is to provide a good mechanism for housing  development. It is necessary to build up regular fundraising  channels for housing construction, expand the financial sources  for housing construction, increase the accumulation of housing  funds, and to gradually bring about a favorable cycle for the  input and output of housing funds. It is necessary to attach  importance to the construction of affordable and functional  housing and strive to lower the costs of house construction so  that the housing needs of workers with ordinary incomes can be  met more quickly. Favorable policies in the fields of arranging  construction land, resettlement, planning, project arrangements,  and taxation should be given to the institutions which construct  affordable and functional houses for ordinary workers. The  banking institutions should also give them financial support.  The funds raised and concentrated in the course of the housing  reform should mainly be used to build affordable and functional  houses and the real estate development companies should be  responsible for building 20 percent of these. It is necessary  to continue to develop the system of cooperative housing  construction through pooling funds in order to provide houses  for people still living in difficult or even dangerous  conditions more quickly.  <H3>  IV. Issues That Should Be Noticed At Present in the Course  of Quickening Housing Reform </H3>   To quicken the housing reform, it is necessary to exercise  more effective leadership over the work of housing reform, to  intensify propaganda related to the reform of the housing  system, to persistently carry out the principle of making  separate decisions according to the local conditions under the  guidance of the unified policies, and to properly arrange  reductions and exemptions for retired workers and workers with  low income. At present, it is particularly necessary to pay  attention to the following two issues:    First, the sales of houses at low prices must be  resolutely checked. Selling public housing is a major  measure in quickening housing reform. However, at present, some  local administrative organs, institutions, and enterprises are  selling public housing at too low prices in violation of the  State Council's relevant policies. Therefore, the State Council  General Office issued the "Circular on Checking Sales of Public  Housing At Low Prices." The circulart demanded that all  localities and departments suspend the sale of all public  housing before the promulgation and enforcement of the State  Council's "Decision on Quickening Reform of Urban Public  Housing"; screen all public housing which has been sold; and  effectively and strictly manage the funds from the sale of  public housing. Selling public housing at low prices is a  short-term action which only serves the immediate interests and  does not consider the long-term development. This is  unfavorable to the efforts to provide houses for people who are  still living in difficult and uneasy conditions and may give  rise to new unfairness in social distribution. This is also  unfavorable to the healthy development of housing reform and  must be resolutely checked. After the promulgation of the State  Council's "Decision on Quickening Reform of Urban Public  Housing," all localities must strictly carry out the State  Council's unified policies, substantially raise rents, and  arrange the sale of public housing in a well planned and orderly  manner on the basis of setting up the housing funds. They  should also conscientiously carry out reforms in other fields,  overcome short-sighted behavior and the welfare viewpoint in the  course of the housing reform, and prevent themselves from making  unrealistic comparisons and handling the housing reform as a  welfare measure. The actions of selling houses at low prices in  a short time, selling houses in violation of the relevant  policies by increasing favorable terms in a disguised form, and  using official powers and functions to seek private gains must  be resolutely checked.    Second, the reform of the urban housing system should  be focused on housing reform in the enterprises. All  localities should select a number of large and medium  state-owned enterprises with favorable conditions to take the  lead to increase the intensity of housing reform and raise the  rents substantially, thus promoting the sale of houses. This  should be linked with the transformation of the enterprises  operation mechanism and the three reforms in the enterprises.  Houses should no longer be managed by the enterprises but by  specialized institutions in society. A number of enterprises  may jointly set up property management companies under the  joint- stock system, or in other forms, to quicken the process  of separating the functions of constructing, distributing,  managing, and maintaining houses from the enterprises.    The reform of the urban housing system is an important issue  which concerns all households and the masses are most interested  in it. Therefore, it must be successful and must not fail. It  is hoped that people in all social circles will understand,  participate in, and support the housing reform and will make  joint efforts to successfully fulfill this important and arduous  reform task.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Jinan, May 30 (XINHUA) -- Shandong, one of China's  major bread baskets, is expected to reap another record harvest  for its summer crops this year, provincial officials announced  here today.    According to a recent survey and remote sensing by  meteorological satellite, the east China province is expected to  produce 20 billion kg of wheat, a little more than last year.    Wheat production accounts for half of Shandong's annual  grain  harvest. The province sowed 4.4 million hectares of wheat this  year, a little less than last year. But total output can be  better as per unit production can reach 5,805 kg per hectare, up  by 240 kg over last year.    Local officials attributed the growth of summer crop output  to improved field management, favorable weather conditions and  intensified efforts in technological extension services, as  high- quality seeds were provided for 95 percent of the sown  areas.</p>

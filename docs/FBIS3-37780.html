			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Radio Slavyanka" program of the Russian Defense </F> Ministry]    [Excerpts] The report on the upcoming Russian-U.S. military  exercises is an important piece of news. The fact of a joint  operation of units of the two armies, which were adversaries in  the recent past, is not surprising. However, details of such  events are always interesting. Here is Colonel General Georgiy  Kondratyev, Russian deputy defense minister, with the details  for "Slavyanka."    [Begin Kondratyev recording] It is the first time in the  existence of the Russian Armed Forces, and, beyond it, in the  whole period of the former Soviet Union, that such exercises  will take place. They will be joint, and will involve the 27th  Motor Rifle Division of the Volga military district of the  Russian Armed Forces and the 3d Infantry Division of the U.S.  Army.    Currently we -- that is myself, as deputy defense minister,  the infantry command, and the command of the Volga military  district -- we have already designed these exercises. According  to our design, the main aims of these exercises are:    First -- to jointly consider issues of a possible planning  of  peace keeping operations -- which documents are necessary for  them, how the personnel should be trained -- and also, during  the exercises themselves we will practice the real actions, an  approximation to actions of U.S. and Russian subunits in  conflict zones, i.e. real peacekeeping operations.    Not only the headquarters of those two divisions, but also  some subunits will be involved from both sides, because these  are command and staff exercises that also include troops. We  agreed that from 200 to 250 men, up to two companies, will take  part on each side and will use their usual military hardware and  means of reinforcement. I believe that these exercises will go  very well, and our officers will obtain certain expertise in  planning and deploying peacekeeping operations not only in CIS  countries but possibly anywhere in the world. [passage omitted]    Why has this become necessary? From 1992, as you know, we  have deployed peace keeping operations in the Dniester area, in  South Ossetia, and also in North Ossetia and Ingushetia to some  degree -- there is a group of troops there. We also we took  part, to a degree, in the Abkhaz-Georgian conflict, and the  recent agreement between Russian President Boris Nikolayevich  Yeltsin and Mr. Shevardnadze in Tbilisi envisages that Russians  may deploy a peace- keeping operation in Abkhazia under the  umbrella of the CSCE and maybe the United Nations as well. We  have been working toward it.    That is why there is an obvious necessity today to share  experiences by way of organizing such exercises. We will  continue to have exercises. I believe this is useful for both  the Russian and the American sides. It is also useful for other  countries. [end recording]</p>

Democratic Party, Rukh, Communists, and  Socialists are Front-Runners in Election Campaign"]    [Excerpts] Public opinion polls conducted on the eve of  elections for the Ukrainian Supreme Council have shown that  question No. 1 for many voters is as follows: "Will a new  parliament be elected?" This cannot be answered yet. There are  a number of options. According to the pollsters, from 70 to 87  percent of the voters plan to turn out for the election. But  while the elections are held according to the majority  principle, the voters' preferences vary too much. This is why  none of the candidates appears to be able to win the requisite  50 percent of the vote: there are too many contenders for one  seat, the average number throughout the country being 13-15  candidates. The second round to be held upon the emergence of  two front-runners in each district may not take place at all  because of low turnout: those who voted for a democrat will  never turn out to elect a communist or a nationalist, and the  other way around. [passage omitted]    There is still only one realistic candidate to the post of  head of state -- former Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma, who draws  on support from the director corps and the Interregional Reform  Bloc [IRB], an organization that is being set up to back his  bid. This association, also known as the "Kuchma-Grinev" bloc,  plans to form its faction at the Supreme Council and to set up a  political party. The IRB, which was created one month ago, does  not have a clear program and comprises people of all stripes --  cautious Rukh members; former nomenklatura, albeit not the most  notorious ones; and people of artistic professions who are well  known by themselves.    What will happen if the parliamentary elections do not take  place? Currently rumors are circulating that Leonid Kravchuk is  going to impose direct presidential rule as the sole head of  state elected by the entire people. In this case he would need  a structure to rely upon, and observers think that the  "Kuchma-Grinev" bloc may well prove to be such a support. At  any rate, Mr. Grinev himself has not ruled out the possibility  of cooperating with Kravchuk on certain terms. [passage omitted]</p>

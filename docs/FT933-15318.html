			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / The Property Market: A battle to win credit - Turbulence at Trizec, North America's biggest developer All the signals coming from Trizec's head office in Calgary, Alberta, suggest that North America's biggest publicly traded property developer is girding for the struggle of its life. From beefing up the number of independent directors on its board to bringing in a joint chief executive skilled in public relations, Trizec is working to win the confidence of employees, shareholders and, most of all, creditors. The company is due to lift the veil within the next few weeks on long-awaited proposals to lighten its CDollars 5.3bn (Pounds 2.76bn) debt burden. At about the same time, it expects to outline a new business plan, spelling out how resources will be deployed over the next few years in its three main businesses: shopping centres, office buildings and retirement communities. Trizec owns more than 160 properties in the US and Canada covering a total of 72m square feet of space. Its portfolio is almost double the North American holdings of Olympia &amp; York, whose collapse last year deepened the chill in real estate markets across the US and Canada. Trizec's assets include many prime office blocks in cities from Los Angeles to Atlanta; a large portfolio of modern shopping centres; and an exposure to the fast-growing retirement-home market. The stakes for Trizec are high. 'If it doesn't go through with the restructuring, it's toast,' says one Toronto real estate financing specialist. The recent confidence-building steps are a measure of the turbulence which has buffeted Trizec. Besides the challenge of finding tenants for its own properties, it has been caught in the wake of crises at its two biggest shareholders and its largest subsidiary. The business empire controlled by the Toronto branch of the Bronfman family has a 53 per cent voting interest in Trizec through Carena Developments and other Bronfman holding companies. Trizec's recent appointment of four new independent directors, combined with a reduction in the board's size, appears designed to reassure outsiders who have been concerned about its links with the tangled Bronfman group. 'It's both a dressing up and represents real change,' one analyst says. Meanwhile, uncertainty hangs over the 25 per cent equity stake (equal to 8 per cent of the votes) in Trizec nominally held by Olympia &amp; York, the Toronto-based developer which emerged from court protection earlier this year a shadow of its former self. O&amp;Y's shares are now controlled by Citibank and six Japanese banks, to which they were pledged as collateral for a loan. The bank shareholders are currently examining their options. Trizec has been called on several times to support Bramalea, a debt-laden subsidiary which over-extended itself in the California and Ontario housing markets. Bramalea earlier this year completed a restructuring of its CDollars 4.5bn debt. The conversion of a sizeable chunk of the debt to equity has cut Trizec's interest from 72 per cent to 20 per cent, allowing it to stop consolidating Bramalea in its books. A writedown of the Bramalea investment comprised the bulk of Trizec's CDollars 544m loss in 1992. Trizec is now giving top priority to its own looming cash crunch. Without a vigorous revival in property markets, its cash flow is inadequate to meet debt repayments and a CDollars 149m preferred-share redemption due over the next two years. Ms Melanie Ward, analyst at RBC Dominion Securities in Toronto, estimated in a report last December that the company faces a cash shortfall of CDollars 899m in 1994, even after fully drawing down its bank operating lines. Since then, Ms Ward has cut her cash-flow forecasts further by 24 per cent for 1993 and 18 per cent next year. (Dominion Securities and Goldman Sachs are acting as financial advisers to Trizec during the restructuring.) Trizec is being forced to accept lower rents on many office leases, totalling 2.2m sq ft, which expire this year. Its latest financial statements noted that, provided the economy picks up, 'rents should stabilise in the months ahead, but it will take some time before they are restored to normal levels'. One example of the pressures on Trizec is its Bay-Adelaide Centre in downtown Toronto. The 57-storey office tower was conceived as a flagship project but is turning out to be a heavy millstone. The property slump has brought construction to a halt on the 1.6m sq ft centre. Ms Ward estimates that Trizec has already spent CDollars 250m on its 50 per cent interest in the project. But more funds are required to re-start work on the tower. In addition, the biggest tenant signed up so far is in the process of being taken over, and is likely to require less office space. Equally problematic for Trizec is its limited options in the forthcoming debt talks. With its share price languishing at little more than CDollars 1 (down from a peak of CDollars 29 in 1989), raising new equity is out of the question. Existing shareholders are unlikely to take kindly to another share issue on the heels of a big private placement in mid-1992 which expanded the number of Trizec shares by 22 per cent. Trizec's main bankers, Royal Bank of Canada and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, are also nervously watching the company's every move. With property financing in North America still in the doldrums, prospects for rolling over loans or raising new debt are uncertain. Nor can Trizec expect gentle treatment from holders of its CDollars 1bn-plus senior debentures, which observers expect will be at the centre of the restructuring. Many of the securities originally placed with public investors are now held by US 'vulture funds'. These funds and other holders demonstrated their tenacity earlier this year by extracting big concessions in negotiations with Bramalea, Trizec's debt-laden subsidiary. When he unveils the debt plan later this month, Mr Kevin Benson, Trizec's chairman and joint chief executive officer, is expected to warn debenture and preferred-share holders that they risk losing everything if they refuse to extend maturities and accept other sacrifices. The collapse of the restructuring effort could ripple further afield. Despite its problems, analysts agree that Trizec's situation is not as precarious as either O&amp;Y or Bramalea's. Trizec has already made several moves to improve liquidity, including the elimination of common-share dividends and the sale of almost all its 25 per cent stake in Rouse Company, the US shopping-mall developer. Trizec's assets are not as heavily leveraged as O&amp;Y's. Several hundred million dollars could still be raised by spinning off part of its wholly owned Hahn Company, another US shopping centre subsidiary which is widely regarded as Trizec's crown jewel. Alternatively, Trizec may seek equity investors in some of Hahn's 48 shopping malls. Other properties may also be put up for sale, although Trizec's interest in many of them is a leasehold one rather than the freehold, which is more attractive to prospective buyers. 'There probably is sufficient value in the assets to cover the liabilities,' one Toronto analyst says. He predicts that, unlike O&amp;Y, creditors will eventually accept the argument that Trizec is worth more alive than dead.</p>

			<p><P> February 11, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CLU GIVES UP LEAD IN 9TH, THEN RALLIES TO BEAT MASTER'S, 7-6  </P> <P> Down to his last strike in the bottom of the ninth inning with two out in a 6-6  tie, Cal Lutheran freshman Danny Weis looked for a pitch to hit. His coach,  Rich Hill, provided the inspiration.  </P> <P> "I was hoping Coach Hill would give me the green light," Weis said. "When he  did, I just let loose. I just went out and got it. It was a fastball, low and  away."  </P> <P> The ensuing two-strike double was Weis' first game-winning hit and propelled  the Kingsmen to a dramatic 7-6 victory over The Master's College on Friday.  </P> <P> But it was visiting Master's that provided the early drama. The Mustangs,  trailing by two runs, came out swinging in the top of the ninth. They drew  close, 6-5, on Craig Johnson's run-scoring double, but with two out Master's  (0-4 overall, 0-2 in NAIA District 3 play) had to look for a light of its own.  </P> <P> Like Weis, Master's third baseman Pete Wilson waved a magic bat, ripping a  double to right field to tie the score.  </P> <P> This day, however, would have only one hero.  </P> <P> "I'm numb," Weis said. "The whole thing feels like a dream."  </P> <P> Hill offered a more specific game summary.  </P> <P> "Master's played tough, you have to hand it to them," he said. "In the future  our team has to take advantage of run-scoring situations. Today, I'm just glad  we escaped with a win."  </P> <P> The victory, in fact, was Cal Lutheran's first. The Kingsmen are 1-1 overall,  1-0 in district play.  </P></p>

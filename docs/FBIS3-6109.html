When he took office, Kim Yong-sam made a noisy advertisement  as if he would bring something like "reforms" and "changes", but  nothing has changed, the analyst says, and continues:    He has only inherited the ruling system of the preceding  dictators, more harshly suppressed the people with physical  strength and made all social evils prevail.    The Kim Yong-sam group is now deeply vexed, expressing  "regret" at the report of the Amnesty International noting that  the human rights situation has not improved in South Korea.    The denunciation of the Kim Yong-sam group by the  international community is a result of its crimes. It deserves  that.    The Kim Yong-sam clique must step down before it faces  greater denunciation from the South Korean people and the  international community.</p>

The accord was signed by Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and  Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew.    Chinese Premier Li Peng and Singapore Prime Minister Goh  Chok  Tong, who arrived here this afternoon for a working visit,  attended the signing ceremony.    Under the agreement, both sides support Suzhou municipality  and the Singapore consortium to form a joint venture to develop  an industrial park (township) in Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu  Province.    The area for the first-phase development is eight square  kilometers. The project is designed to develop a modern  industrial park of considerable size, with modern industries as  the main structure, and new and high-tech as the leading  sectors, complemented by service industries and public welfare  services.    After the ceremony, Li Peng and his wife met with Prime  Minister Goh, Senior Minister Lee and his wife.    The decision by the two governments to develop the Suzhou  industrial park constitutes a major event in Sino-Singapore  ties, Li Peng told the guests.    This has provided a new pattern for the economic cooperation  between the two countries, Li Peng noted, adding that it is of  great significance in deepening the bilateral cooperative ties  of friendship.    Calling Goh and Lee old friends of the Chinese people, Li  Peng voiced appreciation of their efforts in promoting the  development of these bilateral ties of friendship.    In the past two years, Li Peng said, the relations between  China and Singapore have been developing smoothly and the two  countries have conducted fruitful cooperation.    The conclusion of the agreement in a relatively short period  of time demonstrates the sincerity of both sides, Li Peng said,  adding that there will be much to be done after the agreement  was signed.    The Chinese premier referred to the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou  area as a place propitious for giving birth to great men, with  favorable investment environment and labor of good quality.    He voiced the conviction that with the support of the two  governments, the industrial park would achieve fruitful results.    Briefing the guests on China's economy, Li Peng said that  since last year, the country has received an unprecedented  amount of foreign investment, with an increasing part going to  infrastructure and some expanded into the service industries.    China is opening its market even wider to the outside, Li  Peng said, adding that it welcomes cooperation of every kind  with entrepreneurs from Singapore and other countries.    Goh said that he was pleased to attend the ceremony here and  meet Premier Li Peng.    The signing of the agreement reflects the common aspirations  of the two sides and marks the new development of the bilateral  economic cooperation, Goh said.    Singapore hopes the park will yield concrete fruits soon  after its operation and that it is willing to make joint efforts  to this end with the Chinese side, Goh said.    Also in the afternoon, the two sides signed an agreement on  the adoption of Singapore's economic and public administration  experience in the development of the industrial park.    Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Singapore's Senior  Minister Lee attended the signing ceremony.    In the evening, a consolidated commercial agreement for the  industrial park was signed. Jiangsu Governor Chen Huanyou and  Senior Minister Lee were present at the occasion.</p>

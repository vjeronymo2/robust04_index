			<p><P> September 16, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ULTIMATE PANACEA? FOR EAST EUROPE IT'S BRUSSELS;  </P> <P> EUROPE: THE TROUBLED EASTERN BLOC COUNTRIES LOOK TO THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY AND  1992 TO REBUILD THEIR ECONOMIES AND BOLSTER THEIR DEMOCRACIES.  </P> <P> Will Europe manage it this time? Will World War II and the Cold War finally  lead to a Europe at peace with itself and the world? The new Europe has a new  flag, and it is everywhere in Brussels: 12 yellow stars on a field of deep blue  on public buildings, on license plates, on T shirts. The bustling office  buildings of this ancient city are filled with a new breed of Eurocrats:  officials putting together one after another of the directives that, by the end  of 1992, are expected to make one common market out of the European Community's  12 member nations.  </P> <P> Brussels hasn't always been this peaceful. Three centuries ago the armies of  Louis XIV blasted much of the city into rubble. Only 50 years ago Adolf  Hitler's Panzers smashed across the Belgian frontier, knocking out the defenses  within hours and beginning five years of occupation that older Belgians still  remember with bitterness.  </P> <P> That Germany, 50 years after the blitz, is on the march is only one of Europe's  fears and perhaps not the most alarming. Europe is trying to believe that the  Germans learned something in the 20th Century: to remain firmly committed to  the prosperous paths of peace rather than the costly and destructive process of  nationalist self assertion. That the EC exists at all today is a tribute to the  new German leaders who emerged after the war. Germany has long been the most  loyal and generous member of the European Community and its representatives  today are busy assuring its neighbors that, in Chancellor Helmut Kohl's words,  the new superstate wants "a European Germany, not a German Europe."  </P> <P> But Germany is the center of Europe, not its frontier, and from the lands  beyond come warnings of new storms ahead. Travelers returning from the East,  including officials of various Western governments as well as prominent private  citizens with great experience in Eastern Europe, speak of disintegration,  chaos and possibly war. The old institutions and authorities of the East have  broken down, but it is not clear whether they will be replaced by anything  better in the long run. The economic problems of the East, according to these  observers, are far deeper and more critical than the West yet understands. Some  expect to see real hunger in Poland, possibly next winter; experienced  observers not given to hyperbole speak openly of civil war in Yugoslavia  breaking out.  </P> <P> The full extent of Eastern Europe's problems are only beginning to appear. In  the first flush of revolutionary enthusiasm, these nations hoped that the  consequences of throwing off the communist yoke would be rapid economic  improvements and generous Western aid. Now disillusionment is setting in on  both fronts. The formerly communist societies of the East are not ready for  market economies. Reports from Western intelligence and financial institutions  speak of three to five years of recession and worse in the reforming economies,  followed by upturns in the mid-'90s.  </P> <P> Problems are serious and structural, and unlikely to fade away. Transportation  is a shambles; communication a disaster. Some Eastern countries are virtually  cut off from the outside with only a handful of phone lines. Factories have  outdated equipment and cannot be managed profitably in a capitalist economy.  </P> <P> The market successes in Eastern Europe have been small scale: Poland is one  vast flea market but bazaars don't make countries rich. If they did, Istanbul  would be the financial center of the world.  </P> <P> The rapidity with which farmers, restaurateurs and others have moved to take  advantage of new openings testifies to the entrepreneurial spirit of Eastern  Europe. But there is a long way between a flea market and a modern competitive  industrial and electronic economy. Almost nobody in the East knows how to  project a cash flow or depreciate an asset. No one knows how to market a brand,  float a stock issue or set a price in a competitive environment.  </P> <P> The aid from the West is falling short of expectations, and the Eastern  countries are proving unable to use much of what is offered. Perhaps misled by  Western anti-communist rhetoric, Eastern Europeans believed the proclamations  from places like Brussels and Washington about undying solidarity with those  trapped behind the Iron Curtain. It turns out solidarity came more from the  heart than the pocketbook. Increasing frustration characterizes the dealings of  East Europeans with their Western counterparts as request after request for  assistance goes unanswered.  </P> <P> Meanwhile Western donors are almost equally frustrated. The East is so  disorganized, its economy so chaotic and the pool of trained managers able to  function in a capitalist setting so small, that private and public aid agencies  are often unable to find viable projects to fund.  </P> <P> Generally speaking, the more people know about Eastern Europe today, the more  pessimistic they are. "Skepticism, pessimism, alienation." That is how one of  the West's most knowledgeable observers characterized the situation in  Bulgaria. "It's hard to project a country, much less a trend," said a Western  diplomat familiar with conditions in Yugoslavia.  </P> <P> Talks with experts from East and West elicit comments like this about every  country in the bloc. Chaos and fear in Romania; confusion and doubt in Hungary;  strife and urgency in Poland; the harsh realities of 1990 are sweeping aside  the promise of 1989.  </P> <P> The worst stories come out of the Soviet Union, where travelers returning from  districts off the beaten path tell of living conditions reminiscent of the  slums of Cairo and of political conditions like those of late Ceausescu  Romania. In parts of the Soviet Union, citizens tell foreigners that they  admire what the Romanians did to Ceausescu and his unpopular wife, and that  such measures might not be amiss in the Soviet Union. From czarism to  anarchism, the Soviet peoples are resurrecting old ideologies in the wake of  the communist collapse. It gets harder and harder to see how the country will  emerge from its current condition without shedding torrents of blood.  </P> <P> The uncertainty in the Soviet Union isn't just bad news for the Soviets. It is  almost impossible to imagine how Eastern Europe can prosper if the Soviet Union  sinks into anarchy. The Soviet Union is the most important trading partner for  all of Eastern Europe. Without its markets and its raw materials the outlook  for the former satellites would be even bleaker. Furthermore, Western investors  will be reluctant to commit large sums of money to Eastern Europe as long as  the Soviet picture is unclear.  </P> <P> There is one subject, though, that Soviets and Eastern Europeans remain  optimistic about: Brussels. Membership in the European Community is the way to  solve their problems. Brussels will rebuild economies and safeguard  democracies.  </P> <P> This is a lot of faith to put in Belgian-based bureaucrats who spend most of  their time doing things like standardizing sugar beet quotas, but Eastern  Europeans have always been noted for faith. In Brussels, meanwhile, the  bureaucrats go on fine tuning the mechanisms of economic cooperation, but the  road to European union is rocky and long. Nobody knows when or if the  star-spangled banner of Brussels will stand for something more than a pious  wish or how many stars it will ultimately have. But to think that Western  Europe can enjoy peace and prosperity while the Eastern half of the Continent  writhes in agony and misery is to open the door to new dictators and new  threats -- "Hitlersky," as one, only half facetious diplomat put it, more  dangerous and more violent than anything Europe has faced in its long and  bloody history.  </P></p>

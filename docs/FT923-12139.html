			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / International Company News: Vereinsbank in Austrian deal BAYERISCHE Vereinsbank, the big Bavarian bank, has acquired Schoeller &amp; Co. Bank, one of Austria's oldest private banks, for an undisclosed amount. Vereinsbank has bought 90 per cent of Schoeller's shares from Raiffeisen Zentralbank (RZB), the clearing house of Austria's co-operative banks, and has made an offer to the Schoeller family to purchase the 7 per cent holding still owned by the descendants of the founder. The acquisition makes Munich-based Vereinsbank the first foreign bank with a branch network in Austria. Schoeller, one of the best-known names in Austrian banking, operates 12 branches. It specialises in private banking for high net-worth individuals, securities trading and corporate finance. Schoeller has recently suffered financial setbacks because of falling stock prices and bad foreign loans and was forced to halve its 1992 dividend to 5 per cent. At the end of 1991 it had assets of Sch21bn (Dollars 2.03bn). RZB has also seen its profits fall sharply in recent years because of the rise in short-term rates, which boosted its refinancing costs. The Schoeller sale is seen by analysts as a first step toward a retrenchment by RZB.</p>

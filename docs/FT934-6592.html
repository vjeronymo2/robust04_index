			<p>931124 FT  24 NOV 93 / Letters to the Editor: VAT on all food a harmful move Sir, Michael Poyner (Letters, November 19) argues that all food should be subject to value added tax. He says that 'to suggest that this would harm the less well-off is unproven'. There is already abundant evidence that, even without VAT on most foods, some families simply cannot afford a healthy diet. For instance, there are the 1990 study by the Family Welfare Association and the 1991 and later surveys by the National Children's Home. The findings of these studies are reinforced by data from the 1990 Dietary and Nutritional Study of British Adults and the 1991 Household Consumption and Expenditure survey, which spell out the sharp differences between the diets of the better off and those on low incomes. The NCH survey shows that it is primarily lack of money, not ignorance, that accounts for lower spending by poor households on fresh fruit and vegetables. Low income can also make it impossible for people who live well away from big supermarkets, hypermarkets and discount stores, and who don't own a car, to afford frequent fares in order to benefit from lower prices often available at these shops. Poor diet, of course, puts health at risk and will make it harder for the targets set in the government's Health of the Nation paper to be met. If VAT were to be added to all foods, the plight of the poorest families would be worsened at a stroke, unless state benefits were raised to compensate. There could also be an outcry from other consumers if their food bills suddenly rose by 7 per cent to cover VAT - particularly if the argument used to justify this is that it will bring the UK in line with the rest of the EU. It seems highly premature to do this before reforms are completed to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy, which currently costs the average household of four almost Pounds 20 a week extra - the combined cost of food bills kept artificially high by this policy, and extra taxes which go to pay for storing the surpluses produced and then to subsidise their disposal.

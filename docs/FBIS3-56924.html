Yegorov is blamed for arbitrary actions by his subordinates  during the recent arrest in Minsk of the former Lithuanian  communist party leaders Mykolas Burokevicius and Juozas  Jermalavicius. Police arrested the two men without a sanction  from the Prosecutor General.    Shirkovskiy is accused of office abuse. The commission  believes that as the KGB chief he had to control the situation.    A group of lawmakers also demanded that the Prosecutor  General Vasiliy Sholodonov step down.    Meanwhile, as has transpired from a dependable source, the  Lithuanian side intends to formally press for the extradition of  General Vladimir Uskhopchik, the former Vilnius garrison chief  during the events in Lithuania's capital in January of 1991.    Uskhopchik now commands a unit of the 5th Belarussian army  corps, headquartered at Bobruisk.</p>

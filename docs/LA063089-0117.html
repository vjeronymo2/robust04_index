			<p><P> June 30, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRONGFUL FIRING LAW IS UPHELD  </P> <P> A Montana law limiting the damages people may collect when wrongfully fired  does not deprive employees of their rights under the state constitution, a  divided Montana Supreme Court ruled Thursday in upholding the law.  </P> <P> A dissenting justice, however, said the decision clears the way for a  legislative onslaught against plaintiffs' rights in lawsuits, adding, "It may  be the blackest judicial day in the history of this state."  </P> <P> The court's 4-3 decision may have national implications because other states  are considering "wrongful discharge" statutes similar to Montana's, said Joel  P. Kelly, a Los Angeles lawyer who represented a company that was sued in the  Montana case.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Juan Carlos Ruiz and Leonel Gutierrez] </F>   [Text] President Ramiro de Leon Carpio threatened truck  drivers yesterday and said that he would intervene "if they  continue with their blackmailing practices."    Interviewed following the Honor Guard anniversary  celebrations, de Leon said that "the members of the  transportation sector agreed not to adopt illegal positions but  they failed to keep their word, which shows irresponsibility."  The president said that "fortunately" all gasoline stations are  working normally and that his government is not willing to  accept these types of pressures. He even went on to say that if  it became necessary he would take legal measures and "if it were  required he would resort to intervention because the  Constitution gives him the authority. Therefore, they should  accept the consequences."    He noted that the Constitution states that when public  services are adversely affected the government may intervene, so  the people can rest assured they will have fuel without any  inconvenience. "That is what they are trying to provoke. They  are trying to blackmail the government by taking advantage of  the referendum situation."    Ramiro de Leon, however, said that once the referendum  process is over, the president will act firmly on behalf of all  people and "not on behalf of a small group of irresponsible  people." He added that of all the demands made by the  transportation sector some have already been resolved and the  rest are in the process of being resolved. That is why the  strike announcement by transportation sector members to frighten  the population is illegal, inappropriate, and shows their  irresponsibility.    De Leon said the intercity and international freight  transportation bills have already been drafted. As for other  types of transportation bills, legal rulings have determined  that they are unconstitutional, which have prevented them from  passing.    As for cement price changes, he pointed out that the  Communications Ministry has already drafted an agreement to deal  with this request, which means it is being resolved. As for a  4-percent tax retention by the internal revenue office, it was  determined that it is applicable to all persons who provide any  kind of service and do not hand out authorized receipts. That  is why the transportation sector must pay this tax.    Finally, de Leon Carpio said that as for transportation  fares, members of the transportation sector were invited to meet  with the economic cabinet on 2 February, as is government  policy, in order to find a viable solution to the problem.  <H5>  Transportation Sector: Decision To Strike Remains Firm </H5>   Meanwhile, Miguel Angel Luna Gamboa, president of the  National Transportation Coordinating Board [CNT], said he was  surprised to hear the president's statements and reiterated that  the entire land transportation sector is determined to go ahead  with the strike. He added that the movement they are promoting  is not politically oriented. Proof of this is that during the  electoral event they will work nonstop. That is why "the  president's statements are unfair."    What happened, he said, is that the president is trying to  mix economic and political problems, but the CNT reiterates that  its demands are administrative in nature. "If the problem is  not resolved it is because there is no presidential,  ministerial, or political willingness to solve it," Luna Gamboa  said.</p>

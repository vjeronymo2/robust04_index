			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Private Mortgage Insurance Industry Experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A trade association representing the private mortgage insurance industry opposed increasing the threshold level to $250,000, citing substantial losses on loans under $100,000. However, it also noted that for loans originated in 1984, loans above $250,000 had a relative claim rate more than 50 percent higher than the claim rate for loans originated under $100,000. Information provided by this commenter also showed that the relative claim rates on loans below $100,000 and loans between $100,000 and $250,000 were close for most years, while the relative claim rate for loans above $250,000 exceeded the claim rates for loans below $250,000 in all years except one. The commenter did not provide actual claim rates nor dollar amounts of claims. Nor did the commenter disclose the average loan-to-value ratios for those mortgages, a factor that could affect the loss experience.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the trade association stated its belief that a significant amount of the claims experienced by its members were related to inadequate appraisals, bank and thrift commenters stated that losses on foreclosed properties were more directly related to deterioration in the local real estate market, damage to the property, or actions or inaction by the borrower.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Application of $100,000 Threshold to Certain Troubled Institutions.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in more detail below, the agencies are adopting substantially as proposed a separate amendment stating that each agency continues to reserve the right to require a regulated institution to obtain a Title XI appraisal whenever the agency believes that an appraisal is necessary to address safety and soundness concerns. This authority may involve the agency requiring an institution to obtain an appraisal for a particular extension of credit or an entire group of credits.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Whether an institution will be required, pursuant to this provision or existing safety and soundness authority, to obtain an individual appraisal or group of appraisals may depend on the condition of that institution. If an institution's troubled condition is attributable to real estate loan underwriting problems, then the appropriate agency may require appraisals for all new real estate-related transactions of more than $100,000 that are not subject to an exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since thrift industry assets are concentrated in real estate loans, OTS believes that problem thrifts or thrifts in troubled condition <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  generally will have real estate-related asset quality problems. As a matter of policy, OTS intends to require thrifts in troubled condition to adhere to a $100,000 threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> A ``problem'' association is defined as an association that: (1) Has a composite MACRO rating of 4 or 5; (2) is undercapitalized under prompt corrective action standards; (3) is subject to a capital directive or a cease and desist order, a consent order, or a formal written agreement, relating to the safety and soundness or financial viability of the savings association, unless otherwise informed in writing by the OTS; or (4) has been notified in writing by the OTS that is has been designated a problem association or an association in troubled condition. (See Regulatory Bulletin 27a, Executive Compensation.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Reassessment of Threshold. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Finally, just as the agencies have reviewed their experience with the $100,000 threshold in determining whether a higher (or lower) threshold was appropriate, so too will the agencies review their experience with the $250,000 threshold. If the agencies should determine that the increased threshold is causing safety and soundness problems, then the agencies will reassess that threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The Chechen president has again spoken of the  Russian threat. Dzhokhar Dudayev has stated that the Russian  special services are drawing up a plan to organize an  underground nuclear explosion on the republic's territory.  Speaking on Groznyy television, Dudayev claimed that the  special services may well implement this plan since their  previously prepared attempt to physically remove the Chechen  president ended in failure. During his appearance on television  Dudayev expressed the opinion that if this plan for a localized  nuclear explosion in Chechnya is carried out then the Russian  special services will blame the republic's leadership for it,  basing their statements on previously disseminated  disinformation that Chechnya supposedly has components for  nuclear weapons. The Russian foreign intelligence service has  already categorically denied Dudayev's claims.    Incidentally, President Dudayev issued a decree today  introducing a curfew throughout the territory of the republic  from 2200 local time.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In response to these comments, the revised proposal would clarify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which institutions would be considered wholesale or limited purpose institutions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for purposes of CRA. The definition for institutions eligible for wholesale or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limited purpose designation would be as follows: (1) wholesale institutions are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that are not in the business of extending home mortgage, small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> business, small farm, or consumer loans to retail customers; and (2) limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose institutions are institutions that offer only a narrow product line (such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> as credit cards or automobile loans) to a national or regional market. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would not be considered in the business of extending loans to retail  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> customers if it does not hold itself out to the retail public as providing such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loans and the institution's revenues from extending such loans are insignificant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when compared to its overall lending operations. An institution could conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> some incidental retail lending if the retail activity would not cause the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to exceed these limitations. However, a so-called ``niche institution''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (an institution that is in the business of lending to the public but which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specializes in certain types of retail loans or extending credit to a class of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> borrowers with, for example, certain financial or professional characteristics)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not generally qualify as a wholesale or limited purpose institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The revised proposal also would require an institution that elects to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be evaluated as a wholesale or limited purpose institution to file a written  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> request with the appropriate agency and receive confirmation of its status before  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commencement of the examination. The agencies will issue guidelines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regarding how long in advance of a scheduled examination an institution must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> file its request, and under what circumstances an institution will have to reapply  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to retain wholesale or limited purpose status. An institution whose request for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wholesale or limited purpose status has been denied by the appropriate agency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be evaluated under the tests applicable to retail institutions, small  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions, or an institution with approved strategic plans, as appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The OTS did not include provisions for wholesale or limited  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purpose thrifts in its version of the December proposal. In response to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments, the OTS's revised proposal includes provisions that would allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> thrifts the opportunity to request designation as a wholesale or limited purpose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Small Institution Assessment Option  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The December proposal would have offered small banks and thrifts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the option of choosing to be evaluated under a streamlined assessment method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The regulations would not have imposed upon small institutions the data  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collection requirements imposed on other institutions. The agencies stressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the preamble to the December proposal that, notwithstanding the different  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment methods, examinations of small banks and thrifts would have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meaningful examinations and would not have been implemented as de facto  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemptions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Small banks and thrifts were defined in the December proposal as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent institutions with assets of less than $250 million or members of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> holding companies the total banking and thrift assets of which are less than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $250 million. A small institution's CRA rating under the December proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would have been based primarily on its lending record. An institution would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been presumed to receive a ``satisfactory'' rating if it had a reasonable  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan-to-deposit ratio, made the majority of its loans locally, had a good loan  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mix (i.e., made a variety of loans to the extent permitted by law and regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and lent across economic levels), had no legitimate, bona-fide complaints from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community members, had not committed an isolated act of illegal discrimination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of which it had knowledge that it had not corrected fully or was not in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> process of correcting fully, and had not engaged in a pattern or practice of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illegal discrimination that it had not corrected fully. If an institution was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to report loans under the HMDA, the institution also would have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to have a reasonable geographic distribution of reported loans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

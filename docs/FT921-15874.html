			<p>920108 FT  08 JAN 92 / Setback for Belgian unity hopes A POLITICAL crisis which has left Belgium without effective government since elections last November has taken a fresh turn that could make it even harder to build a new coalition, Reuter reports from Brussels. Mr Guy Spitaels, president of the French-speaking Socialists, has agreed to become president of Wallonia, the French-speaking southern half of Belgium, effectively withdrawing from any role in assembling a new national government. Mr Spitaels' power base is in Wallonia and he is widely disliked in Dutch-speaking Flanders. The move is likely to exacerbate tensions between Belgium's two main regions, which argue constantly about budgets and other issues. The two regional governments are of key importance as they have wide-ranging powers under a programme of devolution pushed through in recent years. The Dutch-language daily newspaper De Standaard said in an editorial yesterday: 'The chances of building a stable national government are small.' The previous coalition of Christian Democrats and Socialists, which collapsed in October, has stayed on as a caretaker government. Prime Minister Wilfried Martens is Europe's longest serving premier but his political future is uncertain as his Flemish Christian Democrats (CVP) suffered a setback in the November poll.</p>

			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / The Lex Column: Lloyd's funds The funds now being set up to invest in the Lloyd's insurance market are a diverse bunch. The most obvious difference between them lies in investment strategy, since shareholders' funds can be invested in liquid securities as well as pledged to back insurance policies. CLM, launched by BZW and Sedgwick, will buy UK equities. Warburg's proposed vehicle favours bonds, while Noble's plans an international spread of assets. But while investment strategy will have some impact on performance, the choice of underwriting syndicates will make or break each fund. Backing a bad syndicate carries a far higher penalty than buying shares in a company which fails, since insurance claims can turn out to be far higher than the syndicate's paid-up capital. Investing in Lloyd's through a limited-liability fund should protect investors from the ruinous losses suffered by Names. But funds which back loss-making syndicates will see their assets quickly eroded. Spreading investment across a range of syndicates offers scant protection against the size of individual losses which can occur in reinsurance. The quality of research employed by the fund will thus be critical to success. For an outsider that is extremely difficult to judge. The track record of the insurance adviser to each fund - ranging from established Lloyd's agents to US reinsurance companies - might offer some comfort. But the suspicion remains that the Lloyd's funds on offer this autumn will be almost as opaque as the insurance market itself.</p>

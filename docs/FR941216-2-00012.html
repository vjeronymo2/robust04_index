The estimated margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation'' section of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Case History  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the initiation of this investigation on June 20, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (59 FR 32953, June 27, 1994), the following events have occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 15, 1994, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) issued an affirmative preliminary injury determination in this case ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  59 FR 38201, July 27, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On July 19, 1994, officials of the Department of Commerce (the Department) visited the petitioner's facilities to observe the furfuryl alcohol production process for purposes of developing the questionnaire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 3, 1994, the Department issued an antidumping questionnaire to Illovo Sugar Limited (ISL), which accounted for at least 60 percent of the exports of the subject merchandise to the United States during the period of investigation (POI). In August 1994, officials from the Department presented this questionnaire to ISL in South Africa.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On August 29, 1994, ISL submitted its response to Section A of our questionnaire. On September 21, 1994, ISL submitted its response to Sections B and C of our questionnaire. A supplemental questionnaire was issued on October 19, 1994. On November 7, 1994, ISL submitted its response to this supplemental questionnaire. QO Chemicals, Inc. (the petitioner) submitted comments regarding deficiencies in the ISL's questionnaire responses in September, October and November 1994. ISL submitted comments regarding the petitioner's submissions in September and November 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 7, 1994, the petitioner requested that the preliminary determination be postponed until December 9, 1994. We have done so in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c) (1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Cost of Production Allegation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On October 25, 1994, the petitioner filed an allegation that ISL's home market sales of furfuryl alcohol during the POI were sold at less than the cost of production (COP). On November 9, 1994, we issued a deficiency letter regarding the allegation. The petitioner filed supplements to its COP allegation in October, November and December 1994. During November and December 1994, ISL filed numerous submissions regarding the petitioner's COP allegation. Based on our analysis of this allegation, we have determined that a COP investigation is warranted. We will determine whether ISL had made sales below COP for the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Postponement of Final Determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to section 735(a)(2)(A) of the Act, ISL requested on December 2, 1994, that, in the event of an affirmative preliminary determination in this investigation, the Department postpone the final determination until no later than 135 days after the date of publication of an affirmative preliminary determination in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.20(b), because our preliminary determination is affirmative, and no compelling reasons for denial exist, we have done so.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Scope of the Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The product covered by this investigation is furfuryl alcohol (C <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> H <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OCH <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=2 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OH). Furfuryl alcohol is a primary alcohol, and is colorless or pale yellow in appearance. It is used in the manufacture of resins and as a wetting agent and solvent for coating resins, nitrocellulose, cellulose acetate, and other soluble dyes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The product subject to this investigation is classifiable under subheading 2932.13.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and Customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Period of Investigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The period of investigation (POI) is December 1, 1993, through May 31, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Such or Similar Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We have determined that the products covered by this investigation constitute a single category of such or similar merchandise. ISL reported that it sold merchandise in the home market identical to that sold in the United States. Accordingly, no difference in merchandise information was reported in ISL's sales listings. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.58, we made comparisons at the same level of trade, where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Fair Value Comparisons  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To determine whether sales by ISL of furfuryl alcohol to the United States were made at less than fair value, we compared the United States price (USP) to the foreign market value (FMV), as specified in the ``United States Price'' and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> United States Price  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For the purpose of this preliminary determination, we have found that ISL and its exclusive selling agent, Harborchem, are related parties pursuant to Section 771(13) of the Act ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  concurrence memorandum, dated December 7, 1994, on file in Room B&hyph;099 of the Main Commerce Department building), and that all of ISL's U.S. sales to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importation into the United States. Therefore, we based USP on exporter's sales prices, in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act. The claimed relationship between ISL and Harborchem is based on one of agency. We will, however, reexamine the issue of agency for the purpose of the final determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We calculated ISL's exporter's sales price sales based on FOB U.S. storage or delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductions, where appropriate, for the following movement charges in accordance with section 772(e) of the Act: foreign loading on ship, foreign inland freight, ocean freight, marine insurance, tank car rental, U.S inland freight, U.S. inland insurance, U.S. brokerage and handling, and U.S. duty. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for credit expenses, indirect selling expenses incurred in South Africa, and indirect selling expenses incurred in the United States, including quality control testing, inventory carrying expenses, warehousing expenses, and U.S. storage insurance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We did not make one of the adjustments for freight claimed by Harborchem because there is not adequate information on the record to support this adjustment. Further, we did not make an adjustment to the margin for export incentive payments received by ISL from the Government of the Republic of South Africa through the Government's General Export Incentive Scheme because there is no on-going companion countervailing duty investigation and no such duties are currently being collected ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> see <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  concurrence memorandum, dated December 7, 1994).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FURTHER> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

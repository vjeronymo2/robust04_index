			<p><P> September 23, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> 5 LEGISLATORS AND LOBBYIST CHARGED IN S.C. SCANDAL  </P> <P> Five more representatives and a lobbyist were charged Friday in South  Carolina's growing statehouse scandal.  </P> <P> Reps. Thomas Limehouse, Ennis Fant, Larry Blanding, B. J. Gordon and Donna A.  Moss were named in a federal indictment growing from the FBI sting into the  state Legislature.  </P> <P> Limehouse, the only Republican in the group, was charged in a three-count  indictment of two violations of the Hobbs Act, the federal anti-bribery law,  for allegedly accepting $2,000, conspiracy to accept cash and an additional  obstruction of justice charge.  </P> <P> Fant, Blanding and Gordon were charged together in one count of conspiracy to  violate the Hobbs Act, and each was charged separately with accepting bribes.  </P> <P> Moss was charged with possession of cocaine during the 1989 legislative  session.  </P> <P> Also charged was lobbyist James Madison Brown V, on one count of possession of  marijuana in September, 1989.  </P> <P> The indictments have come as the result of an FBI sting, nicknamed "Operation  Lost Trust," which probed vote-buying in the General Assembly. Of five other  legislators charged last month, three have pleaded guilty and another is  expected to plead guilty this week.  </P> <P> The Hobbs Act carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a $250,000  fine.  </P></p>

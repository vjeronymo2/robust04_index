			<p>941004 FT  04 OCT 94 / Markets hit by interest rate fears Financial markets fell again in the US and Europe yesterday amid growing pessimism over the direction of US and UK interest rates. US Treasury bond prices retreated on the release of data suggesting that the economy was still growing in spite of five interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve since February. A rise in the September index of the National Association of Purchasing Managers was accompanied with news that the prices component of the survey had reached a six-year high. The figures reinforced suspicions that the Federal Reserve would soon raise interest rates again to combat inflation. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down half a point in late trading, with the yield rising to 7.85 per cent. In London, the FT-SE 100 index fell 42.8 points to 2,983.5.

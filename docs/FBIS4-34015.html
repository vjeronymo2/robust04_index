			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Colombian Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin by </F> Guillermo Rodriguez in Cartagena de Indias on 14 June; from the  "Caracol's 0600 to 0900" newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Rodriguez] Good morning, Minister Sanin.  Congratulations on the summit's organization. What will happen  with this summit in Cartagena de Indias?    [Sanin] Good morning. We will continue declaring an all-out  war on poverty. We are working so that the integration, trade,  and all our social policies improve living conditions for most  Colombians.    [Rodriguez] [Words indistinct] in the last issue of the  CAMBIO 16 publication, there is a report by Isaac (Deacon) on  you, Minister Sanin. It is virtually being assumed that after 7  August, you will decide your future, and may decide to form your  own political movement. Is there any truth to this?    [Sanin] I have been so busy with preparing the summit, among  other international commitments. After 7 August, I will decide  what I will do.    [Rodriguez] But you do not reject the possibility of  becoming  fully involved in politics?    [Sanin] Why impose conditions on our lives? I will be  wherever I can serve Colombia best.    [Rodriguez] Following a brief diplomatic career, a one-year  sabbatical....    [Sanin] I truly cannot tell you what I will do yet. However,  I obviously must rest a little.    [Rodriguez] We have heard that most heads of state are  constantly encouraging you to become fully involved in politics.  Will you heed their advice?    [Sanin] I must think about it, but I reiterate: after 7  August.    [Rodriguez] What is the leading aspect of this summit?    [Sanin] The meeting of the 21 heads of state per se is a  very  significant event. Their commitment to promulgate social  policies so that all these economic initiatives provide an  answer to the everyday needs of the people is also crucial.  This is so because any trade and integration efforts obviously  lead to boosting economic growth, increasing jobs, greater  opportunities for consumers regarding product prices and  quality. However, the leading aspect is that we are waging a  war on poverty.    [Rodriguez] How have other Latin American nations received  the integration and free trade agreement signed by the  presidents of Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela?    [Sanin] They have received the signing of this agreement  with  enthusiasm and respect because it opens many opportunities for  all -- more jobs and brighter economic prospects. The existence  of equality and making sure that this process begins yielding  results for Colombians are pivotal for us. This process will  not generate immediate results, but those results will come.    [Rodriguez] A constructive criticism that is raised with  regard to summits is that they usually do not go beyond  well-intentioned declarations because an organization or an  executive body to implement them is missing. Could the Latin  American Community of Nations become that body? What is your  view in this regard?    [Sanin] [Words indistinct] of the Ibero-American community.  Yesterday, I submitted a proposal to the foreign ministers on  creating a follow-up mechanism for all cooperation plans and  political agreements advanced by the presidents and heads of  state. We will meet on 6 August, the eve of the inauguration of  the incoming Colombian president, to determine the nature of  this mechanism and the follow-up instruments for all education  and health plans and the various agreements achieved during this  summit. However, all the political agreements and all the  prospects resulting from this summit in themselves are very  important. This forum possibly gathers the largest number of  heads of state.    [Rodriguez] President Gaviria will inaugurate the summit at  0900. How long will his speech last?    [Sanin] I cannot squeal on [chivear] the president because I  would be risking my job. Let us wait to hear it.    [Rodriguez] Speaking about the president, in that magazine  report, you called yourself a Gavirist conservative. What does  that mean?    [Sanin] It means that I am committed to this phase of  changes, these radical changes, this new country Colombians have  built under President Gaviria's lead.    [Rodriguez] Does it mean isolation from other factions of  the  Conservative Party?    [Sanin] No. What is currently happening is that politics is  being viewed from a new perspective and a new situation. There  is a different attitude and a different manner of conducting it.  Beyond being only a conservative or a liberal, I truly admire  and have a total commitment to how President Gaviria conducts  politics.    [Rodriguez] Carlos Murcia in yesterday's issue of EL  ESPECTADOR as well as CAMBIO 16, SEMANA, and CROMOS have  suggested that you have a place in either Samper's or Pastrana's  cabinet. Would you accept an offer from either Samper or  Pastrana?    [Sanin] Neither CROMOS nor SEMANA nor any of the best media  you mentioned are entitled to make nominations. Therefore, let  us take one step at a time, and let us see what happens.</p>

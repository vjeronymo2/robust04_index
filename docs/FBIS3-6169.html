"It is a clear violation of the  truce," said Gov. Nestor Gumana of Sultan Kudarat who disclosed  that 826 new cadres of the MNLF finished their guerrilla  training at the foothills of the Daguma Range last 10 January.    Moro rebels led by Kamsa Itom, alias "Commander Ronnie,"  were  planning to hold this month another training for rebel recruits  in the mountain sitio [district of a village] of Baton, barangay  [village] Lagandang, Isulan, a Muslim-dominated village, Gumana  said.    The apparent infraction of the peace record, Gumana also  said, prompted the Peace and Order Council of Sultan Kudarat to  file a protest with government panel chief negotiator Manuel  Yan. "It's up to General Yan to act on our protest but certainly  we believed that ongoing training and recruitment indicated bad  faith," he added. "This could heighten tension as it is sending  the wrong signal to Christian constituents."    Gumana's report came in the wake of information that some  Christian groups believed connected with the Ilaga, an  underground movement opposed to Muslim domination, have been  courting police authorities at the PNP Recom [Philippine  National Police Regional Command] 12 headquarters to allow them  to conduct raids on known rebel lairs in the province.    "I told them to hold their line since the police and the  military can contain lawlessness," Sr. Supt. [Senior  Superintendent] Jovencio Sales, PNP Recom 12 chief, said, adding  that several Christian leaders have signified their willingness  to fight the rebels in retaliation of the recent ambush-slaying  of a busload of passengers in Tulunan, Maguindanao and the  bombing of the Catholic cathedral in Davao City. Police sources  said that Christians in Central Mindanao, fearing that the  collapse of the peace talks between the government and the MNLF  could spark hostilities, have been rearming themselves  discreetly.</p>

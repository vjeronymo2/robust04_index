			<p><P> August 10, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL SPIRIT;  </P> <P> SAN PEDRO HIGH GRADS GATHER TO HONOR THE EXTRAORDINARY FRIEND THEY LAST SAW 50  YEARS AGO  </P> <P> The last time some of Mary Nakahara Kochiyama's friends saw her, nylon  stockings were new on the market, "Over the Rainbow" was a popular hit and  Germany was about to invade Poland.  </P> <P> It was 1939, and Kochiyama and 300 classmates were graduating from San Pedro  High School. Soon, many classmates would risk and lose their lives in World War  II. Kochiyama and thousands of other Japanese-Americans would be uprooted from  their homes and confined to relocation camps.  </P> <P> The sorrows and resentments of the war years could easily have destroyed young  friendships among Kochiyama and her classmates, but the ties have stood the  test of time.  </P> <P> Fifty years after the class of '39 finished high school, more than 200 San  Pedro High "Pirates" from the 1930s and 1940s showed up last weekend for a  nostalgic homecoming in Kochiyama's honor.  </P> <P> Why is this woman so well-remembered after so many years?  </P> <P> "I've thought about that many times," said Sam Domancich, who helped plan the  homecoming celebration.  </P> <P> One of the reasons so many people turned out -- the luncheon had to be moved to  a larger restaurant to accommodate the crowd -- is that San Pedro is such a  close-knit community, Domancich said. San Pedro was victory and the thrill of  defeat."  </P> <P> Indeed, during tribute speeches, Kochiyama was not at the head table but  crouched in the audience, taking pictures of the speakers. Ben Tagami,  president of the Japanese-American veterans of the celebrated 100th Infantry  Battalion and the 442nd ("Go for Broke") Regiment, offered her a scrapbook from  the war era, but Kochiyama suggested it be given instead to her husband, a  442nd veteran.  </P> <P> Kochiyama has become a legend in San Pedro because of her friendliness and  school spirit, friends said.  </P> <P> A sports enthusiast, she covered games for the school newspaper and phoned in  results to the San Pedro News-Pilot.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pedaled to Games  </P> <P> Retired teacher and tennis coach Nick Zorotovich, himself a 1923 graduate of  San Pedro High, told his favorite story about how Kochiyama used to travel to  all the games on a bicycle trimmed in the school colors, black and gold. Once,  when the school bus was en route to a tennis tournament in far-off Santa  Monica, players spotted the young cub reporter pedaling her way through  Inglewood and stopped to pick her up, he said.  </P> <P> "San Pedro was a very sports-minded town, and this united all the  nationalities," Kochiyama said. "Everyone accepted the differences and saw the  diversity as a plus."  </P> <P> Kochiyama also is beloved for her efforts to boost morale among the  Japanese-Americans who were confined to relocation camps during World War II  and for Nisei soldiers who fought for America.  </P> <P> "The government calls them relocation camps, but we called them concentration  camps," Kochiyama said in an interview. Still, she said, "I grew up in a mostly  white world, and I never got to know my own people till we were sent to camp."  </P> <P> Kochiyama and her family first were sent to the Santa Anita Assembly Center and  then to Jerome, Ark.  </P> <P> In the camps, Kochiyama helped establish a youth organization called the  Crusaders that conducted a letter-writing campaign for soldiers of Japanese  ancestry who were fighting in the U.S. forces. "We started out with just five  names, but by the time the camps closed, 2 1/2 or 3 years later, we were  writing to 13,000," she said.  </P> <P> Kochiyama said she and others spent their $8-a-month camp pay on postage and  received contributions from soldiers themselves, who collected money in their  helmets on the battlefield. San Pedro soldiers were steadfast in supporting the  letter-writing effort, she said.  </P> <P> In poignant letters she wrote to her mother during the final months of the war,  Kochiyama talked of her struggle to run USO Centers in Hattiesburg, Miss., and  later in Minneapolis/St. Paul, after she was released from the camp in  Arkansas.  </P> <P> In the yellowed letters, which the family has collected in a well-worn black  notebook, Kochiyama asks for her mother's recipes and speaks of spending her  own money to keep the letters and post cards going out to servicemen.  </P> <P> In one letter, dated April 18, 1945, she told her mother she planned to live at  the USO in Hattiesburg. "Then, the rent money can be used for stamps," she  said.  </P> <P> The letters to her mother also presage her later involvement in the civil  rights movement in the 1960s, when she moved to Harlem and became more militant  in her views.  </P> <P> Kochiyama said she became a follower of Malcolm X and was with him when he was  assassinated in 1965. One of her most prized mementos is a Life magazine cover  photo showing her kneeling over the slain black leader's body, she said. The  struggles of blacks to achieve equal rights "influenced all minority rights  struggles," and helped spawn the Asian-American movement in the late 1960s, she  said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Civil Rights Activities  </P> <P> Today, Kochiyama is a member of the New African People's Organization, an  outgrowth of the black power movement. She also has been active in New  York-based Concerned Japanese-Americans and the National Coalition for  Redress/Reparations, groups that are seeking compensation for  Japanese-Americans interned during World War II.  </P> <P> Her life's work is hinted at in a letter she wrote to her mother on Aug. 15,  1945, three days after Japan surrendered. First, she muses about the  differences in the characters of the Japanese and American people that led to  the conflict.  </P> <P>  Yes, Japan has been defeated.... Strange, isn't it, that one country's  greatness could be another country's doom. America's greatest gift to her  people was freedom. And her people love it.  </P> <P>  Japan's greatest gift to her people was an orthodox way of life. And her  people love it. ...  </P> <P>  There is so much we human beings can't understand. I guess because we only  live once. If we lived, died and were reincarnated, and lived again after every  death -- living each time under a different color of skin and experiencing the  hardship of every race, maybe we wouldn't be so harsh and critical and selfish  and limited. We would be humble and loving and kind and 'broad' because we  would understand what it feels like to be black, yellow, brown and white.  </P> <P>  Wishful thinking, isn't it?  </P> <P> As Kochiyama accepted the tributes and applause of her high school friends last  weekend, it appeared that some of the hopes she expressed in the letter to her  mother may have been realized.  </P> <P> "Despite the war, hysteria, and the uprootment of Japanese-Americans,  friendships have continued," she said. "Fifty years have passed by without some  of us seeing one another, yet on the strength of happy memories, warm  relationships have remained intact."  </P></p>

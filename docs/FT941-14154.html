			<p>940121 FT  21 JAN 94 / Banesto details restructuring Banco Espanol de Credito (Banesto), the troubled Spanish bank, yesterday said that the funding needed to restore its balance sheet would be about a third more than the amount estimated by the Bank of Spain three weeks ago. The bank, which put the overvaluation of its assets at Pta675bn (Pounds 3bn) compared with the central bank's figure of Pta503bn, also disclosed details of a restructuring plan that would require substantial assistance from other banks. The plan, to be presented to the chairmen of the top five domestic banks and the Bank of Spain next week, involves the other banks directly and indirectly providing up to Pta350bn of financial support to restructure Banesto. It would transfer all of its Pta245bn reserves into provisions, and absorb a further Pta24bn of equity in provisions. This would reduce the nominal value of individual shares from Pta700 to Pta500. The plan also includes the acquisition of up to Pta200bn of its non-performing loans by the Deposit Guarantee Fund, which is funded by banks, and a Pta120-150bn capital increase, underwritten by a number of banks. Some Pta66bn which the Bank of Spain has estimated as the shortfall in Banesto's pension fund would be written down. This was the intention of an earlier plan proposed by Banesto's adviser, the US bank JP Morgan. The plan no longer includes a Dollars 400m convertible bond issue that JP Morgan had intended as the final plank of a previous capital raising exercise. Banesto's plan, which is weighted towards reassuring its shareholders, is likely to be backed by the authorities who are concerned that a more aggressive cut in the nominal share price would have a negative impact on the markets. Other banks are likely to contest the plan on the grounds that they will be over-penalised for Banesto's mismanagement. Some banks believe Banesto may be taking a deliberately pessimistic view of its assets. Banesto's new management wants to keep the bank as an independent institution. The main banks, Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Central Hispano (BCH), Argentaria, Santander and Popular, are thought to be more more interested in dismembering Banesto or in having one of their number take it over.</p>

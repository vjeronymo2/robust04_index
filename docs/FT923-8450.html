			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / US raid on Iraq 'was set for August 6' THE US called off a bombing raid on Iraq scheduled for August 6 after pressure from the United Nations, the Washington-based magazine Aviation Week and Space Technology reported yesterday. As a UN inspection team spent its second day hunting for Iraq's military secrets yesterday, the magazine quoted a 'senior Joint Chiefs of Staff official' as saying that F-117 stealth bombers, Tomahawk cruise missiles and B-52 bombers armed with air-launched missiles were to have been used against Iraq last week. The raid was cancelled because of opposition from the UN and concerns that a confrontation last month, when a UN team attempted to inspect a Ministry of Agriculture building in Baghdad, was not serious enough to warrant a military strike. It was the second cancellation this year, the official said. The previous planned raid, in March, was aimed at destroying Iraqi missile manufacturing plants. The Bush administration had ordered the air force to be ready to strike quickly if Iraq resisted the next important inspection, the official added. Such attacks would target Iraqi units and equipment near Kurdish positions in the north of the country and Shia positions in the south. They would concentrate on destroying aircraft and helicopters, some of which were used against rebel Shia positions late last month, according to western defence sources. Other targets would include radar installations and factories for tank assembly and the manufacture of missile propellant. The US might also try to kill Iraq's President Saddam Hussein and his staff, according to the report. The administration has been striving to keep up psychological pressure on the Iraqi regime. About 40 US warships are near Iraq and the US Air Force has dozens of aircraft within striking distance of Baghdad.</p>

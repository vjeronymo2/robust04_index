			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Manuel Martinez] </F>   [Text] Their greatness cannot be diminished, only  confirmed. Ideas have a face, said Sergio Ramirez at an  assembly. And ideas are symbols that motivate action. Rebellion  against the ideas championed by Sergio Ramirez has taken shape  in the political defeat of the proposals to reform the Sandinist  National Liberation Front (FSLN). The fact that Sergio was not  elected to the National Directorate is, symbolically, something  akin to the expulsion of the archangel Lucifer. That is because  Sergio Ramirez's great virtue, or the danger he poses, is his  contribution as the visible head of the current of the  "Sandinism that would return to the majorities." But the mere  fact that he shook the foundations of the FSLN, regardless of  his defeat, as Monica Baltodano correctly stated in a radio  interview, is a precedent that can only be fully appreciated as  the FSLN's future unfolds. The first sign of its implications  will come with the results obtained by the FSLN in the 1996  elections.    Others, more adept than he at allying themselves with those  who really hold the reins of power, at the last minute jumped on  board the orthodox, radical boat. They ended up with a high  number of votes and kept their share of power. They clung to  power without regard for the political consequences suffered by  the FSLN.    A party that paralyzes itself and loses the momentum of  renewal places itself on the sidelines of the power game. The  consequences are not something that can be foreseen with a  crystal ball, but by analyzing the course of events, it is  possible to predict the future clearly. And in this case, I  think the prognosis is delicate and guarded.    Sergio Ramirez is one of the most astute thinkers in the  FSLN, and in this defeat, Sergio Ramirez revealed his true human  greatness as never before. Not even when he bravely led the  Group of 12, or during his tireless efforts as vice president of  the Republic, did he show us the magnitude of his capacity as a  politician and intellectual. Now, more than ever, he  demonstrated his ability to bravely take on an inescapable  proposition from which there was no shirking, and he stood firm  even though it meant his ouster.    His contribution, for example, to the idea that authority  cannot continue to be vested in a group anointed for historical  reasons, when that model has been outmoded by our present  reality, and that the fulcrum of power should rest on  rank-and-file Sandinists chosen in open elections, had to come  at a high cost. And he paid that cost in the purge. But like  everything in life, the seed has been planted, the work has  begun, and it inevitably will bear fruit.</p>

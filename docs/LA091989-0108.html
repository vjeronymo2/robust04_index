			<p><P> September 19, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JUDGE TELLS JUSTICE DEPT. TO PROBE PRESS LEAKS ABOUT MILKEN CASE  </P> <P> A federal judge Monday directed the Justice Department to launch an  investigation into leaks of confidential grand jury information in the criminal  case against former Drexel Burnham Lambert junk bond chief Michael Milken.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge Kimba M. Wood, who is presiding over the case against  Milken, asked during a hearing that the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan and  the Justice Department's Office of Professional Responsibility in Washington  begin an inquiry into leaks to the press.  </P> <P> During the hearing, Assistant U.S. Atty. Jess Fardella, one of the lead  prosecutors in the Milken case, told the judge that he had already made a  similar request for an investigation of the leaks.  </P> <P> The hearing followed a request last week by lawyers for Milken and his brother,  Lowell. In a motion filed with the court, they had asserted that prosecutors or  the Securities and Exchange Commission had deliberately leaked information  about the case to the Washington Post, the Wall Street Journal, the Los Angeles  Times and the New York Times. The Milkens' lawyers had asserted that the leaks  were part of a deliberate plot to apply pressure on potential witnesses to  cooperate with the government.  </P> <P> The judge, however, said that at least for the moment she wouldn't grant the  defense lawyers' request for an evidentiary hearing before the trial, in which  they could cross-examine witnesses in court about the source of the leaks.  Instead, Judge Wood said she probably would hold such a hearing after the  trial, which is tentatively scheduled for March, 1990. She said that, in the  meantime, she would ask Justice Department officials to report to her  periodically in closed proceedings in her chambers about the progress of the  investigation.  </P> <P> It wasn't clear if the investigators would attempt to interrogate or subpoena  reporters.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 98-Count Indictment  </P> <P> David Runkel, special assistant to Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, said: "If the  judge has ordered us to investigate the leaks, we certainly will." Runkel said  reporters generally haven't been subpoenaed in past investigations of leaks,  and he said it would be premature to say what techniques may be used in the  investigation. But he said Thornburgh feels "it would be helpful if they came  forward and cooperated in such investigations," adding that "Thornburgh feels  that they're not beyond the scope of subpoenas in cases such as this."  </P> <P> The Milken brothers and former Drexel trader Bruce L. Newberg were named in a  98-count racketeering and securities fraud indictment in March. Since then, the  grand jury investigation has continued, and a new, "superseding" indictment  with additional charges is expected in the case. The three have denied the  allegations and said they will fight the charges.  </P> <P> It is illegal for government officials to disclose information that is before a  grand jury.  </P> <P> In a telephone interview, Fardella said the inquiry would be conducted by  Victor Pohorelsky, the deputy chief of the criminal division in the U.S.  Attorney's Office in Manhattan, under the supervision of the Office of  Professional Responsibility. The latter office is charged with ensuring the  integrity of Justice Department employees, including federal prosecutors.  </P> <P> Scot J. Paltrow reported from New York and Robert L. Jackson from Washington.  </P></p>

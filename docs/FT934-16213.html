			<p>931007 FT  07 OCT 93 / UK Company News: Hewden Stuart advances to Pounds 9m HEWDEN STUART, the UK's biggest independent plant hire company, yesterday celebrated the 25th anniversary of its coming to the market by announcing a 35 per cent increase in pre-tax profits and a 1-for-5 scrip issue. Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 6.7m to Pounds 9.1m in the six months to July 31, even though turnover rose only slightly, from Pounds 88.9m to Pounds 91.7m. Sir Matthew Goodwin, chairman, said the downward trend in profits experienced for the last three years was reversed in the early summer, but this was more a reflection of good husbandry than any real strengthening in the workload of the Glasgow-based group's customers. The chairman said the improvement in the hire division's profits reflected benefits from the heavy capital expenditure programme which had been carried through the recession, often at a cost which adversely profits at the time. He added: 'Overall, however, the division reported no lessening in the severity of the competition and little sign of recovery in rates, and did well to achieve a small increase in turnover and profits.' Merchandising also saw a moderate increase in activity and profits, and Sir Matthew said one of the noticeable factors was that machines taken in part-exchange tended to be older than usual, with a shortage of modern second-hand equipment. 'This supports the view that the condition and age of plant fleets generally has deteriorated and brings nearer the time when customers will seek quality and service, albeit at higher prices,' he said. The group said its tower crane division, which last year incurred a loss, had improved and was expected to make a contribution to profits at the year-end. In July 31, Hewden paid Pounds 11m for the non-operated plant hire assets of BET Group, acquiring 24,000 items of plant and 29 freehold properties. The group said the acquisition increased and complemented its activities in this field, and was expected to contribute to profits in the second half of this year. Capital expenditure, including the BET deal, amounted to Pounds 28m and was financed entirely out of cashflow and cash resources. The group still had net cash at the half-year close, and in August raised more cash by placing 6m shares with institutions at 119p. Earnings per share rose to 3.6p (2.39p). Sir Matthew said that in a recessionary period where wages and costs needed to be carefully controlled, it would be inappropriate to do other than moderately increase the dividend, which rose to 0.9p (0.875p). COMMENT Sir Matthew was pleased with these results and upbeat about the group's prospects in the second half, as well he might be. The speed with which small increases in demand have been translated into substantial increases in profits is a tribute to how the group has kept on investing, and bodes well for the impact of a stronger recovery. Analysts were pleasantly surprised to learn that there will be some profits this year from the BET deal, which looks like a tax-efficient coup. Forecast profits of Pounds 18m put the shares, up 16p to 158p, on a premium prospective multiple of 20, but there are many supposed recovery stocks with a poorer record and outlook.</p>

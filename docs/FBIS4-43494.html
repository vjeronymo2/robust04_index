			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Treasury Minister on Privatizations </F> at Lower House"]    [Text] (ANSA) Rome, June 14 -- The government intends to  move quickly on privatizations and the sale of share packages of  STET [Tutin Telephone Finance Company], the IRI-controlled  [Institute for Industrial Reconstruction] telecommunications  financial holding company, ENEL [National Electric Power Board],  and the ENI [National Hydrocarbons Corporation] energy divisions  "will depend, in the first place, on the fulfillment of the  preparatory norms on privatization," said Treasury Minister  Lamberto Dini.    In a question and answer session at the Lower House today,  Dini disclosed that before the summer is out, the government  will lay down the guidelines for the formation of privatization  authorities in the services sector, one authority for each  sector. Before this, however, the government must complete an  "act of concession" for ENEL for the production and distribution  of energy to prepare the board for privatization.    Responding to MPs worries about maintaining a public role in  STET and ENEL, the minister explained, "The contents of the  privatization decree correspond precisely to this concern. In  fact, a golden share will stay in the state's hands and, look at  this carefully, while the limit on the size of a single holding  will expire in three years, the golden share will never be less."    On the point of protection of the rights of small  shareholders, the minister said the executive will follow  through on the idea of "slate voting" for the boards of the  newly-privatized companies whereby majority shareholders and  small shareholders and their representatives will run majority  and minority slates.    Asked about the fate of IRI, Dini said, in substance, that  it  was too early to say. The privatization and liquidation of IRI  companies will, however, be pursued "with maximum speed" and  will always be accompanied by "relevant management activities."    The minister, who began talking while seated at the  government bench and was then told by the duty speaker to stand  when addressing the chamber, as is customary, also dismissed  allegations of a conflict of interest between Premier Silvio  Berlusconi's government duties and his ownership of Fininvest,  Italy's second-largest private business enterprise.    "I would like to reassure the Parliament on this point  because the number of filters between the premier's coordination  center and the one where decisions are made are such as to stop  any intermingling of interests." He identified the "filters" as  "the panel of three ministers, Treasury, Budget and Industry,  the consulting and guarantee committee on privatizations,  chaired by the Treasury director general, the companies' boards  of directors and, in some cases, the directors of the holdings."  He went on to report that "national interests will always be  taken into account" in the privatization process and pointed out  that thus far 63 percent of the shares sold off have wound up in  Italy.    The new government also intends to fulfill the promise of  the  past executive: that revenues from privatizations "must be  deposited in a fund for the retirement of state securities for  the purpose of reducing the volume of the public debt in  circulation."    After affirming that plans for the privatization of STET  will  go forward "without any further thinking," the minister  responded to a proposal from the opposition Communist  Refoundation for a halt to this plan to prepare for the merger  of the telecom holding company, RAI, the public radio and  television broadcaster, the news agency ANSA, Olivetti, the big  computer manufacturer, and IRI's Finseil. "If ideas of industry  synergies among the telephone, television and information media  sectors should emerge, account could be taken of this during the  privatization program," said the minister.    On the hot topic of social security funds, following a  calculation yesterday that a Constitutional Court ruling will  cost the state an additional 30 trillion lire (18.75 billion  dollars), Dini said the government is committed to legislative  changes, "especially in the fiscal area."    These changes, he explained, will be aimed at furthering the  growth of "financial intermediaries as required for the creation  and development of broadly-based shareholding companies and to  curb and rationalize social security spending."</p>

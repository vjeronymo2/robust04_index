The  causes of different results achieved by these two methods are  discussed. The finite element method is used to simulate the  thermal stress in FGM during its preparation. The consolidated  rules for MgO/Ni FGM design postulation are obtained. Based on  design results, progressive adjustments of powder technology  properties are made. Consequently, MgO/Ni FGM is successfully  sintered.    Key words: Functionally gradient material, thermal stress,  microstructure, design, preparation.  <H5>  1. Introduction </H5>   Metal/ceramic-system functionally gradient materials (FGMs)  are new composite materials having applications potential in  such high-tech fields as aerospace, nuclear energy,  etc.[.sup]1[/] Whether they can eventually be put into  practical application depends on the crucial elimination of  fractures caused by the thermal stress induced from different  gradient layer properties.    MgO/Ni-system sintered bodies of various compositions are  prepared by the powder spreading-filling method. Their basic  property parameters for thermal-stress optimization design are  measured. The causes of differences between these parameters and  calculated values are discussed. Based on test data, the thermal  stress induced during the MgO/Ni-system FGM (MgO/Ni FGM)  preparation is simulated with the finite element method, and  based on the consolidated analysis of the magnitudes and  distributions of stresses, a principle of material structure and  composition distribution is proposed. Guided by design results  and considerations of such production technology factors as  strengths of the transition layers and property data, as well as  sintering shrinkage and densification conditions, MgO/Ni FGM  plates are prepared.  <H5>  2. Measurement and Evaluation of Property Parameters </H5> <H3>  2.1 Material System Selection and Preparation for Sintered  Bodies of Different Compositions </H3>   The MgO/Ni composite system is selected because of MgO  ceramic's superior high-temperature stability, high-temperature  basic vapor corrosion resistance, high-temperature insulation,  etc. Additionally, the thermal expansion difference between MgO  and nickel is small. The gradient combination of these two  materials has high potential to be used as the inner-wall  material for the ducts of magnetohydrodynamic  generators.[.sup]2[/]    The raw materials are MgO microfine powder and nickel  carbonyl powder. Both materials have greater than 99.5 percent  purity. The particle size for MgO is 0.3 m; for nickel  carbonyl powder, 5 m. Each of the powder mixes of different  MgO/Ni volume compositions is loaded in a separate pack and  isostatically compacted under 100 MPa pressure. The pressed  specimens are then sintered in 1.0 x 10[.sup]-2[/] Pa vacuum.  Considering the nickel sintering temperature, we set the  sintering conditions at 1300C for 100 minutes. The sintered  bodies are cut and polished for experimentation.  <H5>  2.2 Properties of Sintered Specimens </H5>   The specimen property parameters of six sintered  compositions  are measured. Their results are listed in the following table.       Material Properties for Various MgO/Ni Mixture Volume Ratios   Specimen No.               A       B       C       D       E       F   Volume fraction of MgO     100     80      60      40      20      0  /%   Relative density           71      64      62      72      83      93  d[.sup]r[/]/%   Young's modulus E/GPa      104     52      60      56      105     146   Bending strength           74      49      29      42      108     163  _s_[.sup]b[/]/MPa   Poisson's ratio _n_        0.16    0.18    0.27    0.26    0.26    0.35   Thermal expansion          12.8    12.9    13.5    14.3    14.5    15.1  coefficient _a_ x  10[.sup]6[/]/K[.sup]-1[/]      The table shows that the bending strengths of the sintered  specimens are closely related to their relative densities. The  lowest relative density of specimen C corresponds to its lowest  bending strength. In addition, among the three major property  parameters for finite element simulation, only the thermal  expansion coefficient _a_ has an approximately linear  relationship with the volume fraction; the other two values,  Young's modulus E and Poisson's ratio _n_, obviously depend on  the microstructure of the sintered specimens. Figure 1 shows the  variation of the measured data of relative density and Young's  modulus with the volume fraction of nickel. Figure 2 shows the  variation of thermal expansion coefficient and Poisson's ratio  with the volume fraction of nickel. For analytical convenience,  the figures also contain the curves denoting the corresponding  property changes with the changing of composition calculated  from the micromechanical model of Wakashima.[.sup]3[/] When  the nickel content is increased, the variation patterns of the  calculated values and the experimental values of the sintered  specimen's Young's modulus are similar, except at the point of  40-volume-percent nickel; besides, the calculated density  variations correspond to the experimental variations. The  calculated value of E is minimum at 60 volume percent of nickel;  however, the fact that the experimental E is not minimum at 40  volume percent of nickel but higher than the E values of the two  neighboring points indicates that Young's modulus is  strengthened at this point. The strengthening characteristic  also occurs in Poisson's ratio _n_. At the same point of  40-volume-percent nickel fraction, the value of _n_ is 0.27,  which is also higher than the _n_ values of the two neighboring  points. The phenomenon that material property parameter at a  certain composition displays abnormal strengthening, which  disagrees with the Wakashima equation, is caused by the  exceptional sintered microstructure at that particular  composition. Experiments show that specimens B, D, and E display  typical dispersion structures, i.e., MgO as second phase  disperses in the nickel matrix, or vice versa. However, the  microstructure of specimen C is different, as it displays a  geometric network structure with a continuous crisscross of  nickel and MgO. This network structure strengthens E and _n_.  Since Wakashima's model is based on the sparse-dispersion  micro-geometrical structure, it cannot describe the properties  of materials with network structures.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-19B>           Figure 1.

Thermal Expansion Coefficient and Poisson's Ratio vs. the Volume Fraction of Ni </FIG>   <H5>  3. Thermal Stress Simulation and Structural Design </H5> <H5>  3.1 Computed Model </H5>   The computed model uses the prepared disk specimen, 6mm  thick  and 30mm in diameter, which is sliced into 15 layers according  to the composition. The specimen is cooled to room temperature  from 1000C. The measured properties are used as model  parameters. The properties of the intermediate gradient layers  are obtained through interpolations of the tested data. A power  function is used to describe the volume fraction variations of  different gradient layers. The composition distribution curves  from different indices P are expressed by the equation C =  (x/d)[.sup]P[/];[.sup]4[/] where d is the total thickness  of each gradient layer, x is the position coordinate of any  gradient layer, and P is the distribution index which determines  the configuration of the composition distribution curve C. At  the plate's 1/4 cross section, we make the finite-element  network partitions, and assign different composition  distribution indices accordingly, then simulate the thermal  stress in the specimen with the finite element method.  <H5>  3.2 Analysis of Computed Results </H5>   In the computation, the P value varies from 0.6 to 2.8. The  results show that a distinct thermal relaxation effect occurs  for any FGM composition distribution, and the maximum stress  boundary moves toward the nickel-rich side. When P = 0.6, the  maximum radial stress component _s_[.sup]rr[/] is 96 MPa,  which indicates a thermal stress relaxation rate of 35 percent,  as compared with the thermal stress of the double-layered Ni-MgO  FGM (NFGM); when P = 1.8, the relaxation rate is as high as 70  percent.    Figure 3 shows the variation of the maximum  _s_[.sup]zz[/], _s_[.sub]rr[/], and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/]   with the P values. All three stresses have minimum values in the  areas of P variations and all appear in the neighborhood of P =  1.8. Comparatively speaking, the axial stress _s_[.sup]zz[/]  is very small, about 1/4 of the radial stress _s_[.sup]rr[/]  and the ring stress _s_[.sup]_th__th_[/]. This is due to the  fact that for the FGM specimens of this experiment, the ratio of  the gradient thickness to the diameter is 0.13. Large axial  stress cannot be induced from this small thickness-to-diameter  ratio.[.sup]4[/] Therefore, the FGM structural design must  take _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] as the main  control stresses.     Figure 3 shows that the _s_ value is minimum when P = 1.6  to  1.8. Whether this P value would provide the best design will be  discussed later in this paper. Figure 4 shows the variation of  maximum stress location center with index P (in the graph, h is  the distance from the center line to the pure nickel side).  Figure 4 also shows the corresponding FGM gradient layer to the   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-20A>           Figure 3. Maximum Thermal Stresses vs. Various Compositional Distribution Power </FIG>  maximum stress location. We can see that the location of the  maximum stress changes with the P value. After the P value  reaches 1.2, the location of the maximum stress center drops  sharply; as the P value continuously increases the maximum  stress center moves downward and approaches the model's  symmetrical center line. The right coordinate of Figure 4 shows  that the center line is located at the layer with 40 percent of  MgO, which is the weaker section (measured value is 42 MPa) of  the gradient material. Comparing with Figure 3, we can see that  even when P = 1.8, the stress is at the minimum value of 40 MPa;  this minimum value is very close to the allowable material  strength; hence, the failure would naturally occur at the center  line of the radial direction. When P = 1.0, the maximum stress  center occurs at 0.8 h, which is the straight nickel layer.  Referring to both Figure 3 and Figure 4, although  _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/] are comparatively  high (about 60 MPa), they are still far below the actual test  strength (163 MPa) of the straight nickel layer. Besides, the  computed stress diagram also shows that when the P value  changes, even though the straight ceramic side is generally  under compressive stress, a tensile symptom still displays at  the neighborhood of the circumference of 0.9 R (R is the radius  of the round FGM plate) on the horizontal surface and the axial  direction of the ceramic side. The tensile stress, however small  (especially _s_[.sup]zz[/]), should be included in the  analysis. As shown in Figure 5, the local tensile stress on the  straight ceramic side at P = 1.6 is minimum. When P = 1.8, the  local tensile stress _s_[.sup]rr[/] and _s_[.sub]_th__th_[/]   are both smaller than 40 MPa, which is far smaller than the  allowable measured strength.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-21A>           Figure 4. Maximum Stress Location vs. Various Compositional Distribution Power; h is a half thickness of the sample </FIG>   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-21B>           Figure 5. Tensile Stresses in the Part of MgO-Side vs. Various Distribution Power </FIG>     In conclusion, even the composition distribution index P  that  represents the best thermal stress relaxation effect cannot  completely reflect the correct structural control parameters.  All the following three conditions must be considered:    (1) the target P value which represents the minimum thermal  stress;    (2) the adjusted P value so that the location of thermal  stress occurs as close to the metallic side as possible;    (3) whether the corresponding P value would induce a tensile  stress far smaller than the allowable strength on the straight  ceramic side.    Based on these considerations, the best FGM design can be  obtained and the FGM material composition distribution can be  determined. This is the basic principle of structural design to  avoid fractures in the FGM during its preparation. Based on the  above, the design outcome is P = 1.0.  <H5>  4. Preparation of Functionally Gradient Materials </H5>   MgO/Ni FGMs are prepared according to the design result P =  1.0. Fifteen layers of MgO/Ni powder of different compositions  are piled by the layer-filling technique, then the green  compacts are either vacuum sintered, or hot-pressing (HP)  sintered.  <H5>  4.1 Adjustment of Compacting and Sintering of Powder Mix </H5>   During vacuum FGM sintering, in the periods of temperature  rising, sintering, and cooling, the compacts are not constrained  by any external forces. Therefore, adjustments of the compacting  property and the sintering property are possible, which is  particularly important for a defect-free specimen. In this  experiment, two different types of MgO powder, both mixed with  0.5 weight percent of Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder, are  used. One is fluffy microfine powder decomposed from  Mg(OH)[.sup]2[/]. The average particle size is about 0.3  m. The other is fine powder thermally decomposed from  MgSO[.sup]4[/]-7H[.sub]2[/]O. The average particle size is  about 3 m. When the mixes are made of exclusively 0.3 m  fluffy powder and nickel powder, the variation of compacting  densities and sintering shrinkages with the MgO composition is  as shown in Figure 6. Because of the considerable variations  among the specimen compact densities (especially in the straight  ceramic specimens, the differences between the axial pressed  compacts and the compacts further treated with 100 MPa cold  isostatic pressing are very wide), and the relatively low final  straight ceramic compact density, stress-induced cracks  frequently occur on the straight ceramic side of the laminated  compacts. To solve this problem, 15 to 35 weight percent of  large-particle (d = 3 m) MgO powder is added. The addition  of  large-particle MgO powder increases the MgO compact density, and  also reduces the shrinkage differences among the sintered  specimens. The previous table shows that the densification rates  of all specimens used in structural designs are fairly low with  high degrees of porosity, which is mainly affected by the  sintering parameters and densification technique. To meet the  sintering temperature of nickel powder and reduce the  densification sintering temperature of MgO so that the sintering  properties of nickel powder and MgO become compatible, about 0.5  weight percent of Fe[.sup]2[/]O[.sub]3[/] powder is  added.[.sup]5[/] After this treatment, almost all the  specimen relative densities reach 90 percent after sintering at  1320C for 2.5 hours.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-22A>           Figure 6. Formation Density and Sintering Shrinkage for MgO/Ni Mixtures </FIG>     After the aforementioned adjustments, the green compacts of  various compositions are used to determine the sintering  shrinkage rate changes from room temperature up to 1250C at  a constant temperature increasing rate. The results are shown in  Figure 7. For all but the straight MgO specimen, the sintering  shrinking rate increases with the increase of nickel content,  but the difference of the shrinkage magnitudes between any two  neighboring specimens is small. Basically, a balance of the  sintering shrinkages is achieved. The straight MgO specimen  contains about 70 weight percent of microfine powder, and  produces an uncoordinated shrinking situation with its  neighboring layers. During the FGM's actual lamination,  compaction, and sintering, the straight nickel side has a higher  compaction density due to isostatic cold pressing. Hence the  diameter of the ceramic side is larger than that of the straight  metal side (by about 6 percent). However, the ``uncoordinated''  shrinkage offsets the existing dimension difference during  compaction, and eventually a uniform FGM specimen is prepared.     In conclusion, quality FGM can only be made according to the   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-22B>           Figure 7. Sintering Shrinkage of MgO/Ni Mixtures With Various Mixing Ratios </FIG>  basic structural design principles when the preparation  conditions such as powder particle size, additives, compact  deformation, sintering shrinkage, etc. are adjusted and  controlled in coordinated fashion.  <H5>  4.2 Preparation of FGM </H5>   Two FGM disc specimens of the MgO/Ni system with about 6mm  thickness, and diameters of 24mm and 30mm are made by vacuum  sintering and HP sintering, respectively. The vacuum sintering  parameters are as follows: 1320C, 2.5 hours, and 1 x  10[.sup]-2[/] Pa vacuum; and the HP sintering parameters:  1300C, 28 MPa pressing pressure, and 1 hour. Figure 8 shows  the prepared specimens. During the HP sintering, the pressure is  released at about 1000C, and MgO displays high-temperature  plastic deformation,[.sup]6[/] hence, the thermal stress is  sufficiently relaxed in the course of HP sintering to pressure  releasing. Therefore, the specimen prepared by HP sintering has  a larger diameter and no surface defects.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-23A>           Figure 8. MgO/Ni FGM Samples Prepared by Different Sintering Methods </FIG>   <H5>  5. Conclusions </H5>   (1) The experimental method and the micromechanical model  are  used to measure and calculate the property parameters of the  sintered bodies of the MgO/Ni system with various compositions.  The results show that the specimen's sintering strength is  mainly controlled by porosity; the coefficient of thermal  expansion follows a quasi-linear variation; and Young's modulus  and Poisson's ratio are strengthened at 40 volume percent of  nickel content. The implication is that Wakashima's  micromechanical model cannot yet truthfully describe the  micro-network structure of the sintered body.    (2) The thermal stress simulation of a FGM model with a  thickness-to-diameter ratio of 0.13 shows that compared with  NFGM, FGM clearly has a thermal stress relaxation effect, and  the maximum stress boundary layer moves significantly toward the  metal side. The degree of relaxation depends on the distribution  index P. The minimum values of the three major stress components  occur when P = 1.8 (when the stress relaxation is 70 percent).    (3) However, the best material structural design condition  is  not when P = 1.8. When factors such as the structural location  of the maximum stress, the strength of the gradient layer at the  same location of the maximum stress, and furthermore, the  tensile strength of the straight ceramic side are considered,  the best combined design condition for MgO/Ni FGM is when P =  1.0.    (4) Based on P = 1.0, when factors such as raw-material  particle size, sintering properties, and the balance between  compact contraction and sintering shrinkage are adjusted, FGM of  the MgO/Ni system without macroscopical surface defect can be  prepared by vacuum sintering and HP sintering methods.

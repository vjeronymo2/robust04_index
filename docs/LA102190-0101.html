			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> HE IS DRIVEN TO SUCCEED AS A FORMULA ONE RACER;  </P> <P> AUTO RACING: MATTHIAS NIKOLAKOPULOS IS A SUCCESSFUL ELECTRICAL ENGINEER, BUT  HIS DREAM IS BECOMING A BIG WHEEL AMONG RACING ELITE.  </P> <P> Matthias Nikolakopulos, one of the youngest electrical engineers in California,  is in France this week wrestling with his future behind the wheel of a  lightning-fast race car.  </P> <P> At 26, he has a bright career ahead of him in his father's engineering firm.  </P> <P> But Matthias, as he is known to friends because his last name is too difficult  for many to pronounce, wants to be a race car driver, despite pressure from his  father.  </P> <P> "He is a top engineer," Alex Nikolakopulos said. "He demonstrated good  engineering techniques as a little boy. It would be very difficult for him to  pursue (a racing career) without a great deal of distress to us."  </P> <P> Matthias, who took his first ride on a minibike when he was 6, has shown  promise, however, not as a good 'ol boy Richard Petty-type, but as a classy  Formula One driver. That's why he's back at the world famous Circuit Paul  Richard race track on the French Riviera today, attempting to become only the  second American ever to qualify for the championship of the Pilote Elf Series,  which is run in part by the Winfield School in France.  </P> <P> About 250 drivers, most of them European, pass through Winfield each year. Very  few, according to Car and Driver Magazine, earn certificates, as Matthias did  in June, one of only five Americans in a class of 20 to do so. Certificate  winners qualify for an advanced driving course. They return to France each  October with the hopes of qualifying to compete in the Pilote Elf Series,  driving smaller versions of Formula One-type cars. The top driver, winner of  the Pilote race, receives a full year of sponsorship by Elf Petroleum, a French  oil company, to race on the Formula Renault circuit, a minor league of the  Formula One. Twenty-one graduates of Winfield have climbed to Formula One, the  highest level of racing available in the world.  </P> <P> Currently no Americans are racing Formula One, but Matthias could be soon. His  performance in the time trials at Winfield in June drew the attention of Car  and Driver Magazine, which said: "Nikolakopulos looks to be a potential merit  winner."  </P> <P> Adds John Peterson of Franam Racing, Inc. of Minnesota, who arranges for  Americans to compete in the Pilote Elf Series: "I've heard good things about  his performances (at the school). "This is an elite organization, and he  returns as one of the top two in his class."  </P> <P> Frenchmen have dominated Pilote Elf competition, winning four of five races. In  recent years, to encourage more participation by Americans, the top Yank  finisher has received a racing scholarship. This year it includes a trip to a  top driver seminar in Montreal and a year as a driver on the Barber Saab Pro  Series of racing in the U.S. In addition, the top American could also win, but  must finance himself, as the third seat in the Pilot Elf Formula Renault  series.  </P> <P> Either way, should Matthias make it past the semifinals this weekend, Peterson  said, "He has a place in racing. There is no doubt in my mind."  </P> <P> Formula One is a costly sport which requires many sponsors. Formula cars are  custom-built, open-wheel race cars costing as much as $50 million apiece.  </P> <P> But the sport can be profitable. Top drivers, often leading lives as colorful  as the brightly painted road-hugging cars they drive, can earn $12 million a  year.  </P> <P> "It's been many years since America has fielded a competitive effort in the  Grand Prix scene, and even longer since we've won the world championship,"  Matthias said.  </P> <P> Mario Andretti was the last American to win a world championship 12 years ago.  </P> <P> Matthias would like to be next, but, according to his father, he would be  better suited with a future in electrical engineering.  </P> <P> Responds Matthias: "I'm there. But my heart is not in it."  </P> <P> It isn't enough just to learn to drive, Matthias said. It becomes a lifestyle.  Formula One sponsors want a complete person, a man who exhibits a combination  of coolness and responsibility, yet flare at the right time.  </P> <P> "I want to stake my own claim. I want to beat the odds," he said.  </P> <P> He is studying the French language and French customs. He also eats French  foods and is taking Dale Carnagie classes to improve his confidence.  </P> <P> "At 5 years old I already knew that I wasn't going to be one of those kids with  a baseball bat on my shoulder and a ball in my hand," he said.  </P> <P> Although shy, at 6 he summoned the courage to ask a teen-ager on his block in  Palos Verdes Estates if he could ride the teen-ager's minibike in the nearby  fields. To his surprise, the answer was yes. Matthias was hooked.  </P> <P> He bought a Honda 50 c.c. minibike when he was seven, then three months later  took it apart and spread the parts over the garage floor. He wanted to learn  what made it work.  </P> <P> His mother died the following year, leaving Matthias, the youngest of five  children, a lot of time to himself.  </P> <P> "But instead of fighting (loneliness) I made the best of it," he said.  </P> <P> He graduated to motorcycles and by the time he was attending Palos Verdes High,  he was racing them. He loved to fiddle with engines. At 16, he put a Buick V6  into a Dodge Ram 50 pickup.  </P> <P> "You can't really change what you are," he said. "You have to take whatever you  have and make the best of what you are."  </P> <P> One day before school his father discovered him awake at 2 a.m., tearing down a  motorcycle in the garage. Parts were strewn everywhere.  </P> <P> "There's still parts in that garage today," Alex Nikolakopulos said.  </P> <P> Schoolwork was easy for Matthias, so he spent most of his time in the garage.  </P> <P> "I think I had four hours of sleep a night while I was in high school,"  Matthias said. "Dad really got mad at me that night he found me in the garage,  but after awhile he couldn't really complain. I was getting good grades and  doing what I wanted to do."  </P> <P> Mechanical knowledge came easy. Said Brian Springer, a high school shop  teacher: "He was a gem of a student. Very intelligent. Whenever he wanted to  get something done, he finished it. There are very few students I remember, but  Matthias was one of them."  </P> <P> Matthias continued to race motorcycles while attending USC. He moved into  go-karts after graduation and then, on a trip to Europe in 1986, discovered the  Formula One circuit. He fell in love with it.  </P> <P> "In the U.S. racing is such a hodgepodge, there is no rhyme or reason to it  because there are so many levels," Matthias said. "In Europe, Formula One is a  serious business, requiring a lot of concentration. It is exactly what I dream  about."  </P> <P> Matthias obtained his electrical engineer's license two years ago. He went to  work for Dad, but racing boiled in his blood. Two years ago at the Phoenix  Grand Prix, he snuck into the McLaren Team pits and learned all he could.  </P> <P> The personalized license plate on his flashy 300ZX read "F1 Bound."  </P> <P> "Everything about (racing) is so me," Matthias said. "Other drivers complain  that when they put the helmet on, they can't hear anything going on around  them. Not me. I like being isolated. It's like I'm in a think tank."  </P> <P> If Matthias doesn't make it as a race driver, Peterson and others say he has  the engineering background to design cars. Matthias thinks so, too, although  his father would prefer he stay closer to home.  </P> <P> "I would rather have him in the office with me," said Alex Nikolakopulos, who  also employs another son. "I have watched him race when he was doing go-karts  and I held my heart in my hand each time."  </P> <P> "I know he worries about my safety," Matthias said. "But he knows I have a  level head on my shoulders."  </P> <P> He is confident. He points to an astrological forecast for his Oct. 9 birthday.  It predicts that he will "travel in October and could win (a) contest."  </P> <P> During lunch at a fancy French restaurant in Redondo Beach before he left,  Matthias revealed that the conflict about his future sometimes rages within  him. Looking all the bit of a high-level electrical engineer with a tie knotted  firmly around his collar as he ate, he said: "You have to follow your passion,  your dream, even if you fail. I just want to do it, without breaking a lot of  hearts along the way."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 20, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> YOUTH SERVICE STRUGGLES FOR LIFE;  </P> <P> LOSS OF PRIVATE FUNDS THREATENS REFERRAL AGENCY  </P> <P> A Van Nuys-based agency that matches troubled children with appropriate  counseling services is in the midst of a financial crisis that has left its  staff members struggling to keep the doors open for the next 2 1/2 months.  </P> <P> The Juvenile Justice Connection Project, which relies almost entirely on  private donations for its annual operating budget, needs $121,000 to pay the  minimum expenses of running the agency for the rest of the fiscal year ending  June 30, said executive director Valerie Hopkins. Staff members said Wednesday  that their board of directors is carrying out an emergency fund-raising  campaign to keep the agency running.  </P> <P> "We're working like crazy not to close the doors," said Barbara Bruckman, the  agency's development director.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Referrals for Children  </P> <P> Founded eight years ago by Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Irwin  Nebron, the project aims to keep troubled children from becoming criminals by  referring them to psychological counselors, educational therapists, alcohol and  drug abuse programs and other support services.  </P> <P> Children, who are sent by police officers, judges, school officials, ministers  and others, are assessed by one of the agency's counselors and then directed to  appropriate treatment programs. The assessment and referrals are free. The  treatment programs also are free to those can't afford them, while others pay a  low fee based on their financial resources.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Stop the Cycle'  </P> <P> "We are trying to act as a preventive to help kids before they get into gangs,  before they drop out of school, before they become criminals. Somebody has to  stop the cycle," Hopkins said.  </P> <P> The budget shortfall stems from several charitable foundations' decisions not  to give the agency any more grant support, Hopkins said. These foundations  supported the project in past years, and the staff was counting on the money  for the balance of their $769,000 annual budget.  </P> <P> "These foundations tell us we are a fantastic organization, with a fantastic  history, and they are so thrilled we are doing so well, and then tell us we  should seek a permanent source of funding," Hopkins said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support Often Cut  </P> <P> A consultant to charitable groups said foundations often cut off support for  projects they help launch, since a growing number of nonprofit agencies are  competing for their support.  </P> <P> "It's the curse of the nonprofit organization," said Alan Kumamoto of the  Center for Non-Profit Management. "Foundations have limited dollars and they  are trying to spread their monies around because of all the different needs out  there."  </P> <P> Hopkins said the agency pared its annual budget down to $572,000, which covers  only minimum operating costs, such as employee salaries, rent and insurance.  The staff of 25 has dwindled by attrition to 16 people working overtime to  continue to provide the same level of services as before the financial crisis.  </P> <P> Despite the cutbacks, the agency still does not have enough money to cover its  basic expenses for the next 2 1/2 months, she said. "We are in a real cash  crunch, and we don't have any money to carry us."  </P> <P> In July, the project will receive grant monies for the next fiscal year, she  said, adding that by then the staff hopes to have new sources of funding that  will prevent it from similar crises in the future.  </P></p>

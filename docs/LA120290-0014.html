			<p><P> December 2, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ERMA BOMBECK: CHRISTMAS BY THE BOOK? HARDLY  </P> <P> Last year, someone gave me Martha Stewart's Christmas book for holiday  entertaining. That's about as cruel as someone offering to set up a deck chair  for me on the Titanic.  </P> <P> We're talking about a woman who decorates a tree with homemade gingerbread  cookies brushed with softly beaten egg whites and then painted with gold leaf.  One year, I hung six fake birds on a tree outside my window. It rained, and  they looked like their intestines were unraveling.  </P> <P> As I leafed through the book recently, I must say it was seductive. It made  everything seem so warm and fuzzy and possible. Maybe -- just maybe -- if I  started early enough, I could pull off a Martha Stewart Christmas.  </P> <P> I figure I'll start by making my own potpourri by gathering together  tellicherry peppercorns, orrisroot powder, bayberry bark, senna pods, lemon  verbena and rose hips. I could do that if I had any idea of what I just said.  </P> <P> What the heck: I'll buy a bag at Hallmark and spend the time making homemade  delicacies. I just have to figure out how many jars I need for onion chutney  and how far ahead to make the crackers for the soups. I don't believe I said  that.  </P> <P> On the other hand, if I really want to knock the socks off guests, I'll forgo  the homemade wreaths and concentrate on the gingerbread mansion on Page 109.  Yes! Let's see, all Martha lists for that is a recipe for gingerbread (piece of  cake), another recipe for icing and an architectural drawing course! Give me a  break, Martha.  </P> <P> Who among us has not dreamed of making our own wrapping paper? Let's see, for  that I assemble lots of plain brown paper, metallic paint, brushes, surgical  gloves and a degree in fine arts.  </P> <P> I leaf to the cooking section to see if perhaps there is something different to  dazzle my holiday guests besides the traditional turkey and ham. There it is,  all right: cassoulet. Cassoulet lists 22 ingredients, including such staples as  six 5-pound ducks, two cups of fresh duck fat, 16 pounds of Great Northern  beans and six pounds of garlic sausage. It serves 100 (I had only 63 at my  wedding) and takes three days to process. The oven is your problem.  </P> <P> OK, so maybe I won't have a Martha Stewart Christmas, but at least the pictures  got me in the mood. I saw the book the other day at a bookstore. When no one  was looking, I moved it from the "Entertaining" shelf to a table stacked with  fiction.  </P></p>

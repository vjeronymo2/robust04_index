			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report signed "ps": "FPOe: No to EU, but No Recommendation </F> for Referendum"]    [Excerpt] At the Freedom Party of Austria's [FPOe] special  congress, European Union [EU] membership was clearly rejected.  The FPOe will, however, not give a recommendation to voters for  the EU referendum to take place in June.    After week-long discussions, the FPOe has finally taken a  position on Austrian EU membership: On Friday evening [8 April]  at the special party congress in Villach, 85.5 percent of the  463 delegates supported FPOe Chairman Haider's proposal.    This proposal recommends that the FPOe parliamentary group  oppose both the EU membership agreement and the amendments to  the constitution that will be necessary for EU membership. The  second central point of the vote at the party congress: The  FPOe will not give voters any recommendation for the EU  referendum in June. A total of 390 FPOe delegates (85.5  percent) voted in favor of this position, 66 were against it,  and seven cast invalid votes.    Haider had determined this course in his speech immediately  before the vote. The FPOe chairman called the results achieved  by the government in EU membership negotiations "poor, modest,  and to be rejected." [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>940126 FT  26 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Fisons Nothing in yesterday's restructuring announcement makes Fisons' future easier to judge. The company has come up with Pounds 35m annual cost savings in pharmaceuticals by 1996, perhaps Pounds 10m more than the stock market expected. Efficiencies in management and manufacturing should allow development spending to be maintained despite the poor trading performance. The sales force has also been spared the worst. Growing competition in asthma therapy from Glaxo - and Zeneca before long - demands that the marketing effort is maintained. Yet the salesforce may look under-employed within two years unless Fisons can conjure something from its research pipeline or, more likely, licenses a good product from outside. Intal, its biggest-selling drug, faces competition from cheaper generic alternatives this year. Although the precise timing and impact are matters for guesswork, sales will surely suffer. The US launch of Tilade, Fisons' new asthma treatment, appears to be going well enough. But it is too early to pass judgment. Until this shortage of new products is addressed, the suspicion remains that yesterday's round of pruning alone will not be enough. Meanwhile the loss-making instruments division is under the microscope. That points to more restructuring provisions to come, possibly with the 1993 figures in March. With the stock market transfixed by the chances of a bid, though, the red ink is unlikely to unsettle the shares. A rating in line with that of Glaxo is otherwise difficult to justify.</p>

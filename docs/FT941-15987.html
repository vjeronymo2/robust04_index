			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Elonex sets up software alliance Elonex, the privately-owned UK personal computer manufacturer, has formed a strategic alliance with Next, the US software company led by Mr Steven Jobs, founder of Apple Computer. It has agreed to market in Europe a range of specially built pcs pre-loaded with Next's NextStep software. NextStep is designed to make it easier for software developers and commercial companies to write business software. The new Elonex pcs were developed at its California research and development centre in conjunction with Next engineers. They will cost typically from Pounds 2,775 to Pounds 5,555 ex VAT. The aim of the joint venture is to create a volume market for NextStep in Europe. The two companies hope to sell about 20,000 systems across Europe this year, chiefly in the financial services, legal services and telecommunications markets. Next already has a number of alliances with pc manufacturers in the US including Dell, the third largest US pc maker, but none in Europe until now. Mr Israel Wetrin, Elonex founder, said the deal would open doors for both companies: 'NextStep has huge cost-saving potential because it allows developers to build complex applications quickly,' he said. NextStep is recognised as pioneering the trend towards 'object oriented' software development in which software modules can be clicked together like plastic bricks and used time and again.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Iraqi Opposition Speaks of Suspect </F> Iraqi Behavior"]    [Text] London, AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT -- The Iraqi opposition  is talking about suspect Iraqi internal and external  developments. The "Free Iraqi Council," based in London, says  that the Baghdad Government has leaked rumors claiming that Air  Force Commander Staff Lieutenant General Muzahim Sa'b Hasan  al-Tikriti is in Amman for medical reasons, but Arab diplomatic  sources emphasize that he went to Amman on the direct orders of  Iraqi President Saddam Husayn to supervise the building of  "secret" air bases to be used when necessary and, in times of  despair, for escape because he now fears a coup by the military  commanders closest to him at any moment.    The "Council" also says that there is a mounting campaign of  condemnation and denunciation in Sanaa and Aden because of the  Saddam regime's increasing interference in the Yemeni crisis and  fueling the fire there. It adds that a number of political  figures and tribal chiefs and some sections of the press have  expressed anger at the arrival of 20 Iraqi pilots in Sanaa and  the payment of funds to some tribal chiefs and officers loyal to  the Iraqi Ba'th party for the purpose of holding Western experts  working in Yemen as hostages and assassinating supporters of  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and accusing the Yemeni Socialist  Party [YSP] leadership of doing that in retaliation for the  assassination of its supporters for which elements loyal to  President Salih were blamed.    A statement issued by the "Council," a copy of which has  been  received by AL-SHARQ AL-AWSAT, says that, at the internal level,  there is growing alarm among most Iraqi merchants, especially  those who move between Baghdad and Amman, after the death of  Iraqi businessman al-Hajj 'Abd-al-Latif Bunyah in a road  accident as he was driving his car to Jordan. Accusing fingers  have been pointed at the Iraqi intelligence services and aides  of the Iraqi president's son 'Udayy.    It should be recalled that al-Hajj 'Abd-al-latif had loaned  the Iraqi Government large sums of money and was in competition  with 'Udayy for the control of the international Coca-Cola  Company's agency. He also allegedly criticized the Iraqi  Government's financial policy on more than one occasion.</p>

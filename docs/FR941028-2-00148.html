The petition is described below, including the regulatory provisions involved and the nature of the relief being requested. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Interested parties are invited to participate in these proceedings by submitting written views, data, or comments. FRA does not anticipate scheduling a public hearing in connection with these proceedings since the facts do not appear to warrant a hearing. If any interested party desires an opportunity for oral comment, they should notify FRA, in writing, before the end of the comment period and specify the basis for their request. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> All communications concerning these proceedings should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number RSFC&hyph;94&hyph;2) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, Federal Railroad Administration, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.

All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.&hyph;5 p.m.) in Room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Association of American Railroads (AAR)_(Waiver Petition Docket Number RSFC&hyph;94&hyph;2) <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Association of American Railroads (AAR) seeks an interim waiver of compliance with certain provisions of the Railroad Freight Car Safety Standards, 49 CFR Part 215. The AAR is requesting an exemption from the requirement of 49 CFR 215.103(h) which requires the removal from service of freight car wheels that show signs of having been overheated as evidenced by reddish brown discoloration, as it is applied to heat-treated curved-plate wheels. As a result of a petition by the AAR (Rulemaking Petition No. 93&hyph;1), the FRA intends to initiate a rulemaking addressing the proposal to revise 49 CFR 215.103(h) as it applies to heat-treated curved-plate (HT&hyph;CP) freight car wheels. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAR indicates that it is filing this petition for an interim waiver to address the situation while the rulemaking process proceeds. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAR requests that FRA issue a waiver providing in substance, that: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 49 CFR 215.103 shall not prohibit a railroad from placing or continuing in service a freight car if the only reason for such prohibition is one or more wheels that are discolored as described in 49 CFR 215.103(h), provided: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Each such discolored wheel is heat-treated and is of curve-plate design, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Each such wheel is identified as a heat-treated curved-plate wheel in accordance with AAR interchange rules, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) The railroad has submitted to FRA and to AAR a written agreement to participate in the Data Collection Program on Premature Wheel Failure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AAR cites the following justification for the waiver request: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. HT&hyph;CP wheels are extraordinarily resistant to the development of residual tensile rim stresses which are a precondition for wheel fracture. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 11, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WHO YOU KNOW CAN BE DEADLY;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE: STRANGERS MAY POSE DANGERS, BUT CHANCES ARE, IF YOU ARE MURDERED, IT  WILL BE BY A RELATIVE, ROOMMATE, CO-WORKER, NEIGHBOR OR SOME OTHER  ACQUAINTANCE.  </P> <P> About 20,000 times each year in the United States, murderers shoot, stab,  strangle, mangle and perform other unthinkable acts.  </P> <P> The public's perception is that most of these murders are random acts of  violence, and in gang-plagued urban areas that perception is fueled by nightly  news of drive-by shootings and other atrocities. No wonder the murder of Boston  attorney Carol Stuart caught the attention of an entire nation.  </P> <P> Last October, Stuart's husband, Charles, claimed their car was invaded by a  black assailant after the couple left a childbirth class at Brigham and Women's  Hospital. Charles Stuart was seriously wounded. Carol Stuart died shortly after  their son was delivered by Cesarean section; the premature baby lived only 17  days. Boston police launched a massive manhunt for the criminal; it was  reported that Stuart identified a suspect in a police lineup.  </P> <P> Three months after the crime, Charles Stuart apparently jumped from a bridge to  his death after he learned he had become the chief suspect in the case. If  Charles Stuart indeed killed his wife, her death fits a pattern. In more than  60% of the murders committed in the United States, the killer was someone the  victim knew.  </P> <P> The Stuart case fed the nation's fears on two levels: fear of random violence  and fear of racially motivated crime. Officials' belief in Stuart's story and  the subsequent discovery that he was the likely killer has left Boston in the  midst of what Mayor Raymond L. Flynn has called its worst racial crisis since  the mid-1970s riots over court-ordered school desegregation.  </P> <P> In truth, if we are murdered, chances are it will be by a relative, roommate,  co-worker, neighbor or some other acquaintance. Carol Stuart's killing was  sensational, but not unusual.  </P> <P> And it is one of many such cases to garner national headlines. Consider:  </P> <P> * In 1985 the body of Arleta teen-ager Michele Avila was found in a creek in  Angeles National Forest. Shortly thereafter, her best friend, Karen Severson,  moved into the family home to console the grieving mother. Severson was later  arrested, along with another friend, for the crime. Their trial started Monday.  </P> <P> * In 1986, in Port Angeles, Wash., preacher Grady Young told authorities that  burglars killed his wife of 38 years, but he was convicted of the crime in  1987.  </P> <P> * In 1975 Tommy Zeigler, a Winter Garden, Fla., furniture store owner told  police that unknown assailants shot his wife Eunice, her parents, and a  customer in his store. Zeigler was convicted in 1976.  </P> <P> * In 1970 Dr. Jeffrey MacDonald claimed a band of drug-crazed hippies invaded  his Ft. Bragg, N.C., home and murdered his pregnant wife and two daughters.  MacDonald was convicted of the crime in 1979.  </P> <P> According to the FBI Uniform Crime Report, "over half the murder victims in  1988 were related to (15%) or acquainted with (40%) their assailants." Twelve  percent were murdered by strangers, and "the relationships among victims and  offenders were unknown in 33% of the murders." (Police and social scientists  assume there is a connection between victim and murderer in a large portion of  homicides where the relationship is listed as unknown.)  </P> <P> Police officials in several jurisdictions list statistics that confirm the  national trend. Of eight murders in Santa Monica last year, six were committed  by people known to the victims, according to Police Detective Steve Rosenfeld.  Detective Rick Swanston of the LAPD's West Valley Division reports that 10 of  last year's 12 homicides were committed by people the victims knew. And at the  Van Nuys Division, Detective Jim Vojtecky says that victims knew their  murderers in 25 of the 26 homicide cases solved last year. (Citywide statistics  were not available.)  </P> <P> As a result of the Stuart murder and the racial tensions it has exacerbated in  Boston, social scientists, psychologists and legal experts say they hope  Americans will start to explore the reality of violence instead of continuing  to believe the mythology of random attacks.  </P> <P> "The problem is that people want to ignore reality" and prefer to think  homicide occurs on dark seamy streets where evil strangers lurk, as it seemed  at first in the Stuart case, said Venice attorney Paul Mones, who specializes  in cases of children who murder their parents.  </P> <P> "It's more likely," Mones said, "that the person who assaults you in a parking  lot is likely to be your boyfriend or girlfriend or someone hired by them than  it is a stranger.  </P> <P> "The same is true in terms of a little girl who has been abducted, raped and  killed. We think it's some guy drooling in a beat-up car, as opposed to a  well-dressed uncle, father or neighbor who knows the kid. But it's more often  the well-dressed father, the businessman, not the strangers" who do the deeds.  </P> <P> Added Mones: "Crime statistics show if you added together all the drug-related  homicides, you still would not approach" the number of relatives and friends  who kill each each other every year.  </P> <P> It's much easier -- and much more comfortable -- experts say, to believe that a  murderer is a stranger rather than someone we know. We are, said Mones, lulled  into the belief that the family is a bastion of tranquillity and peace.  </P> <P> Boston police seemed to embrace Charles Stuart's story of a nightmarish attack,  although, according to Mones, "the circumstances of the homicide would lead an  objective investigator" to look at the person who reported the crime as a  suspect.  </P> <P> "Based on newspaper reports this guy took out an insurance policy on his wife  right before she died. But still the police didn't ask. They just accepted the  fact that it's a black man. A stranger. And the black community is up in arms,  justifiably."  </P> <P> Mones is one of many observers who say that physical violence has become so  subtly woven into the fabric of family life, and into our culture, that most  people are incapable of recognizing that violence when it is happening to them.  </P> <P> Donald Dutton, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia  and an expert on family violence agrees.  </P> <P> "People overestimate the danger of being attacked on the street and  underestimate the danger of being attacked at home," he said, adding that  family violence experts estimate that anywhere from 30% to 75% of all marriages  experience violence between the partners at one time or another.  </P> <P> Dutton and others say that media coverage of violent crime influences our  perception of the likelihood of the event; drive-by shootings make for more  sensational news coverage than do the more frequent episodes of family  violence.  </P> <P> "Only 6.5% of wife assaults, for example, even get reported to the police, and  a very low percentage of those ever make it to the courts or result in  conviction," Dutton said. "For that same reason we overestimate our danger of  dying in a plane crash -- crashes always make the news -- and underestimate our  danger of drowning. Drownings are more frequent but rarely get coverage."  </P> <P> Kirk Williams is a professor of sociology at the University of New Hampshire  and a research associate at the school's Family Research Laboratory, which  studies family violence. Based on studies he's read, he thinks as many as 75%  of homicides committed in this country are done by people who at least know  each other, and about 25% are family-related.  </P> <P> To understand murder, he said, "We have to look at what's going on inside the  homes in this country. Historically, the home has been seen as a place of  peace, solace, warmth and love." But no more. "Once you look behind the closed  doors, you see a very violent place."  </P> <P> Home is a place where, in any given year, a number of physically aggressive  acts are likely to take place, committed by one family member against another.  It could be as mild as a push or a grab, Williams said. It could also be severe  battery, sometimes repeated, he added.  </P> <P> A common finding in family violence research, Williams said, is that children  who see violence at home tend to think it is acceptable, and grow up to  establish violence-prone families of their own. "They think it's OK for people  who love each other to hit each other," Williams said. And in many cases, when  family members kill each other, its just because the small acts of violence  have escalated into a larger one.  </P> <P> Solutions are hard to come by, said Williams. But if things don't change, "the  sanctity and privacy of the home may be in question," with societal  intervention mandated by government authority.  </P> <P> "We most often presume that that married lives are harmonious, that spouses  care for each other and that things are good or the couple wouldn't stay  together," said Julie Blackman, author of "Intimate Violence" (Columbia  University Press) and a forensic psychologist and teacher at the Eugene Lang  College of the New School for Social Research in New York. "For many that is  incorrect. For some it couldn't be more wrong."  </P> <P> Certain people don't recognize trouble because they're living it.  </P> <P> "It's hard to recognize the extent of your own suffering or to be insightful  when you are in pain," said Blackman, who added that women, especially, have a  tendency not to recognize violence in the context of intimate relationships,  even when they are suffering its effects.  </P> <P> That's because "violence is not self-defining. When people hit each other, they  provide the definition (of what's violent and what isn't) as they go along.  They say, 'I'm only doing this to you to teach you a lesson.' " The injured  person does not think of it as a violent act.  </P> <P> "People who look at battered women," for example, "think they must know that  what's been done to them is wrong," she said. "But as a culture, we don't know.  We're not singular in our response to violence. There's no separate standard  that informs us violence is bad."  </P> <P> Said Williams: "We have . . . a lot of violent themes in our culture" evidenced  even in children's cartoons. By allowing it, we signal that violence is  sometimes appropriate. "The good signal would be that it is never appropriate."  </P> <P> Mones believes that police training could be modified to help officers better  deal with the family violence they're confronted with on a daily basis. And  nonviolence training for parents would be helpful, too. "If we have driver  education, we should also have parent education."  </P> <P> "We still don't have, on a state or national level, a coherent family violence  policy," Mones said. And that is tragic, he adds, because research proves that  the whole, senseless cycle of violence is broken when people are taught there  can be another way.  </P> <P> MURDER IN U.S. VICTIMS KILLED BY:  </P> <P> Family -- 15%  </P> <P> Friend / Acquaintance -- 36%  </P> <P> Boyfriend / Girlfriend -- 4%  </P> <P> Strangers -- 12%  </P> <P> Unknown Relationship -- 33%  </P> <P> Source: FBI Uniform Crime Report, 1988.

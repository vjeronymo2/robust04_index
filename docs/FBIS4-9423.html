			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Karlo Jeger] </F>   [Text] Over a period of five years the combined military  industry of the confederation of the RH [Republic of Croatia]  and Bosnia-Herzegovina will exceed that of Serbia!    The immense military potential of the former JNA [Yugoslav  People's Army] provided the main strength for Serb conquest. But  the Serbs also derived superiority from the military industry  located in Serbia or on territory under Serb control. After the  Croat-Muslim conflicts broke out, segments of the military which  remained under control of the HVO [Croatian Defense Council] and  Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina were by contrast fragmented and  disconnected, cut off from sources of production supplies and  energy. That the linkup of these plants into a unified  technological process is a significant threat for the Serbs can  be seen from the fact that upon the first indications of  Croat-Muslim rapprochement, they carried out an air attack  against the largest factory making artillery guns in the former  Yugoslavia: Bratstvo in Novi Travnik.  <H5>  Repair of Supersonic Aircraft! </H5>   At the same time, the Bosnian-Croatian agreement opens up  possibilities for setting its own military industry in motion at  an enviable level.    On the eve of the war Croatia had almost no military  industry  at all, except for shipbuilding. Within the shipbuilding  industry we should mention the Skorpik Repair Yard in Sibenik,  the well-known large shipyards (Split, Rijeka, Pula), and the  Shipping Institute. Although in the near future it still will  not be possible to produce a missile-carrying fast attack craft  or submarine, it will be possible to make smaller vessels.  Although the public is getting very little information, or there  is hardly any mention of this at all, it has still been made  public that the initial phase of production of armament in  garages and small workshops was accomplished in Croatia long ago.    According to officially published data, the infantry weapons  put into production include industrial production of pistols  (the PHP, which stands for First Croatian Pistol, patterned  after the Walter), sniper rifles (12.7 mm and 7.9 mm, and a  third with NATO caliber), and pirated machine guns, patterned  after the Israeli Uzi. The Pleter, Sokac, and Zagi were trial  designs. An improved version of the Kalashnikov, like the  Israeli 7.62-mm Galil, is also being produced. Various mines and  explosive devices, mortars of all calibers with corresponding  mortar shells, even very modern ones, recoilless cannon and  shells, as well as portable light antiaircraft systems are also  being produced.    The level of production now achieved guarantees successful  organization of the production of other automatic and  semiautomatic infantry weapons. Hand grenades are also being  produced....    Infantry land mines (20 types) are also being produced. The  repair of supersonic aircraft and engines has also been restored  in a very short time. The same is true of the repair of cannon  and howitzers.    Nevertheless, the largest plants of the confederal military  industry possible in the future, already installed and with a  world reputation, are located in Bosnia-Herzegovina.    In Vitez the HVO is supervising perhaps Europe's largest  factory making gunpowder, rocket propellant, and explosives. The  Osa Project, whose problem was propellant, becomes realistic  with the liberation of Vitez. In the untouched plants it is  possible to begin immediately, without any lag, to produce  high-quality propellant for all types and calibers of  multiple-barrel rocket launchers, gunpowder for all types of  artillery pieces, as well as all types of explosives. Even  before the Croat-Muslim conflicts, production of gunpowder for  infantry weapons had been organized in Vitez.... The installed  capacity for manufacturing propellant for the long-range  missiles of the Orkan type in and of itself amounts to 2,000  units a year.  <H5>  A Factory Worth a Billion Dollars! </H5>   When the HVO took over the factory, there were about 4,000  finished propellant charges, which were supposed to be delivered  to Iraq, stored in the warehouses!    The value of the factory in Vitez is estimated at a billion  U.S. dollars. A complete and usable older manufacturing line for  the production of gunpowder is stored on the grounds of the  factory and could be set up very quickly. It is certain that for  a long time the Serbs will not be able to attain the  technological level of the factory at Vitez.    The HVO is also overseeing the former Soko Aircraft Factory  in Mostar. Although the Serbs withdrew some of the equipment,  with certain investments the factory could be outfitted, if not  for the production of entire aircraft, then at least to continue  production of parts for large factories in the world and  high-quality aircraft repair. In addition, many parts are still  in warehouses all over Bosnia-Herzegovina and could be used to  assemble aircraft (in Busovaca and near Tuzla...). There are  also quite a few air-to-surface missiles (RX 57 Lightning)  stored in Bosnia-Herzegovina which the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina was unable to use.    The largest factory for cannon and multiple-barrel launchers  on the territory of the former Yugoslavia is under supervision  of the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina in Novi Travnik. The RAK-12, a  copy of the Plamen, is being manufactured in Croatia. Aside from  repair of all types of artillery weapons, cannon and howitzers  of all calibers, from the 75-mm hill gun to the 155-mm howitzer,  were produced in Novi Travnik. The production of very large guns  is being prepared; equipment has been installed to machine  203-mm cannon barrels, and all types of mortars and mortar  shells are being produced. It should be mentioned that the  production of gun barrels is very important because they are  used unsparingly, and it is well-known that they wear out.  Mortars are produced, however, in Sarajevo, Tuzla, and Tesanj,  along with mortar shells.    In Travnik the Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina is also  supervising  a large repair plant for infantry weapons.    The Slavko Rodic Factory in Bugojno, which is now being  attacked by the Serbs, produces all types of fuzes, both for  artillery and also for airborne weapons. Although the Serbs have  also developed a fuze factory in Valjevo, they have been unable  to produce the most up-to-date radio fuzes. The Orkan missiles,  which have been falling around Jastrebarsko, had the poorer  electronic fuzes, which were manufactured at Krusik in Valjevo,  by contrast with those from Slavko Rodic in Bugojno.  <H5>  Ammunition for NATO </H5>   The Igman Infantry Ammunition Factory is in Konjic, buried  deep in the ground in the vicinity of an underground command  center built for the former SFRY [Socialist Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia] Presidency and JNA General Staff. The factory's  production line is newer than that of its sister, the Prvi  Partizan ammunition factory in Uzice, and it has a capacity of  several million rounds per month. The quality of this factory is  indicated by the datum that it has produced infantry ammunition  even for NATO. The steel mill in Zenica has begun to manufacture  105- and 122-mm ammunition using old cartridges.... There is a  chance that in Novi Travnik the Muslims have succeeded in  producing even Kalashnikovs, using barrels from the former  warehouses of the JNA.    Gorazde has a detonator factory, the only important segment  of the military industry which does not have its counterpart in  Serbia. In Vitkovici, near Gorazde, there is also a chemical  plant producing components for making explosives.    If we also add to the total capacity the former tank  assembly  line in Slavonski Brod, the potential of the future confederal  military industry attains an enviable level!    The steel mill in Zenica can produce armor plate, it can  make  the turret, and the engine can be bought. But it is still more  important that it can also produce fast armored vehicles....  <H5>  All the Factories in Serbia </H5>   The voluminous documentation of the UNIS Defense Production  Institute in Sarajevo has remained under control of the Croats  and Bosnian Muslims in Sarajevo. Unfortunately, the Serbs razed  to the foundations the Zrak sighting device plant in Sarajevo.    The military industry for the former JNA was designed to  produce weapons and all supplies necessary for what then was  nationwide defense, and to do so completely independently and in  virtually complete isolation. Almost all the plants of the  military industry were located in the central mountains of the  former joint state. That location was justified by the strategic  rationale of waging nationwide defensive warfare, but Serbia  then became almost completely independent and self-sufficient in  the production of armament, while the other republics were put  in the position of depending on one another for technology and  production.    For example, the plastic mounts for rocket launchers and  motors were produced at Kamnik in Slovenia, gunpowder came from  Vitez, sights from Sarajevo, rockets from Vogosca.... The final  assembly took place at Prilep in Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia].    The Slobodan Princip-Seljo Explosives Factory in Vitez  developed a technology for the production of plastic explosive  and then the entire production operation was moved to Ivangrad  in Montenegro. Up until 1992 its total capacity was quadruple  the needs of the rump "Yugoslavia." Until that time the former  federal army had wherever possible built duplicate production  facilities on the territory of Serbia and Montenegro.    For example, the "mate" of the Explosive and Gunpowder  Factory in Vitez was Prva Iskra in Baric, Serbia; the Soko  Aircraft Factory in Mostar had its counterpart in UTVA in  Pancevo; the Slavko Rodic Fuze Factory in Bugojno had Krusik in  Valjevo; the Konjic Ammunition Factory had Prvi Partizan in  Uzice; the Pyrotechnics Factory in Gorazde had Krusik in Valjevo  and Sloboda in Cacak. The "twins" of FAMOS, the engine factory  in Sarajevo, were the Motor Industry in Rakovica outside  Belgrade and FAP in Priboj.    The Zrak sighting device factory in Sarajevo was  supplemented  by the plants of Teleoptik in Belgrade.    The VMA (Military Medical Academy on Banjica) developed  medical protection, field surgery, protection against all NBC  [nuclear, biological, chemical] weapons, and all other aspects  of military medicine to meet the needs of the ground forces.    All those institutions had the most up-to-date equipment and  devices. The centrifuge at Batajnica for testing pilot behavior  under the most difficult flight conditions alone cost more than  a million dollars.    Prototypes manufactured under license, as well as those made  in our own industrial plants, and imported weapons, were also  tested not far from Belgrade -- at the Aircraft Testing Center  at Batajnica and the Ground Forces Testing Center at Nikinci in  Srem. What is more, there was also the Technical Test Center on  Prevlaka, from which the Serbs withdrew the equipment and moved  it to the Montenegrin side.  <H5>  Supersonic Plane Out of the Question! </H5>   The restructuring of the military-industrial complex of the  remainder of Yugoslavia began in the summer of 1992. But the  Serbs, although almost completely equipped with the technology,  still have not managed to restore production of all types of  weapons.    Production of the Orao airplane has been interrupted and is  no longer even mentioned. Development of a new supersonic plane  is out of the question. That was too difficult a task even for  the entire military industry of the former Yugoslavia, much less  the present Serbian industry.    Nor has production of the Gazela helicopter, the SA-341/24L,  been resumed under French license at Mostar. Informed sources  say that the Serbs are unable on their own to repair MiG-21's,  which was done in Velika Gorica although they took away most of  the machines and special tools. They have completed new  production buildings three km long at Pancevo and built a new  runway alongside the factory....    Almost all the craftsmen and engineers with a world  reputation at Soko, who in addition to meeting the needs of the  former army also worked for the largest world aircraft  corporations, like Boeing, Airbus, Dornier... have remained in  Mostar. The same is true of the repair plant in Velika Gorica.    By contrast with them, the greatest attainment of the UTVA  aircraft factory in Pancevo was the light piston plane, the  UTVA-75. Nor did the piston trainer Lasta ever go into series  production, and independent series production of jet planes is  out of the question so long as the sanctions are in place.  <H5>  Ships Under a Coat of Rust </H5>   The Serbs have not even begun to rebuild production to meet  the needs of the navy. And the ships they have in the Bay of  Kotor have a heavy coat of rust.    To meet the needs of the ground forces, in addition to the  factories that were already on their territory before war broke  out, the Serbs have managed to rebuild and replace the factories  they lost in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Most of the Serbian military  industry is located along the eastern and western Morava and in  Belgrade, and one portion is in Bosnia under supervision of  Karadzic's forces.    The Crvena Zastava plants in Kragujevac are the largest  facility of the Serbian military industry. They produce all  types of infantry weapons and antiaircraft cannon in calibers up  to 40 mm. Their most recent product is a 9-mm pistol (whose  production has been transferred to the Sartid 13 factory in  Smederevo), the 12.7-mm sniper rifle, and the 40-mm infantry  grenade launcher.    The Kragujevac automatic rifle, manufactured under the  license of the Russian AK-47, which the Croatian fighters called  the "Gypsy," is also produced there.    Krusik in Valjevo produces all types of light armor-piercing  missile systems as well as the AT-2 and AT-3 guided  armor-piercing missiles, manufactured under license, and they  were also planning to produce the AT-4. Before the war they  produced the Strela 2-M light portable antiaircraft system, and  production under license of the Igla antiaircraft system, which  is also light, was also being prepared.    The Lightning air-to-surface 128-mm missiles, which are not  guided, and the BR-1 57-mm rocket launcher are also made in  Valjevo.  <H5>  The Serbs Have No More Money! </H5>   According to unverified information, rockets for the Plamen,  Oganj, and Orkan multiple-barrel rocket launchers are also made  there.    At Lucani near Cacak all types of infantry ammunition are  made at Prvi Partizan, and gunpowder for infantry ammunition in  the plants of Milan Blagojevic. Prva Iskra of Baric is the main  producer of rocket propellant.    The Serbian military factory in Bosnia with the largest  capacity is in the UNIS plants in Vogosca, where all types and  calibers of artillery ammunition are produced.    According to foreign sources, the Serbs have managed to  restore production and repair of 100- and 125-mm tank cannon and  also the repair of all types of artillery pieces.    A recent brief communique of the Supreme National Defense  Council stated that only priority activities of vital important  to defense of the country would be financed to meet the needs of  the army, and salaries and pensions of military personnel would  be paid. All capital investments and new projects are being  halted. And the recent strike of workers in the special-purpose  section of Crvena Zastava has shown that it will be difficult  for Milosevic to fulfill his promise that the Kragujevac  factories will operate even on three shifts if necessary.    By late 1993 total Serbian industrial output had fallen to  only 30 percent of its prewar level. Half of this consisted of  wartime production to meet the needs of preserving the territory  conquered in Croatia and Bosnia and Hercegovina. Although their  effect has been gradual, the sanctions have been having a  disastrous impact, even on the Serbian military industry.    The miserly salaries, insufficient even for survival, have  resulted in large-scale departure of highly trained personnel,  mainly to countries overseas. Specialists in the numerous  military engineering institutes and factories have joined the  people with an engineering education.    Another important process is halting the development of  projects which were almost finalized and the suspension of  investments to develop new armament technology. Serbia simply no  longer has the money for that.    The immense amount of military-technical documentation  stored  in Belgrade will simply go out of date. The large amount of  knowledge about the production of weapons and military  equipment, paid for with the money of all the republics of the  former Yugoslavia, will become utterly unusable.</p>

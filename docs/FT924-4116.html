			<p>921203 FT  03 DEC 92 / International Company News: Former Salomon bond chief faces charges over bids THE US Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday charged Mr Paul Mozer, the former head of bond trading at Salomon Brothers, and Mr Thomas Murphy, his chief assistant, with submitting fraudulent bids at auctions of US government securities between 1989 and 1991. The lawsuit alleges Mr Mozer violated the anti-fraud and record-keeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when he submitted eight false bids worth Dollars 13.5bn in seven separate auctions of US Treasury securities between August 1989 and May 1991. Mr Murphy, who was the senior trader on the bond desk at the time, is accused of having been involved in three false bids. Last night, Mr Murphy denied that he had violated securities laws and said he would contest the charges vigorously, and Mr Mozer denied all the allegations except that in February 1991 two unauthorised bids were submitted in one of the auctions. Yesterday's suit represents the first legal action the government has brought against individuals involved in the Salomon scandal of August 1991, when bond traders at the Wall Street securities house were found to have faked customer bids for Treasury bills in an attempt to buy more newly issued securities than was allowed by government rules. Salomon itself settled all charges related to the scandal in May of this year, when it paid Dollars 290m in fines and compensation to the government. Mr Mozer is also charged in the civil suit with insider trading involving the sale of 46,000 Salomon shares, and with arranging false trades to create an artificial tax loss for Salomon. The fixing of false trades was allegedly conducted in 1986 with the help of individuals at other, unnamed, firms, and allowed Salomon to claim the bulk of about Dollars 168m in trading losses against taxes. The insider trading charge relates to Mr Mozer's sale of 46,000 shares of Salomon on August 6 1991. The SEC says Mr Mozer sold the shares knowing that information about the false Treasury bids would soon be released. A few days later details of the activities were released and Salomon's share prices fell sharply.</p>

			<p>930201 FT  01 FEB 93 / Management: Second thoughts about moving in - Christopher Lorenz reports on how ICI rushed to open shop for the single market but beat a quick retreat IT MUST rank as one of the most rapid corporate rethinks ever. Amid a fanfare of proclamations by its senior managers about the need to 'reshape for the single market challenge', the world's fourth largest chemicals multinational creates a new regional organisation, based in Brussels. Then, barely 16 months later, it decides quietly - although amid internal controversy - to shut it down. On the face of it, this volte-face by ICI, Britain's largest manufacturer in any industry, looks like an embarrassment of the first order. But behind the scenes the U-turn over ICI Europe, as the 60-person unit in leafy countryside near Brussels airport was called, reflects the company's new-found willingness to adjust to changing circumstances far more rapidly than in the past. By reversing its decision, ICI has done two things. First, it has recognised that it had overrated the potential demand from multinational customers - ranging from BMW to several household appliance makers - for cross-border European sales co-ordination across its various businesses. Instead, it now feels that any pan-European sales 'synergies' can be handled within individual businesses. Second, the turnaround represents the final triumph within ICI of a movement which, as in many multinationals today, was already on the rise inside the chemical company before the Brussels decision was taken: the need to speed decision-making and cut costs by streamlining the complex 'matrix' structures through which they had managed since the 1960s. Under these, control had been shared for decades between international or global product divisions (what ICI calls 'businesses'), and geographic units. The latter were either regional, as in the case of ICI Europe, or national, as with the 15 ICI country organisations whose responsibilities it was supposed largely to subsume. In September 1990, when ICI celebrated the opening of ICI Europe, a clear shift of influence towards the global businesses, away from its existing regional organisations and national companies, had already been under way since the 1970s. So, although the reasons for the creation of ICI Europe seemed powerful to those directly involved and to the outside world, it was seen elsewhere in ICI 'as being out of kilter with its time', says Bill Madden, chief executive of the group's global materials business and now ICI's top person in Brussels. The story is taken up by Trevor Gazard, who as planning manager of ICI Europe says he was 'the man who finally turned the lights out on it' last June. In line with the 'primacy' of the global businesses within ICI's power structure, he has since taken on a similar role within ICI Materials, under Madden. With hindsight, Gazard says ICI Europe 'was really a project, not a permanent organisation'. This is because its most trumpeted purpose, the creation of 'corporate coherence' towards customers in continental Europe, proved 'a bit ahead of its time', says Gazard. He says car companies, for instance, still prefer not to purchase through a single point, even if four ICI businesses supply them separately with paint, polyurethane for bumpers, advanced materials for engines, and fibres for seats. ICI is by no means the only large multinational which, in its Euro-enthusiasm, misread its customers' purchasing intentions in this way. But that is no excuse for its readiness to swallow the now mainly discredited 'supermarket' theory of business-to-business purchasing. The result was that ICI Europe's main tasks from the start actually turned out to be transitional: To establish an orderly transfer of sales activities and staff from the 15 national companies to ICI's global businesses, splitting sales staff into European sub-regions such as Benelux, Nordic and what ICI calls 'mid-Europe' (Germany, Austria and Switzerland). To support the businesses across Europe by creating half a dozen sub-regional centres for shared 'support services', such as information technology, finance, health and safety, public affairs and personnel. To streamline the old way of maintaining a 'corporate presence' in each country. By the time the chairman of ICI Europe came back to London in the summer of 1991 to report on progress, several things had happened: * Most of the first two tasks were well in hand or complete. * The business climate had changed for the worse, and ICI's profits had slumped. The Hanson group had taken a threatening stake in the company, and a desperate hunt was under way within ICI to simplify structures and cut costs. * From the beginning of 1991 the group's 14 businesses had been agglomerated into eight larger units, all with revenues of more than Pounds 1bn. 'If regional co-ordination in Europe was needed, it could be done at that level,' says Trevor Harrison, ICI's head of planning. * The role of ICI Europe 'was causing some distress to the businesses', continues Harrison. For one thing, they claimed its upkeep was affecting their European selling costs. They also 'felt that they didn't have enough control over their entire business process, from the customer right back to the factory,' explains Harrison: 'Brussels was getting in the middle.' The response from ICI's top management was to set up a study group. It decided that ICI Europe had, in effect, fulfilled much of its remit. It should be shut down, and its remaining activities split up. The provision of shared services would be transferred to the strongest business in each country or sub-region. At the same time a senior manager in each business within a country or sub-region would be selected to act as a part-time 'Mr ICI' there. The first to take on such a representative role, for the whole Nordic area, was the head of ICI Pharmaceuticals. Both these moves follow the growing tendency within other multinationals of streamlining their bureaucracies by dispersing such geographic 'head office' responsibilities among senior divisional managers on a part-time basis. But the conformity of the decision with international practice did not make it unanimous. One ICI line manager says there were complaints that 'it was handed down from HQ without adequate discussion'. The substance of the decision was opposed by the main ICI board member responsible for Europe, by the chairman of ICI Europe, and by one of the business heads. One worry was that ICI might lose continental perspective; another, that it would lose the ability to develop international managers capable of moving across businesses. Like other cross-frontier tasks within ICI today, this has become informally 'networked'. The costs saved by shutting ICI Europe are hard to estimate, since about 20 of its 60 staff have been transferred, either to the UK head office or to the businesses. More significant, Gazard says, is that its efforts cut the cost of ICI's continental support services by a fifth between 1990 and 1992. There is still at least as much again to be saved, he estimates, through streamlining within the businesses. Paradoxically, ICI's costs in mainland Europe may soon be increased slightly by a much more striking rethink than the closure of ICI Europe: the demerger of the entire group into two companies, the Zeneca bio-pharmaceutical side and the remaining five ICI businesses. Both companies will maintain the new principles of dispersing shared support services and national representation. But each company will need its own string of support centres and national ambassadors, so overheads will rise somewhat. That should be a small price to pay if it helps achieve the demerger's promised benefits. But this further rethink does underline the speed with which ICI's European structure is continuing to change. It is unlikely to be the last upheaval. This is the fifth article in the series.

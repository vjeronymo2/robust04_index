			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / BT reassures on redundancies British Telecommunications yesterday assured its workforce that it saw no need for any compulsory redundancies 'in the foreseeable future'. The group, which this year announced plans for 15,000 redundancies during its current financial year, has so far agreed 13,000 voluntary redundancies and said this year's programme was on target. Unions said they were pleased that they had been able to negotiate the redeployment of staff members who wished to stay. In August Sir Iain Vallance, BT chairman, said he was aiming to shed a further one-third of the group's workforce - 50,000 jobs - in the medium term. This week Mercury Communications, BT's biggest competitor, said it would cut 2,500 jobs.</p>

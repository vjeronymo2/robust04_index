			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 18 (CNS)--There have since 1990 been  some 100 cases under anti-dumping investigation overseas  involving China's exports, according to an official with the  Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. He added  that such accusation had adverse impacts on China's export trade  worth billions of U.S. dollars. Last year saw 37 such cases,  registering the greatest ever number in a single year. There  were 12 cases under the anti-dumping accusation during the first  quarter of this year which should arouse great concern because  such accusation from abroad targeting China's export trade have  tended to grow serious.    The United States, Canada, the European Community and  Australia were the very countries in the past to file protest  with China for its alleged dumping overseas. Other countries  including Japan, South Korea, Denmark [as received], South  Africa, Chile Brazil, Mexico and Nigeria followed suit since  1992.    The anti-dumping practice was just against a particular kind  of export item in the past but such practice turns to most of  China's export items at present. Some South America countries  such as Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela accused  China of committing alleged dumping of a certain kind of export  item in great quantity nearly in each of their anti-dumping  movements [sentence as received].    Key export items including machinery products and textiles  showed an increasing portion in the items which were alleged to  be involved in the dumping practice. Colour televisions,  microwave ovens, electric fans and bicycles were put under  anti-dumping investigation by the U.S., South Africa and the  European Community last year while preparations on anti-dumping  campaign were made by Japan, South American countries and the  European Community to target China's other export items such as  textiles, clothing and sport shoes.    Three type foreign-funded enterprises run in China tended to  be under attack for their alleged dumping practice overseas.  Nearly each anti-dumping campaign carried out abroad in recent  years involved products turned out by these enterprises. Bad  influence will be cast on the use of foreign capital by China in  a long run [sentence as received].    Accusation of dumping made by foreign countries on many  occasions mainly lied in some reasons [sentence as received].  First, a long term economic slump in Western countries, the  rising trade protectionism and being jealous of China's vast  trade surplus in recent years played an important role in such  accusation. Second, following the reform of the foreign trade  system in China, the export channels tended to increase but  administration of and control over export items which carry no  export quota nor export permit stopped short. Some enterprises'  practice of lowering prices of their products in order to  strengthen their competitiveness gave a pretext for such  accusation.</p>

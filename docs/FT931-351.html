			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: French notes rally as franc gains ground on D-Mark FRENCH government bonds rallied as the franc strengthened against the D-Mark yesterday in the wake of the expected centre-right election victory. Dealers said French bonds took encouragement as the franc strengthened to FFr3.3950 to the D-Mark, compared with FFr3.4050 before the weekend, and as short-term interest rates edged lower. The yield on the 7.5 per cent bond due 1995 moved to 7.23 per cent from its opening of 7.36 per cent. The rally was less marked at the long end, but the 10-year bond closed higher with the yield of 7.30 per cent, compared with an opening level of 7.32 per cent. One dealer noted strong buying interest later in the day on rumours that the franc may be allowed to float, which would pave the way for lower interest rates. The Matif futures contract gained 0.16 to end at 17.42 in relatively light volume. ITALIAN government bonds tumbled yesterday in response to news at the weekend that some senior Christian Democrats, including former prime minister Giulio Andreotti, may be investigated over alleged links with the Mafia. The lira's weakness against the D-Mark also depressed the bond market, and dealers reported heavy selling by foreigners. The BTP futures contract fell from Friday's close of 95.96 to 95.14. THE Bank of Spain's decision yesterday afternoon to cut its overnight rate from 14.75 per cent to 14.25 per cent added further momentum to the Spanish government bond market. Dealers said the market was already in bullish mood, helped by the French election result and the strength of the French franc. The yield on the 10-year benchmark fell from 11.50 per cent to 11.37 per cent. UK government bonds closed mixed, with the short end buoyed up by hopes of a base rate cut, while longer-dated issues slipped back ahead of tomorrow's Pounds 3bn gilt auction. Abbey National said yesterday it may be forced to raise its mortgage rate in order to be able to offer more attractive rates to savers. Dealers said Abbey National's threat led to speculation in the market that the government may cut its base rate in order to avert the risk of higher mortgage rates. AFTER last week's big losses, US Treasury prices posted solid gains across the board yesterday, despite some early weakness on overseas markets. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up at 102 31/32 , yielding 6.886 per cent. At the short end of the market prices were also firmer, with the two-year note up  1/8 at 99 27/32 , to yield 3.941 per cent. Trading in New York opened against a pessimistic background. Investors and dealers continued to speculate that this year's remarkable bond market rally  -which pushed long-term yields down to 6.7 per cent, may be over because of rising inflation. Moreover, there was considerable overnight selling in Tokyo, although that was seen primarily as a delayed reaction to last Friday's declines. Despite the gloomy backdrop, prices picked up ground from the start, amid talk that the Federal Reserve would once again step into the market and purchase coupon-bearing Treasuries outright. Dealers said that short-covering also contributed to the gains, with prices putting on a strong spurt in late afternoon. The day's economic news - a 4.6 per cent rise in new home sales, a 0.2 per cent rise in personal income, and a 0.6 per cent rise in personal spending (all from February) - was mostly ignored by the market, although the weaker-than-expected income number was said to have spurred some of the late buying. This was mainly because the news was old, and attention was fixed on the more important economic statistic out this week - the March employment report, which will be published on Friday. Yesterday, investors were cautiously optimistic that it will not prove a repeat of February's unexpectedly strong jobs report, which showed a 365,000 increase in non-farm payrolls. JAPANESE government bond futures suffered a sharp fall yesterday, prompted by a strong stock market rally. The Nikkei stock index topped 19,000 and closed at 19,048.38, its highest level in the current fiscal year and 259.68 points above its Friday close. Dealers said the recovery in the stock market - which has gained over 13 per cent since March 8 - wiped out hopes of any further easing in interest rates. 'People see the stock market rally as a sign that there is a switching of assets, out of bonds and into equities,' said one dealer, although he added that most investors were likely to hold on to their cash bond holdings until the new fiscal year starts on April 1. The futures contract opened at 108.60, reaching a high of 108.78 early in the trading session, before heavy selling pressure pushed the price down to a low of 107.93, the closing price. The fall in cash bond prices was less marked. The yield on the benchmark No 145 issue moved from 4.215 per cent at the opening to end the day at 4.28 per cent. The ministry of finance is expected to auction the April issue of 10-year government bonds this week and dealers said the coupon may rise for the first time in almost a year.</p>

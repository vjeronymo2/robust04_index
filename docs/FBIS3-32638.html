			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Division General Ulises Rosales del Toro, member of  the Politburo and first vice minister of the Revolutionary Armed  Forces [FAR], conducted a tour of Holguin Province where he was  briefed on economic and military endeavors.    The chief of the General Staff was accompanied by comrade  Francisco Garcia Ferrer, first secretary of the Communist Party  of Cuba [PCC] in Holguin, as well as other members of the  Central Committee of the PCC. The microjet banana plantations at  Limoncito in Baguano Municipality, were the first stop. Here 33  caballerias are being planted. Of these, from August to date,  almost seven have been planted. There are plans to plant 11 by  the end of February and all 33 by 26 July. Once the planting is  completed, harvesting will begin in the areas planted first. The  yield is estimated at 350,000 quintals of bananas over the next  12 months. This yield is expected given the quality of the soil,  irrigation, fertilization, and careful tending efforts. The work  force consists of a contingent of youths mobilized by the Union  of Young Communists [UJC] in the municipalities of Baguano and  Holguin. An interesting detail is that irrigation is done  entirely by gravity. The water comes from the Limoncito Dam --  five kilometers away -- which yields 6 million cubic meters a  year and was built in record time. The dam, which covers 60  hectares according to the visual estimate made by Fishing Vice  Minister Oltuski, allows for fish farming at diverse rates  according to the level of feed provided.    Ulises praised this provincial effort to significantly  increase in the near future the supply of vegetables to the  population of the provincial capital and other towns. The  general stressed the need to stabilize the labor force because  the outstanding physical conditions observed will yield the most  only if the workers, through work and technological discipline,  high morale, and willingness to win, guarantee the results by  doing every day what is required.    The next stop was the joint Sugar Industry Ministry  [Minaz]-FAR experimental plant to produce bagasse briquettes,  which are then turned into charcoal briquettes and other liquid  or gas charcoal by-products. The plant is located in the  processing center of the Fernando de Dios Mill. This guarantees  a supply of 50 tons of bagasse a day for 100 days during this  abnormally short harvest. The plant can produce briquettes at a  rate of 1 ton an hour. Likewise, the charcoal producing area is  able to produce 3 tons a day by consuming approximately 10 tons  of bagasse briquettes. The importance of the experiment is clear  to everyone because sugarcane bagasse is a renewable energy  resource which yields hundreds of thousands of tons a year. The  trick lies in how to turn its immense energy potential into an  alternative practical and economic energy source.    Rosales del Toro praised the stage of assembly of the  experimental plant and added that similar ones are being  installed at the Luis Arcos Bergnes Mill, in central Cuba, and  the Pablo Noriega Mill in western Cuba.    All this is part of an investigation carried out by the  FAR, in cooperation with Minaz, as part of the scientific and  technical tasks programmed by the national forums. Rosales went  on to say that an extraordinary military council would be held  in April during which the first secretaries of the provincial  committees will participate to analyze, among other issues, this  experiment of the Eastern Army.    Here, Garcia Ferrer [not further identified] mentioned that  the Minister of the FAR had recently pointed out that the most  advanced experiment was that of the Eastern Army.    The tour through several organic plots in Holguin City was  praised by the visiting delegation, which pointed out that this  idea has been stressed by Raul Castro, who is also in that  province, but busy with other tasks together with Ramon  Espinosa, head of the Eastern Army.    The first secretary in the Municipality, Jorge Luis Sierra,  informed them that the city has 13 organic plots, which have  either been completed or are now under construction, in 11 urban  councils. These small agricultural production centers have a  total of 1900 seed beds [calderos] and 54,000 square meters of  cultivatable soil. So far, nine varieties of vegetables are  being cultivated, most of which is lettuce because it is in high  demand. The products harvested are sold everyday. The population  can purchase the lettuce directly from the organic plot for 1  peso a head. Different methods have been established to pay the  wages of the workers at the plots, paying each worker according  to his effort and productivity.    The water used for irrigation at the organic plots is  generally extracted from wells built for that purpose. In some  cases, the water is pumped with the use of windmills in other  cases the old fashioned method is used: rope and buckets. Only  two organic plots use water from the aqueducts because water has  not been found in the subsoil.    Brief conversations were held with the administrators of the  two organic plots visited. These administrators do manual labor  when necessary. Their salaries are also linked to the  productivity of their organic plots. Teresa Saldivar, an  agronomy technician, manages one of those plots. The volume of  sales in January was of 13,000 pesos. The cost per peso is less  than 50 cents. Felix Perez is another one of the administrators  with whom they spoke. He is not a professional but is in fact a  technician that studied in life's university; from being a  leader of the Federation of Secondary School Students, to his  internationalist mission in Angola, and his peasant origin.    Francisco Ferrer, the first secretary of the party in  Holguin, stated that their accomplishments were small when  compared to their goal: 300,000 square meters of plots in the  provincial capital. By when? As soon as possible.</p>

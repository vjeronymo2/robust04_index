			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / The Breakup of ICI: Shareholders react with glee SHAREHOLDERS in ICI yesterday reacted gleefully to the news that the bio-sciences businesses will be spun off into a new company. They said the move was even more aggressive than they had hoped for. 'It's good news for shareholders,' said Mr John Thompson, director of UK equities at Standard Life. The demerger, mooted in meetings last summer with Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, as one option for improving value for shareholders, was broadly welcomed by shareholders as a mechanism to allow the companies mushrooming pharmaceuticals business to flourish unfettered. In earlier discussions, ICI directors had hinted that they planned to demerge no more than the pharmaceuticals business, so the extent of the demerger caused surprise. However, shareholders generally agreed that the new business groupings were sensible. 'The structure has been ridiculous,' said one shareholder. 'Not so long ago, the man in charge of pharmaceuticals was also in charge of paint production. So he had to look at the salaries of paint workers in Slough as well as one of the most complex businesses in the world.' Had ICI not spun off the bio-sciences businesses, they would likely have withered under the company's enormous bureaucracy and diverse product mix. Even if the two individual companies were no better managed than the current conglomerate, investors said there was still likely to be improvement in share prices simply because markets can more accurately value shares of companies in single industries than those of conglomerates. Shareholders pointed hopefully to the share price performance of Courtaulds' two business segments since they were separated in 1990. Shares in both companies have significantly outperformed the FT-A All-Share index and ICI investors are hoping for more of the same. However, while euphorically watching the share price soar 76p to close at 1171p - adding roughly Pounds 800m to the company's share capital - shareholders had some concerns about exactly how the demerger would work. 'I really want to know how much this is going to cost,' said one leading shareholder. 'Advisers can be fairly rapacious in deals like this.' The concern is that fees and the costs of business restructuring may, at least in the early years, outweigh added returns to shareholders. Shareholders are also anxious to see details of the bio-science companies' planned capital raising exercise and plans for spending the new funds. It is expected that the fresh capital will be used to reduce debt shifted to the bio-sciences division from the industrial division.</p>

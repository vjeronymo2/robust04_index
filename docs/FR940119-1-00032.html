			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Background <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> The RSPA has been concerned for some time with the issue of more rapid leak detection on hazardous liquid pipelines, and the optimum placement of EFRDs to limit commodity release after the location of the release in the hazardous liquid pipeline has been identified. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 203 of the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act (codified at 49 U.S.C. app. &sect;2002(n)) as amended by the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (the 1992 Act) (Pub. L. 102&hyph;508) mandated the Secretary, within two years of enactment, to conduct a survey and assess the effectiveness of emergency flow restricting devices (EFRDs) and other procedures, systems, and equipment used to detect and locate hazardous liquid pipeline ruptures and minimize product releases from hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. The 1992 amendments further mandated that the Secretary issue regulations within two years of completion of the survey and assessment. These regulations would prescribe the circumstances under which operators of hazardous liquid pipelines would use EFRDs and other procedures, systems, and equipment to detect and locate pipeline ruptures and minimize product release from pipeline facilities. The Secretary has delegated this authority to the Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA) (See 49 CFR 1.53). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Also, the Department's March 1991 report titled ``Emergency Flow Restricting Devices Study'' contained proposals that we seek public input on the placement of EFRDs in urban areas, at water crossings, at other critical areas affected by commodity release, and areas in close proximity to the public outside of urban areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This ANPRM solicits public input for the survey process mandated by the 1992 Act as well as the proposals from the Department's 1991 EFRD study. The ANPRM requests information and data by posing a series of questions. This approach is utilized rather than conducting a traditional research survey of a selected number of respondents in order to obtain a broader base of data and to accelerate the regulatory process. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=2 --> Notice on Highly Volatile Liquids_1978 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> In 1978, the RSPA issued an NPRM (43 FR 39402; September 5, 1978) proposing requirements intended to limit spillage from hazardous liquid pipelines carrying highly volatile liquids (HVL) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in inhabited areas by requiring installation of remotely controlled valves (RCVs) <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or automatically controlled valves (ACVs). <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  This proposal was later withdrawn (46 FR 2130; January 8, 1981) because hazardous liquid pipeline industry studies demonstrated that placement of closely spaced valves over the full length of an HVL pipeline was not a reasonable method of reducing the effects of an accident. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 1 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``HVL'' is defined in 49 CFR 195.2 as a hazardous liquid which will form a vapor cloud when released to the atmosphere and which has a vapor pressure exceeding 276 kPa (40 psia) at 37.8 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C (100 <!-- PJG 0017 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F). The commodities included in the term ``HVL'' are LPG, anhydrous ammonia, and certain natural gas liquids. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 2 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An RCV is any valve which is operated from a location remote from where the valve is installed. The location is usually at the pipeline control or dispatching center. The linkage between the pipeline control center and the RCV may be by fiber optics, microwave, telephone lines, or satellite. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An ACV is any valve which automatically closes in response to a rate of pressure drop or flow rate in the pipeline which exceeds a preset level. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Mounds View Accident <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A July 8, 1986, accident on a gasoline pipeline focused interest on EFRDs. The accident, caused by a ruptured pipe seam on a gasoline pipeline in Mounds View, Minnesota, resulted in two deaths, one injury, and property damage well in excess of $1,000,000. The accident was exacerbated by backflow or draining from the pipeline after the manually operated valves on either side of the ruptured section were closed. The spill ignited approximately 20 minutes after the rupture. It took the pipeline operator over 1 hour and 40 minutes from the time of the rupture to isolate the ruptured section. Since this accident, the pipeline company installed a computerized leak-detection system and RCVs on either side of Mounds View (a distance of about 5.7 miles). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Advance Notice on Certain Safety Proposals_1987 <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In 1987, as a result of the same accident, the RSPA again addressed RCVs and ACVs in an ANPRM (52 FR 4361; February 11, 1987). This ANPRM invited public comment on the merit of certain safety proposals advanced by Congress, the Minnesota Commission on Pipeline Safety, and the National Transportation Safety Board. One safety proposal was to convert shutoff valves required by the pipeline safety regulations on existing pipelines to RCVs or ACVs, and require similar valves on new pipeline construction. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

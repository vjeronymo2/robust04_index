			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Food &amp; Drink (The French Connection): A Catalan transformation - As France prepares for its summer invasion of Britons, Weekend FT writers have been gathering news and views from its regions What makes someone with a future, a steady income and a secure job with sociable working hours, give it all up to become a restaurateur? As I still cannot explain why I did just that, I put the question to Jean-Marie Pujade, who has opened a second restaurant, this time in Paris. Such was the level of background noise from his busy venture, barely six months old, that I had to call him back three times. Thirteen years ago, Pujade was an architect in his native Perpignan, geographically in south-west France but culturally, spiritually and gastronomically part of Catalonia, the region that encompasses north east Spain and France's Roussillon, and which looks to Barcelona as its capital. He was, however, growing increasingly disenchanted with his architectural commissions and, in a sharp change of direction, became a nightclub owner. There, food in the form of tapas and other small dishes was served, nominally to soak up the alcohol. But, like me, Pujade began to enjoy serving food to the paying public. In my case, memories of Jewish family cooking were rekindled: in Pujade's it was the Catalan cooking of his grandmother. In September 1986, one of Perpignan's oldest restaurants, La Casa Sansa, which opened in the early 1890s, was for sale. In spite of a distinguished history - I was told about a local tax inspector who had eaten lunch there every day of his working life for 40 years - it was in need of Pujade's architectural skills. A deep, gloomy beige on the walls and unflattering ceiling lights were not going to appeal to the clientele of the 1980s. Working 15 hours a day, Pujade transformed the place into a Catalan brasserie. Today, the dining room is much lighter, the walls covered in an eclectic mixture of prints, photographs and posters which, naturally, incorporate Picasso and Dali, and around the open bar is a collection of model wooden ships. Pujade has solved the problem of communication between the restaurant and kitchen by simply carving a hole in the wall, through which orders, dishes and chefs move easily. The service is fast and friendly, supervised by an elegantly dressed woman, who appeared completely in control. While there can be no doubting the courage involved in Pujade's mid-life career change, his timing has been impeccable. So many of the basics of Catalan cooking - garlic, olive oil, vegetables, fish and non-fatty grilled meats, such as chicken and rabbit, - are currently fashionable. La Casa Sansa's menu incorporates them all. We began our meal with thick, grilled asparagus served with a very garlicky aioli. Calcots, a large, local, spring onion, also grilled, was accompanied by a slightly watery romesco sauce. This was followed by quickly sauteed fresh, young squid and escalivade, a simple but filling dish of roasted aubergines, peppers, onions and tomatoes, drenched with olive oil. Then on to a plethora of fresh fish with an appetising white wine from Bernard Vaquer. A plate of thick gambas prawns, was served grilled accompanied by Rivesaltes, a local fortified wine. A parillade de poissons included monkfish, cod and bream. A rather evil-looking, but delicious-tasting, cassolette de la mer was thickened and enriched with almonds. Finally, and fittingly, we were brought creme catalane, a cross between creme caramel and creme brulee, strong coffee and a bill of less than Pounds 20 per person. Sensible pricing is another of Pujade's skills. Behind us a table of six sat down to the FFr48 (Pounds 5.60) two-course menu du jour. They began with a thick vegetable soup and then did battle with a large plate of costellou, a Catalan dish that incorporates various cuts of pork. (The menu du jour in Paris is FFr78, but menus and wine lists are the same in both restaurants). If I was unable to find an exact answer as to what had lured Pujade into the restaurant business I would not let him return to his customers without telling me why he had made the successful 900km leap from Perpignan to Paris. He replied, with typical Catalan pride: 'Firstly, because Paris is the world's capital of good taste - after Barcelona, of course. As to its success, Parisians love the food but coming to my restaurant here brings back for many of them happy memories of holidays in Catalonia.' La Casa Sansa, 43, Rue des Mathurins, Paris 75008.

Instead of  burning fires in the streets, the people in the southeast  preferred to mark Nevruz by staying at home. One of the rare  Nevruz fires in Diyarbakir was lighted by Unal Erkan, the  regional governor. Our correspondent Metin Corabatir reports on  Nevruz celebrations in southeastern Anatolia.    [Begin Corabatir recording] The Nevruz holiday is being  (?marked) without incident but also (?without enthusiasm)  [brief break in transmission]. At present, the smoke from  Nevruz fires is rising in various quarters of the city. The  first Nevruz fires in Diyarbakir were lit in the outlying  quarters in the morning.    The people were again caught in the middle as the government  encouraged this year's Nevruz celebrations under specific  conditions and the PKK [Kurdish Workers Party] called on the  people to mark it in their homes. That the people were caught  in the middle was clear from the fact that instead of dancing  around the few fires, the people closed their shops and stayed  at home.    Unal Erkan exerted enormous effort to put his own cosmetic  touch on Nevruz celebrations in Diyarbakir, where two PKK  militants were killed in a morning attack on a hideout. He  first visited the newspapers and informed them that the holiday  was passing peacefully and without incident throughout the  region. He then visited the central market accompanied by a  large group of reporters. He shook hands and listened to  people's problems. He then left for Sehitlik Street, which he  described as his own street, and distributed candies to hundreds  of children who surrounded him. He danced with them. The fire  lighted by Erkan was one of the rare city fires around which  people danced. [end recording]</p>

The solution is then mixed  with polytetrafluoroethylene and loaded in an autoclave at  150C for 24 hours. After the treated solution is cooled to  room temperature, white SnO[.sup]2[/] powder is obtained. The  powder is washed thoroughly, baked at 150C for 24 hours,  and then pressed into a plate under a pressure of  10[.sup]5[/] kg/cm[.sup]2[/]. The initial particle size of  the specimen is 3 nm. After annealing at different temperatures,  nanoscale SnO[.sup]2[/] powders of different particle sizes  are obtained. The powder crystal structure belongs to the rutile  type, and there is less than 1 percent of impurities in the  powder.    The Raman spectrum is measured with a U.S. SPEX-1403 laser  Raman spectrometer. The excitation light is the 514.5-nm line  from an argon-ion laser. The backscatter configuration is  adopted. All measurements are conducted at room temperature.    Figure 1 shows that the peaks in the Raman spectra are of  two  different groups: the peaks in one group, called mode A,  correspond with the peaks in the monocrystalline or  polycrystalline SnO[.sup]2[/] spectra. The Raman spectrum  peaks with wave numbers of 472, 632, and 773 cm[.sup]-1[/]  are designated as A[.sup]1[/], A[.sub]2[/], and  A[.sup]3[/], respectively. In the other group, called mode B,  the peaks with wave numbers of 358 and 572 cm[.sup]-1[/] are  designated as B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sub]2[/], respectively.  The mode-B peaks do not exist in the monocrystalline or  polycrystalline SnO[.sup]2[/] Raman spectra. This observation  indicates that the appearance of B[.sup]1[/] and  B[.sup]2[/] peaks is caused by the nanoscale effect.   <FIG ID=JPRS-CST-002C-17A>           Figure 1. Raman Spectra of Different Nanoscale SnO[.sup]2[/] Solids </FIG>     All the peak intensities in Figure 1 are normalized  according  to the intensity of peak A[.sup]2[/]. As shown in Figure 1,  the intensity ratios of the peaks in mode B to the peaks in mode  A increase rapidly with decrease in crystal size. This  observation is similar to the phenomenon wherein surface-atom  fractions rapidly increase with decrease in crystal size. We  assume that the B[.sup]1[/] and B[.sub]2[/] peaks are  caused by the surface phonon modes and are closely related to  the A[.sup]1[/] and A[.sub]2[/] peaks. This experiment  shows that the frequencies of the B[.sup]1[/] and  B[.sup]2[/] peaks are lower than those of the A[.sub]1[/]  and A[.sup]2[/] peaks. The appearance of the low-frequency  surface phonon modes is induced by the relaxation among the  surface atoms. This relaxation weakens the interaction among the  surface atoms, and consequently reduces the surface force  coefficient.    Calculations based on the Raman spectra of nanoscale solid  materials are expected to generate the specific positions of the  nanoscale surface atoms.

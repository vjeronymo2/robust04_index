			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Survey of World Nuclear Industry (9): Away from the fast lane - Japan's expansion plan is proving too ambitious JAPAN rarely misses its economic and industrial targets, but it may fall well short of its objective of adding 40,000MW of nuclear capacity between now and 2010. The target, announced by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry at the start of the 1990s, was remarkably bold, but also ominous because of concern over placing so much nuclear capacity in an island nation only a little larger than the British Isles but twice as crowded. Japan's electricity industry, dominated by 10 private regional utilities, has so far towed the MITI line, although many executives now admit that the plan is too ambitious. Equipment exporters, such as General Electric and Westinghouse of the US, which control the licensing for much of the turbine technology used by the Japanese nuclear industry, welcome the potential bonanza, but also expect it to be scaled back over the next two decades. Nevertheless, MITI, and its partner organisation, the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, is sticking to its guns. Japan's nuclear emphasis dates from the Middle East oil prices crises of the 1970s, and its power stations' very high dependence on imported oil, coal and liquefied natural gas. Along with some hydroelectric and pumped storage, the nuclear option would insure against any further upheavals among its chief fuel suppliers. At present, Japan has more than 42 nuclear power stations, with a combined capacity of 35,000MW. Output is 212 terawatt hours (twh), which means that nuclear supplies nearly 30 per cent of all Japan's electricity. Japan is third on a world scale behind the US, with 110 plants, 105,000MW, generating 612 twh; and France whose 54 plants with a capacity of 57,600MW produce 314 twh. The MITI plan calls for 50,000MW by 2000 and 72,500MW by 2010. A certain degree of reality is making itself felt, and the country's utilities now expect a target of 45,000MW by 2000 to be more realistic. A total of 10 nuclear power stations are being built or awaiting construction. Given Japan's fairly fast installation deadline of five years per unit, this means that the modified target looks reachable. Beyond that, however, authorities admit to having much difficulty in establishing sites for new nuclear units. All reactors are at coastal sites - some utilities, such as Tokyo Electric Power Co, Japan's largest with more than a third of all electricity capacity  -operate several nuclear units outside their own service area. In addition, Japan's anti-nuclear lobby has become more effective in sounding alarms against the dangers of too much nuclear. Given the recent change of government, say Japanese energy officials, the anti-nuclear arguments will be more strongly felt, and this will stall clearance of new sites. On top of this, the outcome of the Gulf conflict and the recent Israeli-Palestinian peace accord are seen as having a long-term stabilising effect on Middle East oil prices. While Japan's nuclear programme is likely to fall behind schedule, it is pressing ahead with a long-term partner scheme to develop a full nuclear fuel cycle to give Japan a capacity to undertake nuclear power production with minimal recourse to overseas suppliers, either in terms of equipment or uranium. The first sign of this is the Rokkasho Mura uranium enrichment facility, the first phase of which opened in Aomori Prefecture in northern Japan in March 1992. A nuclear fuel reprocessing facility is to start operating by 2000, according to plans. In line with this, Japan is developing new types of 'breeder' reactors, now at an experimental stage, which would save on uranium imports. The first demonstration Monju fast breeder reactor (FBR) is expected to start operating by 2000. An advanced thermal demonstration reactor (ATR) will be constructed in Ohma-cho, Aomori Prefecture, and will start operating in 2002. It is doubtful that any type of commercial version of the FBR-ATR reactor will be generating electricity before 2010, after the current expansion timetable has passed. Japan's expressed determination to press ahead with its multi-faceted nuclear programme has sparked wide controversy, not least because of the world glut of uranium. This surplus, like that of oil, could slow down Japan's nuclear expansion.</p>

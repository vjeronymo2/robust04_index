			<p>BFN     [Text] In 1993, citizens of former Soviet republics  committed more than 15,000 crimes in Russia, compared to 530 in  1992, Head of the Central Criminal Investigation Department  Lieutenant-General Vladimir Kolesnikov said during a briefing on  Tuesday.    Kolesnikov said that the number of crimes committed by  citizens of countries other than the former Soviet republics had  also increased more than 4 times. Many foreigners have fallen  victim to crime.    About 20 percent of the crimes are committed against  foreigners who come to Russia on business, 20 per cent against  foreign tourists and 13 percent against foreign visitors who  arrive in Russia on private invitations.    In 1993, 311 crimes were committed against Finnish citizens,  304 against Germans and 109 against British citizens. In 1994,  more than 4,500 crimes were committed against foreign citizens.    Kolesnikov announced that the Interior Ministry had drafted  new rules for foreign citizens' stay in Russia, and a law on  foreign citizens. Both documents are being considered by the  State Duma.</p>

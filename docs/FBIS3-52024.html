FRAPH Organization  Secretary Emmanuel Constant considers this decision a complement  to the international embargo imposed on Haiti. Constant  denounces this decision which he labels political  thoughtlessness that will have bad consequences on the lives of  the middle classes and the urban and rural masses. According to  the FRAPH organization secretary, the businessmen, wealthy  shopkeepers, have decided to close the country of Dessalines  [Haitian liberator]:    [Begin recording] Today, the situation is grave because  enemies of the nation, businessmen, wealthy shopkeepers have  decided to block the evolution of the national majority. In  fact, they adopted a unilateral measure. They have decided to  shut down the country of Dessalines. What about the poor negroes  whose fathers are still in Africa? They will get nothing.    FRAPH is asking questions about this stand by the Haitian  employers, and demands explanations as to the ambiguity of such  behavior and the gravity of its consequences. FRAPH considers  this measure a supplement to the international embargo enforced  by President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whereas the businessmen,  the mainspring of the Haitian economy, should direct their  efforts -- in a joint nationalistic spirit of patriotic concern,  with the courageous Haitian people, the vital forces of the  country -- to the application of a war economy in order to  alleviate the sufferings of the nation.    No, gentlemen shopkeepers: Together with the Haitian people,  the middle classes, the soldiers, the peasant class, we in FRAPH  say no. No, gentlemen shopkeepers: The Haitian people have been  misled too often, have been humiliated too often. We must...  [changes thought] it is not our responsibility to inflict this  on them. FRAPH therefore launches a call for calm among all  sectors of the nation, but especially invites the low-wage  earners, the small merchants, the worthy elements of the middle  class, the lucid elements, the class... [changes thought] the  employees of the public administration, and the Haitian people  to keep cool. [end recording]</p>

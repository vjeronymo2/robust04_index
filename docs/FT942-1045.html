			<p>940625 FT  25 JUN 94 / Californian vote on immigrants Illegal immigrants in California will be denied public education, healthcare and other services if the state accepts an initiative which will be on ballot papers in November. It would also require police, teachers and healthcare workers to report suspected illegal immigrants to federal authorities. The outcome of the vote might point the way for other US states, such as Florida and New York, which also have many illegal aliens, Jeremy Kahn writes from Washington. Californian state officials confirmed that backers of the proposal - called the Save Our State initiative - had collected more than the 600,000 signatures necessary to put the issue to a state-wide referendum. Governor Pete Wilson of California, the incumbent Republican who is running for re-election in November but trails in the opinion polls, endorsed the initiative last week. Mr Wilson's Democratic opponent, Ms Kathleen Brown, opposes the proposal, as do various prominent civil rights and Latino groups. These critics have labelled the initiative discriminatory and racist, as it primarily targets Hispanic and Asian minorities. They have promised to challenge the proposal on constitutional grounds if it wins a majority.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: COUNTYWIDE;  </P> <P> LOW-FLUSH TOILET MODELS ARE DISPLAYED  </P> <P> In parched Ventura County, it just may be that the ultra-low flush toilet,  which uses 1.6 gallons or less of water per flush, has replaced real estate as  the favorite topic of cocktail-party conversation.  </P> <P> At a recent forum sponsored by the Ventura County Water Conservation Program,  Etablissements Porcher, a French manufacturer, even introduced an ultra-low  flush toilet for the status-minded.  </P> <P> Called the Veneto, the unit "flushes efficiently on only 1 1/2 gallons" and  "can save a family of four 25,000 gallons of water a year," according to the  company's sales brochure.  </P> <P> A Veneto model on display came in coraline, a salmon-like hue, and had  gold-plated brass fittings.  </P> <P> The price: $1,000, plus installation.  </P> <P> In all, 18 models of water-stingy toilets, ranging in retail price from about  $100 upward, were on display in the Camarillo Community Center.  </P> <P> The manufacturers all claimed that the units will satisfy the Ventura city  rationing law that requires residents to install ultra-low flush toilets and  other water-saving devices before they can apply for increased allotments.  Above-average-size families and homes with toilets using 3.5 gallons or less  per flush may be exempted from the retrofitting requirement at the May 7  meeting.  </P> <P> Most experts agree that the toilet is the No. 1 water user in U.S. homes --  accounting for at least 25% of most families' usage. In contrast to the  ultra-low flush units, which were introduced in Sweden in 1973, the vast  majority of American toilets use from 3 to 7 gallons per flush.  </P> <P> Wendy L. Corpening, a plumbing industry consultant, told about 150 local  officials, plumbing contractors and others that about 1 million ultra-low flush  toilets have been installed in U.S. bathrooms. This year, she said, U.S.  manufacturers are expected to produce 2.4 million more.  </P> <P> There are two basic ultra-low flush systems: gravity feed, a redesigned version  of the conventional toilet, and the turbo type, which combines air and water  pressure and is usually activated by pressing a button on the tank lid. The  turbo types tend to be noisier and more expensive, but they're more effective  than gravity units.  </P> <P> One audience member at the Camarillo forum, Andy Lyskin, of Vic's Plumbing  Supply Co. in Ventura, suggested that the city of Ventura should offer rebates  to residents replacing older toilets, as the cities of Los Angeles and Santa  Monica have done.  </P> <P> Another member of the audience noted that a tank dam, a plastic object to  reduce the amount of water flowing into a toilet tank, costs only about $6.95.  "They don't always work, but they're better than nothing," a panelist said.  </P> <P> And, at no cost at all, Ventura city residents can fill plastic bags with water  and put them in toilet tanks. City spokeswoman Carol Green said Friday that  "boxes and boxes" of the free bags have been given away at City Hall. The city  has also given away at least 6,000 low-flow shower heads, she said.

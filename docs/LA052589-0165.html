			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SOUTH PASADENA;  </P> <P> SENATE OKS FREEWAY BLOCK  </P> <P> A bill approved by the Senate on Monday to raise the state's gasoline tax 10  cents a gallon includes an amendment by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) that  could block efforts to build the Long Beach Freeway through South Pasadena.  </P> <P> The bill, by Sen. Quentin Kopp (I-San Francisco), was approved by a 27-11  margin and now goes to the Assembly, where further negotiations are expected on  the controversial gas tax proposal.  </P> <P> One lawmaker who is close to the issue, but who asked not to be identified,  said he doubts that the Torres amendment will remain in the measure, partly  because of opposition in the Assembly.  </P> <P> The one-paragraph provision inserted into the 28-page bill would prohibit the  state from spending its funds on any state highway in Los Angeles County built  through a historically significant site or through parks or recreation areas.  Several routes that have been proposed for the freeway through South Pasadena  would either require moving historic buildings or would cut through a parkland.  </P> <P> Torres has said his goal is to force transportation planners to consider  alternatives, including a light-rail line, increased utilization of surface  streets or another freeway route.  </P></p>

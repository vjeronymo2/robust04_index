			<p>920514 FT  14 MAY 92 / International Company News: TWA and American redraft hub slot terms TRANS World Airlines, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, has renegotiated a deal with American Airlines, the much larger Dallas-based carrier. It involves the sale of TWA's landing slots and gates at Chicago's O'Hare airport. The deal was originally part of a larger asset sale package agreed between the two airlines in late 1990. The Chicago slots and gates were to be sold by TWA for Dollars 70m, and the airline said it would shift operations to Midway Airport, Chicago's second airport. Under the new arrangements, the sale price for the 40 landing slots and three gates comprises a Dollars 500m zero-coupon note payable in monthly instalments over 20 years. TWA is still talking of moving to Midway. However, under the new deal, it also retains the right to use one of the gates. Neither American nor TWA had any immediate explanation for the changed structure of the deal. TWA, whose operating losses in the first quarter of this year were almost Dollars 100m, has faced opposition to previous asset sales transactions in the bankruptcy court - notably from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federal agency which has argued that sale proceeds should be used first to repair TWA's pension plan deficit. The new agreement is subject to various closing conditions.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Prague, June 16 (CTK) -- Attacks against the  post-war decrees issued by President Edvard Benes and a campaign  conducted against the completion of the Lidice monument were  linked to "the dangerous manifestations of covert or even overt  support for fascism" by Miroslav Grebenicek today.    In his statement given to CTK, Grebenicek, chairman of the  Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), said that the way  in which Benes was being attacked and scandalized "is too  reminiscent of the rhetoric of Adolf Hitler and Czech  collaborators (with fascism)." "We reject resolutely any  challenging of the results of World War Two because similar  steps would be not only an offense to the millions of victims of  fascism, but a dangerous step leading to the destabilization of  the whole of Europe as well," the statement says.    It warns that he who "supports the attacks (against the  Benes  decrees) threatens our national identity and opens up the road  towards unlimited property restitution which would lead to the  total collapse of not only the economy, but all social life in  the Czech Republic."    Under the decrees, some 2.5 [million] Sudeten Germans were  expelled from Czechoslovakia and their property was confiscated.  The Sudeten German Landsmannschaft has now been claiming the  property and the recognition of the right to homeland. [passage  omitted]</p>

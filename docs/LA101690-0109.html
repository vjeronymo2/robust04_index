			<p><P> October 16, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> POLICE REVISE ACCOUNT OF SHOOTING BY OFFICERS  </P> <P> Glendale police on Monday changed their account of an officer-involved  shooting, saying that police, and not an elderly man, fired the first shot in  an exchange that critically wounded the 85-year-old Glendale resident.  </P> <P> A Los Angeles County sheriff's shooting reconstruction team was summoned Monday  to the Glendale home where three police officers shot Albert Levinson Rackin,  who had reportedly threatened them with a flare gun Friday night.  </P> <P> Glendale police Sgt. Peter A. Michael said the deputies were hired to help  police supervisors interpret how the exchange of gunfire took place.  </P> <P> Michael said Glendale police will finish their internal probe within two weeks,  then report to the district attorney's office, which will decide whether to  conduct its own investigation.  </P> <P> Rackin, who lived alone in a small rental house in south Glendale, had been  described Saturday by police as being in his mid-60s. He remained in critical  condition Monday at Glendale Memorial Hospital, said hospital spokesman Bryan  Bishop. Police said he was shot several times in the upper torso.  </P> <P> Rackin's neighbors called paramedics because he appeared to be suffering from  diabetes-related problems, Michael said. The paramedics who arrived at the home  called police when Rackin threatened them with the flare gun.  </P> <P> Officers said they confronted Rackin at the door of the house, but he refused  to drop the weapon.  </P> <P> Glendale police initially reported that officers fired after Rackin shot at  them. But Michael said further investigation determined that police fired first  "to protect one of the officers" when Rackin moved toward the policeman.  </P> <P> After the officers fired, Rackin discharged the flare gun, but the round landed  behind police, Michael said.  </P> <P> The officers who fired their weapons were identified Monday as Sgt. Don  Meredith, an 18-year veteran of the department and officers Stephen Robertson  and Robert Breckenridge, who have each been with the department for three  years.  </P> <P> Michael said the department had not yet determined Monday which officer shot  first and how many rounds were fired.  </P></p>

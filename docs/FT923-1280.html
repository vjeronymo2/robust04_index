			<p>920924 FT  24 SEP 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Commission wheels out its 'big guns' THE European Commission yesterday launched a strong counter-attack against the barrage of accusations of bureaucratic meddling and power-grabbing. Senior officials fear the growing criticism could presage the Commission's emasculation, or at least damaging legislative paralysis. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, was described by a senior official as feeling 'distinctly bruised' yesterday after Chancellor Helmut Kohl, hitherto the Commission's most powerful ally, hinted late on Tuesday that Brussels' powers may have to be curbed. Commissioners, who devoted their weekly meeting yesterday to discussing the Maastricht treaty crisis, reacted immediately, by wheeling out two of their 'big guns' to defend Brussels' role in the EC. Mr Martin Bangemann, the German commissioner in charge of the internal market, used the pretext of a mundane piece of single market legislation - on the technical harmonisation of motorcycles - to defend Brussels' mission. 'In normal circumstances I wouldn't bore you with such a directive,' he told journalists, but 'the work done by EC institutions has constantly to be explained.' This was a perfect example of 'subsidiarity' he argued - which in his view meant action taken 'at the most appropriate level.' This was a case, he said 'where only European legislation can solve the problem.' Despite Mr Bangemann's confident exposition, he himself sought the endorsement of the 12 internal market ministers on Tuesday, even though they gave their go-ahead to the principle of technical harmonisation in June. Some of Mr Bangemann's Commission colleagues had challenged the measure, fearing it might be portrayed as meddling. Increasingly demoralised officials believe, however, that this sort of cap-in-hand posture will rebound on the Commission, which under EC rules has the sole right to propose legislation. 'If you get into a totally apologetic, nervous state, people will begin to assume that you have a case to answer,' said one senior Commission official. 'Soon we will be asking for permission to go to the toilet.' Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior commissioner who runs competition policy, joined the fray last night, warning against the danger of 'Eurosclerosis' again taking hold. 'We must not abandon all policymaking in the face of anxiety, and the fear of one political hurdle after another,' he said. He appealed for renewed confidence between the member states and EC institutions. 'It is time to stop mutual recrimination and abandon the search for scapegoats. The common interest is too important for such futilities.' A test of the Commission's own dwindling confidence should come soon, when it has to decide whether to recommend further liberalisation of EC telephone monopolies.</p>

			<p>940607 FT  07 JUN 94 / Health climbdown on coal sell-off The government announced a significant climbdown on coal privatisation yesterday when it said it would retain responsibility for health and injury claims resulting from service with British Coal before privatisation. Its decision, confirmed by Lord Strathclyde, a trade and industry minister, follows pressure from potential buyers of the corporation who said they would be deterred from bidding unless the government capped the illness liabilities. Yesterday's announcement leaves outstanding differences between the government and prospective bidders over other liabilities including subsidence and pollution. However, the illness issue was the most significant of the differences. Previously the government had suggested that new owners of the industry would have to pick up the entire bill for future claims even if some of the illness related to a period when the worker was in British Coal's employment.</p>

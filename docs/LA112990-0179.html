			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT / WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAIDERS;  </P> <P> SCHROEDER SAYS HE'LL BE READY FOR BRONCOS  </P> <P> Jay Schroeder took his normal rotation at quarterback in Wednesday's practice  and reported that his sprained left knee should not keep him from starting  Sunday's game against the Broncos at Denver.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt in my mind," Schroeder said.  </P> <P> "It feels real good, and I've still got a few more days. When Sunday rolls  around, I think it will feel real good."  </P> <P> Raider Coach Art Shell said Schroeder probably will start, based on Wednesday's  practice. But Shell said he would decide Friday.  </P> <P> Shell said earlier there was a chance Steve Beuerlein would be activated for  the first time this season as security, but that Vince Evans would be the first  quarterback off the bench.  </P> <P> Receiver Tim Brown was limited to light duty Wednesday because of an ankle  sprain suffered in Sunday's 27-24 loss to Kansas City. . . . Defensive tackle  Mike Charles was excused from the workout to attend the funeral of his  grandmother. . . . Tight end Mike Dyal, on injured reserve, has returned to the  team after visiting his sick father in Texas over the weekend. CHRIS DUFRESNE  </P></p>

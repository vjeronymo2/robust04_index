How true is this and what is the reason for the arrests?    [Khalifah] [passage omitted] What we know so far is that one  of the brothers in the Suwaylih branch of the Islamic  Brotherhood was arrested. His name is 'Abd- al-Majid Dayah and  he is an engineer. Everything I know about him is good.    Another person, named 'Abd-al-Majid Ibrahim al-Majali, is  one  of the brothers in the Muslim Brotherhood of al-Qasr in  al-Karak. He was questioned a few months ago when he wanted to  leave Jordan in order to join the ranks of the mujahidin against  the communists in Afghanistan. He was held for some time on  charges of carrying an amount of money to help the mujahidin in  Afghanistan. At the time, he was not a regular member of the  Muslim Brotherhood. He was released a few months later. I do  not remember how long he was detained. [passage omitted]    The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan and in the other Arab  countries have not changed their clear policy toward the  Palestinian cause since the establishment of their call,  although in Islam one greets another by saying: peace be upon  you. We can never believe that the Jews want peace with the  inhabitants of Palestine or with the other Arabs. The Muslim  brothers clearly know this fact, and are also aware of the Jews  wickedness, machinations, and enmity toward Islam and its  followers.    From this premise, if Palestine is not purged of the filth  of  the Jews, it will remain a Trojan horse the colonialist  countries in Europe and America will use to return colonialism  to the Arab countries in general, and the Islamic countries in  particular. The United States has succeeded in arming the state  of the usurper Jews in Palestine and has transformed it into an  aircraft carrier to subdue the Arab and Islamic countries.  Conceding any part of Palestine to the Jews is banned by Islam.  The jurisprudence based on the Koran and the Sunna stipulates  the following: If the enemy steps on a single inch of Muslim  land, every male and female Muslim is duty bound to carry out  jihad. The woman can even leave her husband's house without his  permission and the slave without his master's permission. The  Muslim Brotherhood and others who preach Islam will be  renouncing their religion if they agree to give any part of  Palestine to the Jews or the other enemies of God. Palestine and  Jerusalem can be liberated only if the Arab countries unite and  adopt a cohesive stand with the other Islamic countries. The  Jews know this.    Therefore, any rumor or machination against the Muslim  Brotherhood cannot but originate from the Jewish enemy, its  agents, and its partners in Europe and America. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Zimbabwean Supreme Court has repealed a  34-year-old law used by the Rhodesian and the Zimbabwean  Governments to stop political opponents holding public  demonstrations.    The court ruled that the section of the Law and Order  Maintenance Act that made demonstrations illegal, unless they  had the approval of the police, was in conflict with the  Zimbabwean Bill of Rights which guaranteed freedom of  association. The challenge to the law was brought by members of  the Zimbabwean Congress of Trade Unions who were arrested in  1992 for staging a procession in Harare after police refused to  approve it.    They pleaded not guilty on the grounds that the law  infringed  their constitutional rights and the case was referred to the  Supreme Court.</p>

			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / Former BCCI officials released Authorities in the United Arab Emirates yesterday released five former officials of the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) who had been detained since September 1991 on suspicion of fraud, Reuter reports from Abu Dhabi. The UAE attorney general's office said Babar Saeed Khan, Iqbal Ahmed Rizvi, Qaisar Rida Abed Rida, Mohammed Abdul Mujeeb, and Suhail Alam Kizilbashi, were released due to lack of evidence. The five will not be allowed to leave the UAE. Rizvi and Kizilbashi were Britons and the others Pakistanis. A total of 13 former BCCI officials remain in custody.</p>

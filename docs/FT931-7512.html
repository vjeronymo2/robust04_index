			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / Arts: Today's Television The billing for Life (8.00 ITV) describes it as 'a one-off live programme', but the publicity material asserts 'the philosophy behind Life' is that it will be compelling and sometimes controversial'. It seems that the makers expect a series while the fierce new network controllers may have different ideas. It sounds like precisely the sort of material we have been warned to expect under the new ITV system: 'A global compendium of human triumphs and tragedies', or what the Americans call 'infotainment'. We are promised astrology and a visit to the studio by 'the world's largest venomous spider'. Timewatch supplies the lowdown on J. Edgar Hoover, moralistic head of the FBI for nearly 50 years who, it now turns out, liked wearing pretty frocks and had a long sexual relationship with the man who deputised for him (8.10 BBC2). Mr Wroe's Virgins (BBC1 9.25) is a 4-part drama which takes the real-life figure of John Wroe, 19th century prophet/preacher, and constructs fictional stories around him about four of the seven virgins who provided 'comfort and succour' in his Lancashire household.</p>

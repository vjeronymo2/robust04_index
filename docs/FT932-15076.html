			<p>930415 FT  15 APR 93 / The Lex Column: Whitbread Whitbread's plan to revalue its property holdings has started to generate nervous anticipation as next month's results draw near. But the move is less frightening than it looks. Whitbread's south-east presence and its hotels mean the write-down could be proportionately larger than that of other brewers. If hints at the interim stage are right, it should amount to around 15 per cent of the Pounds 2.5bn retail property portfolio or Pounds 375m. But with current gearing of only 16 per cent Whitbread can afford the hit. That leaves the broader question of the connection between the write-down and the new accounting standards. Till now companies which sold property could credit the entire difference between the price and the original cost to profits. In future, only the difference between price and book value will count. It thus pays companies like brewers with large property holdings to reduce the book value of their assets as far as possible, if only to reduce the risk of having to declare a loss on property sales. It would be churlish to accuse Whitbread of setting itself up to flatter future profits. Although property disposals accounted for 17 per cent of pre-tax profits in 1991-92, sophisticated investors automatically strip them out. Whitbread's plan for regular property revaluations anyway mean property profits should largely disappear. The new accounting standards will then have scored a double hit: stated earnings will be more a reflection of its basic business and the balance sheet will have become more reliable into the bargain.</p>

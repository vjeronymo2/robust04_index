			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Nuestro Tiempo Edition  </P> <P> BUSH SCHOOL ORDER: A MIXED REACTION  </P> <P> Raul Yzaguirre, president of National Council of La Raza, had hoped that the  months of hearings and information-gathering by a presidential task force on  Latino education would yield significant results, such as a national report on  its findings.  </P> <P> "We thought there would be a report" from the task force, said Yzaguirre. "That  is a disappointment."  </P> <P> Still, Yzaguirre's organization isn't going to dwell on the absence of a  report. Instead it is focusing on what did result from the task force: an  executive order from President Bush aimed at improving the educational  achievement of the nation's 20 million Latinos.  </P> <P> "It took over two years of very hard work to finally get something that was  fairly compelling. We did it. We finally got it done; it is one of the most  important events in terms of policy so far," he said.  </P> <P> At the same time, a number of Latino leaders expressed disappointment at the  order's lack of specifics, including funding sources. They say that an  important hurdle remains -- getting funds to implement the order's objectives.  </P> <P> Bush's signing of the executive order came Sept. 24. The occasion was a  Hispanic Heritage Month event at the White House Rose Garden attended by more  than 1,300 Latino leaders, Civil Service members, politicians and community  organizers.  </P> <P> Bush's directive, known formally as the Executive Order on Educational  Excellence for Hispanic Americans:  </P> <P> * Establishes a Latino advisory commission in the Education Department to give  advice on parental involvement in student education, the promotion of early  childhood education, the removal of barriers to their success in education and  work, and helping students to achieve their potential at all education levels.  Commission members are to be appointed by the President.  </P> <P> * Creates an Education Department office called the White House Initiative on  Educational Excellence for Hispanics. (Gilbert D. Roman, an Education  Department official, later was named to head the office.)  </P> <P> * Directs "Cabinet agencies to be actively involved in helping advance  educational opportunities" for Latinos.  </P> <P> Eleven months ago, Bush directed Secretary of Education Lauro F. Cavazos to  form the Presidential Task Force on Hispanic Education. At the time, Bush said,  "Sadly, Hispanic Americans are especially undereducated. As Hispanics become  the largest minority group in the United States in the next century, it becomes  more and more important to overcome the crisis in Hispanic education."  </P> <P> Bush pointed out that among Latinos 25 and older, "an alarming 52% have not  completed high school education, compared to 21% of non-Hispanics."  </P> <P> The task force held public meetings that began last April in San Antonio to  hear the testimony of educators and parents. Other hearings followed in Boston,  Chicago, Miami and, last June, in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Cavazos presented an oral report of the task force's recommendations to the  White House's Domestic Policy Council, which in turn drew up the executive  order for the President.  </P> <P> Despite the expectation of many Latino organizations, the task force was not  required to issue a written report of its findings, said Etta Fielek, a  spokeswoman for Cavazos. Yet Cavazos is "considering how to discuss in a more  public way the feedback he got from citizens," Fielek said. Information  gathered at a series of public hearings last summer may be compiled into "some  sort of departmental report," she said.  </P> <P> Bush's executive order brought guarded optimism from other Latino leaders.  </P> <P> "You need to build, and this is the cornerstone. It's a big step in the right  direction," said Mario Moreno, director of the Washington regional office of  the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "We were looking for  something with a little more teeth in it, such as money. It's pretty broad."  </P> <P> Moreno said his group did not "harp on how much money" the educational programs  would cost because "it was a concept we were trying to get accepted first."  Still, he said, "the problem won't be solved by reshuffling existing monies."  </P> <P> Leticia Quezada, the only Latino school board member of the Los Angeles Unified  School District, said, "I'm very pleased with the advent of a presidential  executive order . . . but I can't help but feel that I'm still waiting for  something else.  </P> <P> "I keep saying, 'Well, what did you find out, and if what you found out is that  there's going to be another commission, that means more fact-finding.' How long  are we going to keep researching before we get to some action? After a while,  you wonder how many people are going to drop out and how many generations are  going to get lost because of that waiting," Quezada said.  </P> <P> "We have no response yet on those hearings and what the secretary intends to do  with the findings. There's nothing there yet that's concrete. I want to be able  to have a program. I want to be able to have a date for some initiative," said  Quezada, who intends to submit her name for the commission.  </P> <P> Jackie Goldberg, president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, lamented that  the order lacks specific directives. The problems, she noted, are well  documented. "If they want to come and study the issue again, they can save  their time, their money and their energy."  </P> <P> On the other hand, Goldberg said, the fact that the order was issued at the top  level could have a positive impact on the effectiveness of any programs that  may result.  </P> <P> Goldberg and Gabriel Alvarez, a Los Angeles parent who has served on a school  district advisory committee, said parents should not be blamed for the poor  performance of Latino students, referring to controversial remarks Cavazos made  last spring in San Antonio.  </P> <P> Citing the high Latino dropout rate, Cavazos said that while Latino cultures  traditionally have considered education important, "somewhere along the line  we've lost that . . . we really have not cared that youngsters have dropped out  of school."  </P> <P> But Alvarez argued that parents "don't have the doors open to them at the  schools and that needs to change because they are interested in education on  all levels."  </P> <P> The signing of the executive order culminated a two-year lobbying effort by a  coalition of Latino organizations. They called for an executive order requiring  federal agencies to assess the level and equity of Latino participation in  federal education-related programs, something that Bush's order does only for  the Department of Education.  </P> <P> Yzaguirre said the coalition's suggested order called on other federal  agencies, such as Health and Human Services, for support in Head Start programs  and in Social Security programs that have educational and medical education  benefits. The coalition had even looked to the Department of Defense, for its  proven expertise in the armed services in "imparting vocational training to  people in an efficient way," he said.  </P> <P> Other key differences between the coalition's suggested executive order and the  one issued by Bush include "some reference to higher education and colleges  with high levels of Hispanic enrollment," Yzaguirre said. "We had also hoped  that the executive order would've mentioned issues of civil rights  enforcement."  </P> <P> Besides making sure that productive and sympathetic educators, business and  community leaders are named to the commission, the Latino coalition must lobby  for funds to implement Latino educational programs, Yzaguirre said.  </P> <P> Mary Anne Perez contributed to this report from Los Angeles.  </P> <P> </P> <P> School Facts  </P> <P> The U.S. Department of Education paints this picture of Latinos in nationwide  education:  </P> <P> * Among Latinos 25 and older, 52% have not completed high school, compared to  24% of non-Latinos.  </P> <P> * Between 9% and 11% of Latino students in high school drop out each year, the  highest rate of any major racial or ethnic group.  </P> <P> * In 1984-85, Latinos earned only 3% of all U.S. bachelor's degrees awarded.  </P></p>

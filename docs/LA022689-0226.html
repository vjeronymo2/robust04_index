			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE RECORD  </P> <P> A story in The Times last Sunday about a $4.9-million Orange County Superior  Court settlement in a home spa accident case incorrectly stated that Blue Haven  Pools and Spas was bankrupt. Actually, the Garden Grove company, which made the  spa in which a 10-year-old boy was paralyzed when he was sucked to the bottom,  is now out of business and was not a party to the settlement. The company was  sold in 1984 to Earl Dexter Corp., which now operates the business as Blue  Haven Pools and Spas of Orange County.  </P></p>

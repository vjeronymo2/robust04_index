			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Letter: Case for control of NHS medicine prices distorted Sir, Your leading article, 'Drug pricing' (December 23), while recognising the tremendous contribution made by the UK pharmaceutical industry to the national economy, encourages the government to drive a 'hard bargain' over National Health Service medicine prices. In doing so your leader writer distorts his case by the sins of omission. First, he confuses prices with costs. The price index for NHS medicines increased by only 1.7 per cent last year - well below the rate of inflation. More importantly he failed to inform your readers that, in addition to controlling NHS profits (and hence prices) through the pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (PPRS), the government has a heavy influence on the demand side. In April 1991 it introduced the indicative prescribing scheme to exert downward pressure on doctors' prescribing. In November this year it also announced an extension to the Limited List to cover 10 more therapeutic categories - this is designed to cut the NHS revenues of mainly research-based companies by up to Pounds 450m a year. NHS patients wishing to continue to receive a 'blacklisted' medicine will, of course, be able to pay for them on a private prescription but many will not be able to afford to do so. The market for those blacklisted products will, to all intents and purposes, be lost. Regretfully, therefore, the PPRS, as a mechanism for controlling expenditures on NHS medicines, cannot possibly be looked at in splendid isolation as your leading article pretends it can. Your case that the government can 'afford' to drive a hard bargain is devalued by this false pretence.

			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / Letter: A much better idea than selling off the roads network Sir, I read with interest your article, 'Road network sell-off proposed' (February 12). My experience of the motorway network suggests that, on the rare occasions when the traffic is actually flowing, so fragile is this phenomenon that the tip vortices from a passing butterfly are sufficient to produce a 10-mile tailback. One toll booth would bring the whole of the country to a standstill. Has the refugee from the land of the cerebrally challenged who thought up this one ever driven round the M25? I have an idea of how the government could raise the Pounds 2bn it requires. Charge an annual levy on every road user; Pounds 100 a year from 20m of them should just about do it. The government could call it a road fund licence and supply little round stickers to put in your windscreen as proof of payment. If it wished to charge according to usage it could (revolutionary, this one) impose a tax on fuel. About 6p a litre should raise the same amount.

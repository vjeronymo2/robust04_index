			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Management (The Growing Business): Breaking with tradition - A look at how Japan's subcontractors are coping with customer demands and a rising yen Japan's army of subcontractors, the hidden muscle power of its industrial economy, are learning the hard way that they must become more than mere foot soldiers to survive. Their famed ability to cut costs and increase efficiency is coming under unprecedented strain as subcontractors' powerful customers demand another round of price cuts, for a record fourth year running. Just as Japan seems to be on the brink of coming out of recession, subcontractors are being asked to shoulder their share - some complain even more than their share - of the cost disadvantage inflicted by another rise in the yen's value. A look at the contrasting experiences of three subcontractors around Osaka, the heartland of Japan's electronics industry, shows that the pressure on costs has started to disturb - but not destroy - the formerly intimate bonds between parent companies and their multiple domestic suppliers. It also indicates that suppliers able to follow their clients to cheaper locations overseas, especially in the rest of Asia, are most likely to prosper. Takizawa Precision Gear, a producer of machine-tool gears with 14 staff, has taken a traditionally Japanese approach to a problem, by stepping up the search for internal self-improvement. Its neighbour, Meisei Metal Industries, a 140-person maker of metal dies for the car industry, has joined forces with other subcontractors to seek economies of scale. Showa Plastics, a producer of plastic casings with 2,200 employees, has behaved like a Japanese multinational. It has closed more than half its domestic production and relocated next to its Japanese buyers' new overseas plants. The trio hold very different ranks in Japan's feudal-style industrial structure, but they share one thing: the realisation that near total dependence on a single large client is not the guarantee of survival it used to be for most of Japan's post-1950s economic expansion. Local bankruptcy figures are a grim illustration. At the start of Japan's recession in 1991, bankruptcies in Osaka grew faster than the number of new businesses for the first time. The sad trend has stayed that way, says Moriyuki Tsuda, director of industrial research at Osaka prefecture. 'Customers are less loyal than in old times,' says Kiyoshi Takizawa, president of Takizawa Precision Gear. 'Sooner or later 20 per cent or 30 per cent of companies in our field will go out of business,' says Yozo Ueda, vice-president of Meisei Metal Industries. 'Toshiba, Hitachi and Sony are more willing to buy from me in Singapore than in Tokyo. They won't even see me in Tokyo,' says Kenzo Nakagawa, president of Showa Plastics. Takizawa is at the bottom of a so-called 'co-prosperity' pyramid, headed by Osaka-based Matsushita, Japan's largest consumer electronics group. The upper echelons include about 500 prime contractors - closely bound to Matsushita - while Takizawa is among the more than 6,000 smaller suppliers which will also sell to several other large companies. The parallel with the feudal system becomes visible on visiting Takizawa's plant, part of an enormous industrial village and consisting of a dense jumble of factories, rice fields and homes on the outskirts of Osaka. Takizawa, whose father founded the business 44 years ago, devotes 40 per cent of annual sales to his top three customers. This is a big enough exposure to make it impossible for the company to resist their demands for price cuts of between 5 per cent and 15 per cent every year for the past four years. Sales have shrunk from Y300m (Pounds 1.95m) to Y200m over the same period, perilously close to Takizawa's Y180m break-even point. Instead of sacking his tiny workforce, Takizawa has instead increased spending on training, borrowed Y50m to re-equip with Swiss machine tools and carried out an engineering cost analysis. His strategy of investing through a recession was typical of Japanese industry in the 1980s, but was widely abandoned in the recent downturn. Takizawa justifies sticking to the old invest-or-die approach on the grounds that the company has few foreign competitors, operating with the advantage of cheaper local currencies. This allows him to market more on quality than on price. Takizawa admits, however, there is nothing they can do if the Japanese market continues to shrink. His clients, he says, hold his business hostage. 'We only supply a small part of a big machine,' says Takizawa. Meisei Metal is slightly higher up the feudal ladder than Takizawa, yet it is even more vulnerable because its top three buyers account for 85 per cent of sales. It has had to accept price cuts of up to 30 per cent this year, and as a result it made a loss of Y100m in the first six months of the year - its first of the recession. The loss would have been larger if Meisei had not turned away demands for 50 per cent price cuts from some buyers, says Ueda. Like Takizawa, Meisei has few direct foreign competitors. But given the domestic overcapacity in Japanese die-making, Meisei has had to find a way of making itself more attractive than Japanese rivals. 'We believe co-operative manufacturing is the key,' says Ueda. He is referring to the formation two years ago of a joint company by Meisei and three other subcontractors to service the needs of a single car company, which Ueda prefers not to name. The subcontracting group, called Must - after the initial letters of its members - pools design, marketing and finance to save costs. It also saves costs for the customer by reducing the number of suppliers the buyer has to handle. Several of Meisei's competitors have adopted the same strategy and the company may launch Must-type groups for other buyers. Showa Plastics, while much bigger than Meisei and Takizawa, is more sensitive to foreign competition because its products go straight to assembly plants, where its consumer electronics industry patrons have led the way in establishing low-cost operations in Europe and eastern Asia. Showa, another member of Matsushita's co-prosperity pyramid, has shifted 60 per cent of its Y20bn turnover out of Japan, mainly into neighbouring Asian countries, since the early 1980s. It has been helped by the natural preference of its Japanese customers' overseas subsidiaries to take a Japanese supplier, says Nakagawa, who is a keen advocate of the borderless economy propounded by his fellow Osaka resident Kenichi Ohmae. Where possible, he has used local funding and local staff, so that nearly half of Showa's employees are now Chinese speakers. In the past five years, Showa has closed four of its eight Japanese plants and reduced its domestic workforce from 550 to 150. This is unusually aggressive restructuring by the standards of Showa's Japanese competitors, who pride themselves on not cutting jobs. 'We were lucky, because 60 per cent of our Japanese workers were part-time, so we just didn't renew their contracts. They easily transferred to other jobs, mostly on higher pay. But we can't restructure on that scale again,' says Nakagawa. Showa's rapid foreign expansion has helped it to broaden its client base, so that the top three now account for 40 per cent of sales, from 75 per cent in the mid-1980s. But the most important benefit of moving production out of Japan is, as its customers have found, to protect Showa from the yen's inexorable rise, the main factor in the price pressure on Japan's subcontractors. Showa's prices have fallen by 30 per cent during the past four years. Overall unit costs have also fallen, helped by the decline in foreign currencies against the yen, far enough to allow Showa to increase its profits throughout the downturn. Many of Japan's subcontractors followed their big clients into the US and Europe in the 1980s - indeed, Showa has a plant in the UK. A second wave of suppliers is now moving into Asia, leaving their domestic counterparts to struggle for market share in a Japanese economy that is unlikely to return to the heady growth rates of the 1980s in this decade.</p>

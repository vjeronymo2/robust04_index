			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Editorial: "Appeal of Reason Should Be Heeded"] </F>   [Text] The resolution adopted by the UN Security Council  [UNSC] does not concern Yemen's unity or partition. It is aimed  at silencing the guns and stopping the massacres.    As was expected, the UNSC resolution calling for an  immediate  cease-fire in the Yemeni war has provoked initial hostile  reactions from the two parties to the conflict.    But one point is now certain, namely that neither of the two  parties to the conflict will be able to ignore a resolution  embodying the international community's will. The world as a  whole is demanding an immediate end to the fratricide in Yemen.  And the international community is willing and has the ability  to guarantee the two parties' respect for its will.    Obviously there are people outside Yemen who would like to  prove their courage at the expense of Yemeni blood. One of them  says that "Yemeni unity must be safeguarded, even if it costs  100,000 Yemeni lives." Another is urging Yemeni leaders to defy  the will of the world "and to continue the fighting to the last  drop of their blood."    But the reality is that most Yemenis -- in the north or the  south -- refuse to allow the Yemeni land to be turned into a  graveyard to satisfy demagogic ideas abroad. And most likely,  they do not want a unity based on mass murder, especially as  they can see that the one-month war has not settled any of the  political problems that ignited the war in the first place.    There is positive evidence that many leading elements in the  north and the south have begun to understand the general mood.  These elements now believe that this war lacks the popular  support for its continuation until it is settled in favor of  this or that party.    The resolution adopted by the UNSC is precise and fair in  its  wording and contains a number of reasonable demands.    It is not adopting a position on the essence of the dispute  between the north and the south. By citing the Republic of  Yemen twice, the resolution has refuted the argument of those  quarters who accused the UNSC of trying to impose the partition  option on Yemen. It is clear that the resolution does not  concern Yemen's unity or its partition. It is aimed at  silencing the guns and providing a breather for reflection in  order to resume the political dialogue, instead of war, until a  just and lasting settlement to the dispute is achieved.    It is necessary for us to point here to a historic fact,  namely that this is not the first time the United Nations has  intervened to end a civil war. In the last decade the  international organization took a number of measures to end  civil wars in at least 19 states.    So is there any reason to exclude Yemen from this rule? And  is it permissible for the world to stand with its hands tied  while the killing and destruction continue in Yemen, merely to  satisfy those who think that war alone will achieve their  objectives?    The council is also urging the imposition of a ban on arms  supplies to the two parties. Actually the council is saying  "no" to pouring fuel on a blazing fire. So what is wrong with  the position adopted by the international community? There is  nothing wrong. It is a rational and wise position. How nice it  would be if the two parties heeded it.    The two parties to this tragic war must accept the sincere  UN  appeal. They must heed the appeal of reason emanating from the  UNSC Council. If they ignore this appeal, they will be ignoring  not only the international community's will, but the will of the  Yemeni people, who certainly want to live in security, peace,  and stability, not in a civil war.</p>

A significant barrier for most businesses small enough to qualify to bid in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks would be access to adequate private financing to ensure their ability to compete against larger firms in the PCS marketplace. <FOOTCITE>29</FOOTCITE>  In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Third Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we concluded that installment payments are an effective means to address the inability of small businesses to obtain financing and will enable these entities to compete more effectively for the auctioned spectrum. We also determined that small businesses eligible for installment payments would only be required to pay half of the down payment (10 percent of the winning bid, as opposed to 20 percent) five days after the auction closes, with the remaining 10 percent payment deferred until five days after grant of the license. Finally, we indicated that installment payments should be made available to small businesses at an interest rate equal to the rate for U.S. Treasury obligations. <FOOTCITE>30</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 29 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See e.g., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  comments of SBA Chief Counsel of Advocacy at 6, 20&hyph;21, NTIA at 27; SBAC Report at 2 (September 15, 1993). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 30 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See Third Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;&para; 86&hyph;90. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 30. In light of the expected substantial capital required to acquire narrowband PCS licenses, we proposed that installment payments be available to most businesses that obtain narrowband PCS licenses in the proposed entrepreneurs' blocks. By allowing payment in installments, the government would in effect be extending credit to licensees, thus reducing the amount of private financing needed prior to and after the auction. Such low cost government financing would promote long-term participation by these businesses, which, because of their smaller size, lack access to sufficient capital to compete effectively with larger PCS licensees. Under the rules we propose today, installment payments would be available to smaller entities that do not technically qualify as small businesses for purposes of other measures we have proposed, such as bidding credits. We believe, however, that, given the significant costs of narrowband PCS licenses and the likelihood of very large participants in the other blocks, this option would be fully consistent with the congressional intent in enacting Section 309(j)(4)(A) to avoid a competitive bidding program that has the effect of favoring incumbent providers of other communications services, with established revenue streams, over smaller entities. <FOOTCITE>31</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 31 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> See <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  H.R. Rep. No. 103&hyph;111 at 255 (Commission has the authority to design alternative payment schedules in order that the auction process does not inadvertently favor only those with ``deep pockets'' over new or small companies). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 31. Under the plan we propose here, all licenses that satisfy the gross revenues, total assets and personal net worth criteria to bid in the entrepreneurs' blocks would be allowed to pay in installments for regional and MTA licenses granted in those blocks. With respect to the BTA licenses in those blocks, however, only businesses owned by women and minorities and those licensees with less than $75 million in gross revenues would be able to use installment payments. <FOOTCITE>32</FOOTCITE>  This distinction is based on the expected lower costs to acquire licenses and construct systems in the BTAs. However, if we adopt our proposal to redesignate BTA licenses as nationwide or regional licenses, we propose extending installment payments on those blocks to all parties eligible for the entrepreneurs' blocks. Thus, with the exception of companies owned by women or minorities, which face additional problems accessing capital, we do not think that a firm with gross revenues exceeding $75 million would require government financing to be competitive for the BTA licenses. <FOOTCITE>33</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 32 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We will apply the same $500 million total assets and $100 million personal net worth standards for purposes of determining eligibility for installment payments in the BTA entrepreneurs' blocks. The attribution rules set forth with regard to eligibility to bid will also apply in all of the BTA entrepreneurs' blocks. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 33 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that a consortium of small businesses would be eligible for installment payments in any market so long as each member of the consortium satisfies the definition of a small business, as set forth in Section V.A.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 32. The installment payment option would enable qualified businesses to pay their winning bid over time. These businesses would still make the applicable upfront payment in full before the auction, but would be required to make a post-auction down payment equaling only ten percent of their winning bids, half of which will be due five business days after the auction closes. Payment of the other half of the down payment would be deferred until five business days after the license is granted. In general, the remaining 90 percent of the auction price would be paid in installments with interest charges to be fixed at the time of licensing at a rate equal to the rate for ten-year U.S. Treasury obligations plus 2.5 percent. Under this general rule, only payments of interest would be due for the first year with principal and interest payments amortized over the remaining nine years of the license. Timely payment of all installments would be a condition of the license grant and failure to make such timely payment would be grounds for revocation of the license. <FOOTCITE>34</FOOTCITE>  We seek comment on this installment payment proposal. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 34 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> As described in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  in PP Docket No. 93&hyph;253, 9 FCC Rcd 2348, 59 FR 22980 (May 4, 1994), ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> Second Report and Order <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> ), the Commission may, on a case-by-case basis, permit a three to six month grace period within which a licensee may seek a restructuring of the payment plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921031 FT  31 OCT 92 / L30,000bn to defend lira DEFENCE of the lira during the currency markets' turbulence of September cost the Bank of Italy L30,000bn (Pounds 13.8bn) in reserves, the bank revealed yesterday, Robert Graham writes. It also showed for the first time the full extent of its short-term obligations contracted with the Bundesbank and the Belgian central bank to defend the lira last month. These obligations, principally to the Bundesbank, amounted to L27,330bn. Between August and September, total net reserves were halved to L32,917bn. They are now at their lowest level since 1978.</p>

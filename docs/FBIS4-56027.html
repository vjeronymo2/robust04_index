			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["G.Z."-initialed interview with Major General Janos Deak, </F> commander of the Hungarian Army; place and date not given: "The  Reorganization of the Army Should Continue"]    [Text] [MAGYAR HIRLAP] What changes have taken place in  the relations between the Army and society since the change in  the regime? Are there any signs attesting to the fact that  society now really regards the Hungarian Army as its own Army?    [Deak] We soldiers think that the relations between the Army  and society are strengthened by numerous positive signs. This  society did not like the Army. The foreign contacts and the  foreign goals were well known. Many people questioned the need  for military service. Today, the sensitivity of our society  toward the problems facing our Army has become perceptible. The  Army and the need for Army service are no longer issues debated  in the civilian sphere. We must admit, however, that the  extended Yugoslav conflict has greatly contributed to the  strengthening of this view. The fact that only a fraction of  the 65,000 young people conscripted annually ask for alternative  military service shows the increased acceptance of military  service.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The Army has not been properly financed in  recent years. Its yearly budget was mostly set on the basis of  the "principle of leftover" [maradekelv]. Do you see any chance  of the new parliament recognizing the need for adequate support  of the Army? What can you do for this?    [Deak] The inadequate financing of the Army started as early  as the eighties. The budget did not make technological  development possible; nor did it enable us to improve the  living, working, and service circumstances, including soldiers'  pay. In view of all this, it is understandable that we are  happy to see that the Army received modern combat aircraft in  exchange for the Soviet debts to Hungary, and we will be able to  deploy a complete tactical air wing soon. We hope that the  Russians will supply further technical equipment used by the  Army and the border police in exchange for a part of the  outstanding debt toward Hungary. Naturally, the soldiers are  aware of Hungary's ability to carry burdens. However, I think  that the budget should be drawn up in accordance with our tasks.  The size of the Army, its composition, and its technical supply  should be determined in accordance with its tasks. Our concepts  regarding the future reorganization of the Army are ready.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Many people think that we are over the most  difficult phase in the reorganization of the Army, and one  should count on fewer conflicts than in the past years. Do you  agree with this evaluation?    [Deak] I do not think that we are over the most difficult  phase. There have been negative measures, but the period ahead  of us will not be easier, because we must continue to reorganize  the Army. We will submit the relevant plans to the new  government and the new parliament. We would like to see ahead  until the year 2010. There are numerous new elements in our  plan. For example, we will attribute great importance to the  rapid deployment forces. We want to strengthen both the size  and preparedness of our staff of warrant officers. I would  divide the existing Army into three main parts: rapid deployment  forces, defense, and reserves. In the future, we envisage the  introduction of a differentiated standing Army service  coordinated with the above. At least 50 percent of the rapid  deployment force would be made up of professional soldiers. I  cannot envisage a shorter Army service than 12 months in these  units and in the active defense forces. It would be  irresponsible to make untrained soldiers carry out combat tasks.  However, in the case of the reserves, we can envisage a  reduction of the service. At the same time, we must modify the  reserves, even by modifying the defense law if necessary.  People who had served less would be called up for reserves duty  more frequently.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] The replacement and modernization of some  military technology and weapons systems will become inevitable  in the coming years. In view of the medium-term military  technology development plan, where do you see possibilities of  development first?    [Deak] Some 90 percent of our military technology is based  on Soviet technology. At the moment, it seems that we have no  other choice but to continue to purchase weapons from the East.  We do not have the possibility of purchasing arms from the  West. In addition, we would like to rely increasingly on the  Hungarian industry. However, we must, anyway, purchase the most  modern electronic systems from the West or the United States.  Without this, we cannot fulfill the integration requirements.  The priority is well known in this area: air defense,  reconnaissance, radio-electronic combat, antiarmor systems.    [MAGYAR HIRLAP] Could the expected changes in the leadership  of the Defense Ministry disturb the professional staff? Can you  envisage a division in the Army similar to the one in our  society along party lines?    [Deak] Any change in the defense and military leadership  system can only occur according to the stipulations of the  defense law. This law stipulates the management and leadership  systems in details. No matter what changes occur in this house,  the Army leadership system must be continuous, stable, and firm.  The Army is above parties. We do not intend to interfere in  government activity. We are waiting for the politician who will  lead this ministry respectfully and be ready to cooperate. I  think that both the minister and the leading officials will  respect the idea of keeping a distance from politics. In my  view, a wonderful staff of officers is currently serving in the  Hungarian Army. I can say this not only in view of their  professional knowledge, but also in view of their honesty,  diligence, and readiness to accept sacrifices. I think all this  is a guarantee that no division whatsoever will take place  within the Hungarian Army.</p>

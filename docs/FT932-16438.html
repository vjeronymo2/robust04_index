			<p>930406 FT  06 APR 93 / People: Loudon broadens M&amp;G's board George Loudon, the former chief executive of Midland Montagu, has been appointed a non-executive director of M&amp;G Group, one of Britain's biggest fund managers. Loudon, 50, comes from a well known Dutch family which has produced the chairman of Royal Dutch Shell and Akzo as well as several bankers. In spite of his Dutch name, Oxford-educated Loudon has an English wife and feels more at home on the international business circuit than most of his peers. He has worked with Lazards Freres in Paris, the Ford Foundation in New York and Jakarta, McKinsey &amp; Co and Amro in Amsterdam, before being headhunted as part of Midland Bank's new management team. He has contacts which should come in handy for a firm of fund managers with international ambitions. Loudon, who lost his job as an executive director of Midland Bank following its takeover by HSBC Holdings last year, was appointed a non-executive director of Arjo Wiggins Appleton in January. It is just over a year since M&amp;G appointed Hugh Collum, SmithKline Beecham's finance director, as a non-executive director and Paddy Linaker, M&amp;G's chief executive, says that Loudon's appointment is part of an effort to broaden the board membership. Traditionally, M&amp;G has drawn most of its non-executive directors from a relatively small circle. Before Loudon's appointment three out of M&amp;G's seven non-execs were connected with the Esmee Fairbairn Charitable Trust, which owns a third of the company, and Bobbie Brooks is a director of Kleinwort Benson, which used to own a 37 per cent stake. Meanwhile, Michael McLintock, who has recently joined M&amp;G from Barings' corporate finance department, has been appointed a director of M&amp;G Investment Management. McLintock, whose father Alan has been a non-executive director of M&amp;G since 1982, will be promoting the firm's investment skills for managing segregated pension funds.</p>

This was  announced by his state minister, Helmut Schaefer, at the opening  of the 5th Hanseatic Economic Days of the Baltic Sea countries  in Kiel on Tuesday [15 March]. With its aid, the European Union  has contributed to the Baltic Sea countries' development. In  view of the challenges, such as the integration of the eastern  Baltic Sea countries into the EU's transport policy, the aid,  however, is not sufficient in the long run, Schaefer said.    The European Union in 1994 must conclude free-trade  agreements with Poland and the Baltic states. "One of the  objectives of the German EU Presidency in the next half year  will be to conclude associate membership agreements with the  Baltic states as soon as possible, including the prospects for  future membership," he said.    Schleswig-Holstein Minister President Heide Simonis, of the  Social Democratic Party of Germany, has called for an opening of  Western markets for the Eastern reformist countries. Despite  the economic differences, the Baltic Sea region has great market  opportunities. To utilize these opportunities it is necessary  to improve the transport infrastructure. This includes the  construction of the A 20 Baltic Sea highway. Apart from the 10  Baltic Sea countries, the 5th Hanseatic Economic Days are also  attended by Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.</p>

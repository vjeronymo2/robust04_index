			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] While in Lusaka, the government and the National  Union for the Total Independence of Angola [UNITA] are  negotiating peace, here in Angola things are not going well.    UNITA is just showing that it wants to continue the war.  This is evidenced by the fact that it began to shell the city  of N'dalatando in Cuanza Norte Province and its outskirts at  dawn yesterday. According to a military source, this happened  after government forces repelled an unspecified number of troops  of the Armed Forces for the Liberation of Angola [FALA] who  tried to infiltrate into Catombe de Baixo area. Government  forces killed more than 10 rebels, took one prisoner, and  captured a quantity of war materiel. [passage omitted]    UNITA rebels are also carrying out actions in Malanje but  are  being repelled by government troops. Our correspondent reports.    [Begin unidentified correspondent recording] Another three  rebels were put out of action today, 4 km south of (Caema) and  14 km from the city of Malanje. Government forces also captured  a quantity of war materiel from the rebels. This was revealed  by an authorized military force. Heavy clashes were also taking  place today between government forces and UNITA rebels in  Cateve, Bumba, Lao, and Cabindondo. The results of this action  are not yet known. What is more, four UNITA (?soldiers) have  presented themselves to government authorities in Malanje.  Government forces continue to control the political and  military situation in the city. [end recording]    The city of Kuito in Bie Province is in a similar situation.  UNITA does not want to leave the people of that city in peace.  It continues to shell it in its plan to overrun it at any cost.  [passage omitted]</p>

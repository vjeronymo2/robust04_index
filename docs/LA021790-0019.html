			<p><P> February 17, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THEY HAVE POINTS TO MAKE AFTER 102-24 PREP GAME  </P> <P> My basketball team (9- and 10-year-old boys) recently had a game against an  undermanned opponent. Five minutes into the game, when we led, 20-0, I benched  our leading scorer, who had already scored 14 points.  </P> <P> Before the end of the first quarter, we discontinued our half-court trap. As  the score mounted, we pulled our top two players and sat them on the bench for  much of the first half.  </P> <P> At halftime, the score was an abominable 45-3. We told the official scorer to  keep track of the score but to turn off the scoreboard. He did so, and the  other team, their parents and friends, happily never knew the final score.  </P> <P> The suspension of Gil Ramirez, the South Torrance High girls' coach, who  stopped a game when Morningside was leading at halftime, 102-24, demonstrates  how perverse the thinking has become in athletics. What possible benefit could  anyone have received from the continued public humiliation of the South  Torrance team?  </P> <P> Punitive administrative actions were necessary as a result of that game.  Unfortunately, they missed the mark.  </P> <P> TOM LALLAS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

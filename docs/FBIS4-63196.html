			<p>BFN     [Text] Russia is starting the destruction of chemical  weapon manufacturing equipment. A decision to this effect was  made by First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets following his  visit of the Khimprom company in Chuvashia which used to  manufacture chemical shells.    The production of chemical weapons was discontinued in the  factory in 1987 but the equipment capable of doing so has  remained intact. Soskovets and Chuvashia's President Nikolai  Fyodorov ordered the compiling of a schedule for the  stage-by-stage destruction of the equipment.    Viktor Glukhikh, chairman of the State Defense Industry  Committee, told Interfax that this decision marked the beginning  of a large scale process in the country. The reluctance on the  part of the U.S. to sign the appropriate convention might,  however, hinder the process, he said.</p>

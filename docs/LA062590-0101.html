			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> IMPROVEMENT OF CITY BUILDINGS STUDIED  </P> <P> Confronted with an aging set of city facilities, City Council members last week  approved a study to examine the state of city buildings and determine whether  voters should be asked to approve as much as $7 million in improvements.  </P> <P> The city's Police Department is housed in a 26-year-old station house, and its  community center operates out of a converted savings and loan building.  </P> <P> The growing police force and its facility requirements have commanded top  attention, but Councilman William D. Mahoney urged his colleagues to take an  overall view.  </P> <P> "If we just look at one facility, I think we're going to be making a mistake,"  he said. "I think we need to take an overall look at the whole downtown area."  </P> <P> The council voted Tuesday to authorize a study of community needs as well as  options for funding improvements. The discussion included the possibility of a  special election asking voters to approve expenditures.  </P> <P> City Manager Lee Risner told the council the study should include a projection  of the city's future population makeup. "If we're going to have a large percent  of senior citizens, that will have an impact on recreational needs. It will  also have an impact on the police department," he said.  </P> <P> The study will also examine the possibility of a city beautification plan, an  idea suggested by Councilman Douglas Bystry. Although some council members  worried about the costs of such a plan, Bystry urged development of landscaped  medians along major streets, entrance signs at the city limits, flower  plantings and additional trees.  </P> <P> Mayor Beth Graham agreed, saying she has urged the council to take actions to  beautify city streets since 1970.

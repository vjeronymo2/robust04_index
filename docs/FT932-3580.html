			<p>930614 FT  14 JUN 93 / Germany's SPD picks Scharping to be new leader MR Rudolf Scharping, the 45-year-old premier of the west German state of the Rhineland-Palatinate, emerged yesterday as the certain new leader of the opposition Social Democrats, and the man most likely to challenge Chancellor Helmut Kohl for his job in next year's elections. He won a clear victory over his two rivals in yesterday's unprecedented 'primary' vote of party members. Mr Scharping will be formally proposed as national chairman today at the national executive meeting of the SPD and his position needs to be confirmed at a party conference on June 25. The vote reflects hesitant steps by the troubled opposition towards the centre ground of German politics, and amounts to a setback for the more radical policies espoused by Mr Scharping's rivals. His victory will be greeted with relief by the party establishment, who feared the ambition of his main rival, Mr Gerhard Schroder, the Lower Saxony premier. Mr Scharping - a life-long politician, first as a research assistant and then serving in his state parliament - is seen as a safe pair of hands, likely to follow the cautious centrism of Mr Bjorn Engholm, the former party chairman, who resigned last month following a political scandal in his home state of Schleswig-Holstein. Mr Scharping will, however, have a huge task to raise his political profile in less than 18 months before the next election, against the dominant, if unpopular, figure of Mr Kohl. According to an opinion poll published yesterday by the ntv television station, 52 per cent of those asked felt unable to say if he was doing a good or bad job because they did not know him. He was described at the weekend by Mr Otto Lambsdorff, the retiring leader of the Free Democratic party, as 'mouse grey'. More than 70 per cent of voters - including 33 per cent of SPD supporters - believe that Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union will win the next election and decide the chancellor, although the SPD and CDU are roughly equal in electoral support. Mr Schroder, 49, who started the leadership campaign as favourite, and Ms Heidemarie Wieczoreck-Zeul, 50, who sought to consolidate the left-wing vote in the party, both conceded defeat last night and threw their weight behind Mr Scharping. Mr Schroder had fought on the basis of a firm commitment to a coalition with the Green party at next year's elections, which almost certainly cost him votes, whereas Mr Scharping has left all his options open. The victor won a majority in all the most populous German states, with the exception of Lower Saxony, and in all the states of eastern Germany, except Berlin. He emerged with 197,000 votes, or 40.3 per cent, against 162,000 (33.2 per cent) for Mr Schroder and nearly 130,000 (26.5 per cent) for Ms Wieczoreck-Zeul.</p>

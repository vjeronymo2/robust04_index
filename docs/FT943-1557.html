			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Storm likely as former NHS chief executive joins Bupa Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the National Heath Service until earlier this year, is to join the board of Bupa, the UK's largest private healthcare organisation. The appointment is likely to cause political controversy. In July, Sir Duncan launched Healthcare 2000, a commission to investigate the future of healthcare provision. Critics of the government's effort to encourage greater private-sector involvement in the NHS will regard the Bupa appointment as evidence of an increasingly uncomfortable overlap between the two sectors. Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, said: 'This is the clearest indication yet of the degree to which the government is blurring the distinction between a public NHS and the private health sector.' The appointment will also revive arguments over how soon after leaving public office senior civil servants should be able to take up such posts. The Department of Health would not comment last night on any possible conflict of interest. Civil servants of Sir Duncan's rank must apply for approval to take an a outside appointment if it is within two years of leaving Whitehall. Sir Duncan's move had been handled with 'statutory propriety', an official said. Mr Tom Sackville, junior health minister, said: 'The appointment is a matter for Bupa and for Sir Duncan. There is positive benefit to the NHS in close co-operation with the private sector.' Sir Duncan, 53, was appointed NHS chief executive in 1989 and held the post until March this year. He was the first career NHS manager to head the service, having started as a management trainee. Some colleagues will regard his decision to join Bupa with surprise, since he was regarded as a staunch supporter of the public health service. Bupa has 46 per cent of the private healthcare market and the biggest number of private hospitals, with 29 units and 1,785 beds.</p>

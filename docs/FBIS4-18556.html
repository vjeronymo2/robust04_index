			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christine Fauvet-Mycia: "Inspired by Cantonal </F> Election Results, Robert Hue Launches `Strong Initiative'"]    [Text] Robert Hue, national secretary of the PCF [French  Communist Party], wants to open discussions with all the other  French left-wing parties. Since becoming the PCF leader, Robert  Hue has shown a desire to promote the emergence of a "new  political force." The good result achieved in the cantonal  elections, in which his party secured 11.4 percent of the vote  in the first round, and the effective tactical move to direct  votes to the leading left-wing candidate in the second round,  has given him renewed confidence. This is "urgent," he said on  Thursday [7 April], addressing the National Committee, when he  suggested to his party comrades that a "strong initiative" be  launched with a view to enabling "the popular forces, the  progressive forces," to build a true "alternative" which would  respond to the "tremendous appeal" made by the "social movement"  and "our youth."  <H5>  `Profound Development' </H5>   This "strong initiative," the new national PCF secretary  emphasized, could not be allowed to boil down "as in the past,"  to a mere platform, an alliance at the level of party leaders.  Robert Hue likes to think of himself as more innovative and  bold, seeking to "reestablish the links between two things that  have become disjointed": society and politics.    He insists on the need to open discussions with all the  left-wing parties with a view to coming up with a credible  alternative. No official invitation has yet been issued, but  Robert Hue wants to move quickly. His proposals will be debated  during a National Committee meeting on 6 April.    Yesterday, Jean Glavany, spokesman for the PS [Socialist  Party], reacted very favorably to Hue's proposals. "For several  weeks," he told LE FIGARO, "this profound development within the  Communist Party has been noticeable. Between the two [cantonal  election] rounds, the withdrawals and commitment of votes could  not have turned out better. Together, we organized several  meetings and were highly aware of the desire on the part of the  voters to see us take up the dialogue again."    Jean Glavany added: "The PS had already started to proffer  its hand by organizing meetings on the transformation of  society. So I can only rejoice at this development. Of course,  it is not a question of reestablishing the union of the Left and  adopting the joint platform of 1972. We must look for a new way  of cooperation." The PS and PCF are working on this, but for  the time being no meeting has been planned between Rocard and  Hue.</p>

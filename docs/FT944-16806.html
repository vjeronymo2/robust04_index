			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / World Trade News: Land Rovers in South Africa The UK's Rover Group is to assemble Land Rover four-wheel-drive vehicles in South Africa, at a car plant operated at Rosslyn, near Pretoria, by Rover's parent company, BMW. The venture, in which Rover Group itself is investing Pounds 10m, represents one of the first visible benefits arising from Rover's purchase by the German luxury carmaker earlier this year for Pounds 800m. It will also mark Land Rover's return to South Africa as an assembler for the first time since it sold a smaller assembly operation in Capetown to local entrepreneurs in the mid-1980s.</p>

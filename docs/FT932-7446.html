			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / Economist warns on recovery one of the Treasury's 'seven wise men' of outside forecasters - warned that the Bank of England's fear of inflation could destabilise recovery. He said on BBC2's The Money Programme: 'The Bank of England are really being ultra-cautious in the direction of fear of inflation. It is an ultra-caution that could be extremely risky, ironically, in destabilising the recovery. 'I want to see the government trusting the market forces it has liberated and also trusting the evidence of the domestic economy on the state of demand and inflation. I want to see it permitting the recovery to proceed much more rapidly than it now looks like proceeding. They should recognise that and let interest rates now drop in order to permit the economy to recover.'</p>

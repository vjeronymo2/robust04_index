			<p><P> May 1, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> GIRLS' ATHLETE OF THE WEEK: FELIX COMES BACK TO PACE EL DORADO'S SWIM TEAM  </P> <P> El Dorado High School's Corry Felix walked away from competitive swimming, but  she's back. And the time off appears to have helped.  </P> <P> Nine months ago, Felix, The Times' Athlete of the Week, walked out on swimming.  She had been in age-group competition since she was 9 and got tired of it.  Swimming in the wake of Janet Evans for the first three years didn't help,  either.  </P> <P> Her mother, Sherri Felix, understood: "Who wants to play wall tag the rest of  their lives?"  </P> <P> Corry Felix said she does not intend to do that, but she was talked into  swimming again this season by El Dorado Coach John Bowman.  </P> <P> Welcome back.  </P> <P> Saturday, she was the only girl swimmer to win two events at the El Dorado  Invitational. This season, she has been beaten only twice in Empire League  competition, despite swimming at various times in each of the individual  events.  </P> <P> "This has been a good year," Felix said. "I just figured that it's my senior  year and I'm going to go for it. I've only lost twice in league -- (Los  Alamitos' Marci) Herron beat me by just .07 seconds in the 50 freestyle and  (Los Alamitos' Stacey) St. Martin beat me by one second."  </P> <P> It's been a good year indeed. Although she'll probably swim the 50-yard free  and the 200 free at the Southern Section preliminary meet May 10-11, Felix has  qualifying times in every event except the 100 backstroke and the 100  breaststroke.  </P> <P> "She's the strength of the team," Bowman said. "We lean on her quite a bit."  </P> <P> Felix also excels at water polo. She started as a sophomore on the El Dorado  frosh-soph team and played one year of junior varsity before deciding to quit.  </P> <P> Felix was good enough to be selected to play on the 17-and-under girls'  national team that played Japan in Sacramento in December.  </P> <P> "I've had more fun playing water polo but I made more friends in swimming,"  Felix said. "I still get bored with swimming in practice, but I tell myself  it's just two more weeks."  </P> <P> TOP PERFORMERS  </P> <P> Desi Abrego struck out 20 and pitched a one-hitter to lead Saddleback to a  12-inning, 1-0 victory over visiting University in a Sea View League softball  game Friday.  </P> <P> Shona Bray, a freshman, pitched a no-hitter to lead Tustin to a five-inning  18-0 victory over Tustin in a Sea View League softball game Friday.  </P> <P> Willa Parchen, a junior, pitched her second no-hitter of the season to lead  Marina to a 1-0 victory over Westminster in a Sunset League softball game  Friday.  </P> <P> Corry Felix  </P> <P> El Dorado High School  </P> <P> * Position: Freestyle swimmer  </P> <P> * Height, Weight, Class: 6-0, 145, Senior.  </P> <P> * Last Week: Felix won the 50-yard freestyle and the 100 freestyle at  Saturday's El Dorado Invitational. She won the 100 butterfly and the 100  breaststroke in a dual meet with Loara Wednesday.  </P> <P> * Season: Felix, a sprint freestyler, has only lost twice in league  competition. She has made the Southern Section qualifying time in every event  except the 100 butterfly and the 100 breaststroke.  </P></p>

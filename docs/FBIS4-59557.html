			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report on a news conference by dismissed Yemeni Oil </F> Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun by Nabil Ghazzawi in Amman  on 14 May]    [Text] Yemeni Oil Minister Salih Abu-Bakr Bin-Husaynun told  a news conference at the Jordan Intercontinental Hotel yesterday  morning that he conveyed to His Majesty King Husayn a message  from his brother 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Yemeni vice president and  secretary general of the Yemeni Socialist Party [YSP], on Yemeni  developments since the eruption of fighting among the brothers  and sons of the one Yemeni homeland.    Bin-Husaynun said the YSP leadership welcomes any call or  mediation by His Majesty King Husayn to halt the current  bloodshed in Yemen. He praised the sincere Jordanian role  represented by King Husayn's continuing personal efforts to  spare blood, heal the rift, and maintain Yemeni unity, as well  as his majesty's continuous call on brothers to apply logic in  solving their differences. He said that Jordan, represented by  His Majesty King Husayn, and Oman represented by His Majesty  Sultan Qabus Bin-Sa'id, exerted great efforts to resolve the  Yemeni crisis, which resulted in the signing of the pledge and  accord document in Amman on 10 Ramadan. He added: The current  events would not have happened if the other party had  implemented the document, to which we adhere and which addresses  all aspects of the crisis.    Bin-Husaynun accused President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih of  obstructing the implementation of the document, especially after  he felt that its implementation would greatly curtail his  powers, and said he began the Abyan battle only one day after  the document was signed, when all Yemeni parties were still in  Amman. He said the president ordered the al-'Amaliqah Brigade  forces to start the battle, which was followed by other battles  that resulted in the destruction of some brigades of the Yemeni  Armed Forces in the south.    He stressed that the YSP is a unionist party and will  continue to be so. He said it was the YSP that achieved unity  and handed power over to President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih. He  denied reports that neighboring states are helping the YSP in  the Yemeni crisis and said these are excuses made by others. He  indicated that the coming days will reveal those who support the  unity and those who oppose it.    He stressed that guns cannot solve any problem and voiced  optimism that logic will replace force as a means to protect the  citizens and Armed Forces from destruction and eventually  preserve the unity of the homeland.    Bin-Husaynun said the discovery of oil or the existence of  oil reserves in the south is not the cause of the crisis and  war. The causes, he said, lie in political differences and  contradictions. He said oil was discovered in both the north and  south before unity and it is not the property of one person, but  all the Yemeni people.    He denied that Yemeni territory has been leased to Saudi  Arabia and said there are border issues that can be solved  through dialogue. He said a Yemeni-Saudi committee is in charge  of this.    Asked about the legitimacy of the decisions made by  President  'Ali 'Abdallah Salih and the Yemeni House of Representatives to  depose Vice President 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Prime Minister Haydar  Abu-Bakr al-'Attas, and the oil minister, Bin-Husaynun said  these decisions were stupid, illegal, and will not solve the  problem. He said the one who declares war on his people can  have no legitimacy and that all President Salih's decrees are  illegitimate.    Asked about President Salih's refusal to halt the fighting,  Bin-Husaynun said that this is unusual in society whether on the  Arab or international level. This refusal was condemned by more  than 30 states during the inauguration of Nelson Mandela in  South Africa recently.    The Yemeni minister denied the presence of troops loyal to  President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih near Aden. He said what  'Abd-al-'Aziz 'Abd-al-Ghani said in this regard is not true  because fighting is now taking place on axes more than 120 km  from Aden. He added: The southern town of al-Dali', which  reportedly fell to the hands of the northern forces, is still in  our hands. Moreover, our forces are in control of Bab el  Mandeb. He said battles are currently taking place in the Abyan  Governorate and that there were no battles in the Zinjibar and  Ja'ar areas during the past two days.    Responding to a question, Bin-Husaynun said the YSP rejects  the principle of separation as an alternative to war and as a  solution to the crisis because the party principles are based on  the unity of Yemen. He denied that Arab forces are fighting  with the northern forces, stressing that elements from some Arab  states with only political affiliations were captured.    Concluding, Bin-Husaynun stressed that the current crisis is  not a personal one between the president and his deputy, but is  due to basic differences over Yemeni issues such as authority,  security, and economic and social development.    Bin-Husaynun said he will visit other Arab states following  his visit to Jordan, including Saudi Arabia, for the same  purpose.</p>

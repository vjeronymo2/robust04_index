			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / International Company News: Hyundai close to default on bill IN A SIGN of growing financial pressure on the Hyundai group, the conglomerate's construction subsidiary yesterday said it nearly defaulted on a commercial bill this week. South Korea's second biggest conglomerate has encountered problems obtaining credit in recent weeks due to a feud with the government over the political ambitions of Mr Chung Ju-yung, the group's founder. The Hyundai group needs a constant flow of credit to service its large debt. Hyundai Engineering and Construction was unable to pay Won9.5bn (Dollars 12.2m) due on Monday on a commercial bill issued by the Korean Exchange Bank (KEB), its main creditor bank, because it had difficulty raising a loan on the secondary financial market to repay the debt. However, it cleared the debt the next day after the KEB made an emergency loan. Other Hyundai companies have also reported difficulties caused by the credit squeeze. Hyundai Motors reported that it was cutting by 40 per cent this year's planned Won700bn investment programme because of its inability to obtain some industrial loans. It was therefore slashing spending on plant and equipment to Won200bn from Won380bn, while cutting its research and development budget to Won220bn from Won320bn. The KEB has threatened to cut off industrial investment loans to five Hyundai companies, including Hyundai Motors, for six months due to alleged violations of the country's strict credit controls. Korean commercial banks operate under close government supervision. The state-run Korea Development Bank also said it would deny the group's request for Won300bn in loans for plant facilities because it feared the creditworthiness of the group would be damaged by its dispute with the government. Mr Chung recently said the Hyundai group is in danger of collapsing by the end of the year if the credit squeeze continues. But analysts believe Mr Chung is exaggerating the threat facing the group in an effort to force the government to back down from its apparent pressure on Hyundai. The disclosure of the troubles affecting the construction and auto subsidiaries may be part of this psychological campaign. Mr Chung said the collapse of Hyundai could seriously harm the Korean economy.</p>

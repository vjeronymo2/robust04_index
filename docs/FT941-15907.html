			<p>940113 FT  13 JAN 94 / Clinton to face probe into funds allegation US attorney-general Ms Janet Reno yesterday said she would seek a special counsel to investigate President Bill Clinton's involvement with a bankrupt Arkansas savings and loan institution in the 1980s. The move came at the request of Mr Clinton following mounting political pressure on the president. Mr George Stephanopoulos, a senior White House counsellor, said there were no credible allegations of wrongdoing by the president or Mrs Hillary Clinton, but 'this controversy is becoming too much of a distraction'. Complaining of a 'barrage of innuendo, political posturing and irresponsible accusations', Mr Stephanopoulos said the appointment of a special counsel was not justified by the facts and set a bad precedent. Nevertheless, he said, no one at the White House wanted the controversy over Mr Clinton's investment in Whitewater Development, an Ozark Mountains property venture, to interfere with the White House agenda. White House officials had hoped to deflect the mounting controversy over Whitewater by turning over all their documents to a Justice Department investigator. But senators from the president's own Democratic party have this week joined his Republican opponents in demanding the appointment of a special counsel, undercutting the White House's attempts to fend off the controversy as mere political feuding. by calling for a Senate select committee similar to those which investigated the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals. foreign policy image. The controversy springs from Mr and Mrs Clinton's investment in Whitewater in partnership with Mr James McDougal, owner of Madison Guaranty, an Arkansas thrift. Republicans say that Madison, which failed in 1989 at a cost of about Dollars 50m (Pounds 33.7m) to the government, was loosely supervised because of Mr McDougal's political connections and may have channelled money improperly to Whitewater and to Mr Clinton's election funds.

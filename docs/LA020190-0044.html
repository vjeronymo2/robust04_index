			<p><P> February 1, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> REFUGEES TRAPPED IN SUDANESE CITY BESIEGED BY REBELS  </P> <P> For a lucky few in the besieged, refugee-jammed Sudanese city of Juba, $350 can  buy space on a packed cargo plane to Khartoum. For others, there is virtually  no escape.  </P> <P> Refugees said that the Sudanese army is preventing thousands of frightened  civilians from fleeing to rebel-held territory outside the town to escape  shellfire, food shortages and the threat of rebel attack.  </P> <P> The Sudan People's Liberation Army, which surrounds Juba, has urged civilians  to leave before it launches a full-scale attack on the army garrison.  </P> <P> The city holds 300,000 people, two-thirds of them refugees from other areas.  Few can afford to leave through Juba airport, which is the only permitted  outlet, according to civilians who have taken the 750-mile flight north to  Khartoum.  </P> <P> One who arrived Tuesday said he paid $355 to fly aboard a cargo plane packed  with people, mainly women and children.  </P> <P> Foreign relief officials said authorities in Juba are preventing civilians from  leaving in the hope that their presence will deter the rebels from launching an  all-out attack.  </P> <P> Refugees reported short food supplies in the city.  </P> <P> No overland convoys of relief food have reached the city since September, 1988.  </P> <P> Relief flights of corn and beans from Uganda and Kenya were banned for three  months until last Wednesday by the Khartoum government, a restriction that has  allowed only limited supplies to be flown in from Khartoum.  </P> <P> The rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1983 against what it sees  as the domination of mainly Christian and animist southern Sudan by the  staunchly Muslim and Arab north.  </P></p>

			<p>921106 FT  06 NOV 92 / Scots CBI attacks upgrading of A1 THE upgrading of the A1 road between Newcastle upon Tyne and Edinburgh to dual carriageway would be a 'white elephant', the Confederation of British Industry in Scotland said yesterday. Mr David MacLehose, director of the CBI in Scotland, told the Commons Scottish affairs committee, meeting in Edinburgh, that making the whole of the 122-mile stretch of the A1 dual carriageway 'would yield minimum or negative returns on investment'. The CBI was lukewarm because most Scottish exported goods originated in the west of Scotland and used the A74/M74 from Glasgow to reach England. Mr MacLehose said it was vital that the Scottish Office, responsible for roads in Scotland, completed the project to upgrade the whole A74/M74 to motorway standard as soon as possible. In March the government announced that it would be 'desirable' for the 91 miles of the A1 between Newcastle and Edinburgh left as single carriageway to be improved to dual carriageway. The Scottish Office had argued that traffic did not justify total dualling.</p>

Konorov followed by editorial office note: </F> "Defense Industry Has Stopped and Threatens To Go Out Onto the  Street"]    [Text] The two first Saturdays of March have become truly  "black" ones for specialists of the military-industrial complex.  Perturbed at the draft state budget for 1994, which dooms the  defense industry to definitive collapse, the leaders and members  of the league for assisting defense enterprises held emergency  conferences. There was reason to be perturbed: Whereas last  year the budget provided 7.5 trillion rubles [R] for the army's  needs, and allocated R6.5 trillion, this year instead of the  necessary R84 trillion the government intends to give only R37  trillion. Some R4,478 billion will be needed to fulfill  conversion programs, but not a kopek is being allocated.    That is why members of the government, to which those  gathered in the Palace of Labor Great Hall appealed, were  invited for 12 March. The planned reduction in defense  expenditure means not only the complete stoppage of the majority  of enterprises but also the birth of a 5 million-strong army of  unemployed. The country will be deprived of its industrial  potential and Russia's national security and future will be  threatened.    Deputy Defense Minister Andrey Kokoshin assured those  assembled that the absence of representatives of the Russian  Federation Government in the hall does not mean the government's  disregard for the sector's needs. Recognizing some of the  criticism heard as fair, Andrey Kokoshin noted that plenty of  edicts and decrees have been adopted, the trouble is that there  is no mechanism for their operation. In particular, there is  permission for trading in arms but bureaucratic obstacles are  cancelling out all the efforts of the defense industry leaders  to extricate themselves from their debts.    The Russian Government has surrounded defense with excessive  taxes, putting it on the edge of survival, while at the same  time for reasons unknown to anyone and in accordance with  inexplicable rules individual joint-stock companies and concerns  receive benefits when being taxed.    The participants in the conference adopted the text of a  decree including specific measures to normalize the situation in  the sector. In particular it was suggested that Russia's  defense program be approved as soon as possible and that the  Russian Federation law "on military production" be adopted.  <H5>  From the Editorial Office: </H5>   It has become known to the editorial office that after the  appeal by Defense Minister Pavel Grachev to the Russian  president the head of state imposed a resolution instructing  that the draft budget be revised. It seems expedient to create  an independent commission which would control the entire  mechanism of the fulfillment of edicts and decrees already in  operation.</p>

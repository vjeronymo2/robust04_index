			<p>920708 FT  08 JUL 92 / A chance to fix Europe: Britain must use its presidency of the EC to champion a more democratic union All right, I admit it. My advice three weeks ago to Irish voters was frivolous and utopian. I urged them to follow the Danish example and vote 'no', in the hope that this would force European governments to come up with a clearer and more rational proposal for European union than the one contained in the Maastricht treaty. Surprisingly but sensibly, knowing well on which side their bread is butter-mountained, the Irish endorsed the treaty. Mind you, I really do find the treaty unreadable and, in parts, incomprehensible - though I am grateful to British Management Data Foundation* for supplying a relatively comprehensible edition of it, giving a consolidated text of the Treaty of Rome as Maastricht proposes to amend it, and using bold type with a different lay-out to identify the new or amended articles. I should still like to see a clearly drafted European constitution - call it federal, if you like - defining the powers of the union and expressly reserving everything else to the member states. Mr Christopher Kane, a lawyer in Seattle, has kindly written to the Financial Times offering a model clause to that effect, namely the 10th Amendment to the US Constitution which says: 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' That is certainly a lot clearer than the now famous Article 3b of Maastricht, which says that 'in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Community shall take action, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by the Community'. My union would have power to conduct a common external policy, to defend and police its external frontiers, and to ensure free circulation of goods, persons and capital throughout its territory. (Does that entail a single currency? I remain agnostic on that point.) For those purposes a central union executive would be needed, which should be accountable to an assembly elected by the people of the union as a whole. The assembly could also be the legislative body. The areas of union competence should only be extended with the consent of all member states. Such is my idea of European Union. But I know that the chances of such a union being constructed on the ruins of the Maastricht Treaty are nil. Although many English people think of the EC as a tiresomely Cartesian phenomenon, full of abstract logic and inapplicable principles, in reality it is and always has been something much more Burkean in nature. It is misshapen because it is organic, forever adapting itself to circumstances through a process of illogical but creative compromise. That is not likely to change to satisfy me or any other doctrinaire federalist. The point is eloquently explained by someone I used to regard as a much more doctrinaire federalist than myself: Mr Peter Ludlow, director of Brussels's own think-tank, the Centre for European Policy Studies. In a lecture** delivered in Stockholm in May, Mr Ludlow mounted a resolute defence of the Maastricht treaty, based on a close reading of the text. He starts from the observation that the EC is neither a purely inter-governmental organisation nor a classic federal system, but an original construct combining elements of the two. Therefore, in his view, the argument between federalists and inter-governmentalists is ultimately sterile. In his eyes the Maastricht 'three-pillar' structure, which sets both 'foreign and security policy' and 'justice and home affairs' outside the purview of the EC proper, is redeemed by the overall provision that 'the union shall be served by a single institutional framework'. It is also saved by the specific provisions which give the Council (of ministers) the main authority in these matters, as in the EC itself, while associating the Commission with the work to be carried out. Mr Ludlow points out that the Council, whose role 'at the heart of the Community's unique institutional structure' the treaty 'reaffirms and reinforces', is more than a purely inter-governmental institution, even though made up of ministers of the member states. In recent years, he says, its decisions 'have not only been much more than the lowest common denominator of agreement among those present, but have to an uncomfortable degree bound those who were least happy about them'. In saying that, he puts his finger on precisely the thing which makes so many people unhappy about Maastricht: the treaty reinforces the authority of a body which, even though its individual members are accountable to national parliaments, is not collectively accountable to any representative assembly. Does Maastricht not thereby exacerbate the EC's notorious 'democratic deficit?' Mr Ludlow concedes that this argument 'must be taken seriously'. He points out that the European Parliament already has a significant role in EC legislation, and that this role is further enlarged by the new treaty. Politically, he says, the parliament has only itself to blame for its failure to act as an 'effective watchdog'. This could be remedied if political parties did more to co-ordinate the work of the European Parliament with that of national parliaments. But he adds that the democratically elected governments of member states must 'constitute an indispensable brake on an over-mighty centre', and claims that the treaty adds checks on the growth of irresponsible power  - though these, on inspection, do not amount to much. In an appendix written after the Danish referendum, Mr Ludlow blames the result partly on the Danish political establishment for failing 'to explain to its voters at large what the European Community has always been about'. He also partly blames the Commission, which 'perhaps involuntarily, conveyed the impression that Maastricht was only the beginning of something that was to be much worse as the future unfolded'. Mr Ludlow urges the other 11 governments to 'engage in a systematic effort to explain and justify the character and logic of the EC's unique political system, as it has developed over 40 years and as it is confirmed and consolidated in the Maastricht treaty'. Such a campaign is indeed necessary, and the UK government should take the lead - both because it occupies the presidency at this crucial moment, and because it involves explaining that the union is something much more British and less continental in its nature than it looks at first sight. That may not satisfy utopians, but it may be more acceptable to seasoned practitioners on the back-benches in the House of Commons. Whether it can be made acceptable, after all, to Danish voters we shall see. If not, some further piece of untidy pragmatism can no doubt be devised to govern their future relationship with the union they have rejected. * Highfield, Longridge, Sheepscombe, Stroud GL6 7QU.

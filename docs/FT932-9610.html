			<p>930513 FT  13 MAY 93 / Squabble delays training revamp AN OVERHAUL of the education and training of young people, which would result in all 16-to-19-year-olds working towards a recognised qualification, is being delayed by a squabble between government departments, the Training and Enterprise Councils said yesterday, Diane Summers writes. Tec leaders said that they had expected Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, to publish a white paper on the issue this spring. A working party - drawn from Tecs, the Department for Education, the Employment Department and the Further Education Funding Council, submitted a report to Mrs Shephard towards the end of last year, at her request. The Engineering Employers' Federation yesterday urged a narrowing of the gap between academic and vocational training, suggesting a new national qualification that would be awarded to those who achieved three Level 3 National Vocational Qualifications, or three A-levels, or equivalent units of AS examinations and/or vocational qualifications.</p>

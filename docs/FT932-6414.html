			<p>930528 FT  28 MAY 93 / Arts: Today's Television Two films shine through what would otherwise be the kind of wilderness unfit even for Ozymandias. The first, My cousin Rachel (Channel 4, 2pm), is not the best cinematic rendition of Daphne du Maurier, but with Olivia de Havilland and Richard Burton it gets pretty close. The second is Frankenstein (Channel 4, 11.10pm), the often-imitated but never-bettered version directed by James Whale in 1931, with Boris Karloff as the monster. The only question is - how to fill the nine hours in between? Brookside (Channel 4, 8.30pm) promises much, and the return of Garden Club (Channel 4, 9pm) immediately afterwards is a boost. But BBC1 these days has a very soggy feel to it on Friday evenings, for example recycling the excellent Casualty (BBC1, 8pm) rather than bringing out a new series. One of the oddities of the year must be Edward Bond's first play for TV, a three-parter beginning tonight. Olly's prison (BBC2 11.15pm) stars the superb Bernard Hill so it probably won't be awful; though given Bond's gift for dreary obscurantism I am placing no bets.</p>

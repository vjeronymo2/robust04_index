			<p>BFN     [Text] There has been an unexpected development in the  negotiations for the formation of a new government. After  months of bitter argument, the leaders of the Northern League  and the National Alliance met for the first time this morning.  Their meeting lasted for an hour and had at its heart the theme  of federalism. Furthermore, relations between Umberto Bossi and  Gianfranco Fini appear to have thawed. Daniela Calastri  interviewed Gianfranco Fini and [Northern League Senator]  Francesco Speroni.    [Begin recording] [Fini] I certainly wanted a positive  dialogue concerning the formation of the new government. As far  as federalism is concerned, we will give the constitutionalists  time to discuss matters further and to make verifications.    [Calastri] Has Bossi agreed to your taking part in the  government?    [Fini] I believe that this problem has been overcome.    [Calastri] Do you agree with the idea put forward by the  League of a prime minister who instigates the reform to a  federal state and then a takeover by Silvio Berlusconi in the  following months?    [Fini] We did not speak about this aspect. I believe that it  up to the president to decide. I believe that President Oscar  Luigi Scalfaro must appoint Silvio Berlusconi to the post of  prime minister. [end recording]    [Begin recording] [Speroni] Finally we have managed to  convince a political force that appeared to be the heir of an  old fashioned style of centralism to sit down at the table and  discuss federalism. This is a positive thing.    [Calastri] Who will be the head of the government?    [Speroni] It will be up to Scalfaro to decide this. I agree  with Berlusconi on this point. Scalfaro must decide.    [Calastri] So certainly not Berlusconi then?    [Speroni] At present we have begun to tackle the issue of  federalism. We will speak about the government later.    [Calastri] If Scalfaro proposes Berlusconi, then this would  be fine by you?    [Speroni] There are still obstacles. First of all, we must  chose the speakers of the chambers, then Carlo Azeglio Ciampi  must resign and then Scalfaro must undertake his round of  consultations. Only then will it be possible to see who the  prime minister will be. [end recording]    [Announcer] Silvio Berlusconi was aware of the meeting  between Fini and Bossi. He said that he was very happy about  this. The news was revealed a short time ago by Gianfranco  Fini, the leader of the National Alliance.</p>

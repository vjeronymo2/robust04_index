			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Observer: Discounted 'Take the train to Windsor for an unforgettable day out' gushes NetWork SouthEast's latest lavishly-illustrated poster. Among the attractions on the poster, promoting cheap fares, is a cut-away drawing of Windsor Castle which clearly depicts St George's Hall 'primarily used for banquets' and the Waterloo Chamber which 'the Royal Family use for their Christmas pantomime'. Bit odd, since both these imposing state rooms were all but destroyed in last year's fire. British Rail would be providing the country with a better service if it encouraged trippers to visit Buckingham Palace which has been specially opened to raise money to repair Windsor Castle.</p>

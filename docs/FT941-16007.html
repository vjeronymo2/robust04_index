			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / The Lex Column: Just the ticket Eurotunnel has good reasons for setting its prices at the higher end of expectations. Due to the late arrival of rolling stock, its trains will run at only half the specified length during the early months of operation. With capacity thus constrained - and the razzmatazz surrounding the official opening bound to drum up business - Le Shuttle is unlikely to be starved of passengers this summer. Once the novelty wears off and capacity is increased to the planned level, though, special discounts and promotions will start to creep in. That will put downward pressure on passenger yields even if the pricing structure announced yesterday is kept in place. Whether yields will fall in real terms thereafter remains unanswered. The ferry operators have no incentive to enter a price war with Eurotunnel, partly because fares on the Dover to Calais route determine the prices they can charge elsewhere. Driving Eurotunnel out of business would simply mean that someone else would operate the tunnel, presumably without the burden of massive interest payments. The new operator would then be able to set prices at a level the ferries simply could not match. Eurotunnel's high fixed costs will be a strong incentive for it to run at full capacity, even if that means being flexible on prices. But without a clearer picture of demand for Le Shuttle's services, the future path of pricing is impossible to predict. The traffic forecasts in Eurotunnel's rights issue document, expected before passenger services start in May, will make for interesting reading.</p>

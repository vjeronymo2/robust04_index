			<p>941222 FT  22 DEC 94 / Gatt talks failure strains US ties with China China yesterday sought to put the best face on the failure of Gatt talks in Geneva but continued its strong criticism of what it termed US obstructionism. The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation in Beijing accused the US of breaking its promises of 'staunch support' for China's entry into the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. China's bitter reaction to the failure of the 19th session of the Gatt working party to reach consensus has also focused attention on Sino-US relations which are set to come under increasing strain over human rights and other issues. Chinese officials have been expressing concern privately about the election of a Republican-dominated Congress and the prospect of figures like Senator Jesse Helms playing a more decisive role in shaping China policy. Senator Helms, who is expected to be the new chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, has a long history of antipathy towards China and has consistently opposed renewal of China's most favoured nation trade status (MFN). After reversing its position this year on linkage between human rights and MFN, the administration has been taking a firmer line towards China  - partly because the business lobby, which urged MFN renewal, was also demanding a tough stance at the Gatt negotiations. Mr Winston Lord, the assistant secretary of state, said on Tuesday that President Bill Clinton would not accept an invitation to visit Beijing next year unless there is 'further progress on a whole range of issues' including human rights. There have been published reports that Vice-President Al Gore might go to Beijing, but these were denied yesterday by his press office. Political relations will continue to be prickly, but the countries appear to want to avoid a dangerous break. Last week, reports surfaced of a confrontation between a US warship and a Chinese submarine off the Chinese coast. The incident was played down in Washington, indicating that he administration did not want to push Beijing too far. US officials in Beijing were seeking yesterday to play down negative fallout from the argument over Gatt. 'While we would have liked to see a lot more progress especially on market access negotiations, the door has not been closed,' said one official. 'Nobody has walked away from the table.' In Washington, Mr Lord said the US 'genuinely' wishes to see China in the Gatt and the World Trade Organisation, the successor organisation. 'We have indicated a willingness to try to find some procedure whereby if they get in later, they could still be a founding member of the WTO,' he said. 'That's to underline our sincerity in wanting them in this organisation.' Chinese officials insist 'the conditions for re-entry into Gatt are fully ripe which constitutes the most important reason why China's re-entry has gained extensive support,' the Moftec spokesman said. But western officials in Beijing said that China appeared to have seriously miscalculated requirements for Gatt entry and was now reduced to 'bluster' in an attempt to disguise responsibility for the failure. These officials also blame political uncertainties in Beijing with signs that the end may be drawing near for Deng Xiaoping, the paramount leader, for Chinese inflexibility in Geneva. China's leaders may be unwilling in the present uncertain political climate to risk criticism from entrenched economic interests likely to be affected by the continued liberalisation of the economy. 'The top people (in China) want to be in the WTO,' an Asian diplomat in Washington said. 'But the vested interests know the price. The state industries would lose their protection and their subsidies.' Beijing's disappointing offer on market access in both the services and agricultural sectors is one of the main stumbling blocks to a resolution of the Gatt dispute. But China and the US face an early hurdle in what may well prove to be a difficult new phase in their relations. The suspension of talks last week on intellectual property rights threatens a serious argument over copyright issues. Although the US succeeded in nudging China into strengthening its intellectual property laws, the difficulty arises over enforcement. US officials understand that this is partly a problem of the central government being unable to impose its will on the provinces, the Asian diplomat said. In any case, the US trade representative has put China on a priority list of foreign countries infringing copyright covenants and given it until January 1 to put its house in order. The talks appear to be stalled and, without agreement, the US will release a list of possible sanctions, which would further complicate Gatt discussions. Chinese officials yesterday were at pains to emphasise that, in spite of the disappointment in Geneva, Beijing remained committed to economic reform.</p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SMALL BUSINESS / JANE APPLEGATE: NEW IDEAS TO HELP IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE  </P> <P> Computerized catalogues and multiline cordless telephones are two new products  designed to help small businesses improve customer service in the 1990s.  </P> <P> Xentek, a Vista, Calif.-based power supply maker recently launched its  catalogue-on-a-disk as a way to encourage computer designers and engineers to  include Xentek power supplies in their new computers and accessories.  </P> <P> Betty Trenberth, Xentek's former marketing director, sat down with advertising  executive Peggy Lefebvre to figure out a way to "add pizazz" to Xentek's  marketing program. Because Trenberth and Lefebvre are both technically  oriented, they decided to put Xentek's 32-page product catalogue on a computer  disk.  </P> <P> "Our idea was to have the disk become an electronic salesman that would help  educate customers about the products," said Lefebvre, whose Anaheim advertising  agency specializes in helping high technology clients promote their products  and services.  </P> <P> The catalogue-on-a-disk idea has met with such positive response from clients  that Lefebvre has set up a division in her agency to produce computerized  catalogues.  </P> <P> And Trenberth has left Xentek to open her own Vista-based business called  Teledisk. She said Teledisk will specialize in developing software programs for  putting catalogue information on computer disks.  </P> <P> The concept is not totally new. A few years ago, Trenberth said Motorola  released its product catalogue on a computer disk, but did not do much to  promote it.  </P> <P> Trenberth said any company with a catalogue of 20 pages or more could save  money by putting the information on a computer disk. She said the major expense  is paying a computer programmer to put the catalogue information on a disk. In  Xentek's case, the job went to a staff member. After that, updating the disk is  simple and inexpensive.  </P> <P> "It costs about $1.80 a copy to produce a two-color, 36-page catalogue,  compared with about 82 cents to produce each computer disk," said Trenberth.  She said the computerized catalogues are designed to be easy to use even by  people not totally comfortable with computers.  </P> <P> So far, response from Xentek's customers to its 5 1/4 -inch floppy "Powerdisk"  computerized catalogue has been positive, Trenberth said. One computer company  recently asked for six Powerdisks so every engineer could keep one next to his  or her computer. Currently, Xentek customers who select products from the  Powerdisk call in their orders by telephone, but Trenberth said eventually  orders could be placed over phone lines with the computer.  </P> <P> Trenberth said any company with an inventory of products to sell should  consider making product information available on a disk in addition to or  instead of a printed catalogue.  </P> <P> Cordless telephones have been around for a while, but last month American  Telephone &amp; Telegraph released a new, multiline Merlin model designed  specifically for busy small businesses. Unlike the single-line home version,  the new phone can handle up to five lines simultaneously.  </P> <P> Liz Morris, an AT&amp;T spokeswoman, said the new cordless phone was developed  to enhance the Merlin phone system, which is designed to serve small businesses  needing two to 100 phone lines.  </P> <P> Lew Mitchell, owner of Lew Mitchell's Orient restaurant on Wilshire Boulevard  in Los Angeles, was among the first AT&amp;T customers to buy the cordless  phone.  </P> <P> "Our business is based on service," said Mitchell. "People come here to eat,  but they also come here to do business."  </P> <P> Instead of asking customers to walk across the room to accept calls, he brings  the phone to their table.  </P> <P> "I just walk in there and say, 'This is for you,"' said Mitchell. "I can leave  the phone on the table and trust him not to call Uganda."  </P> <P> Mitchell, who paid about $500 each for the phones, said he considers them a  good investment.  </P> <P> Other phone makers also offer multiline cordless phones. For example, Radio  Shack has a two-line model for about $160.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Where the Hot Prospects Will Be in the New Decade  </P> <P> Children's fitness centers, senior day-care centers and sock shops are among  the hot business prospects for the 1990s, according to Entrepreneur magazine.  Kiddie gyms are popping up across the country, as are day-care centers designed  to care for elderly people. These senior centers provide a lower cost  alternative to home care for ambulatory seniors who enjoy being part of a  group.  </P> <P> Brew pubs, which are restaurants with small beer breweries, are also a good  investment. On the West Coast, the number of brew pubs has grown from 50 to 82  in recent years. (Gorky's Restaurant in Hollywood is one of the newer ones.)  </P> <P> Mobile automotive services and home inspection services are also attractive  business opportunities, according to the magazine's editors.  </P> <P> Selling bottled water is also a good way to make money, since the sale of  bottled water doubled from $1 billion in 1985 to $2 billion in 1988. The  public's interest in health, combined with the taste of some local tap waters,  has encouraged new bottled water companies to compete against the industry  veterans, Sparkletts and Arrowhead.  </P> <P> If you like children, opening a day-care center has great potential this year.  Currently, about 2 million children are spending their time in 65,000  child-care centers across the country. But, every month, more mothers return to  work and are looking for somewhere safe and stimulating to leave their  children. Being a wedding or event planner is also an option for the 1990s  because people are too busy to organize things themselves. Or if you are a  computer whiz, there will be about 8 million home computers sold this year, and  most of those new buyers will need training and instruction.  </P></p>

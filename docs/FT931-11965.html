			<p>930130 FT  30 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce among big winners from Tornado deal THE Tornado order is a relief for British Aerospace's 450 sub-contractors which have shed thousands of jobs between them because of recession and the collapse in defence spending. One of the biggest beneficiaries is Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine group, which will supply two RB-199 jet engines for each of the 48 strike aircraft. The engines and spares, worth about Pounds 500m, will be made by an international consortium comprising Rolls-Royce, FiatAvio, the Italian motor group's aerospace subsidiary, and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the Daimler-Benz subsidiary. The UK group's share of the work is about Pounds 250m. Components will be made throughout Britain, but all the engines will be assembled at Rolls-Royce's Bristol plant, which employs 6,000 - fewer than 600 working directly on the RB-199. GEC-Marconi is responsible for about 30 per cent of the value of each aircraft, providing electronic navigation, radar and engine management systems. The order ensures employment for about 6,000 people across six sites - in Edinburgh, Basildon, Portsmouth, Stanmore in Middlesex, Rochester in Kent and Pitchfield in Hampshire. The company was waiting to hear detailed specifications, which could considerably increase the value of the order. A possible add-on it has developed for the Royal Air Force is a thermal imaging and laser-designator pod, which guides bombs to their targets. Smiths Industries, the avionics group, will supply electronics worth an estimated Pounds 200,000 per aircraft, including a head-up display and a weapon-aiming computer. All the work will be done at Smiths' largest factory, in Cheltenham, which employs 2,000 people - 1,000 fewer than two years ago. Smiths is also keen to see whether orders will materialise from Saudi Arabia for Hawk jet trainers, since dual-control avionics make them almost as valuable for the group as the Tornados. Lucas Industries, the Birmingham-based motor and aerospace components group, will supply nearly Pounds 50m worth of engine and flight-control systems, windscreens and switches. The order will be spread across seven sites - Wolverhampton, Coventry, Bradford, Hemel Hempstead, Luton and two in the Birmingham area, Lucas said the order would help secure jobs, although only 2,000 would be directly involved in the Tornado order. Since the group started restructuring in October it has shed 400 aerospace jobs from a total of more than 8,000. Mr Frank Turner, head of Lucas's aerospace division, said: 'This is excellent news at a time of difficult trading in the aerospace industry.' TI Group, the specialist engineering company, estimates it has won work worth Pounds 25m - mainly through Dowty, the aerospace engineer which it took over last year. Dowty will supply landing gear and associated hydraulics from its plants in Cheltenham and fuel-control systems from Wolverhampton. TI will also make engine rings from a plant in Birmingham. The factories involved employ a total of 2,500 people. Many smaller suppliers will benefit. MBM Technology, part of Morgan Crucible, employs 200 people in Brighton and makes the weapon-release systems. It said it had not yet heard from BAe, so could not estimate the value of the work.</p>

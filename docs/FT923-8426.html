			<p>920811 FT  11 AUG 92 / McDonnell Douglas launches overhaul to cut costs MCDONNELL Douglas, the financially stretched US aerospace company, yesterday announced a large cost-cutting overhaul of its military and government business. The St Louis-based company will either sell or seek a joint venture partner for its helicopter business, and close a parts plant in Columbus, Ohio, with the loss of 1,000 jobs. The commercial aircraft operations of its Douglas Aircraft subsidiary will be unaffected. McDonnell Douglas has been buffeted by the downturn in military spending, and by upheavals in the commercial airline industry. Two weeks ago, the company unveiled a 51 per cent drop in second quarter earnings, with all three of its manufacturing segments reporting lower profits. The shake-up will place McDonnell Aircraft, McDonnell Douglas Missile Systems and McDonnell Douglas Helicopter in one division under Mr John Capellupo, president of McDonnell Aircraft. Mr Kenneth Francis, president of McDonnell Douglas Space Systems will head a second division, comprising the space business, McDonnell Douglas Electronics Systems, the C-17 military transport project and other military work which formed part of Douglas Air-craft. The group said the new structure would 'lead to other staff consolidations on a regional basis'. It is creating a new 'office of the chairman', with five senior executives, to decide the mechanics of the restructuring in the next three months. McDonnell said the time and money required to build the helicopter business into a market leader was too great. 'We will seek a joint venture partner that will enable us to reach that objective, or we will seek an appropriate buyer,' said Mr John McDonnell, chairman. The company has been pursuing a similar policy with its commercial aircraft division, talking to potential foreign partners, principally Taiwan Aerospace. The Columbus plant which is closing makes parts for the C-17 military transport aircraft, and the MD-11 and MD-80 commercial aircraft. Yesterday, McDonnell shares, which slumped after the second quarter figures were released, rallied by Dollars 2 1/8 to close at Dollars 37 1/2 .</p>

			<p><P> September 23, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ON THE WATERFRONT: SEAFOOD COOKERY MADE SIMPLE  </P> <P> Something different for dinner?  </P> <P> How about sauteed squid? Spaghetti sauce with mussels? Or steamed shrimp?  </P> <P> When it comes to preparing food such as squid, mussels or even the less exotic  shrimp, many ordinary steak-and-potato cooks are intimidated by these mollusks  and crustaceans that live beneath the sea.  </P> <P> It's enough to make biologist and amateur seafood cook Joe Conner toss his  fish-shaped potholder into the air in frustration.  </P> <P> Instead, Conner, who teaches biology at National University in Irvine, has come  up with an unusual seafood cooking class he offers throughout Orange County.  The class is designed to take the mystery out of seafood cooking by taking the  mystery out of the delectable creatures themselves. "There is no mystery  involved," Conner says. "They (students in his class) hold and feel the shrimp.  They learn that shrimp are crustaceans, related to arthropods, invertebrates  with jointed feet. That they have so many legs because they use them to swim."  </P> <P> Under Conner's tutelage, students also learn about lobsters, clams and fish.  And they get to touch and hold each subject. "It makes them feel more confident  in handling seafood," he says.  </P> <P> In the end, after Conner the biologist has taught his students all about the  tasty critters from the deep, then Conner the cook demonstrates how to prepare  a simmering bouillabaisse or seafood chowder.  </P> <P> A new series of Conner's classes, offered by the Newport Beach Parks, Beaches  and Recreation Department, will begin Oct. 2 at the Oasis Center in Corona del  Mar. The class will cover crustaceans, fin fish and mollusks and will include a  session on chowder recipes from around the world. Students will learn about  seafood ecology and the scientific names of common delicacies. They will also  learn what parts of the crustaceans, fin fish and mollusks are edible.  </P> <P> While the Newport Beach class is aimed at adults, Conner has offered similar  cooking classes for children, including preschoolers, through the Dana Point  Harbor Youth and Group Facility. There is no age limit, he says, but "you have  to be able to handle a knife and a fork."  </P> <P> Conner's classes usually "start off with shrimp," he says. "Shrimp are the  least expensive and the easiest to cook. Mollusks -- including mussels, squid  and clams -- on the other hand, people have to warm up to," he explains. Conner  recommends buying medium-size shrimp and says you should look for ones that are  translucent, firm and not crushed. "And there should never be a fishy smell,"  he warns. "No seafood smells fishy when it is fresh."  </P> <P> After teaching his students all about the biology of the shrimp and how to buy  fresh shrimp, Conner turns his attention to shelling and deveining. "A lot of  women don't know how to devein a shrimp -- and women still do the bulk of the  cooking," says Conner, hastening to explain his reference to females, who make  up the bulk of his classes.  </P> <P> As a biologist, Conner explains that it is not a vein that you are removing  when you devein a shrimp. "They (his students) think you take out the part from  under the shrimp, but it is the back part, the intestine . . . that you remove.  You don't remove the part underneath. Deveining is just a more genteel term  than removing the guts," he says.  </P> <P> Even in classes made up mostly of children, Conner says, students participate  with enthusiasm and, in the end, are willing to eat the results of their  culinary efforts. In one recent class in Dana Point, Conner taught a group of  9-year-olds to fillet and cook a trout. And in another children's class, he  dissected a squid, then chopped it up and tossed it into an aromatic  bouillabaisse.  </P> <P> Conner, who says his entire family is made up of "good cooks," began cooking  when he was working on his Ph.D. at UC San Diego. "I began cooking to distract  me and to overcome my phobia of flunking out of school," he says.  </P> <P> For information on Conner's upcoming seafood cooking class in Newport Beach,  call (714) 644-3151.  </P> <P> Seafest continues -- Newport Beach's Seafest, a series of ocean-related events  held throughout the city, will continue this weekend with the Wooden Boat  Festival, the Tall Ships Festival and the annual Character Boat Parade.  </P> <P> The third-annual wooden boat festival will be held Saturday and Sunday and will  feature more than 60 classic and contemporary wooden boats plus displays,  demonstrations and seminars. There'll even be a boat-building contest in which  contestants must actually construct and launch a boat during a specified period  of time. The event is sponsored by the Marine Division of the Newport Harbor  Area Chamber of Commerce. Admission is $3. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The  festival will take place at the Sea Scout Base, 1931 W. Coast Highway, Newport  Beach.  </P> <P> On Saturday, the tall ship Californian, back from a 10,000-mile voyage, will be  open for tours from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., also at the Sea Scout Base. On Sunday at  1 p.m., the Californian will join other tall ships, including the Pilgrim, for  an exit parade out of Newport Harbor.  </P> <P> Also on Sunday, the 29th annual Character Boat Parade, featuring more than 50  decorated boats, will take place from 1 to 5 p.m. in Newport Harbor.  </P> <P> Shearlean Duke is a regular contributor to Orange County Life. On the  Waterfront appears each Saturday, covering boating life styles as well as  ocean-related activities along the county's 42-mile coastline. Send information  about boating-related events to: On the Waterfront, Orange County Life, The  Times, 1375 Sunflower Ave., Costa Mesa, Calif. 92626. Deadline is two weeks  before publication. Story ideas are also welcome.  </P></p>

			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Trade War Fears: Wine importers face risk of going into the red AMERICA'S wine importers were in a state of shock yesterday after the US's announcement on Thursday night of a 200 per cent tariff on European white wine imports. The measure, if enacted, would treble the price of an average bottle of French white wine, from Dollars 9 to Dollars 27 (Pounds 17.40). Although California wineries stand to gain, in the short term, from the effective exclusion of European white wines from the US market, they too are hoping for a swift resolution of the trade dispute. 'This is not a positive development for the American wine industry,' said the Wine Institute in San Francisco, a trade group representing California wine producers. The US wine-makers fear retaliation from Europe, which is their principal export market. Last year, Dollars 49m-worth of Left: checking white wines at a vineyard near Macon. France is seen as intransigent. American wines were sold in the EC, most from California. The European white wines covered by the proposed import tariffs represent about 7 per cent of the total US table wine market, according to the Wine Institute. If the tariffs are imposed, US wineries might increase their domestic sales, but this could be balanced by a loss of sales in Europe if the EC retaliates, the industry group fears. But an aide to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, yesterday held out the prospect that the wine tariff - 90 per cent of the Dollars 300m punitive package unveiled by the US - could yet be lifted before it takes effect on December 5. The decision to target white wines was aimed mainly at France, which has average annual exports of Dollars 125m to the US. The French are viewed by Washington as the most intransigent in the current round of trade talks. But the US tariffs would have a devastating impact on Italian white wine sales, which last year were Dollars 115m, and to a lesser extent on German sales. The decision to hit European white wine exports rather than red wines or champagnes was made because Washington is trying to maximise the persuasiveness of the tariffs on the EC while minimising the impact on US interests. In other words, US white wine is a more palatable alternative to European whites than is US red wine. US champagne production is also minimal compared to that of France. The anguish of wine aficionados was evident yesterday. In New York, Dr Lucio Caputo, president of the Italian Wine &amp; Food Institute, said he was 'very scared'. Mr Michael Aaron, the owner of Sherry-Lehman, a leading new York wine merchant, said calls for white wine were pouring in yesterday morning. He said a number of distributors could go bankrupt as a result of the decision. One US official, in a jocular mood, said: 'Think of this as an educational opportunity to get to know the delights of wines from California's Napa Valley.'</p>

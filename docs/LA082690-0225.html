			<p><P> August 26, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC'S PICK: 'BULL DURHAM'  </P> <P> In this sweet and sexy comedy set around a rat-poor minor-league baseball team,  the Durham Bulls, writer-director Ron Shelton is absolutely the diamond's best  friend.  </P> <P> He has packed his off-beat love story with a handful of resonant characters,  all of whom, in one way or another, worship Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon,  center). The veteran catcher on the team (Kevin Costner, left) has the task of  smatrening up the blazing young pitcher (Tim Robbins). Fierce, funny and  uninhibited, with the famous baseball clown Max Patkin (right) playing himself.  (TMC Wednesday at 10 p.m.) Sheila Benson  </P></p>

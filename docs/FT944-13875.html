			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Southern Africa eyes prize of peace: As Mozambique and Angola edge warily toward a lasting peace, Michael Holman, Nicholas Shaxton and Peter Stanley assess the likely impact on the region If the 60m people of southern Africa were capable of collectively crossing their fingers, and uttering a silent prayer, they would be doing so this week. The outcome of Mozambique's elections and Angola's peace talks will determine whether the region can, for the first time in three decades, secure peace. Here, in the two countries where the old southern Africa was born some 400 years ago, the final stages in the shaping of the new southern Africa are taking place. It was on the coasts of Angola and Mozambique that the Portuguese seafarers Vasco da Gama and Bartolomeu Dias laid claim to an African empire which was to last until 1974. That year the foundations of white rule began to crack, for the coup in Lisbon in 1974 not only paved the way to independence for Portugal's African colonies, it marked the beginning of the end for minority regimes in Rhodesia and South Africa. The days ahead now see the final phase of that process, which has been hastened by the collapse of communism and the end of superpower rivalries. In Mozambique, 6.5m voters go to the polls tomorrow and Friday in the country's first multi-party elections. If they proceed without mishap, the country can begin to develop an economy shattered by civil conflict and external aggression. In Angola, talks aimed at bringing an end to the civil war may be within reach of success, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, United Nations secretary-general. Should Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita leader who forced the collapse of the 1991 settlement when he refused to accept his defeat by President Eduardo dos Santos in the election the following year, agree to the terms negotiated over the past nine months in the Zambian capital Lusaka, the last piece of the regional settlement falls into place. And if both Mozambique and Angola manage to secure a lasting peace in the critical days ahead, it would mark a watershed for the region, led today by newly democratic South Africa. Free of racial division and civil war, without external aggressors, and accepting the principles of democracy and civil rights, and with market driven economic planning, southern Africa will have a common cause: to develop the potential of lands rich in oil and natural gas, minerals, marine resources and agricultural produce, with the bonus of thousands of miles of fine beaches encompassing Af-rica's finest wildlife res-erves. But although the foundations of the new region are in place, much can yet go wrong before the edifice is finally complete. In Mozambique Mr Afonso Dhlakama, leader of the erstwhile rebel Renamo party and the main challenger to President Joaquim Chissano's ruling Frelimo party, seems to be hinting that he, like Mr Savimbi, might not accept defeat at the polls. Meanwhile peace may yet prove elusive in Angola, notwithstanding the optimism of Mr Boutros Ghali, who in his report to the Security Council said that 'the peace talks are now in their final phase'. The collapse of Angola's transition to democracy is fresh in the minds of the Mozambique electorate. Mr Chissano, whose party has ruled Mozambique since independence, is widely expected to win, but made clear that Mr Dhlakama would be part of a coalition government only on his terms, unconditionally accepting Frelimo policies. The differences between the two parties are not ideological, however, but stem from regional, ethnic and personal rivalries. 'First we are asking whether Mr Dhlakama will accept my programme with no preconditions,' said the president. 'I think it is necessary to have opposition, but in parliament, not in the administration. . . Renamo is not an opposition in ideological terms.' Some observers suspect that Mr Dhlakama is preparing the way for a return to the bush war. He has repeated recent warnings that Renamo would not tolerate electoral fraud in the presidential and parliamentary polls. Unlike Angola, however, the integration of rival armies is more advanced and the UN monitoring force is 7,000 strong - nearly 10 times the Angola contingent - and is backed by 2,400 international observers. Both sides, however, are thought to have substantial arms caches and to have kept back soldiers in reserve. Whichever party wins the elections, only a coalition government can effectively tackle the legacy of 400 years of colonialism and 30 years of war. Meanwhile in Angola the UN secretary-general's optimism is not shared by the people in Luanda. 'If the two sides show the necessary political will, the outstanding issues can be resolved within a short time', Mr Boutros Ghali said recently, and urged the Angolan government and Unita to conclude the peace talks by October 31. Should a final deal be struck, it would involve a revival of the 1991 accords. But the collapse of the transition in late 1992 inspired new hatreds. The Unita fighters used hidden weapons stockpiles rapidly to capture much of Angola's territory, while in the main towns and cities MPLA vigilante groups hunted down and killed Unita supporters. The renewed distrust will make disarmament of both sides, envisaged under the new peace plan, a difficult exercise. The two sides do agree that Angola needs a UN force at least 6,000 strong to oversee a ceasefire. Both government and Unita officials are doubtful, however, about the world's willingness to pay for an exercise on this scale and provide the manpower required. Without a settlement, the conflict seems set to drag on as neither side is likely to win the war. Unita is able to make much of the countryside ungovernable, but is unable to capture MPLA urban strongholds. Neither side seems short of funds. For the government, proceeds come from more than 500,000 barrels of oil that flow daily from mainly offshore oilfields. For Unita, an estimated Dollars 250m (Pounds 158.2m) worth of diamonds have been leaked out from its territory, which includes the main diamond producing areas. Generals and politicians on both sides openly recognise that the war is unwinnable. And the size of the prize at stake is so great that they know they will not readily be forgiven if they squander the opportunity for peace. Angola is in the fortunate position of being able to fund its recover by using the oil and diamond wealth that currently funds the war, and take part in the wider reconstruction of the region. For the first time southern Africa is attracting the attention of emerging market funds, thanks both to political change in South Africa and economic reforms across the continent. Although the bulk of the Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn the market might attract will go to South Africa, nearly a dozen stock markets are now competing for business - in Botswana, Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Traditional obstacles to investment  -ranging from artificially fixed exchange rates and exchange controls to government hostility - are being eased or removed altogether. For the first time in 400 years, the region will be free of systems of racially based hegemony, free of conflict, free of the ideological differences that marked the post independence era of Africa, and able to harness the power of South Africa. If Mozambique and Angola succeed in their transition to lasting democracy, the people of southern Africa may be able to look back on the days ahead as the start of a new and more prosperous era.  --------------------------------------------------------       THE EVENTS THAT SHAPED A NEW SOUTHERN AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- 1974  Portugal's dictatorship ousted.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1975  Portugal cedes independence to colonies, including       Angola and Mozambique, where guerrilla wars began       in early 1960s.  Portuguese flee, and civil wars       break out.  South African troops invade Angola;       Cuba begins troop build-up.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1976  Mozambique closes border with Rhodesia, where white       minority had unilaterally declared independence       from Britain in 1965.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1976  Guerrilla war in Rhodesia escalates as forces led       by Robert Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo infiltrate from       bases in Mozambique and Zambia.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1979  Lancaster House settlement on Rhodesia paves way       for the independent state of Zimbabwe; elections       in 1980 won by Mugabe's Zanu party.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1988  US-brokered deal secures independence for Namibia       from South Africa in return for Cuban troop       withdrawal from neighbouring Angola.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1989  Sam Nujoma, leader of South West Africa People's       Organisation, wins Namibia's independence election.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1990  South Africa releases long-imprisoned black       nationalist leader Nelson Mandela  -------------------------------------------------------- 1991  Ceasefire in Angola civil war.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1992  Angolan elections confirm President Eduardo dos       Santos' MPLA in power, but opposition Unita leader       Jonas Savimbi refuses to accept outcome.  Civil       war resumes.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1992  Ceasefire in Mozambique civil war.  -------------------------------------------------------- 1994  Mandela's African National Congress wins first       all-race elections in South Africa.  --------------------------------------------------------                          ANGOLA  -------------------------------------------------------- The 1974 military takeover in Portugal brought Angolan independence the following year but not peace.  Civil war continuedm exacerbated by South African invasions and the arrival of Cuban troops.  A ceasefire resulted in elections in 1992, with the ruling MPLA defeating the opposing Unita movement.  Unita refused to accept the outcome; war resumed.  Now, peace talks may be close to success.  --------------------------------------------------------                         NAMIBIA  -------------------------------------------------------- A 1988, US-brokered settlement saw the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola in return for South African acceptance of multi-party elections in Namibia.  These took place in the following year and were won by the South West Africa People's Organisation, which is still in power.  --------------------------------------------------------                        ZIMBABWE  -------------------------------------------------------- Once the fiefdom of the British South Africa Company, the territory (then Rhodesia) became a British colony at the turn of this century.  The settlers won self government in 1923, unilaterally declared independence in 1965, but bowed to sanctions and guerrilla war in 1979. In 1980 elections, the Zanu party came to power, where it stays today in partnership with the Zapu party.  --------------------------------------------------------                       MOZAMBIQUE  -------------------------------------------------------- As in Angola, independence in 1975 was traumatic, marked by the exodus of more than 200,000 settlers of Portuguese origin and a civil war encouraged first by white Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) and then by white South Africa. A 1992 peace pact brought the war to an end.  This Thursday and Friday, 6.5m voters go to the polls in the country's first multi-party elections.  --------------------------------------------------------                     SOUTH AFRICA  -------------------------------------------------------- More than 350 years after Dutch explorer Jan van Riebeeck founded a settlement at the Cape of Good Hope, white rule and its apartheid racial policies finally gave way in the face of sanctions and domestic opposition with the release from prison in 1990 of Nelson Mandela.  He was elected president of South Africa this year in the country's first all-race elections.  --------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 9, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TEACHER IS PRAISED, AND FINALLY NAMED  </P> <P> In my many years as a teacher I have encountered several fine and dedicated  teachers, but there is one individual who is such a cut above and so  exceptional that he is in a class by himself. You covered his class project in  December when it launched the Mesa shuttle. Your coverage was excellent in  every respect -- except you did not mention the teacher's name.  </P> <P> Now Scott Stark's class has been chosen to represent the state of California in  the national NASA "name the Challenger replacement shuttle." His name should be  in lights for the year-in and year-out teaching he does. He inspires, motivates  and excites all students to truly achieve their best. He does not forget  students when they leave his classroom. He follows their high school and  college careers with involved interest and guidance of class selection and  career opportunities.  </P> <P> Most of all, he makes those people believe they can achieve the impossible. Now  the state knows of him, and I'm convinced the country will as well when the  winner is announced in May. For now your paper needs to recognize him by name:  Scott Stark, Mesa View sixth-grade teacher.  </P> <P> JUDY M. SCHWANTES  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 7, 1990, Thursday, Valley P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> GLENDALE GIRL, 4, PINNED AGAINST WALL BY PICKUP TRUCK IS CRITICAL  </P> <P> A 4-year-old Glendale girl was in critical condition today after a parked  pickup truck rolled and pinned her against a wall, police said.  </P> <P> Sharon Judy Montez suffered a crushed skull in the accident at 2:30 p.m.  Wednesday at the apartment complex where she lives in the 1000 block of Western  Avenue, Sgt. Dean Durand said.  </P> <P> Because only young children witnessed the accident, investigators are unsure  what happened. Durand said several children from the apartment complex were  playing in and around the pickup truck that was parked facing a wall.  </P> <P> "From all indications, one of the children released the brake on the truck and  it rolled," Durand said. "The truck hit her and pinned her against the wall."  </P> <P> Several children started screaming when they saw that the girl was pinned.  Adults who were in the apartments ran to her aid and called for paramedics. She  was taken to Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, where she was in critical but  stable condition, spokeswoman Cheryl Trinidad said.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by E.Cz., E.K., and Ma.S.: "Efficiency of Policy </F> of Silence; SLD Applies PSL Methods"]    [Text] The communique issued after Tuesday's [8  February] talks between the Polish Peasant Party [PSL] and the  Democratic Left Alliance [SLD], which was general and apparently  laconic, is what we wanted to see the most--one can hear such  statements in SLD circles. During the talks, both sides  confirmed that the coalition will continue, they said they would  jointly support the government's budget draft, and they also  said they decided the Finance Ministry will remain in the SLD  domain. The conditions which had been set earlier by SLD will  probably be the subject of further talks and negotiations. The  name of the new finance minister (who will also be a deputy  prime minister for economic affairs) will be announced by SLD  prior to the second reading of the budget draft, that is to say  next week at the latest.    It seems that SLD leaders' serious fears concerning the  chances for maintaining the governing coalition, were caused  first of all by the prime minister's television appearance where  he was critical of a straight, liberal continuation of economic  policies, and at the same time he stressed the need to include  social needs in the budget to a greater extent. The second  reason was Lech Walesa's involvement in the crisis. He reminded  everyone of his constitutional powers and of a possibility of  presidential rules. SLD was relieved to see the compromise with  PSL, despite Marek Borowski's exclusion from the government  being the price for the compromise. According to SLD Spokesman  Zbigniew Siemiatkowski, the president's involvement at the last  moment proves that if there was anybody to gain from the crisis  in the government, it was the president.    Andrzej Zakrzewski, chief of the president's Political  Service Bureau, when asked to comment on the view that the  president--by his signing of Borowski's resignation--had an  impact on the speedy signing of the new agreement within the  coalition, said that Lech Walesa "does not get involved in the  coalition's affairs, but he simply takes note of what the  coalition and the government 'produce.'" When asked whether he  thinks the president accepted Borowski's resignation very fast,  Zakrzewski replied: "The president is always fast...."    Apart from three fundamental issues--the coalition's  stability, support for the government's budget draft, and  leaving the finance minister and deputy prime minister in the  domain of SLD--no other topics were discussed.    But SLD hopes it will be able to return to talks with PSL  concerning the conditions that had been set earlier which--among  others--pertained to defining the powers of deputy prime  ministers, consultations within the coalition concerning  appointments of new local governors, and establishing the post  of government spokesman. According to SLD, the most important  thing right now is to enact the budget in the form proposed by  the government; Marek Borowski--who after his resignation will  return to work as a Sejm deputy in the Sejm Economic Policy,  Budget, and Finance Commission--will "protect" the budget draft  on SLD's behalf.    In its contacts with the mass media, SLD decided to apply  PSL's method. SLD says it was a bad idea to be open in  supplying information to journalists during the most recent  conflict. "Right now, we will talk less and do more"--SLD  decided. While recognizing the efficiency of PSL's silence,  left-wing politicians intend to closely watch the political  scene and wait for PSL's next move.    Aleksander Kwasniewski, a leader of SLD, refused to give any  information to journalists yesterday. PSL politicians say he  was full of bitterness. According to unofficial information, a  joint principle of commenting on the recent events as little as  possible, was adopted during the evening coalition talks. There  are probably no chances for establishing a post of press  spokesman for the government. Government circles say that  establishing such a post would mean that the prime minister's  information policy is different than the government's.</p>

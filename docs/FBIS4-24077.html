			<p>BFN     [Text] Parliament June 22 SAPA -- Serious shortcomings had  developed in both the combat and logistical support capabilities  of the South African National Defence Force [SANDF] because of  cutbacks in defence spending, the SANDF said on Wednesday [22  June]. A document released by the chief of the SANDF, Gen Georg  Meiring, said the defence budget would have to increase in  future years.    The defence allocation had declined by 44 percent in real  terms during the past five years and was now equivalent to the  defence budget of the mid-1970s. Capital spending on armaments  and equipment had dropped from 44 percent of the overall defence  budget in 1989 to 28 percent last year and the SANDF could no  longer maintain even minimum strategic technological levels.    "The annual reductions in the defence budget not only  necessesitated a reduction in the diversity of capabilities  available within the SANDF, but also caused a drastic reduction  in the quality and depth of combat capability."    Gen Meiring said the costs of integrating non-statutory  forces such Umkhonto We Sizwe [Spear of the Nation, ANC armed  wing] into the SANDF would increase defence spending in the  short term, as would the costs of retrenchments resulting from  such rationalisation.    Although defence laid claim to a large proportion of state  revenue, it also contributed to the national economy through  production, employment and foreign exchange earnings. He said  the export of armaments and related equipment had earned South  Africa R750 million [rands] in foreign exchange between April  1993 and January 1994.    While the conventional threat at present was low, South  Africa had to maintain all its existing combat capabilities.  Moderate, expandable force levels were needed to enable the  SANDF to gear up to war force levels if and when needed.</p>

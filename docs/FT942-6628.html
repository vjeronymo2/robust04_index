			<p>940528 FT  28 MAY 94 / Books: Balancing act - Children's books A good children's picture book is not an illustrated story, and it is not, as some adults think, just a handful of sentences with a few dazzling pictures. Sendak describes the perfect picture book as a visual poem and some are just that, while others are nearer to the art of film making. The very best author-illustrators instinctively understand the subtle balance between words and pictures. John Burningham is one such author-illustrator and Courtney (Cape Pounds 8.99, 32 pages) is a truly interactive book - one that interacts with the child's imagination. Courtney is a simple story about a mongrel who plays the violin, cooks wonderful dinners and juggles to entertain the baby. It sometimes seems that Burningham is seeing just how far he can go in artlessness - his scratchy penlines, childlike crayoning and sketchy pencil marks could easily appear crass, but it all works magnificently. His choice of words demonstrates that, as well as an illustrator, he is one of the best writers in the business. Truly a visual poem. Posy Simmonds has produced another superb picture book with Bouncing Buffalo (Cape Pounds 8.99, 24 pages). This tale of how two children save their parents' ailing antique shop from the horrible Mr. Fowler is told in a mixture of comic-strip and more conventional picture book style. The story has an Ealing comedy feel and is told cinematically, with the rhythmical balance of long shots and close ups, light and dark, and a stunning use of contrasting emotional colours. The comic-strip form for children's books can be tiresome, but Posy Simmonds understands just how to carry the flow of the story with the text, the speech bubbles, and the illustrations all working together. Most importantly, she leaves the vital gap between pictures and words - the gap that is filled by the child's imagination. Captain Abdul's Pirate School by Colin McNaughton (Walker Books Pounds 9.99, 32 pages), is a hilarious yarn from the diary of Maisy Pickles, whose stinking dad sends her to stinking Pirate School to toughen her up. The interest here lies not in the plot (pupils mutiny and sail for the West Indies), but in the Bash Street humour and incidental details. I was particularly pleased to meet Beryl Flynn sailing on The Golden Behind, and to find out from the pirate teachers that six plus three equals about eight. Colin McNaughton's bold line and wash style is perfect for the light story, and deceptively well drawn. Ted Dewan, who re-tells and illustrates Three Billy Goats Gruff (Scholastic Pounds 8.99, 32 pages), is better known for his non-fiction but makes the difficult leap from one genre to the other with ease. The book's subtitle is 'Three Strikes Year Out' and Dewan links the story tenuously with baseball. The artwork has echoes of American comics rather than the Beano style that influences so many British illustrators, and the tale comes across with a real freshness due to the dramatic illustrations, the brash hand-written lettering, and a funny lively text. A Letter to Granny (The Bodley Head Pounds 8.99, 24 pages), written by Paul Rogers, is the story of a girl's everyday world transformed by her imagination. Lucy dreams of tomorrow when Granny will come, and that her house is surrounded by sea. Inevitably, her parents do not notice. This rather familiar tale is transformed, like Lucy's world, by John Prater's stunning artwork. He uses soft pencil and bold, brilliant watercolour washes to reflect the watery feel of the story perfectly. One of the strengths of Walker Books is the design and My Cat Jack by Patricia Casey (Walker Books, Pounds 7.99, 24 pages) is no exception. This beautiful book is simply a celebration of the animal yawning, stretching, scratching, purring and washing, with some of the best drawings of a cat I have ever seen. Anthony Browne's next book, King Kong, will be published by Julia MacRae Books in October.</p>

			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> POST OFFICE KUDOS  </P> <P> There have been a number of recent articles concerning the U.S. Postal Service  here in San Diego. Many of us in the mailing industry strongly disagree with  the extremely negative comments in these articles and some of the comments  attributed to Rep. Jim Bates.  </P> <P> As co-chair of the San Diego Postal Customer Council, president of the San  Diego Direct Marketing Club, and the owner of one of San Diego's largest  direct-mail production companies, I think Margaret Sellers is an excellent  postmaster. She is responsible for over 11,000 employees, almost 300 facilities  and an annual budget in excess of $450 million. She has the task of managing  these responsibilities as a government agency and a competitive business. While  trying to provide top-notch service, Postmaster Sellers has to deal with  constraints imposed on the Postal Service from Washington.  </P> <P> Many of my employees and I have had a great deal of contact with postal  employees at all levels. While there is always room for improvement, our  positive experiences with the Post Office far out weigh the negative.  </P> <P> RAYMOND G. ELLIS  </P> <P> San Diego  </P></p>

			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BILINGUAL EDUCATION  </P> <P> Acuna makes a valid point in saying that the needs of Latino students are  neglected in the LAUSD. But to characterize "bilingual education" as inherently  good simply because it is targeted at Latinos, and to characterize LEAD  (Learning English Advocates Drive) as "English-only," indicates a lack of  research into both subjects.  </P> <P> The LAUSD's Bilingual Master Plan is neither a format for learning English, nor  a true "bilingual" program, but a monolingual Spanish program. Under the new  plan, most Latino students are taught in Spanish for all but 20 minutes of the  day, and can graduate high school without ever demonstrating proficiency in  English.  </P> <P> LEAD, a nonprofit organization of concerned teachers, parents and education  experts across the country, is dedicated to reforming -- not eliminating --  bilingual education by emphasizing modern English language development  techniques. Not only does LEAD recommend that the native tongue of non-English  speaking children be used to clarify difficult new words and concepts, whenever  possible and appropriate, as English is being learned, it actively promotes  foreign language study for monolingual English-speaking students.  </P> <P> Moreover, no officer of LEAD ever made the statements Acuna attributed to it.  For what it's worth, I am bilingual, and I never learned a second language by  being taught exclusively in English.  </P> <P> Acuna neglects to mention national surveys which indicate that 80% of Latino  parents of limited-English speaking children believe bilingual program emphasis  should be placed on teaching English.  </P> <P> The days of sink-or-swim can never be allowed to return, but neither should  Latino children be abandoned in an institutionalized underclass simply because  of an inability to communicate effectively in English upon entering the  American public education system. The real civil rights travesty is to deny  children the tools they will need to function in our nation's 96%  English-speaking business community.  </P> <P> LEON WORDEN  </P> <P> President, Santa Clarita Valley  </P> <P> Chapter of LEAD  </P> <P> Valencia  </P></p>

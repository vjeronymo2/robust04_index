			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro to write off CDollars 3bn to cover shake-up Ontario Hydro, North America's biggest power utility, has decided to swallow several doses of bitter medicine in one gulp with write-offs totalling between CDollars 2.9bn and CDollars 3.5bn (Dollars 2.63bn) to be charged against 1993 income. The write-offs are part of a top-to-bottom shake-up which was put in motion a year ago after the appointment of Mr Maurice Strong, former secretary-general of the United Nations Environment Programme, as chairman. Mr Strong has cut a swathe through the government-owned utility with the aim of transforming it from a bureaucratic, financially-stretched organisation into an operation run along business lines. Ms Eleanor Clitheroe, chief financial officer, said the charges give the utility 'a clean slate to proceed with its debt reduction programme'. The aim is to reduce Hydro's heavy debt burden, currently about CDollars 35bn, by at least one-third over the next decade. The write-offs announced yesterday are roughly double the figure projected six months ago. They include the cost of cancelling long-term uranium contracts negotiated with Denison Mines and Rio Algom at prices far above present market levels, and a write-off of surplus generating capacity. Details of the capacity write-downs have yet to be determined. Ms Clitheroe said that by taking the write-offs in one lump, Hydro will boost its 1994 income from CDollars 250m to CDollars 600m. Thanks to lower costs and improved operating performance, it now estimates that its operations virtually broke even last year, compared with earlier forecasts of a CDollars 200m operating loss. Hydro's problems came to a head after growing resistance from its customers to steep electricity price rises, which averaged 7.3 per cent a year between 1988 and 1992. Mr Strong has promised to freeze power rates this year.</p>

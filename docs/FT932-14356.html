			<p>930419 FT  19 APR 93 / Survey of Business Air Travel (22): Increasingly hostile dogfight - Airline slots / A place on the tarmac THE captain of the British Airways shuttle to Belfast was apologetic. 'You could be forgiven for thinking we were going via Rome,' he told his passengers. 'We have taxied about four miles around Heathrow, but we have the next slot in the queue.' Flight BA4572 operates in one of the many slots which together give BA a commanding share of traffic at Europe's busiest international airport. Slots, a prized possession at busy airports, give carriers access to runways where air traffic is limited because of congestion. The Belfast shuttle is one of thousands of flights in Europe which depend on traffic flows controlled by slot schedules. The system regulates departures and arrivals at London's Heathrow and Gatwick, Frankfurt, Milan and Munich. By 1995, increasing congestion is expected to require slot restrictions at Geneva, Rome, Stuttgart, Paris Orly and Dusseldorf. Increasing frustration at slot restrictions has now prompted several carriers to seek changes in the traffic management of Europe's air space. Aware of complaints that smaller airlines get a poor deal in the share-out, EC transport ministers last year decided to tighten the rules so that airlines would lose slots they don't use. But some operators, such as Virgin Atlantic Airways, claim the moves do not go far enough. It wants slots confiscated from large carriers to make way for new ones. For the business traveller, the argument turns on whether a more equitable distribution of slots would provide more choice and better service for the consumer. Independent carriers such as Virgin at Heathrow and ANA at Tokyo Narita argue that airlines operating existing routes would be forced to improve services with more direct competition. That competition depends on rival carriers being awarded slots at the right time to mount an effective challenge. The bodies governing slot allocation are not so sure. They are reluctant to endorse a sweeping upheaval of the slot allocation system and prefer instead to increase availability through piecemeal improvements in air traffic control and terminal capacity. In terms of consumer choice and service, it is questionable whether travellers would see an immediate benefit if the authorities embarked on a Robin Hood strategy of taking slots from the rich - mega-carriers such as United, American, BA and JAL - to give to the poor. The small independents, however, claim their whole future depends on slots. Without them their hopes for expansion and a larger route network will be frustrated. Virgin, for example, has route licenses to fly to San Francisco and Washington but cannot begin services from Heathrow without slots. The equation is quite simple: no slots, no service. The European Commission is now considering a complaint that slot allocation at Heathrow is unfair. Virgin hopes the ruling, expected in the summer, will transform take-off and landing patterns at London. Whatever the Commission's decision, the big carriers will fight tooth-and-nail against surrendering slots. They are a heavyweight lobby and many, including BA and Lufthansa, will argue that their sizeable share does not inhibit fair competition. BA is extremely reluctant to give up its hold on 39 per cent of Heathrow slots and says it compares favourably with the control exercised by US carriers at their home hubs. American Airlines controls 65 per cent of slots at Dallas; United 68 per cent at Washington and 48 per cent at Chicago; Delta has a 70 per cent share at Atlanta. The best bet for smaller carriers seeking slots lies not with allegations of market-rigging and complaints to Brussels. They should concentrate instead on making gains out of the increasingly hostile dogfight being waged by the mega-carriers under the auspices of air liberalisation. United, for example, has decided to test Britain's commitment to liberalisation by agreeing to buy the Gatwick-Philadelphia licence from USAir on condition it can transfer the route to Heathrow and use it to serve Chicago. If the move is approved it could create opportunities for other airlines to press their case. In the end, however, Heathrow will reach saturation point and there will be fewer slots. For all their lobbying of politicians and transport user groups, the airlines seeking clearance at the world's most popular hub will have to wait for gradual improvements in technology and runway capacity that should, in time, make more slots available. At Heathrow, this piecemeal expansion is overseen by three different bodies: the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), in charge of air traffic control; BAA, the airports operator which provides gates and terminal capacity; and Airport Co-ordination Limited (ACL), the final arbiter of UK slots. Under the system, no slots can be allocated without the approval of two men. Dr Peter Brooker, chief scientist at the CAA, decides the sustainable runway capacity at Heathrow and Gatwick. He has set the runway rate at Heathrow at 76 movements an hour. This compares with 67 an hour in 1981 and reflects improvements in air traffic control and the use of 'fast taxiways' that enable aircraft to join or exit runways with greater frequency. Mr Peter Morrisroe, managing director of ACL, is Britain's independent slot co-ordinator. He decides where to allocate capacity following bi-annual meetings with the CAA, BAA and the airlines concerned. Most slots at EC airports are in the gift of co-ordinators employed by national flag carriers. Britain - reacting to complaints of slot rigging - has now urged its EC partners to follow Heathrow's example and set up an independent body to make allocations. According to Virgin, however, London's independent co-ordinator is too partial in favour of BA and it wants a radical change. 'We believe slots should be allocated for a 10-year period and should be handed back if there is a change of use,' the airline says. Such initiatives are not welcomed by all the independents. British Midland, the short-haul carrier with 14 per cent of Heathrow slots, is pursuing another course. It wants to see US-style 'mixed-mode' operations which allow aircraft to take off and land on the same runway. At present, Heathrow's two runways are reserved for one or the other. Sir Michael Bishop, British Midland's chairman, argues that such a system would free more slots for some of the 62 airlines operating out of Heathrow. But the CAA says there is no leeway for mixed-mode operations. 'A take-off between two landing aircraft would be difficult to introduce because of the Vortex Separation Standards which ensure a three-mile gap between each aircraft movement,' it says. Mixed-mode slots are also constrained by environmental regulations designed to minimise the airport's impact on residential areas. Any change would require political intervention, according to the authority. 'The biggest move to get more slots is to extend the working day. With only an extra half hour in the morning and in the evening you'd get an extra 74 movements,' the CAA adds. The proposal is backed by British Midland, which says it would create slot vacancies by enabling long-haul flights to land earlier. Sir Michael claims European airports are also following US trends by allowing slots to be leased or sold by one carrier to another. In the US a peak period slot at a leading hub has an estimated value of Dollars 1m. An American carrier may own 20 or more gates at a particular hub which it can sell or lease to its rivals. But the European Commission is opposed to the idea. 'The pricing mechanism used in the US is not considered appropriate for Europe because it would increase the costs considerably and would not be in line with the policy of the Community to increase competition,' Commission officials say. The system of buying and selling slots is fraught with difficulties because most European carriers do not own airport gates; they share them. Gate control lies with the airport operators. Limitations on use of gates and runway capacity has forced airlines to maximise the use of existing slots by switching routes and introducing larger aircraft into their schedules. British Midland, for example, has abandoned services from Heathrow to Liverpool and used the slot to serve Frankfurt. Using bigger aircraft for existing slots might avoid increased congestion on the runways but can lead to jams in the terminals. To solve that problem a number of European hubs including Paris Charles de Gaulle and London Heathrow have embarked on ambitious plans to create more terminal capacity. BAA says its proposed fifth terminal will handle a further 10m passengers by the turn of the century and 30m by 2015 - without any increase in the number of slots available. 'Overall, the planes coming in are going to get larger,' says BAA. 'We expect an increase of 2 per cent in average size by the time the new terminal opens. 'Until then we have to hope that slot allocation will be more flexible. But aircraft will still be stacking at the runway for some time to come.'</p>

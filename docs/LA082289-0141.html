			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: A NEW DAY AND NIGHT FOR BLAIR BROWN  </P> <P> The number of television shows that have been returned by popular demand can be  counted on a couple of chewed fingernails. The number of much-beloved programs  that popular demand has failed to bring back is, on the other hand, very large.  But cable has now entered the equation in a positive way.  </P> <P> "The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd," which premiered on NBC in the summer of  1987, survived the network numbers racket for only two seasons. Yet it was  beloved by critics and by quite decent-sized audiences, who responded to Jay  Tarses' series about a single, independent-minded woman riding the pleasures,  pains and perplexities of Manhattan life.  </P> <P> Those who appreciated the program's candor, charm and sensitivity included some  executives at the Lifetime cable channel, to which "Molly Dodd" transferred  last April. New shows for a second cable season will start shooting in  February.  </P> <P> This is relieving news for all the admirers of the series and its resilient  star, Blair Brown. Actors profess, not wrongly, an ability to play anything.  But the fact is that some roles are a good deal more becoming than others, and  what actors pray for is a particular congruence in spirit and understanding  between the player and the part.  </P> <P> "Molly Dodd" was created for Brown by Tarses, a friend for years before the  show was launched. "We used to talk about each other's lives a lot," Brown said  one afternoon last week.  </P> <P> While it is folly to presume too many one-to-one match-ups between player and  part, it seems clear that Brown and Dodd are, equally, free spirits with a  taste for unconventionality, and that both are alternately tough-minded and  vulnerable, having pushed themselves to the edge of nervous collapse. As Brown  has said, she has tried all the current nostrums, up to and including Rolfing.  </P> <P> "Actually, I'm a very cynical person," Brown says, "but this last year has been  so terrific I've had very little to complain about."  </P> <P> Brown finds marriage to be the death of romance, she says, and she does not,  thus far, believe in it. Her long relationship with actor-director Richard  Jordan produced a son, now 7, a second-grader who lives with Brown in  Manhattan. Although the relationship ended, she and Jordan remain close and  cordial.  </P> <P> At the moment, Brown is in rehearsal for "The Secret Rapture," a play by her  close friend David Hare, which is a substantial hit at the National Theatre in  London, already into its second cast.  </P> <P> The play, which Hare is directing, opens for what amounts to a preview run at  Joe Papp's Shakespeare Festival on Sept. 8 and then moves to Broadway and the  Barrymore Theatre for an extended run starting Nov. 2. "It's easier than an  out-of-town tryout," Brown says. She will have to leave the cast in February to  resume her other life as Molly Dodd.  </P> <P> She has also, during a hiatus from the series, made a feature film,  "Strapless," similarly written and directed by Hare and shot in Britain.  Co-starring Bridget Fonda and Bruno Ganz, it will be seen at the New York,  Toronto and Telluride film festivals in search of an American distributor,  which it does not have. Two firms that were interested in it, Atlantic and  Island, have both, as Brown says, "gone bust in recent days."  </P> <P> She and Fonda play sisters living in London, she a doctor who has gone to  London to work for the national health system "because that's the way she wants  to practice medicine." Ganz enters her life, changing it in all the ways  romantic love can: positively, negatively, chaotically, unpredictably. "In the  larger texts," Brown says, "it's about politics and medicine."  </P> <P> Now that cable shows have become eligible for Emmys, Brown has received a  nomination for her "Molly Dodd." "You're never supposed to admit that you care  about awards. But that nomination meant so much to me, just because we're doing  the show on cable now. It seemed to me it's so good for the business. It just  confirms that there is an alternate network these days. And it's nice to know  there's life after the Big Three."  </P> <P> Moving to cable meant a lower production budget, but not for the first time  necessity became the mother of creativity. "We couldn't have as many sets,"  Brown says, "which meant writing longer scenes. And they made the show much  fuller."  </P> <P> As the critics observed, a show that had been refreshing for its concern not  with zowie exit lines but with nuances and the shadings of relationships and  moments became even more admirable in its reversals of sitcom formulas.  </P> <P> By the bizarre logic of network thinking, "Molly Dodd" during its two NBC  seasons was shot in Hollywood, although Molly lives in New York, as in actual  fact do Brown and most of the cast members and all but one of the regular  writers.  </P> <P> "It was crazy," Brown says. "It meant I had to stay in a hotel and we had to  shuttle to New York to pick up location shots." Now, for Lifetime, the show is  shot at the Astoria Studios in Queens. One of the pleasures surrounding the  family feeling of "Molly Dodd," with its permanent cadre of players and  writers, is that opinions can be voiced. "I can say, 'That take is terrible,  that scene is terrible, let's try something else.' My early experience in the  movies was that whatever you said, it was, 'Yes, dear, and now will you shut up  and get on with it?' 'Molly Dodd' is what you long as a theater actor, to work  with people again and again in a really collaborative way."  </P> <P> Her early television experience was unsettling: "I did 'Wheels,' an appalling  miniseries with Rock Hudson. I loved working with him. He was such a nice man.  And I shouldn't complain. I got more jobs off 'Wheels' than from any of the  more artistic work I've done. But I felt as if I was on the Lusitania, and all  my own sensors temporarily disengaged."  </P> <P> At the Astoria Studios one day last season, "Molly Dodd" was sharing a sound  stage with "The Cosby Show." The week's Dodd script had Molly surviving an  attempted rape. Brandon Tartikoff, the NBC chieftain who had initially liked  "Molly Dodd" but grew disenchanted with the show's candor as well as its  ratings and killed it, came by the stage to look in on Cosby.  </P> <P> He found himself on the "Molly Dodd" set as the attempted rape scene was in  progress. Producer Tarses, says Brown, whirled around and said, "Funny as ever,  eh, Brandon?"  </P></p>

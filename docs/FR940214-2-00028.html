The export facilities will have a capacity of 40,000 Mcf per day. SoCalGas estimates the cost of the Bowker Road Alternative to be about &sect;350,000 and the cost of the Calzada Justo Sierra Alternative to be about &sect;590,000.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> SoCalGas says that the export facilities will be used to provide natural gas transportation service from receipt points on the SoCalGas systems to the United States_Mexico border. The rates for this service will be rates on file with, and approved by, the California Public Utilities Commission. Any third-party shippers or exporters will be required to obtain the proper export authorization from the United States Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A connecting pipeline to receive the exported natural gas will be built on the Mexican side of the border and operated by Petroleos Mexicanos. SoCalGas also describes certain other related facilities which are scheduled to be built by it in Imperial County. SoCalGas says that these facilities, (about 31 miles of pipeline, with appurtenances), are under the jurisdiction of the California Public Utilities Commission.

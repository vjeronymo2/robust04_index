			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Secretary proposes to make explicit that record-keeping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is a basic standard of administrative capability. Those new  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions that do not have adequate record-keeping capability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be approved to participate in the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. The record-keeping capability of participating  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions would be evaluated when the institutions seek  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> renewal of their program participation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to revise the satisfactory progress  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards to require that the maximum time frame for completion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of an undergraduate program be no longer than 150 percent of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published length of the educational program and that increments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the maximum time frame not exceed the lesser of one academic  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> year or one-half the published length of the educational program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The establishment of the maximum time frame must, as usual, take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> into account a student's enrollment status. Thus, an institution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that offers a four-year degree program (as listed in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution's catalog) would have to establish a maximum time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> frame of no more than six years for completion of the program by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a full-time student. The time frame could be proportionally  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> longer for a half-time student. The Secretary emphasizes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement would set an upper limit on the period of time  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for which a student may receive Title IV, HEA program aid. An  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution would not be required to expel or otherwise remove a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student from the educational program after the expiration of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> maximum time frame (unless, of course, the institution has a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar requirement for students who do not receive Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program assistance). The Secretary has a longstanding policy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under which 150 percent of the length of an educational program  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is considered to be a reasonable period in which a serious  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> student should be able to complete the program. The Secretary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> notes that this proposed time frame is also consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposals made by the NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA (57 FR 30826). The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Secretary does not believe that Title IV, HEA program aid should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be provided beyond the point at which a student can reasonably be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected to complete his or her educational objective.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary proposes to expand and clarify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements for reporting information about possible fraud or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> illegal misconduct related to the Title IV, HEA programs. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations would eliminate the current provision for an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to refer suspected instances of fraud or other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criminal misconduct involving Title IV, HEA program assistance to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a State or local law enforcement agency rather than the Office of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Inspector General (OIG), if more appropriate. Instead, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed regulations would require the institution to notify only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the OIG. The proposed regulations would also remove a related  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement_that the institution report to the OIG, for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> calendar year, all relevant referrals to State or local law  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement agencies, as this would no longer be necessary if all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referrals were made directly to the OIG. Upon receipt of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> information, the OIG will notify and work with the appropriate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials to resolve the issue. The Secretary is proposing to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> amend this section to streamline the referral process and reduce  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the burden of reporting information.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Currently, under this provision governing the reporting of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> instances of suspected fraud and criminal misconduct,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institutions are required to report only information regarding  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicants for Title IV, HEA program assistance. Another  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed change would expand the reporting requirement with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> respect to both the types of misconduct to be reported and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individuals and entities involved in the misconduct. In addition  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the information currently required, an institution would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to report information regarding illegal conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving the eligibility and funding of the institution and its  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> students through Title IV, HEA programs believed by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> institution to have been committed by any employee, third-party  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs. This provision would specify that illegal conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would include possible fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> breach of fiduciary responsibility, or any other illegal conduct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Secretary believes it is important to investigate any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible illegal misconduct (i.e., misconduct where formal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criminal charges have not been brought) in addition to possible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criminal misconduct. The intent of this expansion is to specify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that institutions should report not only acts that constitute  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fraud or criminal conduct, but any and all other illegal conduct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> involving Title IV, HEA programs in which an employee or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> third-party servicer might have engaged.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

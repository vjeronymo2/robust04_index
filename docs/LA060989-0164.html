			<p><P> June 9, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: NEW PLAN OFFERED ON PAN PACIFIC SITE  </P> <P> Opponents of commercial development of the fire-gutted Pan Pacific Auditorium  said Thursday they want to see the building's streamlined front facade moved so  that it faces Beverly Boulevard and becomes a gateway to Pan Pacific Park on  the Westside. The rest of the site should be converted to parkland, they said.  </P> <P> "We support public uses for Pan Pacific Park. We do not support it as cheap  land for yet another movie complex," said Laura Lake, president of Friends of  Westwood, a slow-growth group.  </P> <P> She said her organization and other groups will urge county Supervisor Ed  Edelman to reject a proposal to rebuild the 54-year-old auditorium and use it  for an ice skating rink, movie theaters and restaurants.  </P> <P> "We are of the belief that the developer is trying to resurrect a commercial  development project that is dead at this point in time," said Diana Plotkin,  president of the Beverly Wilshire Homes Assn.  </P> <P> A spokesman for developer Joseph Kornwasser said earlier this week that the  project could be completed in two years despite the damage caused by the May 24  fire.  </P></p>

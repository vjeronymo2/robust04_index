			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Design of new houses attacked A poll of homebuyers has found widespread dissatisfaction with the design of the 180,000 homes built in the UK each year, Simon London writes. The poll, by Gallup for Riba Journal, the architectural magazine, found that 60 per cent of housebuyers were dissatisfied with the design of new houses. A similar percentage doubted whether they offered value for money and more than 40 per cent questioned construction quality. Other criticisms centred on the degree of choice and flexibility offered. Nine out of ten people said housebuilders were not providing enough choice in terms of design and more than 75 per cent wanted greater flexibility over the layout of rooms. The poll found that 3 per cent of the housebuying public would prefer to live in an ultra-modern home. This suggests that there is a market for about 45,000 high-tech units each year.</p>

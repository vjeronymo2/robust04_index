			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by correspondent Mikhail Svetlichnyy] </F>   [Text] [Svetlichnyy] Russian Defense Minister Pavel  Grachev's official visit to Belgium that began today is  undoubtedly closely connected to the NATO Council session that  ended on Wednesday, and in whose work the Russian minister took  part for the first time. It was the Belgian side's active  support that to no small degree helped on this.    At today's news conference, Pavel Grachev stressed the  special role played by Belgium and Defense Minister Leo Delcroix  in bringing NATO and Russia closer together. The Russian  minister said that the timescale for signing the partnership  documents now depends not on Russia but on NATO, on how quickly  it examines the parameters for partnership proposed by Russia.    In an interview for the NTV company, Belgian Defense  Minister  Leo Delcroix noted that it is simply necessary to take into  account the weight and significance of Russia as a great nuclear  power. For Russia is not Albania, with all due respect to  Albania, he noted.    If relations between Russia and the western partners are  more  predictable, then evidently this cannot be said of the former  eastern bloc allies. A question from a Polish journalist to  Pavel Grachev on his attitude toward Poland's joining NATO  seemed more than just strange, for according to her they are  seriously afraid of complications in the internal political  situation in Russia.    [Begin recording] [Grachev] What can we say when it is heard  from the mouth of this Polish girl that they are saying that  Poland wants to join NATO in order to ensure its future safety  against the processes going on in Russia. What is this, a  challenge?    But of course we will consider that this is a lack of  understanding. At state level our Russian-Polish relations are  good, and I hope that they will be strengthened.    [Svetlichnyy] During these two days have you had the feeling  that some states participating in Partnership for Peace, present  like you at the meeting, are playing a game against Russia? I  mean the two days of the session's work.    [Grachev] You know I do not want to draw any final  conclusions. But those states that make up NATO, or are part of  NATO, I have reached the unambiguous opinion that these states  want to see Russia inside Partnership for Peace. As regards  other states who have signed up, you know it is still early, I  repeat, to draw any conclusions.    There were no open yeses or noes. We will see. [end  recording]    [Svetlichnyy] Today the Belgian and Russian defense  ministers  laid wreaths at the eternal flame in the center of Brussels.  This may not just have been a formality. The Belgian minister  has said that his country is ready to be an intermediary between  Russia and NATO. One has the impression that it is frequently  much simpler for Russia to talk with W. European NATO member  countries than with her former E. European allies.</p>

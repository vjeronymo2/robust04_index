			<p>940112 FT  12 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Savills benefits from return of confidence Savills, the estate agent and surveyor, revealed the benefits of a further recovery in confidence in London's commercial property market when it announced interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.19m, against Pounds 163,000. Turnover for the six months to October 31 rose 20 per cent to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 11.9m), with improved performances from all core businesses. Mr George Inge, chairman, said the most noticeable improvements had been in the London residential business and in commercial investment, where there was 'more optimism now than there has been for several years'. Savills is holding Pounds 5m in cash and is looking for opportunities to expand. One area of focus is likely to be property financing. It set up Savills Finance Holdings in August, which should be profitable in its first year. Mr Inge described it as an area of great potential. Operating profit from commercial property more than doubled to Pounds 568,000 (Pounds 250,000), while agricultural and residential property contributed Pounds 511,000 (Pounds 176,000 loss). Group earnings per share was 2.1p (0.03p) and the directors announced an interim dividend of 0.75p.</p>

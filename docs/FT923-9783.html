			<p>920803 FT  03 AUG 92 / Karabakh talks crisis averted The collapse of international talks aimed at ending fighting in the disputed Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh was averted last night when Azerbaijan and Turkey decided to return to the negotiating table, Reuter reports from Rome. The two delegations stormed out of the 11-nation talks earlier in the day as the representative of the disputed territory's Armenian leadership started to address the meeting. They later agreed to shelve a dispute with the meeting's Italian presidency which delegates said could have arisen from a translation error.</p>

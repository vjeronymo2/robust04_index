			<p>921013 FT  13 OCT 92 / US political clout won tank deal, says Vickers: Lost contract with Kuwait could cost British jobs VICKERS, the UK engineering group, yesterday accused the Bush administration of using political leverage to clinch a crucial Kuwaiti tank deal for the US company General Dynamics just ahead of the American presidential election. The company is considering asking the British government to protest to Kuwait over the way the decision was handled. Vickers was hoping for a contract from Kuwait worth Pounds 1bn for Challenger 2 tanks, including spares and support. One of its two tank assembly lines at Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne could face closure if other Gulf export deals for the new tank fail to materialise by the end of next year. News of the Kuwait setback follows announcement last week of a wage freeze at the two plants, each of which employs about 800 people. General Dynamics yesterday confirmed that Kuwait had signalled its intention to buy 236 of its M1A2 Abrams tanks. Details were still to be negotiated. It would not comment on allegations of administration pressure on Kuwait but said it welcomed any US official support. According to several reports, Mr Dick Cheney, the US defence secretary, wrote to the Kuwaiti authorities stressing the importance of the deal for continued US military aid in the region. Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers' chief executive, said he was 'not in any way critical' of the British government's role. The company had received full backing from Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, who visited Kuwait last month, and Mr John Major, the prime minister, had expressed a personal interest in the deal. The Ministry of Defence said yesterday: 'We share in the disappointment.' Last year Vickers won a British government contract worth Pounds 500m to produce 140 Challenger 2s, partly on the strength of the tank's export prospects. Sir Colin said he believed Vickers was able to offer Kuwait a lower price than General Dynamics. It had submitted its bid only last week and was not expecting a decision until next month. 'We've not even discussed our price with them,' he said. General Dynamics said results from Kuwaiti trials earlier this year would show that the Abrams 'outperformed Challenger in every category'. The trials focused on mobility, firepower and engineering. Sir Colin said, however, that the Kuwaitis initially appeared to be 'favourably impressed' by the Challenger. The company thought it had done 'quite well' in firing trials. Vickers claims Challenger, although slower on the ground, has the edge in crew protection and in maintenance costs. Losing the Kuwaiti contract is the second upset for the Challenger 2 after its exclusion from a competition in Sweden for a similar-sized order. Production work on the UK Challenger order, due to last until 1998, would not on its own be enough to sustain the two plants, Sir Colin said. The most immediate export prospect is Oman, which is seeking about 60 tanks. But Vickers would need a larger contract - either from Saudi Arabia, which is in the market for more than 200 tanks, or the United Arab Emirates, which is set to buy 390. Observer, Page 21</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Quito, 23 Jun (EFE) -- Three Ecuadoran Indians were  killed in clashes with military forces, who were enforcing the  state of emergency and clearing the country's highways,  Legislator Maria Eugenia Lima has stated.    The highways have been blocked since 13 June by Indians  protesting the recent approval of an agrarian law. The agrarian  law was declared unconstitutional in the past few hours.    Legislator Lima reported today that two of the three people  were killed last night in the Andean town of Guamote, Chimborazo  Province, some 180 km south of Quito, when soldiers were  evicting a group of Indians from a church.    Guamote is near the city of Riobamba. The cathedral in the  city of Riobamba was occupied this morning by 100 Indians who  are supported by Victor Corral, bishop of the diocese. A church  spokesperson told EFE that Victor Corral will reiterate his  support for the Indians upon his return from Rome tomorrow.    Luis Macas, Quechua leader and president of the  Confederation  of Indian Nationalities of Ecuador (Conaie), said the third  Indian was killed last night in the Andean province of  Tungurahua, some 110 km from Quito, when soldiers were forcing  Indians to return to their communities.    Last week, the Conaie reported that three other Indians were  killed in Canar Province, which is farther south of Tungurahua  and Chimborazo. The Conaie said they were "victims of  paramilitary landlords." Other reports, however, attributed the  deaths to merchants who claim their stores had been looted by  demonstrators.    The Conaie also reported previously that an Indian was  killed  in Tungurahua. According to press reports, he was struck by a  driver who attempted to evade the barricades.    The incidents occurred 48 hours after the state of emergency  was declared Tuesday by Conservative President Sixto Duran  Ballen, who is 73 years old.    Immediately after the deaths were reported, increasing to  seven the number of dead since the protests began on Monday of  last week, the Constitutional Guarantees Tribunal (TGC)  suspended the provisions of the agrarian law, declaring it  unconstitutional.    Carlos Jaramillo, TGC president, said the six tribunal  members decided unanimously "to totally suspend the provisions  of the law because it was found to have flaws in form and  substance."    "The law was declared unconstitutional and its provisions  were suspended. I have arranged to send the TGC resolution to  the Supreme Court immediately so that the law will be  definitively suspended," Jaramillo added.</p>

			<p><P> March 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TWO GANG MEMBERS HAD KEY TO MAKE THEIR ESCAPE FROM JAIL, LAPD SAYS  </P> <P> Two gang members who still are missing used a key to escape from the jail at  the 77th Street Division during the weekend, police said Thursday.  </P> <P> The fugitives, Buford Bates, 24, and Eric Wright, 18, are members of the  Rolling 60s Crips gang and had been arrested on suspicion of kidnaping and  robbery, Police Cmdr. Bill Booth said. They had been taken into custody during  a crackdown on drug trafficking in South-Central Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "Our investigation has established that they escaped (with) . . . a key," Booth  said. "We're not certain how. . . . We start with the strong assumption of  negligence or poor procedure someplace."  </P> <P> However, Booth did not rule out the possibility that someone inside the police  station may have given the prisoners a key that fits cell doors and a back  door. The key was later found outside the building, Booth said, but he declined  to say where.  </P> <P> Bates and Wright were among 33 suspects arrested last week during joint raids  by the FBI, anti-gang police detectives and agents of the Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms. Police said they are suspected of stealing 11 guns,  including a MAC-11 assault weapon, from a man they allegedly kidnaped on Jan.  30.  </P></p>

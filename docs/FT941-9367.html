			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / UK Company News: Adscene expands with Pounds 2m purchase of free weekly titles Adscene Group, the Canterbury-based newspaper publisher, is expanding its interests with the acquisition of JJ Priebe Holdings for Pounds 2.1m, satisfied by the issue of 646,154 shares at 325p. Hereford-based Priebe publishes two free weekly newspapers with a combined circulation of about 105,000. The purchase extends Adscene's portfolio of local newspapers to 34, producing 755,000 copies of both paid for and free newspapers each week. In the nine months to December 31 Priebe had turnover of Pounds 1.22m and profit before tax of Pounds 141,449. Net assets were Pounds 427,929. Mr Harry Lambert, chairman and chief executive of Adscene, said he expected Priebe to make a small contribution to profits in the current year and, after bringing additional marketing resources to bear, a full contribution from June 1994. He said that the the group was confident that cost savings could be achieved by bringing the typesetting and printing activities in-house, which will have benefits for the printing company in Welshpool.</p>

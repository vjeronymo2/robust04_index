			<p>920721 FT  21 JUL 92 / Technology: Anit-sense therapy ANTI-SENSE therapy uses a short synthetic strand of nucleotides, the chemical building blocks of genes, to stop the production of disease-related proteins. Every gene has two complementary nucleotide strands, which together form the famous double helix of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). The nucleotides in one strand are said to have a 'sense' sequence and the other has an 'anti-sense' sequence. The drawing above shows that a synthetic anti-sense strand (1), known as an oligonucleotide, can be used in two alternative ways. It binds to the 'sense' strand of the gene's double-stranded DNA and produces a triple-stranded structure which switches off the gene (2). It binds to the single-stranded RNA (ribonucleicacid) which the gene generates as a first step to producing protein (3). This blocks protein synthesis without permanently inactivating the gene (4). Although a whole gene may have several thousand nucleotide units, anti-sense drugs are much smaller molecules with 15 to 25 units. This is long enough to make them completely specific; each will recognise a specific sequence in the target gene, without binding to any of the 100,000 other human genes. Pure oligonucleotides are not suitable for pharmaceutical development because enzymes would break them down before they reached their targets. Therefore anti-sense drugs are chemical derivatives, such as methylphosphonates, which are more stable than natural molecules and better able to enter cells.</p>

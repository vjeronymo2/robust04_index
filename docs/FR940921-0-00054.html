			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA's proposed procedures for conversions of vehicles whose  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> engines were originally certified on an engine dynamometer (i.e.,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most heavy-duty engines) are quite different than CARB's. As was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> previously mentioned, the Agency proposed that conversions in this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> category be certified using the test procedure used to certify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> original engine. That procedure is the engine dynamometer-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy-duty transient test. CARB's procedures use the chassis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dynamometer-based urban dynamometer driving cycle for conversions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of vehicles 14,000 pounds and under gross vehicle weight (GVW).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For conversions of vehicles greater than 14,000 pounds GVW, CARB's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures allow for either steady-state chassis dynamometer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing or an engine dynamometer test approved by the CARB  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Executive Officer. Most of the comments received on this issue  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requested that, in order to reduce compliance costs, EPA adopt the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> CARB test procedures for aftermarket conversions. One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also suggested that it is unfair to require conversions for heavy-duty engines to be certified using the heavy-duty transient test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because there are few available testing facilities at which one  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could get the required testing done.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> EPA response to comments:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Agency continues to believe that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> most appropriate way to determine whether an aftermarket conversion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meets the emission standards that the original vehicle or engine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was certified to is to use the same test procedures that were used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in certifying the original vehicle or engine. As the comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> suggest, this is only an issue for the conversions intended for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles originally certified using the engine dynamometer  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> procedures. While the Agency understands the concerns voiced by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the commenters, it does not believe that there is an adequate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to using the original test procedures when attempting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to demonstrate compliance with the original standards. In the case  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the CARB procedures, CARB uses an approach whereby compliance is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined by comparing post-conversion emissions performance with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pre-conversion performance, and allowing for some increase in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions to account for test to test variability. Given this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach, it is not nearly as important for CARB to use the same  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> test procedures that were used to certify the original vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the standards being certified to are not those the vehicle  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> was originally certified as meeting. However, by taking this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approach it is possible that an aftermarket conversion which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeds the original configuration's emissions standards could be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certified, which is in conflict with the anti-tampering provisions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920423 FT  23 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Bad news from financials hits market A SPATE of bad news from the banking and insurance sectors plus disappointment with the latest official figures on bank and building society lending put paid to early hopes that London's equity market could build on some big early gains yesterday. The effects of recent earnings downgrades for some of the UK's biggest companies added to the gloom. By the close the market was on its heels, and suffering from successive bouts of profit-taking. The FT-SE 100-share Index ended a busy session at the day's low point, closing a net 18 points off at 2,607.8. One of the few encouraging signs was an upturn in the level of business. Turnover expanded to 617.4m shares, well ahead of Tuesday's 420m shares when the value of customer business fell to Pounds 867m, compared with last week when figures above Pounds 1bn were recorded on each trading day. Turnover was boosted considerably by at least five programme trades executed yesterday, with the majority said to have been weighted to the sell side. The market got off to an excellent start, as the Footsie index posted a 15.4 points rise during the first hour of trading, on buying stimulated by a strong pound which in turn prompted more talk of a cut in domestic interest rates. The Footsie future also provided comfort for the cash market, maintaining a good premium throughout the day. Downside pressure began to emerge, however, in mid-morning with the impact of two programme trades, plus gloomy news from Abbey National and Legal &amp; General. Shortly afterwards the market was unsettled by the Pounds 500m decline in bank and building society lending during March, compared with market expectations of a rise of about Pounds 2bn. Ensuing selling pressure, although never more than light, was sufficient to lower the Footsie for the rest of the day, with sentiment additionally weakened by a weak opening on Wall Street. Senior traders were not unduly perturbed by the market's latest decline, pointing out that the long three-week account ends on Friday and a period of consolidation was needed after the 250-point rise that followed the Tory election victory. 'The market may be looking ragged but the underlying firm tone remains intact,' said one dealer. New business figures from insurance group Legal &amp; General were viewed as disappointing and triggered a wholesale retreat throughout the life and composite insurance sectors, which provided six of the market's worst ten performers yesterday. The gloomy message from Abbey National's annual meeting led to a round of profits downgrades and a flurry of selling of Abbey shares. On the other hand, there were good gains from the utilities sector, notably the Scottish generators ahead of the 70p-a-share call on the stock which has to be paid by May 5. Takeover rumours continued to surround Dowty Group, the aerospace/engineering group, with TI Group said to be a potential predator. The market took seriously stories that Hanson was about to unload its 2.8 per cent stake in ICI to help fund another takeover move.</p>

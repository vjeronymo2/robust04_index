			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on the Russian Federation economic statistics, by </F> Valeriy Galitskiy, Aris Zakharov, and Aleksandr Frenkel, the  Russian State Committee on Statistics: "Production Output and  Price Dynamics as of 17 May"]    [Text]  <H5>  Prices for Consumer Goods and Services </H5>   Over the period from 10 to 17 May 1994 prices for  consumer goods and services rose at a faster rate than over the  preceding weeks--by 2.5 percent, including for foodstuffs and  nonfood items--by 2.3 percent, and for-fee services for the  population--by 4.7 percent.    The highest rate of increases in food prices were registered  in the Urals region (5.2 percent), and the lowest in the  Northwestern and East Siberian regions (1.3 percent). Increases  in prices for nonfood items ranged from 1 percent in the  Northwestern region to 2.6 percent in the Urals region. The cost  of for-fee services for the population went up by more than 5  percent in the West Siberian, Far Eastern, and Northwestern  regions, but remained practically unchanged in East Siberia.    Indices of prices for consumer goods and services in the  consumer market were as follows (as a percentage of the  preceding date):                     05/04       05/10       05/17       Average daily price                                                       rise                                                        May        April   Consumer goods   102.2       101.6       102.5       0.28       0.30  and services   including:   foodstuffs       101.9       101.9       102.3       0.27       0.23   nonfood items    102.3       101.2       102.3       0.28       0.25   for-fee          103.8       101.9       104.7       0.45       1.27  services for  the population       Since the beginning of the month, the current consumer  price index measured 105.0 percent, including that for  foodstuffs--104.7 percent, nonfood items--105.0 percent, and  for-fee services for the population--108.0 percent.    If the current rate of price increases remains at the same  level, prices for consumer goods and services in May will  rise overall by 8-9 percent.  <H5>  Foodstuffs. </H5>   Over the period of 10 to 17 May, prices in organized and  nonorganized trade rose by 1.9 percent and 4.3 percent.    Price changes by main categories of food products are shown  below (as a percentage of the preceding date):                         Total           Including:                                        in organized        in nonorganized                                       trade               trade   All food products    102.3           101.9               104.3   including:   Meat and meat        102.3           102.4               102.0  products   Fish and fish        100.3           100.4               96.3  products   Milk and milk        100.9           101.1               99.9  products   Eggs                 99.9            99.9                100.5   Sugar                100.6           100.6               101.2   Bread and bakery     102.9           102.9               -  products   Cereals and          101.7           101.7               101.7  macaroni items   Vodka                100.0           100.0               100.2   Potatoes and         105.3           104.4               106.1  vegetables   Fruit                117.4           116.9               117.7      In organized trade over the elapsed week fresh  produce prices continued to rise at an anticipatory rate:  cabbage and onions by 10-14 percent, and apples by 23 percent.  As compared to the preceding week, prices for meat, bread, and  bakery items rose at a perceptibly higher rate--2.6-4.4 percent.  There was no significant change in prices for certain dairy  products, sugar, tea, eggs, butter, vegetable oil, vodka, and  potatoes.    Since the beginning of the month, prices rose the most with  respect to vegetables and fruit--by 10-26 percent. Since the  beginning of the year, their prices increased 2.3-fold and  1.7-fold, respectively; milk prices increased 2.1-fold, and meat  prices--1.5-fold.    Similar to organized trade, the greatest price rises in  nonorganized trade were registered with respect to fresh  produce. Prices for apples rose by 20.5 percent; cabbage, beets,  and carrots--by 10-14 percent; and onions and garlic--by 4-5  percent.    Since the beginning of the month, prices for vegetables  increased by 17 percent, and for fruit--1.4-fold; since the  beginning of the year, these prices increased 2.7-fold and  2.6-fold, respectively.    The cost of the consumer basket of 19 basic  foodstuffs increased over the week by 3 percent and as of  17 May amounted to R51,100, calculated on a monthly basis. Since  the middle of March, the price differential between monitored  cities had been increasing gradually and measured a factor of  4.7 on 17 May as compared to 3.6 on 15 March of this year. The  highest cost of the basket was registered in Magadan (R141,300)  and the lowest in Ulyanovsk (R30,000). In terms of the cost of  the consumer basket, Moscow and St. Petersburg ranked 34th and  46th among 132 monitored cities (R55,400 and R51,500 on a  monthly basis).    The practice of price controls with respect to food  products persisted in April. While there were no price  controls on the federal level, in 104 of 132 monitored cities  (100 in December 1993) regional administration influenced the  process of price formation.    At the same time, the extent to which various forms of price  control were applied to the consumer market varied. For  instance, in the cities of the Volgo-Vyatka and North Caucasus  regions, prices on practically all food staples are controlled,  while in the Northern and Northwestern regions, price control  with respect to basic food staples is limited to several cities  (mainly the cities in Komi Republic, Cherepovets, and Pskov).    The data on the scale of price controls with respect to  basic  food staples in December 1993-April 1994 are presented below:                   As % of the total number of monitored cities                  1993                       1994                  December      January      February      March      April   Beef           49            53           46            45         45   Bologna        48            50           41            41         42   Butter         42            38           34            42         39   Vegetable      28            30           33            32         32  oil   Milk           67            71           74            68         69   Baby food      33            32           29            31         37   Eggs           40            40           43            41         42   Sugar          39            33           28            32         29   Salt           29            27           30            28         28   Flour          35            39           30            33         37   Bread          74            77           78            73         75      The most commonly used kind of price control is putting a  limit on trade organization's mark-up (about 50 percent of all  instances of price control). In approximately 5 percent of the  cities, limits are set on profitability of food processing  industry enterprises. Much more rarely, subsidies from local  budgets were used to keep prices at a certain level; the  practice of setting a maximum limit on prices is still used in  Voronezh (meat products, butter, and milk) and Lipetsk (butter,  eggs, and vodka). In some cities of Russia (Syktyvkar, Orel,  Kazan, Ulyanovsk, Nalchik, Ufa, and Omsk) several kinds of price  control were used simultaneously.    By the end of April of this year, prices for products  subject  to price control and for those sold at market prices rose at  practically the same rate. At the same time, the level of  regulated and market prices did differ. For instance, regulated  prices for wheat bread made from category I and II flour ranged  from R213 per kg in Ulyanovsk to R750 in Tomsk, while market  prices ranged from R641 in Arkhangelsk to R1,274 per kg in  Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. With respect to milk, on the contrary, market  prices in Ivanovo (R419 per liter) were lower than controlled  prices in Kostroma (R484).  <H5>  Nonfood Items </H5>   Over the period from 10 to 17 May prices for nonfood items  rose at a moderate rate. There was practically no change in  prices for personal and household goods or tobacco. At the same  time, there was a considerable increase in prices for natural  silk fabrics, synthetic detergents, wallpaper, and certain  categories of medical supplies (by 4-10 percent).  <H5>  For-Fee Services for the Population </H5>   Over the elapsed week, rates and fees for for-fee services  for the population increased on average in Russia by almost 5  percent. There was a substantial increase in the cost of fares  in suburban trains (by 18.2 percent) and city buses (by 8.6  percent); among municipal services, electric power rates  increased by 12.6 percent. The cost of suburban train fares in  Tomsk and the cities of Nizhniy Novgorod Oblast increased  twofold or more, and in St. Petersburg--fivefold. Electric power  rates doubled over the elapsed week in Nizhniy Tagil, Orenburg,  Syktyvkar, Vorkuta, Ukhta, and St. Petersburg.  <H5>  Industry. </H5>   Over 15 days of May 1994, of 163 categories of products  counted in periodic reports, the average daily production,    as compared to the corresponding period of May 1993:    --increased with respect to 6 items, (including  diesel generators, city telephone cables, front-wheel drive  passenger cars, high fat-content cheeses and feta cheese), or 4  percent of the total number;    --decreased with respect to 148 items, or 91  percent of the total number;    as compared to the corresponding period of April 1994:    --increased with respect to 31 items, (among them  oil, including gas condensate, automotive gasoline, iron ore,  pig iron, coke, caustic soda, synthetic ammonia, potassium  fertilizer, polyvynilchloride resin, drop forges, traveling  electric cranes and self-propelled cranes, trolley buses, grain  harvesting combines, cardboard, motorcycles, commercial edible  fish products, butter, canned milk products, confectionery  items, and salt), or 19 percent of the total number;    --decreased with respect to 123 items, or 76  percent of the total number.    The output of main categories of industrial products over 15  days of May 1994 is shown below:                                Produced over     As % of the corresponding period                              15 days of May    of (in terms of average daily                              1994              production)                                                 May 1993         April 1994   Electric power--billion     29.5              93               82  kW/hr   Oil, including gas          11.9              85               103  condensate, million  tonnes   Natural gas, billion        24.2              96               91  cubic meters   Coal, million tonnes        8.3               81               79   Steel, million tonnes       1.9               77               98   Finished rolled metal,      1.4               77               90  including semi-finished  product for  export--million tonnes   Steel pipe, thousand        68.7              30               90  tonnes   Large electric machinery,   23                18               28  units   Metal-cutting machine       60                18               56  tools, units   Passenger cars, thousand    21.5              68               93  units   Tractors, thousand units    429               13               86   Chemical filament and       5.9               40               84  fiber, thousand tonnes   Mineral fertilizer          332               70               92  (recalculated as  100-percent nutrients),  thousand tonnes   Automotive tires for        194               18               31  agricultural vehicles,  motorcycles, and  motorollers, million  units   Commercial timber,          1.3               64               77  million cubic meters   Lumber, thousand cubic      236               60               85  meters   Paper, thousand tonnes      83.7              74               85   Cement, million tonnes      1.2               63               91   Roof slate, million         17.1              14               47  standard tiles   Construction brick,         208               52               74  million units of standard  brick   Rolled roofing and          14.6              70               91  insulation materials,  million square meters   Fabrics, total, million     32.9              38               54  square meters   Hosiery, million pairs      5.9               48               65   Knitwear, million units     2.6               43               55   Footwear, million pairs     1.3               36               82   Television sets, thousand   20.4              24               40  units   Radio receiving devices,    6.5               14               42  thousand units   Refrigerators and           44.4              43               64  freezers, thousand units   Electric vacuum cleaners,   16.6              27               90  thousand units   Washing machines,           22.8              26               47  thousand units   Meat, including             43.5              70               97  byproducts, category I,  total, thousand tonnes   Whole-milk products,        240               82               97  recalculated as milk,  total, thousand tonnes   Butter, total, thousand     15.6              65               118  tonnes   Granulated sugar, total,    18.9              18               49  including from  customer-supplied  material--thousand tonnes       Over the elapsed period of May 1994, there has been no  production of forge presses with a numeric program control,  processing centers, bulldozers, automotive graders, tower cranes  with the lifting capacity of eight or more tonnes, truck  trailers and semi-trailers, tractor hitches, passenger railcars,  and magnetic tape.  <H5>  The Agro-Industrial Complex </H5>   By the middle of May, in the country as a whole, spring  crops  were planted on 29.6 million hectares, including 10.4 million  hectares over the past week. The lag as compared to proceeding  years so far persists. Last year by this time, spring crops were  planted on 32.7 million hectares, and in 1992--38.1 million  hectares.    The progress of the spring planting campaign at agricultural  enterprises as of 16 May is characterized by the following data  (in thousands hectares):                          1992           1993           1994           1994 as %                                                                     of 1993   All spring crops,     38.1           32.7           29.6           91  million hectares   of that:   Grain and legume      23.5           21.1           20.8           99  crops (without  corn), million  hectares   Corn--total           3,924          2,841          1,542          54   including for grain   631            575            449            78    Sugar beet            1,285          1,125          916            81  (industrial)   Long-fiber flax       207            211            79             38   Sunflower for seed    2,386          1,980          1,745          88   Potatoes              436            349            131            38   Vegetables            172            130            104            80   Annual grasses,       4.2            3.5            3.0            88  million hectares      The data is available now on the extent of ruin of winter  crops sown for the current year harvest. As of 16 May of this  year winter crops at Russian Federation farms were ruined on 2.9  million hectares (19 percent of the total area sown), including  grain crops--2.8 million hectares (20 percent). Last year winter  crops were ruined on 1,7 million hectares (8 percent).    The remaining 1994 harvest winter grain crop area at  agricultural enterprises comprises about 12 million hectares as  compared to 15 million hectares sown for last year's harvest.    The total area of grain crops sown, counting the surviving  winter crops, is smaller by approximately 4 million hectares (11  percent) than that as of the same date a year ago.    Spring planting is almost completed on the territories of  the  Central Chernozem region, Krasnodar and Stavropol Krays, Rostov,  Orel, Tula, Volgograd, Penza, and Ulyanovsk Oblasts, Mordovia,  and Tatarstan, where spring grain planting areas exceed those of  last year.    Spring grain crops were planted on a substantially smaller  area in Kirov, Nizhniy Novgorod, and Saratov Oblast, and the  Republic of Mari El (by 20-40 percent); the same is also true of  winter grain crops planted here last fall.  <H5>  Construction </H5>   In keeping with the federal investment program, in the  current year it is envisaged to commission 128 facilities  financed from the budget, and 332 facilities financed by credit  investment resources. By and large, the developers plan to  commission the facilities in the fourth quarter (96 percent).    The utilized volume of capital investment in budget-financed  facilities amounted to R114 billion, with the annual limit of  R772 billion as set by the Russian Ministry of Economics, and  those financed through credit resources--R256 billion and R872  billion, respectively. No construction was under way at one in  six facilities in January-February of this year.    The progress of construction work on the facilities in the  federal 1994 start-up program by national-economic complex is  characterized by the following data (units):                        At objects financed through:                       budget means                                  credit resources                       planned to be   commissioned    capital       planned to be   commissioned    capital                      commissioned    (including      investment    commissioned    (including      investment                      this year       commissioned    utilized,     this year       commissioned    utilized,                                      in part         billions of                   in part         billions of                                                      rubles                                        rubles   Total for Russia    128             1               114.3         322             2               256.4   including by  economic complex:    Fuel and energy     22              -               43.3          21              -               59.4   Machine-building    5               -               38.9          67              -               59.2   Metallurgical       1               -               0.4           52              1               60.8   Chemical and        72              1               16.1          71              -               48.9  timber   Construction        -               -               -             54              1               22.7   Transportation      26              -               14.5          8               -               0.6  and  communications    <H5>  Past-Due Back Pay Liabilities </H5>   The number of enterprises having liabilities with respect to  back pay and other labor remuneration-related pay-outs dropped  somewhat in the beginning of May as compared to the beginning of  April; the ratio of past-due liabilities in relation to  enterprises' payroll also dropped. In absolute terms, past-due  back pay liabilities increased insignificantly over April.    The data on the number of enterprises having past-due back  pay liabilities and the volume of liabilities are represented in  the following table:                            As of        As of        05/01/94     For                          04/01/94     05/01/94     as % of      reference:                                                    04/01/94     as of                                                                 05/01/93   Number of enterprises   32.2         30.3         94           10.9  with back-pay and  other pay-out  liabilities--total,  thousands   including:   in industry             6.9          6.6          96           3.2   in construction         6.2          5.9          97           2.4   in agriculture          19.4         17.8         93           5.3   Volume of past-due      2,341.5      2,435.0      104          51.4  back pay and other  pay-out liabilities  to enterprise  employees--total,  billions of rubles   including:   in industry             1,311.1      1,405.5      107          27.5   in construction         414.1        459.1        111          11.3   in agriculture          616.3        570.4        93           12.7   Past-due back pay and   130.1        121.9        52.2  other pay-out  liabilities as a  percentage of total  payroll calculated  for the month at  enterprises having  such  liabilities--total   including:   in industry             108.7        112.9        46.1   in construction         145.5        107.5        61.4   in agriculture          199.5        175.0        61.5      The bulk of past-due back pay liabilities was owed by  state-owned enterprises and organizations--41 percent, mixed  ownership (without foreign participation)--32 percent, and  privately-owned--32 percent; enterprises and organizations in  municipal ownership and those owned by public associations and  organizations accounted for less than 1 percent of it.    A considerable part of past-due back pay liabilities was  owed  by enterprises in machine-building and metalworking (30 percent  of the total volume of liabilities owed in industry), fuels (24  percent), timber, woodworking, and pulp and paper industries (11  percent), and in ferrous metallurgy (8 percent).    Back pay owed for more than one month as of 1 May 1994 in  all  three economic sectors amounted to R1.1015 trillion, or 45  percent of all back pay liability, including in industry--R546.6  billion (39 percent), construction--R212.7 (46 percent), and  agriculture--R342.2 billion (60 percent).    The main cause of past-due back pay and other pay-out  liabilities is insufficient funds, or lack thereof, in operating  accounts of enterprises and organizations. The greatest amounts  not paid out in time have been registered at enterprises and  organizations in industry, construction, and agriculture in  Tyumen Oblast (R252.5 billion), Krasnoyarsk Kray (R118.9  percent), Kemerovo Oblast (R113.9 billion), Chelyabinsk Oblast  (R99.6 billion), Republics of Tataria (R88.3 billion) and  Bashkiria (R66.4 billion), Altay Kray (R54.5 billion), Rostov  Oblast (R50.2 billion), and the Komi Republic (R49.5 billion).  <H5>  Fulfillment of Inter-Government Agreement With CIS Countries </H5>   Russia's foreign trade turnover with CIS countries in the  first quarter of the current year amounted to an estimated R6.8  trillion (in current prices). Exports accounted for R4.2  trillion, or 62 percent of the goods turnover (63 percent in the  first quarter of 1993), and imports--R2.6 trillion, or 38  percent (37 percent).    The volume of shipments of most important categories of  producer goods from Russia under inter-government agreements in  the first quarter of 1994 was as follows:                          Delivered         As % of fulfillment of   As % of the                                          annual                   first quarter                                          inter-government         of 1993                                          agreements   Finished rolled       98                12                       25  ferrous metals,  thousand tonnes   Steel pipe,           17                6.7                      21  thousand tonnes   Polyethylene,         9.2               54                       46  thousand tonnes   Caustic soda,         15                30                       57  100-percent,  thousand tonnes   Synthetic rubber,     21                40                       29  thousand tonnes   Commercial timber,    186               6.3                      34  thousand cubic  meters   Lumber, thousand      110               9.8                      39  cubic meters      The main consumers of material resources are Ukraine,  Belarus, and Kazakhstan, which account for 86 percent of the  total rolled ferrous metal delivered to CIS countries, 64  percent of steel pipe, 76 percent of commercial wood, and 56  percent of lumber.    Deliveries of certain goods to the Russian market in the  first quarter of 1994 are characterized by the following data:                         Received         As % of fulfillment of   As % of the                                        annual                   first quarter                                        inter-government         of 1993                                        agreements   Meat and meat        17.6             12                       47  products  recalculated as  meat, thousand  tonnes   Milk and milk        35.9             14                       49  products  recalculated as  milk, thousand  tonnes   Hosiery, million     1.4              12                       116  pairs   Carpeting and        153.4            153                      0.1  rugs, thousand  square meters      In the first quarter of this year, Ukraine delivered 8  percent of the annual agreed-upon volume of meat and meat  products; Belarus--31 percent of meat and meat products, and 14  percent of milk and milk products; and Kazakhstan--2 percent of  meat and meat products.    In 1994, in keeping with inter-government agreements, in the  category of consumer goods Russia is to deliver only household  and facial soap and synthetic detergents. In the first quarter  of this year, their deliveries to CIS countries comprised 1  percent, 2 percent, and 25 percent, respectively, of the total  agreed-upon volume for the year.

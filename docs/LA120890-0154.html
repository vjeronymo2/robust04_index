			<p><P> December 8, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MUSEUM PICKS FIRST CURATOR FOR INDIAN ART;  </P> <P> APPOINTMENT: ELLEN SMART WILL BE IN CHARGE OF AN EXTENSIVE NEW COLLECTION OF  INDIAN PAINTINGS AT THE SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF ART.  </P> <P> The San Diego Museum of Art has appointed Ellen Smart its first curator of  Indian paintings.  </P> <P> Smart, 45, will be in charge of about 1,400 Indian paintings and manuscript  illuminations bequeathed to the museum in 1986 by Edwin Binney III, a former  museum trustee.  </P> <P> The Binney Collection, valued at $40 million to $50 million, spans more than  seven centuries of Indian art from Rajasthan to Agra, from a rare, 12th-Century  manuscript on palm leaves to 20th-Century paintings.  </P> <P> "It will take me a couple of years just to see what's here," said Smart, who  begins at the museum in May. She will continue doing independent art research  in Rhode Island until then. Her appointment was announced Thursday.  </P> <P> Smart first became acquainted with works in the Binney Collection when she saw  them in a show in San Francisco in the late 1960s. At the time, she was  studying for her master's degree at UC Berkeley.  </P> <P> "I've been working with Indian paintings ever since," she said.  </P> <P> The works -- described by museum director Steven Brezzo as "a breathtaking  addition to the (museum) collection" -- were held in probate until just last  month, when complex negotiations between the museum, Binney's estate and the  Massachusetts attorney general's office finally concluded.  </P> <P> An exhibition of highlights from the collection is scheduled at the museum for  next December.  </P> <P> Smart, a specialist in 16th- and 17th-Century Mughal painting, received her  Ph.D. in the art and archeology of South Asia from the University of London.  She has worked as a research curator and a consultant for such institutions as  the Nelson-Atkins Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the Walters Art  Gallery in Baltimore. In 1988, she was named a Fulbright Scholar.  </P> <P> Smart's publications range from children's books to articles in scholarly  journals. According to Brezzo, it was important to find a curator "committed to  public education" because Indian art has had so little exposure in San Diego.  </P></p>

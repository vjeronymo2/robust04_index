			<p>931127 FT  27 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Learmonth shares tumble on setback Shares in Learmonth &amp; Burchett Management Systems, a USM-quoted computing services company, lost more than a quarter of their value yesterday after interim profits sharply below expectations. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 201,000, 73 per cent lower than last time's Pounds 753,000. The shares fell 60p to close at 163p. Turnover increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 13.1m (Pounds 10.7m) and earnings per share amounted to 1p (3.1p). Mr Rainer Burchett, chairman, said the profits slide was the result of slow trading conditions in the UK and a period of inactivity among the company's agents in mainland Europe: 'Most of our new European business partners decided to invest seriously in sales and marketing activity only after the summer holiday period and we failed to anticipate the extent to which this would cause a deferral of first-half sales,' he said. He said the company's US subsidiary had shown rapid growth, trebling software sales from Dollars 2.1m to Dollars 6.1m (Pounds 4.09m). The Australian subsidiary had performed well, although below budget. Mr Burchett said he expected significant improvement in the second half of the year and that profits for the whole year would be broadly similar to last year's Pounds 1.8m.</p>

			<p>930628 FT  28 JUN 93 / Tapie team corruption claim OLYMPIQUE de Marseille, the successful French football team owned by Mr Bernard Tapie, the left-wing politician and businessman, has contested allegations that its staff rigged a crucial match. Mr Christophe Robert, a striker for Valenciennes, was questioned by French public prosecutors on Saturday, suspected of having received a FFr250,000 (Pounds 29,400) bribe to fake an injury against Marseille last month. Marseille went on six days later to beat AC Milan in the final of the European Cup, becoming the first French team to win the title. Valenciennes was relegated to the second division after losing. Charges have yet to be made, but the investigation is likely to ensure French football comes under fresh public scrutiny. Mr Tapie, who made enemies in the football world a few years ago by leading a campaign against corruption, firmly denied his staff were involved in such practices. 'One cannot cheat at that level,' Mr Tapie said. The allegations came from another Valenciennes player, Mr Jacques Glassmann, who claimed Mr Jean-Pierre Bernes, Marseille's general secretary, and Mr Jean-Jacques Eydelie, a Marseille player, telephoned members of the opposing team to offer cash inducements to play badly. Mr Bernes has sued and Mr Eydelie last week voluntarily approached the public prosecutor on the issue. Both deny the allegations.</p>

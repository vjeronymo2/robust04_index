			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Armando Calderon Sol and Enrique Borgo </F> Bustamante, Nationalist Republican Alliance candidates for  president and vice president, respectively, by unidentified LA  PRENSA GRAFICA reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] How do you view other political  parties' proposals vis-a-vis yours when we are virtually a week  away from the elections?    [Calderon] Arena [Nationalist Republican Alliance] has had a  coherent proposal for a long time, even during the difficult  period when communist and Marxist ideas were popular in Latin  America. Our party has always presented a clear proposal, since  its birth. It has made an economic proposal in defense of  individual rights, the market economy, private property, and,  particularly, the state of law.    Now we see that opposition candidates are planning to  present  a similar program, although they lack the credibility necessary  to do so. However, we have noticed a change in their language,  and that has changed the campaign: it has made it more  pragmatic, it is using a similar language, by which all can  picture the social problems.    What I see is a greater awareness among all sectors  regarding  the country's social problems. I believe it is the product of  the war experience per se. The fact that all Salvadorans have a  clearer vision of the social problems has made possible that all  programs better target social welfare.    [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What does your campaign's concept of  Arena being the new socially aware right mean?    [Calderon] What we mean is that Arena represents the right  with social consciousness, a right that faces social problems  with courage. It is not socialist, corporate, or Marxist ideas,  but ideas founded on a true Christian humanism that make up the  contemporary world, and turn man into a being of solidarity.  The philosophy of the new right is that profound. There cannot  be true economic development if we do not involve social  welfare, human progress.    Here is the success of the new right in the world: it is  opening possibilities, leaving behind populist and socialist  ideas and positions that gave leaders a demagogic vocabulary,  and that led Latin America to poverty in the past decades. This  new right is causing countries to reemerge with new positions,  sustained economic growth, and facing social problems, reducing  poverty levels, and boosting economic indicators.    [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] And now that you have been touring the  country and getting in touch with the national situation, how  would you summarize the social offers your government is  proposing?    [Borgo] We are very satisfied with the expressions of civic  awareness and education Salvadorans have given. Past experience  shows us that people strongly believe in democracy.    These opportunities and discussions with the people promote  high participation. We believe that Salvadorans are receptive  regarding compliance with the law and the state of law. People  respond favorably when they hear us talk about the need to stop  violence, respect the laws and life.    Regarding our program, the economic aspect has been the best  publicized. Regarding the social aspect, we have received very  positive feedback when people hear that we want to work in  education, health, and the environment, among other areas.    Education is the tool needed so that people can aspire for  opportunities to grow. We have absolute trust in education  because it constitutes the key to the country's progress. We  plan to broaden such programs as Educo and Sabe, which began  during President Cristiani's term.    The loss experienced in the area of education during the war  period was enormous: almost 700 schools were closed and over  150,000 children could not attend. We are determined 100  percent to make education and physical reconstruction our main  concern.    [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What proposals are necessary to achieve  a type of economic and social welfare in which people can  actively participate?    [Borgo] We see the need to increase foreign currency in the  country. Family remittances are a fragile source of funds that  might decrease, and even if current levels are maintained, we  can expect to see a decrease in international aid.    We are trying to promote the export of nontraditional  products, and we want to broaden our prospects for tourism.    If we might draw something positive from a negative  experience, it would be that the 10-year war put us on the world  map. In turn, we might be able to take advantage of this,  because we have many tourist attractions, the foremost of which  is our people. Salvadorans are pleasant and willing to help. We  can be very successful at promoting tourism.    Another major initiative will be to get Salvadorans abroad  to  invest here. We are trying to create a program with investment  tools that can be joined by people who receive family allowances.    These two ideas are important. We have been working on these  projects for a long time. When the director of the World  Tourism Organization visited, we were able to get all of the  political parties to commit themselves to developing the tourism  industry.    So far, we have outlined four pillars of this development  program.    [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] Recently, the Salvadoran Foundation for  Economic and Social Development [Fusades] presented an economic  program that was reportedly open to all political parties. Is  there any similarity between this program and your plan?    [Borgo] What Fusades presented is a summary of a political  strategy. It was explained that a number of studies comprised  the basis of that summary. This package must be analyzed  thoroughly, but we do agree that it necessarily concurs with the  party's economic and social philosophy. Nevertheless, we  believe it is very useful.    [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] What do you think, Dr. Calderon?    [Calderon] I believe it is a true contribution to El  Salvador  and that it fully corresponds with our party. We have somewhat  of a similar philosophy with the people from Fusades. We must  also recall that President Cristiani's program received  significant input from Fusades. In a second government, there  will also be continuity, because ours is not simply a five-year  program.    The country is being rescued; Arena's program is not over,  but just beginning. Our program is designed to achieve peace,  progress, freedom, democracy, justice, and better living  conditions for the country.    Now that we are heading toward an economic recovery, peace  has helped guide the country toward reconstruction. We still  have a long way to go before we reach the desired levels. We  have always said that our program is not limited to five years;  there is no way that it could be. This is why we hope people  will reelect us on 20 March -- to enable us to continue with our  program.    [LA PRENSA GRAFICA] President Cristiani's government will go  down in history as the government that achieved peace. Where  will you lead your government if you win the elections?    [Calderon] I would like my government to be a government of  reconstruction, not only a physical reconstruction, but also  moral, cultural, and civic reconstruction. People should  experience a renewal.    We believe we can strengthen the peace that has been  achieved, bolster the democratic process, and fulfill the great  goal of rebuilding the country structurally and morally.</p>

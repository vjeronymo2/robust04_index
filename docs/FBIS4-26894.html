			<p>BFN     [Text] Wuhan, June 28 (XINHUA) -- This capital of central  China's Hubei Province is making full preparations for combating  any possible major floods on the Chang Jiang River, China's  longest.    The city, situated on the middle reaches of the Chang Jiang,  is divided into three parts -- Hankou (the business center),  Wuchang, (the political and educational center) and Hanyang --  by the river and its tributary, the Hanshui River.    When the spring flood arrived this year local officials led  workers in different groups to check the 286.2 km of embankments  along the Chang Jiang and removed a dozen hidden perils.    By early June different localities had already invested  300,000 yuan to buy gunny sacks and straw bags, and prepared  more than 650 tons of petrol, diesel oil, and rolled steel. In  addition, they mobilized some 50,000 people to fight possible  big floods.    Major floods on the Chang Jiang usually occur in late July  and early August.    While summing up past experiences in fighting floods and  improving some of the rules concerning flood control, this year  the city started to assign local officials to participate in  concrete flood fighting work to different sections of the  embankments, with clear tasks and targets.    In addition, areas and institutions which exercise  jurisdiction over some sections of embankments are also given  concrete tasks in the case of severe floods.</p>

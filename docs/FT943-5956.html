			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Leading Article: German prospect Germany is recovering from recession. But what sort of growth will it manage in the medium term? That is the question raised by this year's excellent survey from the OECD. It is an important question, not just for Germany, which needs rapid growth to cope with the burden of unification, but for Europe. East Germany is - and will remain - a huge burden, despite GDP growth of 7.1 per cent last year and an OECD forecast of another 9.1 per cent in 1994. This growth has only been made possible by net transfers of DM130bn (Pounds 54bn), 4.6 per cent of west German GDP, last year. These transfers, which amounted to 47 per cent of east German GDP, have made it possible for exports from the new Lander to be less than a fifth of their imports. The need for transfers, which this ratio reveals so starkly, is unlikely to change in the near future. At least the fiscal damage has been contained. The general government deficit as a share of GDP is expected to be brought down to 2.9 per cent this year. Even the overall public sector borrowing requirement is forecast at 4.6 per cent, not unreasonable in the circumstances. While the ratio of public debt to GDP will breach the Maastricht treaty guideline of 60 per cent in 1995, the OECD argues that further increases can be halted by a 'combination of sustained medium-term growth and active programmes of fiscal consolidation'. But, inevitably, a price has been paid. Germany's effective tax rate is higher than that of any leading industrialised country, except France. For all its strengths, the economy may not be able to bear this burden that well. The growth of total factor productivity has slowed markedly since the 1960s; unemployment has risen cycle-by-cycle; in the 1980s, productivity in manufacturing grew at less than half the rate of the European Union as a whole; the shares of German exports in markets outside the EU have declined markedly since 1973; and wage costs seem out of line with productivity, by comparison with the US and Japan. The German economy is, in short, showing signs of senescence. It needs to be revitalised, for its own sake and for that of the European economy as a whole. A combination of tough control over spending, lower taxation and structural reforms - privatisation and deregulation - is urgently needed. The OECD report shows the way. Will Germany dare to follow?</p>

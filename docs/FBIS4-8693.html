			<p>BFN     [Text] Gyorgy Csoti, foreign affairs spokesman of the  Hungarian Democratic Forum [MDF], has held a press briefing  about the MDF's foreign policy views. Judit Laszlo supplies the  details.    [Laszlo] The MDF welcomes the policy of Slovak Prime  Minister  Jozef Moravcik because his government is willing to hold a  dialogue, Gyorgy Csoti, the party's foreign affairs spokesman,  said when analyzing Hungarian-Slovak relations. In connection  with the southern Slav crisis, Gyorgy Csoti said that the  slowdown in negotiations is alarming. In his view, Russia and  the West ought to coordinate their activity more closely to  resolve the crisis.    The foreign affairs spokesman called attention to the  dangerous phenomena of Hungarian party politics, particularly in  connection with a statement made by Gyula Horn, chairman of the  Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP].    Gyula Horn met with Romanian Senate President Oliviu Gherman  yesterday and then told journalists that in the view of the MSZP  an agreement is possible concerning the issue of a  Hungarian-Romanian basic treaty. According to Gyorgy Csoti,  this suggests that it is the fault of the current Hungarian  Government that a basic treaty has not so far been signed and  that an agreement would be possible if the MSZP came to power.    For this reason, the MDF, having drawn the general  conclusions, is of the view that the Alliance of Free Democrats  [SZDSZ] and the MSZP -- presumably in a coordinated manner --  are subordinating basic foreign political interests to party  goals in the election campaign. This conduct seriously harms  the country's security; it weakens our negotiating positions  with Slovakia, Romania, and Serbia, and it makes a historical  reconciliation with our neighbors impossible, the MDF statement  points out.</p>

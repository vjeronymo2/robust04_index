			<p>940322 FT  22 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Putting China top of the agenda - Simon Holberton reports on ICI's expansion into mainland China In what used to be a banana grove on the outskirts of Guangzhou (Canton), the capital of Guangdong province, Imperial Chemical Industries has built a beachhead for its expansion in China. On Friday, Sir Denys Henderson, ICI chairman, opened a joint venture factory which will produce a range of decorative paints and coatings for the household sector, automotive and packaging industries in China and Hong Kong. The 15m litres a year plant - with capacity expandable to 50m litres - will employ some 160 people, and is cheap in terms of investment. Total cash expended is just Pounds 8m of a Pounds 15m plant. Swire Pacific, a Hong Kong-based trading company, and a local Chinese investor are joint owners of the factory. However, this investment represents a return to the Chinese mainland for ICI which, like so many large foreign industrial companies, was forced out of China in the aftermath of the Communists' assumption of power in 1949. Sir Denys said that ICI's board had been thinking about China quite a lot recently. 'As China has become more receptive to inward investment and more politically stable, we have begun to take it more seriously,' he said. Mr John Chandler, chairman of ICI China, put the point more forcefully: 'There is not a single business of significance within ICI where China is not on its agenda.' The same can be said for many of ICI's competitors in Europe and the US. They, like ICI, are lured by the attraction of a market for chemicals growing in line with the rapid expansion of the Chinese economy. Over the past decade this growth has averaged nearly 10 per cent a year in real, inflation-adjusted, terms. In Guangdong, southern China's fastest growing regional economy, growth has been quicker, with total output in 1993 rising by more than 20 per cent in real terms. On Friday, Sir Denys said that ICI's paints division had often been the division to lead the company into new markets. This was the case in Taiwan where ICI has been manufacturing paints since the 1970s. Over the past five years ICI has invested Pounds 350m in Taiwan. This culminated two years ago in the opening of a pure terephthalic acid (PTA) plant. PTA is an essential ingredient in the manufacture of polyester fibre for the textiles industry - an industry which is growing rapidly in Taiwan and China. ICI China is pursuing opportunities in three main business areas: Polyurethane. The company currently ships 20,000 tonnes of polyurethane from factories in the US and the Netherlands. It has established a liaison centre in Beijing and a technical development centre in Shanghai. It wants to upgrade the Beijing office to a technical centre and by 1995 to have opened a 'systems house', where customised polyurethane can be produced. The latter will cost up to Pounds 10m. PTA. ICI's Taiwan plant produces 350,000 tonnes of PTA a year. Currently up to 10 per cent of output is exported to China, but customers on the mainland want more. ICI's board is considering a proposal to double the capacity of the Taiwan plant, some of which would go to satisfying demand on the mainland. One of ICI's main customers in China is Yizheng Chemical Fibre Company. Earlier this month ICI paid Dollars 7.7m (Pounds 5.3m) for a 2.5 per cent share of the company, which is to be listed shortly on the Hong Kong stock exchange. Additionally, ICI has licensed its PTA manufacturing process to two mainland Chinese chemical companies. Paint. ICI has ambitious plans to invest in paint factories throughout China. It is currently assessing sites in and around Shanghai, and intends to invest in plants in Tianjin, Beijing, Wuhan and others. For automotive paints, currently refinish paints, it has about 300 outlets throughout the country. Last year it established 60 outlets to sell decorative paint and hopes to have 180 open by the end of 1995. Mr Barry Matthews, managing director of ICI Swire Paints, said the company had no ownership of these retail and business outlets, however they tended to stock only ICI paints. 'It is relatively rare in China to have such a broad distribution network,' he said. According to Mr Chandler, one of ICI's biggest challenges will be building up local management. The company believes that the biggest brake on its growth in China will be the supply of qualified and trained personnel. 'People are both the problem and an opportunity,' he says. 'In China the outlook and values are different, and trying to fit them into a western company is very difficult.' An added pressure is that with mainland management resources so scarce, ICI has been forced to take risks with people which it would not normally be prepared to do. 'We've been forced to take expensive decisions about people before we have really got to know them,' says Mr Chandler.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Finland is reportedly prepared to give the  western defense alliance, NATO, a positive response to its  Partnership for Peace initiative. It is expected that on Monday  [10 January] a NATO summit in Brussels will present a proposal  on the issue to all the countries involved in the CSCE process,  including Finland. According to a review prepared at the  Foreign Ministry in Helsinki, the NATO initiative is in harmony  with Finland's own foreign policy and security policy aims. The  ministry is stressing, however, that Finland is not seeking new  defense or security arrangements. [passage omitted]</p>

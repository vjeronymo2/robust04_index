			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jose Carlos Santana] </F>   [Excerpts] Belem, 9 Jun (AE) -- The 24th OAS General  Assembly will close here on 10 June. The 34 OAS member states  have described its results as positive and quite significant,  especially in the area of human rights. OAS Secretary General  Joao Baena Soares characterized the approval of an  inter-American convention to prevent, punish, and eradicate the  use of violence against women -- which was already signed by  five countries, Brazil included -- and of an inter-American  convention on the forcible disappearance of people, namely  political activists, as "extremely significant for the future of  the continent." [passage omitted]    In addition to the above two conventions, Baena Soares also  mentioned the adoption of a resolution proposing greater  cooperation for hemispheric security and limiting the  proliferation of instruments of war, a proposal to create an  inter-American defense board, and another proposal containing  measures to improve the inter-American program to preserve the  environment.    Baena Soares said: "I could not have asked for better and  more significant results at the Belem meeting." He added: "The  decisions made here are proof that the OAS is increasingly  becoming a forum in which all countries in the hemisphere can  discuss political and economic issues and other types of issues  as well."</p>

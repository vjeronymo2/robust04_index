			<p>930924 FT  24 SEP 93 / Survey of IMF World Economy and Finance (39): A tireless campaigner - Profile, Babacar N'Diaye / The ADB chief has also used his position to act as diplomat and spokesman for the world's poorest continent, whose future, he believes, lies with investment rather than charity FEW EXPERTS can claim to understand Africa's debt problems as well as Babacar N'Diaye, the Senegalese banker who has headed the African Development Bank since 1985. Mr N'Diaye, who joined the ADB as a young graduate straight out of accountancy school in France, has devoted 28 years to making it one of the continent's biggest sources of development finance. With a disbursed loan portfolio of more than Dollars 7bn, the ADB is as important to Africa as the World Bank or any large Western donor nation. Under his stewardship, the multilateral bank has acquired a political cohesion that is sadly absent in other pan-African organisations. This has given him the confidence to tackle sensitive political issues, such as South Africa's admission to the ADB. South Africa is expected to become the ADB's 52nd member next year, after holding its first multi-racial elections. Mr N'Diaye has also used his position to act as diplomat and spokesman for the poorest continent. He has campaigned tirelessly to find new formulas to reduce Africa's Dollars 300bn foreign debt. Some admirers even favoured Mr N'Diaye to succeed Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar as UN secretary- general. In the event, the job went to a fellow African, Boutrous Boutrous Ghali. Mr N'Diaye is one of a new generation of Africans who believe that the way forward for Africa is not to beg, but to persuade investors that the continent has long-term growth potential. He does not run the bank like a charity. His main success to date has been to strengthen its lending base by increasing its borrowing power in the international markets. When he took over the presidency in 1985, the bank's capital was Dollars 6.3bn; it is now Dollars 22bn. But a bank is ultimately only as strong as its customers, and Africa's worsening economic environment has also created problems for the ADB. At the last annual meeting in May, Mr N'Diaye devoted a large part of his address to the issue of arrears, which now total more than Dollars 425m - about 6 per cent of outstanding loans. Zaire is the worst offender, with unpaid debts of Dollars 140m. Even borrowers with a good track record, such as Kenya, are now Dollars 15m in arrears. In spite of a doubling of loan-loss provisions to Dollars 50m, N'Diaye has begun to turn the screws on delinquent borrowers. 'The insidious accumulation of arrears is disastrous for the institution in the long run,' he told the annual meeting in Abidjan. He said the bank would begin to apply tighter lending controls. However, African states are already finding it difficult to meet the ADB's long list of loan conditions. Only 17 countries borrowed from the ADB in 1992, and Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria accounted for half of the total loan approvals of Dollars 1.75bn. There is a growing demand for concessionary grants from the ADB's African Development Fund, but a concomitant reluctance by western countries to increase subscriptions to the ADF. Mr N'Diaye, therefore, favours altering the balance between the ADB's non-concessionary and concessionary financing. Under his plan, ADF lending would double to Dollars 2bn a year, while the ADB's operations contracted to Dollars 1bn. Cost-cutting western governments, however, have dismissed as unrealistic his call for a 62 per cent increase in the replenishment of ADF funds, which is due early next year. Mr N'Diaye remains undaunted. He has embarked on yet another of his international lobbying marathons for the needed funds.</p>

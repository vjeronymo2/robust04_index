			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Dr. Stanislaw Kalina, director of the </F> Szczecin Voivodship Office, by correspondent Pawel Winiarski;  place and date not given]    [Text] [Winiarski] It would appear that the reform of the  administration system in our country has slowed down recently.  On the other hand, the number of conflicts between local  self-government structures and the central administration has  increased. What is happening here?    [Kalina] When I was starting in my post of the Voivodship  Office director, the process of decentralization of the existing  range of powers and administrative competence was very rapid.  Nowadays, these changes have, as it were, been suspended in a  vacuum. For example, the pace of work on the pilot reform  program has decelerated, as has that on the reform of the  country's administrative division system. On the other hand,  local self-government bodies had earlier secured a range of  powers and competence of which they cannot now take full  advantage because the necessary funds for the implementation of  these powers have not followed in the wake of the legislation.  In addition, the question of a clear and lucid division of  competence between the central and local administration is also  still unclear in many points. Consequently, it is not surprising  that conflicts arise.    [Winiarski] Is Szczecin Voivodship particularly prone to  frequent occurrences of such conflicts? Are they justified?    [Kalina] On the whole, as regards the quality of the central  administration's work, we are among the national champions here,  but the real criterion for assessing the work of the central  administration bodies is provided by the results of conflicts  brought before the Supreme Administrative Court [NSA]. In that  area, we have no reason for indulging in complexes. For  example, last year none of our supervisory administrative  decisions against which charges were brought before the NSA by  local self-government bodies were actually found questionable by  that court. This does not necessarily mean that all of our  other decisions were invariably correct. The NSA judged that  several of our administrative decisions were incorrect. This  was partly the result of the complexity of our legislation and  partly the fault of individual officials handling the cases.  However, the vast majority of complaints are caused by the poor  knowledge of our legislation prevalent among the public and the  lack of understanding of the role of central government  officials. Another, partial reason is that certain  organizations, particularly the trade unions, subscribe to the  philosophy that, if the law is unfavorable to their causes, that  is just too bad for the law.    [Winiarski] You mentioned mistakes made by central  administration officials. How do these mistakes arise?    [Kalina] First of all, they arise out of the lack of  thorough  briefing in the disciplines of administrative law and modern  administration systems. We still suffer from the lack of a  cadre of well-trained experts, who would be apolitical, assured  of their job security, protected from outside pressures, and  given sufficient financial security in their positions. This is  our greatest problem, and it can only be solved by a new  parliamentary act on public service officials. At present, we  have the opposite situation, with a growing number of instances  of outside pressure to bring about certain administrative  decisions, and with the financial situation of the public  service officials worsening steadily. In this situation, it is  hardly surprising that the best experts leave the sector and the  most talented graduates of higher education establishments are  reluctant to join our ranks.    [Winiarski] The list of complaints leveled against the  central administration includes the extremely onerous and  time-consuming procedure of appeals against the voivodas'  decisions. It is true that cases brought before the NSA wait  there for a very long time before being investigated.    [Kalina] It is indeed true. At present, the nearest  extramural NSA center is situated in Poznan and serves five  voivodships. Consequently, cases wait for six months or more  before coming up for investigation. We want to change this  state of affairs and set up an independent extramural NSA center  in Szczecin. All the formal criteria for doing so have been  met: We have a sufficient number of cases awaiting  investigation, an adequate number of experienced and highly  qualified judges, and enough academics who specialize in that  branch of the law. We have also been successful in "breaking the  premises barrier" in Szczecin. At present, the only dilemma we  still have to face is the choice of the future seat of the  Szczecin extramural NSA center from the two premises offered to  us. Consequently, I believe that the first cases will be heard  by the center as soon as the first quarter of next year.    [Winiarski] But does it guarantee that they will be  investigated promptly?    [Kalina] Yes, and this should be advantageous not only to  those bringing the charges, but also to the central  administration bodies themselves, including such special  administration centers as, say, customs and excise offices and  the treasury police. Nothing improves the quality of work as  effectively as the awareness of the existence of rapid  monitoring systems capable of checking your results. In  addition, the proposed bill postulating a revision of the NSA  act contains provisions on the NSA control of local legislation  brought in by local administration bodies. This will in effect  mark an end to the accusation leveled against us that the law  set down by the voivoda is not subject to any judicial controls.    [Winiarski] Have such accusations been brought against you?    [Kalina] Certain people view relations between central and  local administration as a platform for power struggles and  fights for domination. But we are doomed to work together, and  we must find a way of coexisting. The voivoda does not aspire  to the role of a scourge or sword suspended above the doings of  local self-government structures. Our proposals and suggestions  extended to city and parish councils before they make their  decisions in specific cases prove that we wish to avoid the need  to waive them after the fact. This type of cooperation has  proved successful with many local self-government structures,  but we simply cannot avoid a certain area of conflict,  especially in the sphere of finance. Unfortunately, the  situation is such that the voivoda is unable to finance many  projects because he himself has no adequate funds at his  disposal. The funds come from the central budget and are  strictly limited.    [Winiarski] The voivoda also has the power to coordinate the  activity of special administration structures. How are  relations shaping along this line?    [Kalina] They vary. For the past few years, there has been a  tendency to encourage massive development of the special  administration structures and multiplying the numbers of  relevant institutions. Each of them is under the competence of  a different institution, and, as a consequence, the voivoda is  unable to coordinate the work of that sector of local  administration, although he is formally obliged to do so. As a  result, the decisionmaking process becomes unduly extended, the  bureaucratic apparatus mushrooms, and the entire system becomes  more rigid instead of more flexible. This, of course, in turn  causes frequent conflicts and misunderstandings. In  consequence, all the blame is heaped on us because the voivoda  is the most easily accessible representative of the central  administration and the government.    [Winiarski] But perhaps the whole central administration is  not really so very necessary?    [Kalina] There is no state in the world capable of  functioning well without its own internal administration.  However, the secret is in getting the whole administrative  machinery to function efficiently and to issue just decisions on  the basis of the legislation in force. In turn, that  legislation must be clear and lucid and the range of competence  clearly set out and distributed, and the people who are involved  in operating that system must be adequately qualified and  trained.</p>

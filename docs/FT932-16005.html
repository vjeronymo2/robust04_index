			<p>930408 FT  08 APR 93 / World Trade News: Italian car market tumbles - Government will protest to Brussels over soaring Japanese sales THE Italian government is to complain to the European Commission about surging Japanese car exports, after sales figures for March showed a sharp rise in Japanese registrations against a steeply falling market. New car sales in Italy, Europe's second biggest market, dropped by almost 21 per cent in March. The fall was the biggest since sales plummeted in late 1974 and early 1975, after the first oil price crisis. The Rome government will argue that Japanese exports to Italy are running well above the 17.5 per cent increase to 42,900 hammered out for this year between European Community and Japanese negotiators last week. It will also claim that sales of Nissan's UK-built Micra compact car, which have soared this year, represent an unfair case of 'targeting' one model at a single market, a practice forbidden under an earlier EC-Japanese accord. Domestic manufacturers, largely Fiat, bore the brunt of last month's sales drop, with a 22.4 per cent fall in registrations. Although imports dropped by 19.5 per cent, most Japanese marques, notably UK-made 'transplants' such as Nissan's Micra and Primera models, performed strongly. Nissan, the biggest Japanese exporter to Italy, raised sales by 90 per cent to 4,372, boosted by demand for the Micra. Honda and Toyota also performed well. However, in spite of the increases, Japanese models still account for less than 5 per cent of the Italian market. Until last month, Italy had been partly isolated from the steep falls in demand seen in most neighbouring countries. Analysts attributed the sharp drop to rising unemployment and growing worries about the recession. Buyers may also have been put off by the general climate of political uncertainty, and price rises for some foreign models caused by the near 30 per cent decline in the value of the lira agains the D-Mark and most other European currencies. However, many foreign manufacturers have kept price rises well below the level of the lira's devaluation so as to maintain market share. Vietnam venture, Page 6</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In Zaire, the debates of the High Council of the  Republic, the new transitional parliament [HCR-PT], are going  slowly but surely. Important articles, about which the  opposition and the parliament had disagreed before, were finally  adopted in Kinshasa yesterday. Herve de Guelinck reports:    [Guelinck] An agreement was reached yesterday on the  autonomy  of the Central Bank -- and this is no mean feat -- on the way  regional governors are to be appointed, and on the government's  responsibility. The transition rules are gradually getting  clearer.    Another eight articles remain to be debated, including the  famous 76, which makes provisions for the way the prime minister  should be appointed.    That just shows how both sides are preparing for the final  showdown, for which it will be necessary to know who is on which  side, since good accounts make good friends. Each side is  accusing the other of attempted corruption. The Sacred Union of  the Radical Opposition and its allies say they possess a damning  file indicating that the presidency has 120 million new zaires  to convince some opposition counsellors to vote in favor of the  ideas of the Political Forces of the Conclave. On the other  hand, some newspapers have said that France and Belgium would  pay those voting for Tshisekedi. Information or indoctrination?    Monsengwo, the HCR-PT chairman, has forbidden counsellors to  attend the debates with more than 5,000 new zaires in their  pocket; that is, about 300 French francs. One is never too  careful.</p>

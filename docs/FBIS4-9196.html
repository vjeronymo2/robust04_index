			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Mirza Sadikovic from Bihac] </F>   [Text] Karadzic's fascists are continuing with their  attacks on the Bihac region, particularly on Buzim and the  surrounding area, and the free Bosanska Krupa territory. The  shelling of residential areas and the defense lines has  continued throughout the night and this morning, particularly  from the territory of the Republic of Croatia, that is, from the  so-called Serbian autonomous region of Krajina. These areas  have been attacked from the back, while the local rebels and  traitors have been shelling them sporadically from their  strongholds in Golubovici and (?Travnica). During the night  they fired at the Cazin outskirts, trying to instigate infantry  clashes. Their main target is still the [word indistinct]  production facilities.    On the Bihac part of the front, in the operative zones of  the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army 5th Corps and the Croatian Defense  Council [HVO], and on the Grmusko-Srbljanski Plateau, the  chetniks have been behaving in their usual manner, which means  unselectively shelling the defense lines, firing with  antiaircraft weapons and small arms, and infiltrating smaller  sabotage groups that keep trying to penetrate well inside our  territory. The chetniks have continued to bring in equipment  from the occupied Croatian territory, deploying it in the hills  surrounding the Bihac commune. They are also carrying out  engineering work and digging in.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Alija Izetbegovic, the president of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Presidency, has sent a letter to Palestinian  President Yasir 'Arafat in connection with the massacre of  Palestinians in the town of Hebron.    The letter reads: I am shocked by the news of the horrific  massacre of Palestinians in Hebron. The seriousness of the  incident is aggravated by the fact that it took place during the  holy month of Ramadan, in God's shrine, during the holy act of  morning prayer. The latest crime in Hebron, like the recent  massacre at the market in Sarajevo, is the kind of crime that  leaves one speechless. We consider the innocent victims at the  mosque in Hebron to be our own. We pray God to bestow  everlasting blessings upon the dead and give patience to their  families, the letter says.</p>

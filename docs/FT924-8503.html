			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Support for impeachment in French blood scandal FRANCE'S MAIN opposition parties yesterday supported President Francois Mitterrand's suggestion that parliament should open an impeachment procedure to clear up the question of ministerial responsibility in what one newspaper has dubbed the 'Bloodgate' scandal. Mr Mitterrand announced on Monday night that he would shortly propose a constitutional reform package, partly because the existing parliamentary impeachment procedure was an inappropriate way of dealing with the allegations that Mr Laurent Fabius, the Socialist party leader and former prime minister, and two other former ministers were culpable in the transmitting of HIV-infected blood to more than 1,000 haemophiliacs in the mid-1980s. But for the time being, impeachment involving the possible trial of the former ministers before a 'high court of justice' composed of 24 senators and deputies, was the only way of settling the affair, the president said. Mr Charles Millon, leader of the centre-right UDF party, proposed that the national assembly should elect its representatives on the high court next week. Last month the national assembly's steering committee rejected impeachment demands from the opposition. But the president's intervention has changed sentiment within the governing Socialist party. This is now anxious to clear its name and that of Mr Fabius. By contrast, opposition leaders were generally suspicious of Mr Mitterrand's announcement that, before the end of this month, he would also propose changes to limit the term in office of future presidents, to strengthen the judiciary's independence, and to alter the balance between the executive and legislature. Some suggested that, in coming with up such reforms after 11 years in office, Mr Mitterrand was only trying to distract attention from the blood contamination affair.</p>

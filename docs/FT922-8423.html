			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Delors denial on Brussels powers EUROPEAN Commission president Jacques Delors vigorously denied yesterday that he had any intention of trying to increase the powers of the Community's executive at the expense of small member states as the precondition for admitting new EC members. He made his denial in an interview with the Danish newspaper Politiken in an attempt to scotch rumours before next month's delicately poised referendum in Denmark on the Maastricht treaty. Mr Delors was reported to have been canvassing changes to make it possible for a bigger Community to function. Decisions are already slow in coming with 12 members in EC institutions set up to accommodate the original six member states. A smaller Commission, with greater supranational powers but more accountable to the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, was the central idea Mr Delors is said to have been considering. The suspicion was that such a Commission would weaken the role of the six-month rotating presidency of the Community. This would weaken the position of small member states, which hold it just as often as the large, core countries, while the latter would maintain their influence through more prominence in the new executive. Mr Delors said yesterday that criticism of his alleged intentions was 'based on untruthfulness and lies. 'I have never put forward these proposals, because I do not intend them. On the contrary the meaning of the Community is that small and big countries are heard with the same interest.' Earlier this week, Mr Uffe Elleman-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, warned him that the widespread rumours were endangering the outcome of the referendum in Denmark and could cost Mr Delors his job.</p>

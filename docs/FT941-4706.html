			<p>940310 FT  10 MAR 94 / Pay group raps failure to create jobs Average labour costs in manufacturing are lower in the UK than southern Italy, one of the poorest regions of the European Union, a report published by the Low Pay Unit yesterday shows. But it says the UK's success in creating jobs has been much less than countries with a higher level of employment and social protection. The research group said: 'Italy created proportionately six times as many jobs as the UK between 1970 and 1992. Germany created almost four times as many jobs and France created twice as many.' De-regulation, it said, had not allowed the UK to create employment and it had not delivered prosperity. 'It has helped to create a situation in which 40 per cent or more of the UK workforce are employed on a part-time, temporary or casual basis, or are classed as freelance or self-employed.' The unit said the UK was uncompetitive because productivity was low, pushing unit labour costs to a level very much higher than the EU average. In part the UK's low productivity was a result of long working hours and poor conditions of employment. Staff turnover and absenteeism were high by European standards and training was poor. 'These factors were directly related to the low wages themselves,' it said. De-regulation: Britain Pays the Price. Low Pay Unit 27-29 Amwell Street, London EC1R 1UN. Free</p>

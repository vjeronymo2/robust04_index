			<p><P> May 16, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE PREPS;  </P> <P> SOUTHERN SECTION CHAMPIONSHIPS;  </P> <P> MATER DEI PLANNING TO BRING ITS 19-1 TENNIS RECORD TO LIGHT  </P> <P> If there is a dark horse in the Southern Section 4-A tennis playoffs, it's  Mater Dei High School. At this point, there's no other way to classify the  Monarchs.  </P> <P> Mater Dei swept to the Angelus League title and compiled a 19-1 record. Not a  bad season. But when the Southern Section announced its pairings, Mater Dei was  not among the seeded teams.  </P> <P> Mater Dei plays host to Baldwin Park as first-round play begins today at 3:15  p.m.  </P> <P> If the Monarchs win, they play the winner of today's Newport Harbor-Marina  match. Some reward. Newport Harbor (13-7) is seeded fourth.  </P> <P> Mater Dei depends on the singles play of brothers Dax and Adam Peterson. Dax, a  senior, plays at No. 1 singles. Adam, a freshman, plays at No. 2 singles.  </P> <P> Corona del Mar, the third-seeded team in the 4-A, plays host to Nogales (17-4).  Top-seeded Santa Barbara (20-0) plays host to Santa Ynez (8-12), and  second-seeded Beverly Hills (14-6) plays host to Ventura (13-7).  </P> <P> In the 3-A, top-seeded Woodbridge (15-4) plays host to Claremont (11-8).  Second-seeded Laguna Beach -- led by Jon Leach, last year's Southern Section  singles champion -- plays host to Esperanza (7-9). Laguna Beach is 17-3.  Third-seeded Sunny Hills (18-1) plays host to Rubidoux (14-6).  </P> <P> San Marino, which has won back-to-back 3-A titles, is unseeded with a 17-3  record.  </P> <P> In the 2-A, Valencia (15-4), the Orange League champion, is fourth-seeded and  plays host to Bonita (12-8).

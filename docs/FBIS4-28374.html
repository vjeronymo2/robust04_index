			<p>BFN     [Text] The newspaper PRUM BAYON NEWS has been closed  forever.    Ieng Muli, information minister, issued a communique dated 7  June forbidding Thai Sarun, alias Seng Sokhom, to continue  publishing the newspaper PRUM BAYON NEWS.    This communique reached REAKSMEI KAMPUCHEA on 7 June. It did  not give any details about the offenses that PRUM BAYON NEWS had  committed. The communique merely referred in general to the  final provision of the Kingdom of Cambodia Constitution's  Article 139, the Cambodian king's royal decree of 1 November  1993 dealing with the appointment of the Royal Government of  Cambodia, the press law of the State of Cambodia's National  Assembly passed in its 6 April 1992 extraordinary session, and  the ethical code of the Cambodian Journalists Association.  Besides all of that, no other specific, detailed explanations  were given.    Since Cambodia returned to democracy after the May 1993  election, this has been the first time that a newspaper has been  officially shut down by government authorities. It should be  recalled that on 24 March Nguon Non, political director of  DAMNOENG PEL PROEK, was jailed for two days for refusing to  respond to a subpoena, and on 16 May the police confiscated all  copies of SAKAL before they could be distributed on the grounds  that this newspaper had disparaged the king, an act prohibited  by the Constitution.    Concerning this worrisome incident, it can be said that the  press in Cambodia is going through a frightening stage of  destabilization. While commenting on this event, the optimists  have pointed out that it was a correct measure taken by the  Royal Government to help strengthen the journalistic profession,  a step well in line with true democracy and necessary in a  law-abiding country. Almost without exception, people  disapprove of Cambodian journalists who are irresponsible to  their profession.    At about the same time we have learned that two other  newspapers might be closed if they continued to ignore the laws  of the state, to spurn their professional conscience, to cause  riots, to inflame public opinion due to old grudges or past  scores to settle, and if they refused to respect the superior  interests of the nation.    One Cambodian journalist has expressed skepticism, saying  that the leaders are indulging in the questionable tactic of  making certain statements intentionally for the press to report,  and then issuing denials to discredit the press. Faced with  such a ploy, Cambodian journalists will encounter great  difficulties no matter how extensive is the documentation and  evidence, including tape recordings, they have to back up their  reports. Aside from stoically enduring "pain" of great  magnitude, how courageous must these journalists be in order to  use all the proof they have against their own top leaders in  open court?</p>

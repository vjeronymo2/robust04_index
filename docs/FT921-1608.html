			<p>920324 FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (15): Fair exchange shaped by market forces WOLFF'S GUIDE TO THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE (4th. edition) Metal Bulletin Books Pounds 44 (Dollars 88), 269 pages THE TIN MEN by Ralph Kestenbaum Metal Bulletin Books Pounds 25, 316 pages THE latest edition of Wolff's Guide, edited by former FT Commodities Editor John Edwards, is renewed testimony to the long-standing, hand-in-glove relationship between the London Metal Exchange (LME) and Rudolf Wolff &amp; Co., one of its founder members in 1876 and now one of the elder statesmen of the metal-broking fraternity. Different chapters by various contributors cover in detail the LME's history from its early days in City coffee houses, how metal trading is conducted, the theory and practice of hedging, traded options, chart analysis, and the six metals traded on the exchange. Appendices list LME members, brands of deliverable metal, locations of LME warehouses and contract specifications. An index might have been useful, although the publishers might justifiably argue that the contents are so well arranged that the reader can find his way around without an index. A more obvious omission, particularly from the many worked examples of trading strategies, is any meaningful reference to dealing costs. How can one be sure that a complicated hedging programme will not cost more in commission than it is worth in trading gains? Of the 22 chapters in this edition, eight are new and several others have had to be revised since the previous edition in 1988. Trading on the LME has changed in several respects since then, with the advent of traded options, settlement in a choice of currencies, worldwide points of delivery and a trading 'horizon' extended from three to 27 months forward. Furthermore, the LME has had to restructure itself in the wake of both the 1985 tin market crisis and the 1986 Financial Services Act, both for its own protection and to redefine the relationship between its brokers and their clients. The concept of investor protection now extends to speculators and even trade hedgers on commodity markets, and the LME's clearing house, which guarantees the execution of every contract, ensures that brokers are protected as much from each other as from their clients. A consistent theme running through the book is the LMF, as the embodiment of irresistible free market forces, prevailing over the evils of price manipulation by both metal producers and speculators. This market is the dog which, unlike others, no cartelised or speculative tail can wag. It is the perfect hedging medium because it discovers the definitive free market price - because it is the perfect hedging medium. Ralph Kestenbaum's The Tin Men is a long overdue account of the most famous recent attempt to use the LME to rig a market. Kestenbaum, who led the LME brokers in their claims for redress from the International Tin Council (ITC), is particularly well placed to write this authoritative if not unbiased account. By October 1985 the ITC and its 22 member governments had run up a bill of Pounds 900m on the LME's tin market, which it then decided not to pay. Kestenbaum takes us through the web of contradictions, conflicts of interest, doublespeak and humbug which allowed the ITC to get into this position. He also corrects a popular misconception: that the scandal of the tin crisis was simply about the collapse in prices. More to the point was, first, that tin prices should never have been as high as they were to begin with; and second, that the price collapse was accompanied by the ITC's refusal to pay its bills. The politicians and bureaucrats who claimed to run the ITC deserve to be highly embarrassed by this reminder of their folly.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: GEA capital increase aims to raise DM370m GEA, the Ruhr-based German energy, environmental and process technology group, yesterday revealed details of its planned capital increase, intended to raise some DM370m (Dollars 218m) in extra finance for the rapidly expanding enterprise. The share issue will increase the company's basic capital stock of DM150m by a nominal DM40m, or more than 26 per cent, with the issue of 400,000 new voting shares, and the same number of preference shares. The shares will be offered to shareholders at a ratio of 4:1, and be managed by Commerzbank and CS First Boston. The company, based in Bochum, was family-owned until it went public with a DM775m share issue in 1989. It made its name in thermal and energy technology, expanding into air treatment and refrigeration, with the acquisition in 1992 of the Dutch group Grasso, and food and process engineering, with the purchase last year of Niro, in Denmark. Mr Volker Hannemann, the chief executive, said that at least one purchase was planned in 1994. 'We are working on a number of projects both inside and outside Germany,' he said.</p>

			<p>920120 FT  20 JAN 92 / Algeria recalls envoys to Paris and Tehran ALGERIA has recalled its ambassadors to Iran and France in response to criticism of last week's coup. It has also asked the Iranian ambassador to Algiers to leave. The deteriorating ties with the countries - one a leading Middle East ally, the other Algeria's largest trading partner - underlines the uneasy relationship between the new five-member Council of State and the rest of the world. The move came over a weekend which saw the first reported attack on security forces since the army stepped in and cancelled elections expected to bring the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) to power. According to the Algerian news agency, a group of Islamic militants attacked barracks at Sidi Moussa, 45km south of Algiers, on Saturday night. One soldier was killed and two others wounded. Algeria's decision to recall its ambassadors follows blunt criticism from Iran, and what Algeria's new leaders regard as a patronising and unhelpful response from France. Iran's sharpest comment came last Thursday, when President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said: 'Algeria presents a historical test, where the supporters of freedom and democracy failed and are really disgraced.' The close ties with Iran go back 11 years, when Algerian diplomats succeeded in convincing the Iranian leadership to release US diplomats who had been held hostage in Tehran for more than 12 months. Since 1979 Algeria has represented Iranian interests in Washington and in the International Court of Justice in The Hague. A suggestion by President Francois Mitterrand of France that Algeria should renew what he called a diplomatic dialogue is regarded by government officials as paternalistic. They also point out that as minister of the interior at the start of the Algerian war of independence in November 1954, he initiated a military campaign that paid little heed to democratic principles. Reacting to Algeria's decision to recall its Paris ambassador for consultations, Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, said on French radio he had confidence that Algeria's people would find 'the route to progress and democracy'. US officials have backed away from suggestions that Algeria might be producing a nuclear weapon at a secret research centre. Satellite intelligence data had been misinterpreted, they said.</p>

			<p>931126 FT  26 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Ferranti spells out alternative - Shareholders urged to be 'realistic' and accept 1p a share offer Mr Eugene Anderson, chair-man of Ferranti International, stepped up pressure on the defence electronic group's 48,000 shareholders yesterday, urging them to be 'realistic' and to accept GEC's 1p a share rescue bid. In a lengthy letter to shareholders Mr Anderson said Ferranti's directors 'understand the unhappiness' over the terms of the GEC offers to ordinary, special and preference shareholders. However, he reiterated that the Ferranti board believes that if the Pounds 11.4m GEC bid is rejected 'the only practical alternative is receivership, and we believe that no class of shareholder will receive any value from receivership.' The letter rejects many of the claims of disgruntled individual shareholders and attempts to deal with the issues raised by the Ferranti Shareholders Support Association led by Mr John Katz. In particular it confirms that administration, suggested by some as an alternative to receivership if the GEC bid fails, is not an option because Ferranti's banks have held a fixed and floating charge over the assets of the company for the past four years. As a result Ferranti's 15 banks, which are owed about Pounds 100m, can block the court appointment of an administrator and insist on receivership - something Mr Anderson said they have indicated they would do. The other issues covered in the letter include: Order book and installed base. The letter says orders arising from the group's Pounds 1bn installed base are reflected in the order book which fell from Pounds 200m at the end of March to Pounds 165m by the end of September  -a period when Ferranti lost Pounds 19.4m before tax. The current order book is 'not sufficient to sustain the Ferranti business and the group will have to be restructured, its cost reduced and substantial new business must be won for it to return to profitability.' Pension Fund Surplus. Although Ferranti's annual report shows that the actuarial value of the Ferranti pension scheme is over-funded by about Pounds 106m, under Inland Revenue rules, which impose more stringent actuarial assumptions, the letter says the surplus is not large enough to allow for any repayment. Tax Losses. The letter claims that Ferranti's UK tax losses of Pounds 110m can only be used to offset future profits from the Ferranti businesses. They cannot be directly transfered to GEC, or be offset against GEC's existing businesses. Goodwill. Ferranti insists the potential value of the group lies in the experience and expertise of its remaining employees rather than in patents and trademarks. The letter also emphasises that, 'Ferranti is worth only what someone will pay for it in its present circumstances.' GEC has said it will not proceed with the bid unless it receives the support of shareholders controlling at least 90 per cent of the group's 1bn shares.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / Donors increase aid to Indonesia INDONESIA'S western donors yesterday increased their aid for the coming year to Dollars 5.1bn (Pounds 3.4bn), from Dollars 4.9bn, in recognition of its 'excellent' economic performance and development needs. But several members of the 18-nation consultative group, chaired by the World Bank since Indonesia's row with the Netherlands over human rights, raised the issue of 'good governance', which they said was vital to sustain the country's development. Canada and Belgium were among those said to have taken this line. Mr Gautam Kaji, the World Bank's vice-president for East Asia and the Pacific who chaired the three-day meeting in Paris, acknowledged some donors brought up the issue of human rights, but said they were pursuing this bilaterally. Dr Saleh Afiff, Indonesia's economy minister, had declined to comment on the concerns in a multilateral forum as, he said, they were being discussed bilaterally. In a statement, the donors' group congratulated Jakarta 'on the continuity of its sound macroeconomic management and the country's excellent economic performance'. In 1992-93 this had resulted in the non-oil sector expanding 7.5 per cent, with a 30 per cent growth in exports. The current account deficit fell to 2.4 per cent of GDP. The Dollars 1.4bn improvement reflected a growth in non-oil exports and a larger than expected decline in imports. Indonesia was again congratulated for cutting poverty from 60 per cent of the population in 1970 to 15 per cent.</p>

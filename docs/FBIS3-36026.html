According to classified documents of the Russian Federation  Defense Ministry, only 51 percent of Armed Forces personnel are  capable of performing combat missions. Only one division in  every military district is capable of taking part in combat  operations, the Inspectorate for the Russian Federation Armed  Forces' Combat Readiness reports. Only 20 percent of tanks in  service can be considered combat ready. As for naval  requirements -- putting a ship on full alert within 45 minutes  -- only a few ships of the Russian Navy are able to fulfill them.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Serhiy Pavlenko: "The `Zombie' Effect: What </F> About the Elections To Be Held on 27 March 1994?"]    [Text] From the very outset the election campaign in  the Chernihiv region was marked by a newspaper sensation. Its  essence is quite simple. We voters--it is explained--are no  longer human beings, but rather zombies, resulting from a  "psychological weapon" used by the CIA. The mass media, which  have been taken over by this American agency, are being used in  a hostile manner to "subdue their own people.."    Let's cite some quotations. "We have become the subjects of  a  refined and subtle experiment which is unprecedented in its  scope," writes M. Khmelenok in NOVYNY HORODNYANSHCHYNY. "What is  being done is a persistent attempt--lasting for almost two years  now--to `restructure' the mode of thinking of 90 percent of our  country's population: to turn upside down the moral principles  and spiritual values that have been handed down from one  generation to the next, to make black look like white and evil  look like good. Everything bright and shining is ridiculed and  trampled into the dirt. What is being forged here is the  `freedom' to steal, to play clever tricks, to be degraded,  duped, and `not to figure things out'." The author of this quite  lengthy article, unfortunately, did not find enough space to  cite even one argument in support of his verbose and pessimistic  assessments. And it seems to me that he did not want to do this  because it would have been so hard for him. Well then, it is  certainly vain and useless to speak about finding on the staffs  of Chernihiv's local newspapers a single editor-agent of the  CIA. And this is something more akin to the propaganda of  "villains, corrupt persons, extortioners and bandits, traitors  and ignorant persons." All this is nothing more or less than the  ideogically misguided fantasies of dreamers, whom it is quite  easy to forgive for their nostalgic longing for the old days,  when the lacquered Brezhnevist truth lulled people's hearts.  Moreover, we can agree with at least one point made by M.  Khmelenko: The ideological manipulation of the voters as if they  were zombies is genuinely evident nowadays in the election  campiagn. In whose interests is this being done? Let's analyze  certain publications.    The state press with certain exceptions (the rayon-level  newspapers of Meni, Bobrovytsi, Bakhmacha, and Ichni, as well as  the oblast-level DESNYANSKA PRAVDA), in my opinion, has  consistently worked from issue to issue against Ukrainian  independence. This is felt particularly just prior to the  elections. M. Tush, the first secretary of the CPU [Ukrainian  Communist Party] Kulykivskiy Raykom and a candidate for the  office of people's deputy, has published more than 10 articles  and works in verse, the contents of which can be basically  boiled down to the following: "Give my Fatherland new birth,"  and "The shining little star soars again over the Desna. The  soul quickens with the abundant colors of spring. Shchors will  smile upon us again, and Lenin will awake from his sleep." And  in subsequent issues of the rayon-level newspaper he echoes the  political songs of H. Leheyd: "How we were in the Union. We were  harnessed togther to a single plow. We have begun to live  independently, and we are constantly clashing."    The copious rayon-level press boringly sets out such  conclusions and headlines as the following: "My hapless Ukraine"  (NIZHYNSKYY VISNYK), "Only in a powerful Union" (PROMIN  ZHOVTNYA), "How did we lose our life?" (NOVYNY  HORODNYANSHCHYNY), "How we were in the Union" (POLISKA PRAVDA),  and so on and so forth. One gets the impression that the people  of the Chernihiv region, like soulless zombies, are having the  following ideas pounded into their heads: How unfortunate,  helpless, foolish, simple-minded, and inept you are! And all  this is because of independence! It is clear that there is no  alternative idea to this. Nor is there any reflective thought  given as to how life in Ukraine could be made better. And so the  following premeditated, directorial thought has been implanted  in the voters' collective subconscious: We are such an inept  people. Brothers, let's gather under the protection of Moscow!  Let's vote for the candidates who have programs specially along  those lines.    Of course, all this is presented as the voice of the people.  But it has been taken directly from the written program of the  Ukrainian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), which is now on sale for  1300 karbovantsy at any newsstand in the Chernihiv region. The  adherents of the only "true teaching of  Marx-Engels-Lenin-Stalin" view their own future only in the  storehouse of the USSR, which will again "support  national-liberation movements in the colonies of imperialism,"  as a result of which the world capitalist system" will not  emerge "from its own present-day crisis, and socialist  revolutions will occur in most of the capitalist countries."    The "zombie" effect has manifested itself particularly  during  the days when the election campaign is gathering speed. As if  following the gesture of an orchestra conductor, LENINSKIY  SHLYAKH, POLISKA PRAVDA, and other newspapers at the very same  time in February published the joint statement by the leaders of  the Ukrainian Communist Party, Socialist Party, and Peasant  Party: P. Symonenko, O. Moroz, and S. Dovgan respectively.  According to this statement, the blame for all of Ukraine's  troubles falls upon Rukh and the Ukrainian Republican Party. It  was upon their demands that the "pro-Rukh" L. Kravchuk and I.  Plyushch appointed to the "storehouse of the oblast- and  rayon-level structures of state administration" "functionaries  of these political organizations to key positions of power and  authority."    Having read all the above, for whom should the voter cast  his  or her ballot? Of course, not for the "ruling" Rukh people,  and--I suppose--not for the communists (among the people it  seems that there is still a virulent allergy to raykoms, party  activists, and the like). Our degraded people--wearied by  political statements, promises, and economic stagnation--will  vote, first and foremost, for people of action, for people who  can get things done. They could be called the Expeditors (with a  capital letter) of the election district. It is already clear  that in the Ripkinskyy Election District No 449 victory will be  gained by A. Dron, chairman of the Ukrainian State Committee on  Housing and Communal Affairs. There are few persons who know for  what and how he voted during the present parliament, but three  Polisian rayons are almost completed converted to gas. That is a  fact--a reality. And people know about that. And, therefore, he  is now the main newspaper hero of the three rayons in this  election district.    An analogous situation has also evolved in other districts.  As I was informed by one of the leading officials of the  oblast-level state administration, in January the oblast  authorities felt themselves under some unprecedented pressure  from Kiev. They were openly offered large-scale credits,  off-budget financing in great amounts, and even petroleum  products. For seats in the parliament! These are not  good-quality principles on the basis of which life can be  improved throughout Ukraine. But it is precisely such things  that the voters are demanding; their evaluational criteria have  been distorted by an obvious system of propaganda.</p>

			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Government loses Japan history case THE JAPANESE education ministry went too far in exercising a controversial legal right to censor school history textbooks, the Tokyo high court ruled yesterday. The court awarded Y300,000 (Pounds 1,866) compensation to a professor at the former Tokyo University of Education, Mr Saburo Ienaga, who had challenged government changes to parts of a history text he wrote 31 years ago. His book, a New Japanese History, had offended the education ministry with its blunt accounts of Japan's aggression in Asia. A series of legal battles over the years by Mr Ienaga, 80, have become a symbol of Japan's uncomfortable internal debate over its responsibilities in the second world war. His campaign has been given wider relevance by the recent apologies by Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the new prime minister, for Japan's war-time record. Mr Hosokawa's apologies have drawn bitter criticism from the nationalist wing of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party. Mr Masatoshi Kawakami, the presiding high court judge, yesterday upheld the ministry's right to censor history textbooks, but said it had acted unreasonably in demanding that Mr Ienaga rewrite three out of eight passages cited in the case. An account of the 1937 Nanking massacre was among the passages that should not have been censored, he said. Mr Kawakami upheld the education ministry's right to change five other passages, on the grounds that it was 'not recommendable' for a textbook to contain negative judgments about Japan 'when such negative judgments are not established'. Japan's supreme court apparently put an end to Mr Ienaga's campaign only last March, when it ruled that the education ministry had the right to ask for changes or disqualify textbooks from school lists on 'reasonable grounds'. Yesterday's ruling showed 'some progress', said Mr Ienaga. However, he said he would take the case, his third, on to the supreme court, Japan's top legal authority.</p>

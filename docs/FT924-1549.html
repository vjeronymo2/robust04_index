			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Amstrad directors sell stakes TWO OF Amstrad directors sold their entire equity holdings in the consumer electronics group on Tuesday for 23 1/8 p-a-share, less than a week after shareholders rejected Mr Alan Sugar's 30p-a-share buy-back bid for the company he founded. Mr Malcolm Miller, sales and marketing director, sold 714,000 shares to raise Pounds 165,112. Mr Robert Watkins, technical director, sold 563,000 shares, raising Pounds 130,309. Amstrad, which has 581m issued shares, reported the directors' action, but declined any further comment. Mr Sugar, who has a personal 35 per cent equity stake, warned shareholders during his battle to take Amstrad private again that the share price might fall sharply if they rejected his bid. However, since Amstrad's 31,000 shareholders rejected his offer the shares have traded in a narrow range around 25p. Yesterday, after gaining 1p to 26p the price slipped following the sales' disclosure, but pulled back to close just  1/2 p lower at 24 1/2 p.</p>

			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / Staff discounts freed of VAT EMPLOYERS selling discounted goods to their staff will be required to levy VAT only on the reduced price, in a reversal of the previous position held by Customs and Excise. The decision - which will be announced next week  - follows vigorous complaints from employers, particularly in the retail trade. It will come into effect from May 15. In the past Customs has argued that employees who receive staff discounts as a condition of the terms of their contract or when they sell goods on to third parties should pay VAT on the full market price. Customs said yesterday that the existing position was 'a bit of an absurdity' and that it had normally proved very difficult in practice to demonstrate cases where VAT should be charged on the retail price. The ruling will mean that, for example, where clothing with a retail price of Pounds 100 was sold to staff at Pounds 80, staff will now always be required to pay VAT only on Pounds 80. Tax specialists are trying to work out whether those few companies that have paid the full VAT on the discounts will be eligible for a refund.</p>

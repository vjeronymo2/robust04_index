			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Warsaw, March 9 -- Former Senate Speaker Prof.  Andrzej Stelmachowski on Wednesday told PAP that a declaration  to set up the "Programme Centre" is an attempt to return to the  roots of the Solidarity movement and that this new movement will  draw on the Catholic Social Thought.    "Accepting unanimously, that the Catholic Social Thought is  an ideological foundation of further works, the group will seek  to formulate theses and a political, social and economic  programme for all who adhere to Christian, democratic ideals and  the concept of social solidarity," the Programme Centre  declaration reads.    The new movement will not seek to become a party, and was  born "out of concern resulting from the fact that elements of  social justice are put to the back burner despite a government's  shift to the left," Stelmachowski claimed. He argued that the  ruling coalition has failed to present a concrete  socio-political programme that would contain a clear vision for  the future.    The centre intends to cooperate with the Solidarity clubs  and  other socio-political groupings in formulating its programme.  Representatives of the "Solidarity" Union Mazowsze Chapter, the  New Polish Right (NPP), the Party of Polish Democracy (SDP), the  Christian Democratic Centre (CCD), the Movement for the Republic  of Poland (RDR) and former activists of the Centre Alliance (PC)  have responded to Stelmachowski's invitation to join the centre.</p>

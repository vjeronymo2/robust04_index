			<p>921126 FT  26 NOV 92 / International Company News: Illinois Tool in rival bid for Siddons ILLINOIS Tool Works, the US engineering group, yesterday emerged as a rival bidder for Siddons Ramset, the Australian hardware and fasteners group for which BBA, the UK component maker, has offered ADollars 86m (USDollars 58.8m). WA Deutsher, an Australian subsidiary of Illinois Tool, said it had offered ADollars 2 a share for Siddons, valuing the company at ADollars 94m. Pacific BBA, an Australian subsidiary of BBA, offered ADollars 42m in cash and shares worth ADollars 44m. Siddons, which has rejected the BBA offer, did not respond to the announcement by Deutsher. Siddons is seeking an order from the federal court to force Pacific BBA to increase the information in its offer document. Siddons claims the document does not provide shareholders with sufficient information to make an informed assessment of the true value of the share element of the offer. Mr Graham Johnston, Deutsher managing director, said that the Illinois Tool offer was subject to 90 per cent acceptance by shareholders and approval by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which monitors overseas investment.</p>

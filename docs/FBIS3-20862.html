			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.V.: "Granic Was `Brought' to Washington!"] </F>   [Excerpt] [passage omitted] This is Dobroslav Paraga  [president of one faction of the Croatian Rights Party] on the  Washington agreement: "The complete turnaround achieved in  Washington is a historic event, a final solution, not only to  the problem of Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, but a  redefinition of the situation in the Balkans. When I speak of a  turnaround, I have in mind the agreement signed in Washington,  which represents a complete negation of the present policy of  Dr. Franjo Tudjman, the policy that allied itself with the  Serbian chetniks at the expense of the Muslims. Because that  policy enabled not only the chetniks, but also the Russians, to  break through to the Adriatic, the United States has finally  realized that the basic principles of the post-world war order  are being destroyed, that Tudjman's pact with Belgrade was  destroying Yalta and that the West was losing its spheres of  interest. Therefore, the United States and its allies have  joined forces in the defense of their strategic interests to  revive the Yalta Agreement -- extending their sphere of interest  to the Drina River. How strong the U.S. influence is can be  judged by the fact that Granic was `brought' by plane to  Washington, where he was presented with the agreement that  renders the present Croatian foreign policy, as well as the pact  with Milosevic, irrelevant."</p>

			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Virtue in mega-deals After the financial excesses of the 1980s a new wave of takeovers and mergers denominated in billions of dollars inevitably gives rise to a sense of unease. The nervousness is magnified when, as in the case of SmithKline Beecham's offer for Sterling Health this week, a Dollars 2.9bn bid is financed on borrowed money and declared to be part of a plan to become 'the major healthcare company in the world'. Yet the generalised worry can be overdone. The financing of most of the mega-deals so far this year has fallen well short of the risks run in the heyday of leveraged buyouts. The deals are also being driven chiefly by industrial logic. The get-together between defence contractors Lockheed and Martin Marietta is part of a desirable rationalisation in an industry that has already seen the marriage of such giants as Northrop and Grumman earlier this year. SmithKline Beecham and Sterling are following a route already explored by Merck and Eli Lilly, among others. If the deals have anything in common, it is that they amount to a backhanded tribute to the effectiveness of the Clinton administration's fiscal policy. Defence and healthcare spending were two of the more dynamic components of the budget deficits that piled up under Mr Clinton's predecessors. The end of the Cold War and the need for discipline in welfare spending have combined to change government priorities. Mega-deals are a just one indication of how the corporate sector is trimming its sails to the prevailing fiscal wind. These problems are common to most of the industrialised world. But rapid adjustment in the US is facilitated by the existence of a more sophisticated takeover market. Europe's response is nonetheless under way, although the commitment to fiscal orthodoxy, which is encouraged by the Maastricht convergence criteria, varies widely from government to government. Measures to cut spending and increase taxes are accompanied by an accelerating privatisation programme that will shift part of the burden of public sector finance from debt to equity markets. Among Europe's corporate giants awaiting treatment are Lufthansa in Germany, Renault in France, and Italian energy and telecom concerns Enel and Stet. One of the conventional wisdoms of the post-Cold War world is that the adoption of the liberal market model in developing countries will raise investment returns and attract a growing flow of First World capital. This is undeniable; but it should not be forgotten that the potential for increasing risk-adjusted returns in the public sector of the industrialised world is also very great. One lesson of the British privatisation programme is certainly that policymakers tend to underestimate the scope for efficiency gains at the time of privatisation. The dynamic effects that come from the introduction of market discipline into hitherto protected industrial structures are far reaching. The phenomenon may also result in a pattern of capital flows that diverges sharply from that suggested by the global distribution of payments imbalances. There may be advantages, too, for continental Europe in the more active equity markets that will result from privatisation. The merits of takeovers in bringing about industrial restructuring remain controversial. But a deeper secondary market is a magnet for external portfolio funds and thereby helps reduce the cost of domestic capital.</p>

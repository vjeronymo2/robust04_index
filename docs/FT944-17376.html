			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Analysts warn of provisions at Lucas Lucas Industries, the automotive and aerospace component maker, could make provisions of up to Pounds 100m, pushing it into a headline loss when it announces its annual figures on Monday. The speculation among City analysts is that provisions could be at least Pounds 17m to take into account costs involved in warding off litigation in the US over lapses of quality control on aerospace component contracts with the Defense Department. But the provisions could reach as high as Pounds 100m, in the opinion of Credit Lyonnais Laing, if Mr George Simpson, the new chief executive, embarks on a major restructuring of the group to cut costs. This may involve job losses and a continuation of the series of plant closures which go back to 1991-92. Lucas's difficulties in the US are well known, but any provisions for restructuring remain guesswork until Mr Simpson, on Monday, outlines his strategic plans for the group. If the provisions go as far as the highest guess, then they would push Lucas into a pre-tax loss. Without provisions, Lucas is expected to make pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 65m, perhaps as much as Pounds 80m, for the year to July, compared with Pounds 50.3m in 1992-93. The dividend is forecast to stay at 7p. Mr Simpson, since his arrival from Rover last April, has reviewed Lucas's activities and concluded that the group should concentrate on aerospace and automotive. The first priority, he has made clear, is to improve the group's financial performance. The plans, foreshadowed last week when Lucas put a software company up for sale and said it was considering the sale of a manufacturing systems consultancy, will also involve a new round of disposals. These are expected largely to be companies in what was the group's applied technology division.</p>

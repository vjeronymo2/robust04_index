			<p>921030 FT  30 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: ICI ICI's demerger plan could still be scuppered by the cycle. The proposed rump chemicals business made a trading profit of just Pounds 1m in the third quarter, including losses from associated companies. The shape of the business may change slightly, but the chemicals side will hardly be in a position to foot its share of ICI's Pounds 400m dividend bill next year. By maintaining that chemicals and bioscience will be run as separate units from the New Year, ICI is keeping its options open. It might be better advised to shelve the plan until the economic prospects are clearer. ICI Bio is in better shape, although sales of Tenormin, the heart drug, have gone into a nose-dive since its US patent expired last year. With other drugs turning in respectable volume growth - and the benefit of a stronger dollar - bioscience could yet show respectable growth next year, even allowing for some drag from agrochemicals. Judging by yesterday's dire results from DSM, ICI is possibly faring better than the competition in bulk chemicals. Even so, the prospects are so bleak that the immediate question must be whether ICI can afford to pay a maintained dividend this year. On the basis of yesterday's figures, it is touch and go whether such a payout would be fully covered by earnings. A lower dividend would ease the burden on the chemicals business if the demerger goes ahead. But it would hardly encourage shareholders to subscribe to an ICI Bio rights issue.</p>

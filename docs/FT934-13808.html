			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / People: Baron for Owners Abroad Owners Abroad has appointed Francis Baron as chief executive, thus completing the top management reorganisation triggered by the resignation of Howard Klein from both positions in July. Baron has been chairman and chief executive of Anglo-Saxon Television, a family company he set up last year after he resigned from European TV Networks. Michael Julien, former chief executive of Storehouse who was appointed non-executive chairman of Owners Abroad in August, is understood to have wanted a chief executive with strong management and marketing skills. Klein was forced to resign after he issued a profits warning only four months after Owners Abroad narrowly fought off a hostile bid from rival Airtours. Baron joined WH Smith in 1983 to build a television division from scratch. By 1991, when WH Smith sold its television interests, the division had become one of the largest satellite operators in the UK. Baron helped put together an international consortium, which became European Television Networks, to buy the business from WH Smith for Pounds 50m. But he resigned last year after differences with the foreign shareholders and set up Anglo-Saxon Television.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Michael Hornsby article: "Water Tests Show Quality </F> Improving"]    [Text] Water quality in Britain's rivers has improved over  the past 20 years, a survey shows.    Over three years, 170,000 schoolchildren tested 415 rivers  and streams: 75 per cent were in "great" or "good" condition,  based on ability to support insect life. Jane De'Ath, who  co-ordinated the National RiverWATCH project, said that was a  5.7 per cent improvement since 1971.    "This is a welcome improvement but we cannot afford to be  complacent," she said. "There were big regional variations,  with rivers in the North generally faring much better, while  water quality in some southeastern counties has declined."    The children monitored their local rivers during September,  October and November in 1991, 1992 and last year. They were  given kits to measure acid and nitrate levels and fashioned  other equipment from household rubbish. Water quality was rated  "great" in 28.2 per cent of rivers, meaning they were able to  support insects that need high oxygen levels, and 47.2 per cent  of rivers rated "good". The worst 2.9 per cent supported no  animal life.    There were big regional variations. On the insect test,  quality improved most in Warwickshire and Lancashire and  declined most in Bedfordshire, Suffolk and London. The poor  showing of the South East is due to concentration of industry  and population, intensive farming and drought.    The 13 most litter-strewn rivers were the Cottingham Beck  (Humberside), Stour (Worcs), Idle (S Yorks), Lukely Brook (loW),  Severn and Rea (Shrops), Lostock, Irwell and Calder (Lancs),  Trent (Staffs), Aire (W Yorks), North Esk (Midlothian) and Cam.</p>

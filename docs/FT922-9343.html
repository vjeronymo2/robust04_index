			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / Arts: Royal Ballet new season The Royal Ballet is staging Tales of Beatrix Potter at Covent Garden next December. This is the first time that the work, choreographed by Frederick Ashton for a movie in 1971, has been performed live. Anthony Dowell, director of the Royal Ballet, has undertaken the adaptation which should prove a success for the company. The other major ballets in the 1992-93 season are the British premiere of Baryshnikov's Don Quixote and a new one act ballet by David Bintley designed by Jasper Conran. The Royal Ballet will dance Glen Tetley's La Ronde for the first time and there will be a new production of Balanchine's Ballet Imperial. General director Jeremy Isaacs confirmed yesterday that Covent Garden will close in 1997 for large scale renovation work. It hopes to be a beneficiary of the Government's Millennium Fund and open its refurbished building in grand style to welcome the 21st century.</p>

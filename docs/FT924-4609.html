			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (21): Barriers in accountancy ACCOUNTING HARMONISATION IN EUROPE, VOLUME II by Christopher Nobes Financial Times Business Information, Pounds 160 IF BRITISH standards-setters had bothered to glance across the English Channel a few years ago before they started investigating an approach to replacement cost accounting, they could have saved themselves considerable trouble: Philips, the electronics group based in the Netherlands, had already developed a version which it had been using in its published annual accounts since 1951. The incident is just one example of the many differences and barriers to change in financial reporting and auditing standards across Europe, highlighted in Christopher Nobes' book on EC accounting harmonisation. There are many ways of classifying accounting patterns in the EC states, says Nobes, professor of accounting at Reading University, and a committee member of the Federation of European Accountants. One clear-cut distinction is between the so-called Anglo-Saxon model - including the UK, Ireland, the US, Canada, Australia and the Netherlands - and the Continental model - such as France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and Greece. The Anglo-Saxon countries tend to use English law, have a significant equity market, and a strong, long-established accountancy profession.  The Continental versions are very different. The former are oriented towards shareholders, disclosure, professional standards and substance over form in printed accounts; the latter play towards creditors, are tax-dominated and enshrined in law. In a useful review of current legislation, he shows how EC company law directives are bringing about changes while still leaving room for great differences in presentation, measurement, publication and audit. There are some frustrations with the book. While he tantalisingly touches on the fall of the Iron Curtain and the westernisation of former the Communist countries at the start, Nobes does not explore how financial reporting practice is developing. He is also not always entirely sure whether his function is to provide a textbook or a rather more opinionated commentary. But the result is a valuable introduction to a topic which receives far too little serious consideration.</p>

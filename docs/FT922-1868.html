			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / Arts: As You Like It - Theatre The Open Air Theatre at Regent's Park ought to be the ideal setting for As You Like It, just as it is for A Midsummer Night's Dream. The Forest of Arden corresponds more closely to Regent's Park than most of the rest of London. Never underestimate, however, the chances of a director getting it wrong by trying to be clever. Maria Aitken's production is perverse. To be fair to Ms Aitken, her As You Like It is not nearly as dreadful as her programme note would lead you to think. Aitken claims that Jaques, the melancholy outsider, is the equivalent of a 20th century movie director: he has spotted that all the world's a stage and Arden is the place where you go to shoot on location. The idea produces one good joke. In the wrestling match Orlando gets hammered in the first round. Jaques, the movie director, calls a halt and substitutes the stand-in who pummels the court wrestler close to death. This is Hollywood triumphant, but merely a gloss on As You Like It. Gradually Hollywood recedes and the play takes over although the production remains perverse. Ms Aitken appears to think that all the men in the play are drips and all the women players. There is some evidence in the text for her point of view  -Orlando is not a ball of fire and you could say that Rosalind is lowering her standards by chasing him. On the other hand, if you take the female superiority too far, you begin to distort the play. As You Like It is about boy meets girl, mutual attraction. There has to be something to be said for the men. Aitken's preference for putting the women first has strange effects. Corin, the shepherd, has some wonderful lines in defence of the pastoral society: 'The greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck.' He is not allowed to speak them as if they are at the heart of the play or as if anyone might wish to take him seriously. The minor part of Phebe, the shepherdess, comes out as one of the most striking characters. This is partly because she is played by Anna Patrick, whose performance as Helena in the Regent's Park production of the Dream has already shown her to be an actress at the top of the class. It is also because the production suggests that she is a woman striking out on her own. The text shows plainly that she is only having a minor fling. Aitken's perversity runs into problems with Jaques, played by Bette Bourne. He is over-coiffeured and noticeably overweight. He speaks his lines very well, but the underlying suggestion is that he is suffering from some fatal disease, quite probably Aids, not an improvement on the original unexplained melancholy. Rosalind is played with some distinction by Cathryn Harrison. The question remains of what a clever girl like this is doing chasing a duffer like Orlando. The logical conclusion of Aitken's interpretation is that Rosalind should go off with Phebe.  Still, you can't keep a good play down; nor the pleasures of Regent's Park either.

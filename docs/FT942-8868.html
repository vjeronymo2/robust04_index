			<p>940518 FT  18 MAY 94 / International Company News: Flotation may help ITD build on past successes - Thai contractor plans listing Italian-Thai group, one of the biggest and most successful conglomerates in south-east Asia, plans to float Italian-Thai Development (ITD), its construction and civil engineering arm, on the Stock Exchange of Thailand. ITD, which accounts for about half of total group business, is expected to be valued at about Dollars 1.6bn when 10 per cent of its shares are listed in the next couple of months. This would give a market capitalisation bigger than the other three Bangkok-listed construction companies combined - including Christiani and Nielsen, the Thai group that took over its Danish parent in 1992. ITD is the dominant contractor in Thailand for big infrastructure projects such as ports, dams, power stations, roads and pipelines. The government has begun tendering out transport and other projects to private companies. ITD wants the new capital to help finance its share of concessions and pay for new equipment. In addition to the construction arm, the privately-held Ital-Thai group owns a trading and industrial business, importing aircraft and locomotives as well as pumps and valves, and holds a quarter of a brewery in neighbouring Laos. It also has interests in 14 hotels - including Bangkok's most famous, the Oriental - and in the luxury Eastern and Oriental Express train. Both the Oriental and the Royal Orchid hotels are listed on the SET, and there are plans to float the Amari group of hotels in the next few years. ITD is well-placed to take advantage of the inadequacy of Thailand's existing infrastructure. The Thai economy is growing at 8 per cent annually, but traffic congestion, water pollution and a shortage of telephones testify to the need for transport improvement and new communications networks. All are areas of opportunity for ITD. The company owns a 14 per cent stake in Thai Telephone and Telecommunication, which is installing 1m new telephone lines in the provinces. ITD is also hoping to take a share of forthcoming work to double Thailand's single-track railways. It is engaged in a Bt2bn (Dollars 80m) project extending terminal buildings at Bangkok's Don Muang international airport, and wants to win contracts for the new airport planned for Nong Ngu Hao. ITD has been selected as priority bidder, together with the Anglo-French engineering group GEC-Alsthom, for a proposed elevated commuter railway in central Bangkok - a contract that could provide as much as Bt15bn in revenue for ITD if it goes ahead. Last year ITD made a net profit of Bt1bn on turnover of Bt11.61bn. Even if the elevated railway project is excluded from the forecasts, Jardine Fleming Thanakom, co-lead manager for the forthcoming share issue, predicts sales growth of 27 per cent, 35 per cent and 25 per cent over the next three years. By 1996, ITD's turnover is forecast to reach the equivalent of Dollars 1bn, with profits of Bt2bn. The Italian-Thai group began as a temporary alliance for ship-salvaging between Mr Giorgio Berlingieri, a marine engineer, and Mr Chaijudh Karnasuta, a Thai-Chinese doctor turned entrepreneur. The two men established their own company in 1958 and bought the local assets of Archimede. Ital-Thai went from strength to strength, although Mr Berlingieri died in 1981. One of the few continuing links with Italy is a joint venture with the Italian company Trevi. The Karnasuta family now control the group and ITD.</p>

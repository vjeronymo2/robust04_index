			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / UK Company News: Leading UK and European institutions to shun WMI SEVERAL LEADING UK and European institutions have decided to shun the Pounds 465m flotation of Waste Management International (WMI) which enters its last lap next week. Despite heavy pressure from Cazenove and Merrill Lynch, brokers and lead underwriter respectively, the institutions say they will avoid the international offer and placing of 20 per cent of the shares in WMI, the overseas arm of Waste Management Inc, the US waste disposal company. However, demand from the US is expected to be strong enough to allow the flotation to be successfully completed. The UK institutions are worried about the high indicated price of the shares and the ambitious growth assumptions made for WMI in the issue prospectus. The shares are due to be priced in the US on Monday night, before preliminary dealings begin on Tuesday. UK fund managers said yesterday the price for the UK placing was likely to be around 620p, against an indicated range of 530-645p. That would value the whole of WMI at Pounds 2.3bn and put the shares on a multiple of 34 times the pro-forma 1991 earnings per share. US investors are reportedly keen to switch into the fast-growing overseas subsidiary of the US parent. See Lex</p>

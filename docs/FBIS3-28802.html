			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 10 KYODO -- Prime Minister Morihiro  Hosokawa vowed efforts Thursday [10 February] to bring stalled  trade talks with the United States to a successful conclusion in  his meeting Friday with president Bill Clinton in Washington.  However, Hosokawa offered no clues as to how he will break the  impasse.    He reiterated that Japan cannot accept a U.S. proposal to  set  numerical targets to gauge the openness of its markets to  imports, but said he will strive to reach an accord on bilateral  trade, Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura told a news  conference.    He said the premier told a cabinet meeting that the trade  negotiations are a key to further promoting friendly and  constructive ties between Japan and the U.S.    Hosokawa will fly to Washington later Thursday and hold a  summit with Clinton on Friday to assess progress in the economic  negotiations being held under a bilateral trade framework accord  concluded last July.    It will be Hosokawa's third meeting with Clinton since he  took office last August. They first met in New York in  September and again in Seattle in November.    In his afternoon news conference, Takemura reiterated that  Tokyo cannot accept the U.S. demand on numerical targets,  saying, "I don't think we will depart from that principle."    On Hata's arrival in Washington, Takemura said the foreign  minister will do everything he can in a last-ditch effort to  break the gridlock in the bilateral trade talks before the  Hosokawa- Clinton summit.    Asked about International Trade and Industry Minister  Hiroshi  Kumagai's remark suggesting the possibility of a partial  agreement in the negotiations, the chief government spokesman  said Tokyo is still trying to reach a comprehensive accord with  Washington.    Japan and the U.S. have been negotiating on three priority  trade areas -- government procurement of goods and services,  auto and auto parts trade, and insurance. They remain at odds  over the U.S. demand that "objective criteria" be set to measure  how open Japanese markets are to imports.</p>

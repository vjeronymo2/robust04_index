			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Letter: Economic ideas need scientific testing Sir, As Tim Congdon (Letters, July 2) knows, my colleagues, Andrew Burrell and Stephen Hall, have just undertaken the first systematic analysis of all the UK forecasts published regularly in Economic Forecasts, the monthly survey from North Holland. They presented this yesterday at the Macromodelling Conference at Warwick University. They compare the forecasting records of a wide range of forecasters, academic and commercial, allowing for differences in information available at the time of the forecast. They find that differences between individual predictions are typically small in comparison with forecasting mistakes. Moreover, forecasting late in the year on the basis of the fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimates helps in producing a good forecast of next year's growth. Some forecasting groups, such as London Business School, have not produced a regular year-end forecast (a reason why we cannot rise to Tim Congdon's challenge on end-year forecasting records). They therefore do less well in comparisons, such as Chris Huhne's Golden Guru award, which make no adjustment for differing information sets at the time of forecast. To win at the Guru game, the motto must be 'forecast often and late'. Allowing for this, one is led to the conclusion of our recent Economic Outlook, reported by Peter Marsh (June 28), that claims made for Tim Congdon's forecasting record have been exaggerated; it may or may not be marginally better than that of others, but the differences are dominated by the forecast errors. Tim Congdon also claims that his forecasting record rests on certain basic ideas in economic theory. He mentions a specific one - the need for equilibration between money demand and money supply - that is not in dispute, incorporated as it is in all well-specified macroeconomic models, including London Business School's. This is one of the reasons why his March Open Letter so entirely missed the point. His specific policy advice, that underfunding can materially affect the growth of broad money and the economy without a change in interest rates, is one that is inconsistent with modern monetary economics, particularly in a world of high international capital mobility. More generally, his analysis takes little account of recent developments in the theory of money and banking. Tim Congdon makes little reference to the very considerable body of empirical research devoted to testing the propositions that he advances and which are generally found wanting; hence our comments on the unreliability of broad money. It is important that economic ideas are subjected to careful empirical testing: this is the basis of the scientific method that allows the slow advance of knowledge. Tim Congdon has played a useful role in restating some simple propositions in macroeconomics; unfortunately they seem not to withstand scientific testing, perhaps because they are over-simple. Any edge that he may have in forecasting is based on intuition and prowess, not on theoretical insight or scientific method.

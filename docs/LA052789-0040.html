			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NO INDICTMENT IN FETUS-ABUSE COCAINE CASE  </P> <P> A grand jury refused to indict a mother for manslaughter in her infant's death,  which was linked to alleged cocaine use during pregnancy, authorities said  Friday.  </P> <P> Prosecutors had charged Melanie Green, 24, with involuntary manslaughter and  delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, a charge usually used against  street-corner drug dealers.  </P> <P> A Winnebago County grand jury that met Thursday did not indict her on any  charge, State's Atty. Paul Logli said.  </P> <P> Green's 2-day-old baby, Bianca, died Feb. 4. Cocaine was found in Bianca's  system and in her mother's, said Dr. P. John Seward, the county coroner. The  drug was carried through the placenta to the fetus, reducing Bianca's ability  to accept oxygen from the mother and resulting in brain damage.  </P> <P> Logli had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled substance.  </P> <P> In a similar case, another mother in this northern Illinois city of 140,000 was  convicted May 1 of prenatal child abuse for using cocaine throughout her  pregnancy, including the hours right before she gave birth. That child  survived.  </P></p>

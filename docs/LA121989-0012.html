			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CHARGERS LOSE GAMES, ORTMAYER LOSES JOB  </P> <P> The Chargers announced Monday that Steve Ortmayer, director of football  operations since January 1987, will not be offered a contract next season.  Ortmayer cleaned out his office at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium and left at  mid afternoon.  </P> <P> "Steve and I met today," Charger Owner Alex Spanos said. "I want to thank him  for the effort he has made to make the Chargers a stronger team. Our meeting  was amicable, and we wish him well in future endeavors."  </P> <P> Ortmayer, 45, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> There has been speculation throughout the season that Spanos was considering  replacing Ortmayer with Bobby Beathard, former general manager of the  Washington Redskins who left the Redskins at the conclusion of the 1988 season.  Spanos said last May that he planned to "make an effort to hire" Beathard, and  that he had discussed his intentions with Ortmayer.  </P> <P> Beathard, who owns a home in Leucadia, was with the Redskins for 10 years.  During that time, Washington played in three Super Bowls and Beathard earned a  reputation for having a keen eye for talent.  </P> <P> Sources have said Beathard may be reluctant to accept a position with the  Chargers because of Spanos' propensity to involve himself heavily with draft  and trade decisions. Beathard, currently a once-a-week television commentator  for NBC, could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Ortmayer, the director of football operations for the Raiders from 1978 through  January of 1987, has had his share of peaks and valleys with the Chargers. In  1988, the Chargers' first pick was Anthony Miller, now one of the top receivers  in the AFC. Also drafted in '88 was tackle David Richards, who has started all  31 games since.  </P> <P> This season's draft picks included defensive end Burt Grossman (eighth  selection), quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver (51) and running back Marion Butts  (183). Grossman has added strength to the Chargers' pass rush, Tolliver  recently took the starting job from Jim McMahon and Butts rushed for a  season-high 176 yards in Sunday's 20-13 victory over Kansas City.  </P> <P> But if Ortmayer's drafting was his strength, his trades were undoubtedly his  undoing. He gambled and lost in trading for Chip Banks in 1987. Banks is now  with Indianapolis. He sat out all of last season and was arrested four times on  drug charges.  </P> <P> Several Charger players have expressed dissatisfaction over Ortmayer's contract  negotiations. Heading that list is running back Gary Anderson, who sat out this  season because he could not come to terms with the Chargers. Anderson was the  team's MVP last season.  </P> <P> "I think he really dealt with me wrong at the beginning of the season," said  Anderson, in a telephone interview from his home in Tampa, Fla. "(Other Charger  players) who have dealt with him in the past seem like they have had a hard  time getting contracts also."  </P> <P> Ortmayer was also responsible for trading all-pro offensive lineman Jim Lachey  to the Raiders for Napoleon McCallum and offensive lineman John Clay. McCallum  was cut in training camp this season. Clay will probably not play again because  of a neck injury. Sources say that Spanos put pressure on Ortmayer before that  trade, telling him he had 24 hours to do something with Lachey.  </P> <P> Certainly, the verdict is still not in on the trade for McMahon, who is now an  $800,000-a-year backup and not exactly a gem from a public relations  standpoint.  </P> <P> Charger Coach Dan Henning expressed regret at Ortmayer's dismissal.  </P> <P> "I'm disappointed that Steve won't be with us," Henning said. "I've had an  excellent relationship with him. I think he's done a good job in the time that  I've been here.  </P> <P> "I saw him handle the draft as well as it can be handled, and I think we had an  outstanding draft. I've seen him put a great deal of time and effort into  getting things where they ought to be. And I see the progress. But wins and  losses . . . that's what we have to do a better job of."  </P> <P> Other Charger coaches had similar reactions.  </P> <P> "Surprised and very disappointed," defensive coordinator Ron Lynn said. "I like  Steve Ortmayer, and I think he's done a great job. I think he's been very  supportive of what (the coaches) have been trying to do."  </P> <P> Center/guard Dennis McKnight, the Chargers' player representative, said the  blame for the team's 5-10 record cannot be piled entirely on Ortmayer's  shoulders.  </P> <P> "I know he took a lot of abuse about the trades, but I wasn't of the belief  that they were solely his decision," McKnight said. "I'm sure Mr. Spanos gave  the final OK. It's hard to blame all those things that happened on one man. Mr.  Spanos is a successful businessman, and I think he wants to win in the worst  way."  </P> <P> As player representative, McKnight had the opportunity to deal with Ortmayer on  a regular basis.  </P> <P> "He was an OK guy to me," McKnight said. "That's a very high pressure job. Your  head is on the block. You've got to win."  </P> <P> In Ortmayer's three seasons, the Chargers were 19-27 and made no playoff  appearances. That starkly contrasts his tenure with the Raiders, who were in  the playoffs five times during Ortmayer's nine seasons, including two Super  Bowl victories.  </P> <P> Others likely to be dismissed by the Chargers at the end of this season are  Chet Franklin, the director of player personnel, and Les Miller, the director  of college scouting. Both were hired by Ortmayer.  </P> <P> Staff writer Brian Hewitt also contributed to this story.  </P> <P> Charger Notes  </P> <P> Quarterback Billy Joe Tolliver is probable for Sunday's season finale with the  Denver Broncos with a contusion in the leg. Tackle Joel Patten (hand) is also  probable.  </P></p>

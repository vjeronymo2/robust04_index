			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Bonds: Ecu sector welcomes first 30-year benchmark issue THE Ecu market gave a rapturous welcome yesterday to its first 30-year benchmark issue as the French Treasury duly launched a widely-expected Ecu1.5bn deal. Despite a rough ride for Ecu bonds yesterday, the new French issue was still trading at around its issue price by the close. The pricing of the bonds guaranteed a strong take-up. In an attempt to let the market determine the level for the long end of the yield curve, the lead managers, Credit Lyonnais and CDC, had indicated early in the day that they were looking for a yield of between 8.38 per cent to 8.41 per cent. However, price indications from syndicate members suggested a tighter price could have been achieved. The issuers opted to keep within their original parameters, though, and the bonds, with a coupon of 8 1/4 per cent, were eventually priced at 98.64, to yield 8.38 per cent. In the words of one banker: 'It looked as though the French government had given everyone a treat.' The issue also appeared to meet the French Treasury's own funding target. When launched at midday, the yield was almost exactly midway between the spreads on outstanding French franc OATs maturing in 2019 and 2023. Permission to strip the new bonds has not been given by the Treasury, in order to encourage their take-up as a 30-year issue. However, stripping is expected to be allowed at a later stage, probably after the issue has been added to in the coming weeks. Stripping will not be restricted to primary dealers in the French Treasury market. The maturity date, April 25, 2022, has been chosen to make the bonds fungible with the outstanding French franc 30-year OAT issue, should the EC move to a single currency in the interim. The issue was sold almost entirely in Europe before the New York market opened, with only a small portion going to the Far East. Latin America provided the other highlight yesterday as Bankers Trust International brought US dollar issues for Bariven, which is backed by Petroleos de Venezuela, the state oil company, and Tubos de Acero de Mexico, a steel manufacturer. The Dollars 200m five-year issue from Bariven was brought at a spread of 2.58 points over five-year Treasuries. The bonds traded slightly higher later in the day. By contrast, the Tubos de Acero deal came at a spread of nearly 4.5 points above the three-year Treasury, and the issue was increased from Dollars 30m to Dollars 50m due to demand. The longer end of the sterling sector saw further supply from the water industry, meanwhile, as South West Water issued Pounds 150m of bonds maturing in 2012. The issue, guaranteed by South West Water Services, the regulated utility in the group, was priced to yield 1.2 per cent over the 9 per cent UK gilt maturing 2008. In later trading it was offered at 99.875, compared with the re-offered price of 99.554. A shorter-dated sterling deal was launched by Samuel Montagu, which underwrote a Pounds 100m bought deal for the European Investment Bank. The issue, fungible with an existing Pounds 525m of bonds, created the largest euro-sterling issue yet. Having been brought at 5 basis points over the benchmark gilt, the spread had tightened by several basis points later in the day. Credit Local, the French agency, has set up an ADollars 750m registered bond programme in the Australian domestic bond market, following changes in April to the rules governing issuance by foreign borrowers, writes Tracy Corrigan. The first bonds, which will have a maturity of two to 15 years, are expected to be issued shortly. The programme was arranged by Hambros Bank. Nomura Securities has had its long-term rating lowered from AA+ to AA by IBCA, the European rating agency.</p>

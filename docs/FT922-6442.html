			<p>920523 FT  23 MAY 92 / Gardening: Historic views on a Cornish headland - A Garden to Visit / One of Britain's finest landscape parks AT THE extreme south-east corner of Cornwall, where the rugged coast turns northwards into Plymouth Sound, there is a bluff headland which is nearly filled by one of the finest landscape parks in Britain: Mount Edgcumbe, home for centuries to the Edgcumbe family. When Richard Edgcumbe built his turreted mansion there in 1547, he sited it halfway up the northern end of the headland, exposed fully to the sea and the sound, with a direct view of Plymouth across the water and Dartmoor in the far background. To highlight this outlook, he planted a double avenue of trees, with a wide grass ride between them, centred on the house. There are other equally impressive views, particularly south-east and south towards the Channel, and later generations were to take full advantage of them. For the moment, however, the Edgcumbes contended themselves with their 800 acres which they used as a hunting park. Over the years, this began to develop an increasingly composed quality, with many fine belts and coppices of trees, plus occasional isolated stone pines to add an element of drama. The only really level ground is by the sea, just to the south-east of the double avenue. It was there, fairly early in the 18th century, that a wilderness of trees and shrubs was planted. At that time, this was a very fashionable idea for getting away from the formality of much garden-making. The Edgcumbes showed a lively appreciation of what was going on by doing all planning and planting themselves, right up to 1971 when the property was sold to Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council. In all that long period, the family sought the advice of only one nationally-known gardener: William Mason, who provided help in turning a wilderness into what is known now as the English garden. But thereby hangs a story which was to affect the garden, and the fortunes of the Edgcumbes, profoundly. In 1779, there was a threat of invasion by the French and Spanish fleets, and the War Office demanded that all Mount Edgcumbe's trees and shrubs near the water be felled lest the enemy use them as cover. The order, which included the complete destruction of the wilderness, was obeyed. A couple of years later, the Edgcumbe who then owned the property was made a viscount - an honour which soon became an earldom. The following years saw a great burst of activity at Mount Edgcumbe, and this took two forms. The landscape was improved further by the addition of a circulating road known as the Earl's Drive, which incorporated various architectural features, some already in place and others newly constructed. In addition, a great natural amphitheatre facing Plymouth Sound was planted with trees and shrubs which, as the years went by, became more and more exotic. Eventually, this area became a very fine example of a 19th century woodland garden, complete with rhododendrons, camellias, magnolias and other fashionable species. A quite separate development, concealed from the amphitheatre by trees and hedges, included Mason's English garden and, at a later date, two other specialised gardens, one Italian in style and the other French. These allowed other architectural features to be used: an orangery and a balustraded stairway with statues in the Italian garden; and a conservatory in the French garden, where there is also a shell fountain, a trellis arcade, and much colourful bedding-out with plants in season. Since Mount Edgcumbe was sold, two more specialised gardens have been made. One is devoted largely to American plants, both to commemorate the US soldiers who were stationed there during the Second World War and to acknowledge family connections with America; the other a New Zealand garden with NZ plants and a spectacular geyser which spouts every 20 seconds or so. Much of the mansion was destroyed by fire bombs during the war, although it was rebuilt afterwards in much the same style. But another new garden, known as the Earl's garden, has been made behind this building, in Victorian style, with trees, shrubs, flower beds and well-kept lawns. Here, at the back of one of the lawns against a steep primrose bank, the wild British orchid known as lady's tresses has established itself and flowers freely. It is preserved by adjusting the mowing regime to suit the orchid's period of growth - proof that excellent conservation is not incompatible with highly-disciplined gardening. As if to acknowledge how firmly this historic garden has been linked with our own times, it now contains the national collection of camellias, most of themplanted in the amphitheatre, where conditions are ideal. There are already 450 varieties and, no doubt, many more to come. Park and gardens are open daily all year, free of charge. The house and the Earl's garden are open April 1-October 11, Wednesdays to Sundays and bank holidays, 11am-5.30pm, for an admission fee.</p>

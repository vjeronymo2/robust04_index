			<p>920904 FT  04 SEP 92 / Accountants warned of further fall in salaries ACCOUNTANTS must expect salaries to continue to fall in the short-term and little prospect of an upswing in employment over the next few years, according to a survey by Challoner James, a financial recruitment agency. London salaries for newly-qualified chartered accountants have fallen by between 4 per cent and 5 per cent in the last six months into the Pounds 20,000-Pounds 25,000 range. Salaries for chartered management accountants fell slightly, but held up more strongly than any other qualification, reflecting the greater relevance of the degree to many employers. There was also strong demand for accountants with language skills and for jobs in credit control, salaries supervision and internal auditing. Mr Martin Humberstone, Challoner James operations director, dismissed as 'wishful thinking' optimistic projections that the falling graduate intake would lead to renewed demand from employers in the mid-1990s. He said employers were becoming far more selective and increasingly recognised the need to hire people with sound business experience. Recruitment firms were still spending considerable time 'rescuing' newly-qualified chartered accountants hired by companies and struggling because of a lack of experience, he added. He said it was common for employers to offer jobs below the advertised salary because of the intense competition by applicants. Salaries for existing staff are on average 13 per cent higher than for equivalents who are newly-hired.</p>

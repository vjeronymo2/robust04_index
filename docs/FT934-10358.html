			<p>931105 FT  05 NOV 93 / UK Company News: WPP agrees sale of US agency for Dollars 55.5m WPP, the heavily-indebted marketing services group, announced yesterday that it had agreed the sale for Dollars 55.5m (Pounds 36.70m) of its 80 per cent stake in Scali, McCabe, Sloves, the New York-based advertising agency group. The sale is to The Lowe Group, a subsidiary of Interpublic, the US marketing group. The deal, which had been expected for some time, excludes Scali's operations in Brazil, the Netherlands and Germany. It also excludes Fallon McElligott, the US agency, for which WPP obtained Dollars 14.6m following a management buy-out last month, and some New York property interests. As part of the latest sale, a total of Dollars 34.9m will be paid in cash to WPP and a further Dollars 8m will be phased in payments over two years. Assumption of liabilities will total Dollars 12.6m. In the half year to June 30 WPP's average net debt was Pounds 372m. As well as the sale of its 64 per cent interest in Fallon in October, WPP recently sold Seiniger Advertising, the Los Angeles-based producer of marketing campaigns for films, for Dollars 6.9m. No further divestment is expected in the immediate future; longer term, WPP has said it is considering the flotation of the group's market research activities and operations in south-east Asia. Scali was acquired by WPP in 1989 as part of the Ogilvy group and from that time it has been known that the agency was for sale. The part of the operation that comes under the current deal had billings of more than Dollars 550m in 1992, generated revenues of Dollars 73m and recorded a net pre-tax loss of Dollars 2.8m. Analysts had expected the sale of Scali to raise between Dollars 50m and Dollars 70m. Given that WPP had already sold its interest in Fallon, which was 80 per cent owned by Scali, for Dollars 14.6m, the total sale price is seen as being at the top end of the scale. The Lowe Group said that the acquisition would more than double the size of its North American operation. Mr Marvin Sloves, currently Scali chairman, will join the Lowe Group board as vice chairman.</p>

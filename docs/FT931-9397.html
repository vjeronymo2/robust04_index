			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / Arts: Where Angels fear to tread - Antony Thorncroft looks at the state of West End theatre ON MARCH 25, at the HQ of the Society of West End Theatre in Covent Garden, a training seminar will be held. The aim is to initiate aspiring impresarios into the arcane mystery of the theatrical producer. It may seem odd that men and women should need instruction on how to lose others people's money, but the West End is desperate for more producers, and if the seminar can unearth another Cameron Mackintosh, or even a Duncan Weldon, it will have paid for itself a million times over. On the surface the West End is weathering the recession rather well. Audiences last year just about equalled the 10.9m achieved in 1991, the second highest total on record. But many of these theatre goers will have been occupying a discounted seat and the last six months have seen audiences slip. Spurred on by falling receipts the entire West End brotherhood - theatre owners, producers, even actors - is drawing together in an unprecedented show of co-operation, with the objective of conjuring up the perfect scenario: well financed producers with a good supply of new plays queueing up to rent theatres. Change is inevitable because traditional Angels are becoming extinct. The flow of individuals prepared to fritter away Pounds 1,000 or more on a stake in a show which nine times out of ten will fail financially, has all but dried up. The problems of Lloyds of London, coupled with a rise in production costs which makes a straight play a Pounds 250,000 bet and a musical anything up to a Pounds 3m gamble, have scattered even the most stage struck theatrical backers. New sources of finance are being explored, notably American, Japanese and even City syndicates, but the West End now relies for its precarious living on plays and musicals which started out in the subsidised theatre, or on limited runs of revivals built around star names by Duncan Weldon or Peter Hall. New producers, tapping new sources of funding and, ideally, new writers, would be most welcome. In the meantime the theatre owners, reluctant to see their properties lying dark, are doing their bit to develop product. Stoll-Moss, which owns 11 theatres, has just recruited Nica Burns, best known as a comedy impresario, to seek out new plays for its smaller, 400-seater plus, theatres, which are the accountants' nightmare. Stoll-Moss might even commission new works: it already takes a small stake in many of the productions renting its theatres. This involvement by theatre owners parallels a trend by the more successful producers to acquire theatres. Andrew Lloyd Webber's Really Useful company has just spent around Pounds 3m acquiring a half share of the Adelphi Theatre, which will present his new musical Sunset Boulevard. He already owns the Palace and the New London. Cameron Mackintosh has joined forces with Lord Delfont and now owns the Prince Edward, the Prince of Wales, and the Strand. Michael Codron owns the Vaudeville and manages the Adelphi, and Eddie Kulukundus is a co-owner of the Duke of York's and the Ambassadors. We are returning to the post-War era when moguls like Prince Littler and Bernard Delfont put on shows in their own theatres. The arrival of the new theatre owners, especially when they are multi-millionaires like Mackintosh and Lloyd Webber, has brought a much needed infusion of cash into the West End. Inspired by the thought that he will not be paying rent at the Adelphi, Lloyd Webber has embarked on a Pounds 3m refurbishment of the theatre, while Mackintosh has insisted on a Pounds 3m revamp of the Prince Edward, returning it to its 1930s glory and hoping to attract the major musicals which are the gold spinners of the West End: the Broadway hit Crazy for You starts previews there next week. And Stoll-Moss will be investing Pounds 3m on improvements across its theatre chain this year. George Biggs, director of Maybox, which owns seven West End theatres, has no plans to become a producer, but is happy to join in the current blurring of responsibilities. Maybox underwrote the losses at its revamped Donmar Theatre until producer Sam Mendes could find alternative backing for the small venue, which can never survive on ticket sales alone. Like Stoll-Moss, Maybox will increasingly carry plays for a few weeks if they fail to reach the agreed box office revenue. This is good business sense. If there is no new play waiting in the wings, the current production, even if playing well below capacity, brings in some income through bar and snack sales. Left dark it could cost Pounds 12,000 a week to maintain. With virtually all the theatre buildings in the West End now architecturally 'listed' they are safe from commercial predators, and only one is on the market, the Royalty, owned by Stoll-Moss. It is on the wrong side of the tracks, but the success of Cats at the equally remote New London supports the view that there is no such thing as a bad theatre, only a bad show. There have been three offers for the Royalty; none from existing theatre owners. Anyone becoming a West End theatre owner will join a closely knit community co-operating to survive. It beggars belief that central London can support fifty theatres, but despite the prophets of doom, who include Duncan Weldon, the vast revenues from the successes - around Pounds 350,000 a week from Miss Saigon - will continue to weave their spell. The number of theatres is actually destined to grow this year. The Criterion has just re opened and the Savoy soon starts up again. There is also a growing interest in the Lyceum, which was one of the finest theatres in the West End. It has been a wreck for years and its current owner, the financially embarrassed Brent Walker, has let it decline into total disrepair. The cost of refurbishing it, estimated at around Pounds 15m, deters potential buyers, but, in another example of how far the barriers between producer and theatre owner, between the subsidised and the commercial theatre, between the Arts Council and the West End, have broken down, there is now serious discussion of an ambitious, indeed dramatic, solution. Like much else in the arts it involves Millennium money, gathered in through the Lottery. The government would use it to pay for the renovation of the Lyceum. This could then become London's dance theatre (and perhaps the home of the English National Ballet). Alternatively, Stoll-Moss would rent out the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, to fit this role: it would be ideal for the Royal Ballet which will be homeless in 1997 when Covent Garden closes for restoration. As compensation Stoll-Moss would take on the Lyceum as a home for musicals. The will is there for mutual co-operation; all that is missing is the money.</p>

			<p><P> June 21, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WOMAN GETS PROBATION FOR MAKING TORTURE FILMS  </P> <P> A Hesperia woman who produced and distributed films in which she tortured her  husband pleaded guilty Tuesday in Los Angeles Municipal Court to five  misdemeanor obscenity counts.  </P> <P> Such plea bargains are unusual in pornography cases, in which attorneys often  cite First Amendment rights of free expression, but "the nature and subject  matter of the films make it extremely difficult to defend," said Stuart  Goldfarb, lawyer for Anita (Mistress Anne) Murray.  </P> <P> "These films were not simulated," Goldfarb said.  </P> <P> Judge Carol Boas Goodson gave Murray, 45, a suspended sentence of one year in  Los Angeles County Jail and placed her on five years' probation on condition  that she get out of the adult film industry and donate $10,000 to the Los  Angeles Police Department's DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program,  "helping to erase, rather than add to, some of the ugliness in our society."  </P> <P> Murray sold her hourlong films for $100 apiece through the mail, said Deputy  City Atty. Michael Guarino, acting as a special assistant to the U.S. attorney.  </P> <P> Search warrants have been served on two New York companies that allegedly also  distributed Murray's movies and federal charges against the firms are being  considered, Guarino said. The search warrants are sealed because the  investigation has not been completed.  </P> <P> Most of the movies feature Murray, who stands 6 feet tall and weighs 170  pounds, inflicting punishment by various methods, some scatological, upon her  5-foot-9, 160-pound husband, Richard Henry Lichy, 51, Guarino said.  </P> <P> Los Angeles police saw Murray's catalogue, which was available at a local  newsstand, and ordered five films with such titles as "The Bizarre Debut of  Mistress Anne Murray" and "Leather Domina."  </P> <P> When a search warrant was served at Murray's home in the San Bernardino County  desert in January, authorities found the couple, in matching negligees, baking  a cake, Guarino said.  </P> <P> Murray's income from the film business was about $50,000 a year, Guarino said,  though she sold her master tapes to other companies, which allegedly made much  more. The movies were sold in New York, the District of Columbia and Oklahoma,  as well as in California, Guarino said.  </P> <P> The couple sat quietly in the courtroom Tuesday. The defendant offered brief  responses to the judge's questions and told a reporter, "I have nothing to say  to you."  </P></p>

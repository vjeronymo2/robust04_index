			<p><P> November 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROBLEMS MAY LEAD TO CUTS IN COLLIDER PROJECT  </P> <P> Plans for the superconducting super collider are likely to be scaled back  because of technical problems that may cause its costs to jump by up to 30%, or  nearly $2 billion, U.S. officials and independent scientists say.  </P> <P> The technical troubles recently caused the scientific managers of the  controversial project -- which is aimed at expanding knowledge about the basic  nature of matter without any hope of immediate practical application -- to  propose extensive design modifications.  </P> <P> But angry Energy Department officials have responded that the program is  unlikely to win a substantial increase in its promised $5.9-billion budget and  should instead be "built to cost," the sources said last week.  </P> <P> Several officials, who asked not to be identified, said that this preliminary  decision by the Energy Department probably will require cuts in the power and  size of the collider -- modifications that may, in turn, raise new questions  about the project's technical merit, jeopardizing its political future and  thousands of associated jobs.  </P> <P> Congress recently approved a $225-million down payment on the collider's  construction over an eight-year period at Waxahachie, Tex.  </P> <P> Beams of protons are to be accelerated in a 53-mile tunnel and crashed together  so scientists can examine the interaction of subatomic particles and test  theories about the building blocks of matter and the origin of the universe.  </P> <P> Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said in an interview that project  managers were told that "either we're going to build it for the figure of 5.9  (billion dollars) or we're not going to build it at all."  </P> <P> Moore said that "we know we can't get the additional money in these times of  tight money, and we simply can't go back to the Congress six months after  promising it would be one amount and tell them it's going to be something  else."  </P> <P> Moore said he is uncertain about whether the collider plans will be scaled  back, because some of the proposed changes associated with added costs may have  been gold plating.  </P> <P> But the scientists involved say that many of the changes were needed just to  meet -- not exceed -- the original specifications, and "building to cost" will  doubtless require some technical sacrifices.  </P> <P> Roy Schwitters, director of the Dallas laboratory created to supervise the  collider's construction, said his proposed changes were "not due to flaws in  the previous (design) work, but to advances in the state-of-the-art technology"  that scientists would like to see incorporated in the collider.  </P></p>

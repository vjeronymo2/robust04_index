			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / International Company News: Interbrew invests in Zagreb brewer Interbrew, the Belgian brewer that produces Stella Artois, is to buy 23.78 per cent of Zagrebacka Pivovara, Croatia's biggest brewery. The Zagreb-based operation stands to benefit from Interbrew's plans for significant technical and commercial investments. According to the Belgian company, these will amount to the biggest foreign investment in Croatia. Zagrebacka-Pivovara, a low fermentation brewery which produces six different types of beer, holds 28 per cent of the Croatian market. The Interbrew offer, which valued the brewery at about DM82m (Dollars 48.2m), beat four rival bidders including Brau of Austria, and Castel of France. Mr Hans Meerloo, president of the Belgian group's executive committee, said that the move was in line with the company's strategy to develop in eastern and central Europe. The shares sold to Interbrew are owned by the Croatian Privatisation Fund and two Croatian pension funds. The brewery was privatised in April last year and most of the shares are owned by its employees.</p>

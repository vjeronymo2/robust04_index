			<p>940926 FT  26 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Setting a sensible nuclear agenda Sir, Following your excellent coverage of the nuclear Non- Proliferation Treaty PrepComm in Geneva ('Opposition to nuclear treaty grows', September 16), I was surprised that the FT failed to highlight the significance of the Liberal Democrats' conference decision to support a limited extension of the NPT. By calling for the NPT to be extended initially for a limited period, and for further extensions of the treaty to be linked to progress on a worldwide convention to eliminate all nuclear weapons, the Liberal Democrats have taken on a commonsense agenda for practical measures to break the nuclear deadlock. Menzies Campbell, Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesperson, made clear that the reasoning behind the policy is 'to maintain the pressure on the nuclear weapon holding powers to meet their obligations under Article VI of the NPT'. The NPT has been accused of discrimination and Israel, Pakistan, India and Ukraine will not sign. Extending it indefinitely, as the government and Labour party advocate, may mean that the present creeping proliferation becomes irreversible. A new global treaty could be universally respected and ratified. CND looks forward to the Labour and Conservative parties supporting such a positive move.

			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSUMERS;  </P> <P> NEW RETAIL TACTICS MAKE EVERY DAY A SALE -- SOMEWHERE  </P> <P> Smart shoppers don't buy big-ticket items like new wardrobes, refrigerators or  cars when the mood strikes. They track the sales in their area on a monthly  basis, waiting until they know a particular item will be offered for less by  department stores, specialty shops, discount houses or manufacturers.  </P> <P> Next month, for example, is the traditional time for finding bargains on coats,  hosiery and rugs. But, because of the proliferation in the last few years of  retailers' one-day sales, you also may be able to spot a September or October  sale on tires (usually in May), baby products (January and May), or diamonds  (January).  </P> <P> </P> <P> One-Day Sales Lose Favor  </P> <P> In the 1980s the one-day sale has become a popular merchandising tool, but  there are signs that retailers will be cutting back on these sale days and  offering lower prices in general. "There's a plethora of sales compared to 20  years ago, with many more of the one-day sales," said Bill Dombrowski, vice  president of corporate affairs for Carter, Hawley, Hale Inc., parent company of  the Broadway. "We also tie the one-days into traditional themes, so that a  one-day will be a white sale in January." But, he added, "The fact is, our sale  days have been less this year than last and the long-term strategy is to become  less reliant on the one-day sale."  </P> <P> Expensive cosmetics (such as Chanel or Lancome) are rarely on sale in  department or specialty stores, but cheaper ones can be found at a discount  usually in late January. Department stores often have promotional give-aways of  cosmetic products -- with the purchase of a high-priced perfume or other  cosmetics -- near Valentine's Day, Mother's Day or before Christmas.  </P> <P> It is hard to get a handle on coming sale trends -- one-day sales, product  giveaways, lower everyday prices -- of most other merchandise because the  fiercely competitive retailers guard their plans like gold at Ft. Knox.  </P> <P> "This is the most competitive business in the country," admitted Dombrowski.  "We're in competition with other department stores, specialty stores, T-shirt  stands on the corner."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Traditional Sales  </P> <P> Many stores, however, do have sales on specific items at the same time, year  after year, so consumers can anticipate good buys by keeping a calendar of the  recurring events. In addition, storewide clearances on most all items are  offered after Christmas, Easter and the Fourth of July.  </P> <P> Most industry analysts insist that the traditional sales months are honored by  the majority of retailers, whether they offer a month-long sale or several  short sales during a particular month. (See accompanying chart.)  </P> <P> "There's still a tremendous bunch of traditional sales," said Tomi Block of the  National Retail Merchants Assn. in New York, the major trade organization of  the general merchandise retail industry, which counts 45,000 member stores in  the United States and 1,000 retail stores in 56 other countries.  </P> <P> "Most stores have started cutting down on the one-day sales," Block said.  "There are the normal holiday sales, back-to-school, but fewer last-minute  sales. Last year, there was a sale every minute, but their (store) inventories  are a little bit leaner this year, so there aren't as many."  </P> <P> Even though there were fewer sales this year nationwide, total retail sales,  excluding automobiles, were 7.2% ahead of a year ago, as of August tallies by  the trade group.  </P> <P> Sears has taken another tack, and won't have as many specialty sales in its  nationwide stores since the company decided on March 1 "to focus on everyday  low pricing" of items.  </P> <P> "We're making prices more competitive on a daily basis so people will shop more  often and not have to wait for sales," said Mary Jean Houde, a Sears  representative in Chicago. "Consumer research indicated that most people would  prefer not waiting for sales and have the lowest possible prices offered  everyday."  </P> <P> Sears also has instituted a "price pledge" to consumers, promising to meet or  beat any other price, selling an item for the same price or less than the  competition.  </P> <P> In the car market, not only are some dealers making price pledges similar to  Sears, they're offering unbelievable rebates on their 1989 models, anywhere  from $500 to $2,500. If there's a factory rebate included, you might be able to  get as much as $4,000 off on certain models. (Dealers are offering rebates of  up to $4,000 on Sterlings and $3,700 on Buick Centurys.)  </P> <P> "We're making junkies out of consumers," said Dan White, manager of the  Southern California Chrysler Plymouth Dealers Assn. "It's probably more  confusing (to consumers) than ever. It's not like the old days anymore, when  you had the traditional cleanup period. Cleanup time was July, August and  September so dealers could get the '89s off the lot."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Breaks Direct to Consumer  </P> <P> Manufacturers used to offer dealers a 5% carryover allowance on current models  when the next year's line came out. The dealer could pass on the savings to the  consumer if he wished. But manufacturers have discontinued that practice,  preferring instead to give rebates directly to the consumer. Today, although  they still have 1989 models available, some dealers are already offering  rebates on 1990 models.  </P> <P> Some auto manufacturers also bring out new car lines in midyear now instead of  on the traditional Oct. 1 date, so consumers can frequently get new car deals  on those brands in June instead of September, White pointed out.  </P> <P> "The traditional clearance time is gone forever," observed Mickey Garrett,  executive vice president of the Greater Los Angeles Motorcar Dealers Assn.  "Incentives and rebates are here to stay in the auto manufacturing business. .  . . It's a consumer-driven market and it looks like it will be for many, many  months. There are more cars being introduced everyday and the industry is  overproducing. There's a tremendous amount of inventory."  </P> <P> Garrett said he would advise consumers to do a considerable amount of price  shopping if they are in the market for a new car.  </P> <P> "People just have to look for the rebates," he explained. "If they hold off  (buying a 1989 edition now) they'll see rebates on the new 1990 ones. Toyota,  Nissan, Chrysler and Chevrolet are already offering them on some models.  Consumers can get good deals now, but if they hold off 'til towards the end of  July, 1990, they'll get even better ones."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BEST BUYS BY THE MONTH  </P> <P> JAN.: Sheets, towels, linens, coat clearances, furs, baby products, diamonds,  cosmetics, lingerie, luggage, drugs, TVs and radios. Good time to do shopping  for next Christmas.  </P> <P> FEB.: Furniture, fabrics, hosiery, carpet, furs.  </P> <P> MARCH: China, glassware, dishes, silver, washing machines and dryers.  </P> <P> APRIL: Air conditioners, diamonds, sleepwear and lingerie, kitchen ranges,  paint and wallpaper.  </P> <P> MAY: Linens, sheets, blankets, towels, baby needs, home furnishings,  housewares, luggage, tires/auto accessories.  </P> <P> JUNE: Furniture, sleepwear and lingerie.  </P> <P> JULY: Swim suits, refrigerators/freezers, garden supplies, shoes/sandals,  automobiles (traditional cleanup sales through September).  </P> <P> AUG.: Household linens, garden furniture, accessories, furs, back to school  clothing/shoes.  </P> <P> SEPT.: Housewares and home furnishings, cars.  </P> <P> OCT.: Coats, hosiery, rugs.  </P> <P> NOV.: Wines and liquors, coats, furs, furniture.  </P> <P> DEC.: Men's coats and suits, women's dressy dreses, cameras, post-Christmas  sales, including cards, wrapping paper and ribbon.  </P> <P> Sources: National Retail Merchants Assn. and other trade associations.  </P></p>

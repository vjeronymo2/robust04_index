			<p><P> July 10, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 20 YEARS LATER, SOME FOLLOWERS OF GURU STILL KEEP THE FAITH  </P> <P> Norman Paulsen has shown a remarkable ability during his 20-year career as a  guru to preach asceticism and live in comfort.  </P> <P> While most of his followers live in Utah and work long hours for low pay in one  of the commune's small businesses, Paulsen lives in a waterfront Oxnard  condominium a short walk from the group's 78-foot schooner, where he can sail  every day and ponder cosmic issues without distraction.  </P> <P> Paulsen has also persuaded his followers that he must be free from the  constraints of daily labor, so members help support him, some tithing their  income.  </P> <P> While many former members of his Brotherhood of the Sun commune -- once based  in Santa Barbara -- claimed in a lawsuit that they were hornswoggled by  Paulsen, his current followers draw from a seemingly limitless reservoir of  faith in Paulsen's claims of knowing the secret to the "tunnel to eternity" and  "cosmic consciousness."  </P> <P> At one time the Brotherhood owned a 3,000-acre ranch in Santa Barbara and was  one of the nation's most prosperous communes. Commune members called their  businesses Sunburst Farms, and they were the largest shippers of organic  produce in the country.  </P> <P> But by the late 1970s, the commune, beset by controversy and problems, began to  collapse. Some members were frightened by Paulsen's decision to stockpile  weapons and conduct military training drills at the commune. Others were  disillusioned when Paulsen, who preached abstinence, became addicted to drugs.  </P> <P> Hundreds defected; some sued. By 1980, the Brotherhood could no longer make the  payments on its ranch and lost the property.  </P> <P> Despite the tribulations and a move from California, the Brotherhood has  survived. There are about 35 members still with the group, the last of the true  believers, men and women approaching middle age who joined almost 20 years ago  and have persevered, working in the commune's small businesses in Utah and  Nevada.  </P> <P> "All religions have been started by someone who has had a breakthrough in  cosmic awareness," said Jonathan King, 39, a portly, gray-haired man who bears  little resemblance to the ethereal seekers once associated with the group. "Men  like Jesus and Mohammed had that breakthrough. And so has Norm. He still has a  lot to teach us."  </P> <P> In 1963, Norman Paulsen's visions landed him in the psychiatric ward of Santa  Barbara County Hospital. A few years later, his visions made him a guru.  </P> <P> The man and the era had met.  </P> <P> Paulsen was working as a bricklayer in Santa Barbara in the early 1960s when he  says he passed out after taking a few sleeping pills before retiring for the  evening. At the hospital, while surgeons performed a tracheotomy, Paulsen said  he had a "near-death" experience. He later told followers that he watched his  body float above the room, saw three "ethereal men in robes" hovering about and  was confronted with a "swirling vortex of light . . . the tunnel to eternity."  </P> <P> The doctors "thought I was wacko," Paulsen says now, and he awoke in leather  restraints in the psychiatric ward. He was transferred to Camarillo State  Hospital for psychiatric observation and released after 90 days.  </P> <P> In the years afterward, he began talking about this experience and others. But  this time, instead of staring into the arms of a straitjacket he found a  receptive audience of young seekers open to bizarre ideas, mystical experiences  and Eastern religion.  </P> <P> Melanie Arcudi was 19 years old, had just moved to Santa Barbara from the East  Coast and wanted to learn how to meditate. She heard that Paulsen was leading  meditation sessions at his home, a converted ice cream warehouse in downtown  Santa Barbara. Arcudi, like many of the hippies, surfers and students who  gathered at Paulsen's house in the late 1960s, was seeking a direction in life.  </P> <P> "A lot of people were coming out of the turmoil of the 1960s," Arcudi said.  "Many of us came from broken homes and were searching for the security we never  had in our own families. At that time, Norm was a very strong father figure for  all of us."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Spiritual Seeker  </P> <P> Paulsen commanded respect, Arcudi said, because he was older than the others  (40 when he started the group); bigger (6-foot-4 and 275 pounds), and had  greater experience as a spiritual seeker. He had been a disciple for a few  years in the Los Angeles ashram of an Indian guru. Paulsen learned a meditation  technique from the guru, Arcudi said, and enough Eastern religion to sound  authoritative to a group of American teen-agers.  </P> <P> Arcudi, Paulsen and a few of the regular meditators decided they wanted to live  communally, grow their own food and form their own alternative society. They  purchased 160 acres in the Santa Barbara mountains, using as a down payment,  Paulsen said in an interview, a $6,000 worker's compensation settlement he had  received. But Arcudi says her mother contributed $50,000 toward the down  payment.  </P> <P> The early years, Arcudi said, were a glorious time.  </P> <P> "For a while, it was like Camelot," said Arcudi, who left the group in 1979 and  now works as an acupuncturist in Santa Barbara. "We were successful in  everything we tried. We'd open a store and it would succeed so we'd open  another one. We lived on a beautiful piece of land. More and more people were  joining. It was a very exciting time."  </P> <P> In 1976, the group purchased a spectacular 3,000-acre ranch, adjacent to  spreads owned by Ronald Reagan and John Travolta, and turned it into the  largest organic farm in the country. The commune eventually owned four markets  in the Santa Barbara area, two restaurants, a bakery and had more than 300  members.  </P> <P> But as they expanded, Arcudi said, Paulsen changed. Eventually, she asserted,  he came to represent everything the Brotherhood opposed.  </P> <P> Although no alcohol, drugs or even cigarettes were permitted on the group's  property, it was well known in the late 1970s, former members said, that  Paulsen had a serious drinking and drug problem.  </P> <P> Paulsen's addiction was cited numerous times in a lawsuit filed in 1981 by  about 100 former members who sought a portion of the commune's assets. (They  eventually dropped the suit.) According to the lawsuit, Paulsen was the subject  of a Drug Enforcement Agency investigation in 1982 and acknowledged to DEA  agents that he spent $60,000 on narcotics.  </P> <P> But former members who were involved in handling the group's finances say  Paulsen spent more than $200,000 of community funds during the late 1970s and  early 1980s. They say he injected Demerol, Dilaudid, cocaine and other drugs  obtained fraudulently from doctors or purchased on the street.  </P> <P> Paulsen discussed his drug problems during a recent interview, which took weeks  to arrange because he would only meet on the day when his astrological  alignment appeared most propitious. "I was trying to catch a moon that was  decent," he explained."  </P> <P> Although his rhetoric may sound antiquated, Paulsen has a deep, mellifluous  voice and a lyrical manner of speech. When he leans back in a chair in the  living room of his wood-paneled condominium, clasps his hands over his great  stomach and stares into the distance with heavy-lidded, liquid brown eyes, he  resembles Buddha in repose.  </P> <P> Paulsen acknowledged that he had been addicted to drugs, but said he has been  completely clean for years. His addictions, he said, stemmed from medication  prescribed by doctors for migraines and a back injury.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Same Explanation  </P> <P> Paulsen still clings to the same explanation he gave his followers a decade ago  when it was discovered that he had drug and alcohol problems.  </P> <P> He blamed them.  </P> <P> By counseling troubled members at the commune, Paulsen claims, he absorbed all  their "bad karma."  </P> <P> "You can't sit down and talk to someone without exchanging energy with them,"  Paulsen said earnestly. "If that person has negative thoughts, that leaves a  residue of negative energy on the one who's trying to help. All that took its  toll on me."  </P> <P> The current followers in Utah and Nevada have accepted his curious explanation,  and they now compare Paulsen's plight with the travails endured by Jesus.  Because both Jesus and Paulsen gave too much to others and absorbed all their  bad karma, they say, both men had to suffer.  </P> <P> Jesus died on the cross. Paulsen abused drugs.  </P> <P> Michael Ableman was working on a farm in British Columbia in the mid-1970s when  friends told him about the Brotherhood. He was tired of the Northwest's gloomy  weather and was "longing for more of an extended family," so he and a friend  hitchhiked to Santa Barbara and joined the group.  </P> <P> Ableman began managing the apple and pear orchards and enjoyed living  communally and having the opportunity to learn about organic farming. But soon  he began having doubts about the Brotherhood.  </P> <P> Ableman recalls working 12 hours a day and struggling for funds to keep the  orchard going, while Paulsen siphoned off money for drugs and drove a Lincoln  Continental. Other members recall how Paulsen spent extravagantly on quarter  horses, silver saddles and sailboats.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Houses, Fancy Cars'  </P> <P> "I was sleeping on a wooden pallet in a sleeping bag while Paulsen and some of  the leaders who didn't seem to do any work had houses and fancy cars," Ableman  said. "A small clique began making all the decisions."  </P> <P> While Paulsen initially espoused nonviolence, he grew increasingly paranoid  through the 1970s. The group stockpiled thousands of rounds of ammunition and  dozens of weapons, including Belgian assault rifles and M-14 military rifles.  Under Paulsen's direction, a former Green Beret who lived at the commune began  training members in military tactics in preparation for the collapse of  society.  </P> <P> One night, after Paulsen was stopped by a sheriff's deputy for drunk driving, a  group of male members gathered at the ranch office and brought out the guns,  recalled former member George Sessions.  </P> <P> "Norm started yelling: 'Let's shoot up the Sheriff's Department,' " Sessions  said. "It was close enough to Jonestown that some of us were pretty scared.  Energy was running very high, and I don't know what could have happened. Norm  finally stopped yelling because he was pretty drunk and fortunately, things  fizzled out."  </P> <P> Although several other former members agreed with Sessions' account, Paulsen  rolled his eyes when asked about the incident and muttered, "That's a joke, an  absolute joke." He declined to comment further.  </P> <P> During the late 1970s, as Paulsen grew increasingly incapacitated by substance  abuse, a handful of the commune's leaders stepped in to perpetuate the  oligarchy, former members said. They drove luxury cars, lived in better housing  than other members and made all the business decisions.  </P> <P> By 1980, dozens of members had been purged from the ranks and others left in  anger. Ableman recalls the day he was exiled.  </P> <P> "Norm was sitting in his house, in a very dark room, with his shirt off, and he  was quite drunk," Ableman said. "He said to me: 'I am the man they call Jesus  of Nazareth. If you believe me you can stay. If not, get out.' I was told to be  out of there by the next day."  </P> <P> For many, their departure was traumatic. Some had lived in the commune for  almost a decade, had worked 12-hour days building the businesses and had given  every thing they owned to the group.  </P> <P> "It was worse than a divorce," said Ableman, 34, who now manages an organic  farm in Goleta. "If you leave a marriage you still have friends, neighbors and  community. But when we were forced out we had to leave our entire world  behind."  </P> <P> After the first wave of defections, many of the commune's businesses, which had  benefited from an abundance of free labor, could not survive, said Donna  Belton, a former head bookkeeper for the Brotherhood. By 1980, the commune was  unable to make payments on the ranch and had to sell it. Paulsen eventually  discovered a 500,000-acre cattle ranch in eastern Nevada that he was able to  purchase with a small down payment.  </P> <P> Those who stayed with the community and made the move to Nevada were faced with  great hardship, Belton said. The winters were brutal, the cattle they had  purchased were sick and the growing season was so short that they could not  raise enough crops to sustain themselves.  </P> <P> Many returned to California. The remaining members struggled to keep the ranch,  but, eventually, lost most of the property. On the remaining acres, they  created a roadside gas station, a mini-market and a coffee shop. But these  small businesses could support only a handful of members, so the others moved  to the Salt Lake City area and opened two health food markets and, later, a  demolition business.  </P> <P> Paulsen's drug abuse worsened during this period and the group paid for his  stay at treatment programs in Salt Lake City and Las Vegas, Belton said.  Paulsen ended up staying in Las Vegas for several years, until he moved back to  California eight months ago.  </P> <P> While the current members in Utah and Nevada seem like anachronisms, still  following a guru and spouting cliches from the 1960s, the group, in many ways,  has adapted to the 1980s.  </P> <P> Many have families and live in the suburbs. They have their own apartments in a  slightly ramshackle four-story apartment house near Salt Lake City with  barbecues on the patios and children's bicycles chained to the stairwells.  </P> <P> The men who run the commune's businesses no longer have the luxury of devoting  all their energy to meditation and the search for higher consciousness. The  exigencies of meeting a payroll and turning a profit take up much of their time  now.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Formal Board Meetings  </P> <P> Jonathan King, general manager of the group's businesses in Salt Lake City,  attends business seminars titled "How to Collect Accounts Receivable More  Effectively," holds formal board meetings and plans to institute a  performance-appraisal system for employees at the health food stores.  </P> <P> Recently King, Paulsen and a few others in the group advocated abandoning the  central element of the Aquarius Age commune -- the sharing of resources -- in  favor of the prevailing ethos of the 1980s: the bottom line. So temporarily,  until the group's next move, all members receive a salary and manage their own  finances.  </P> <P> "When you're single and 23 years old, it's easy to get by," King said. "But if  you're 40 and have three kids and can't afford a winter coat for them, you're  going to be less inclined to share what you eat with others."  </P> <P> Although members no longer pool their resources, their life style still is  communal in many ways: Members in Nevada live in the same trailer park, and  those in Salt Lake City live in the group-owned apartment building; they still  gather every day in one of the designated "meditation rooms"; most work for one  of the group's businesses, and they all share the belief that Paulsen is their  spiritual leader, a man who has met with God.  </P> <P> While King has the mien and manner of the sober businessman, he is transformed  when he discusses Paulsen. Eyes shining and smiling beatifically, King quoted  Paulsen 11 times during a recent two-hour interview and described him as "a  conduit hooked up to The Light . . . an instrument of divine will."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Long, Rambling Story  </P> <P> When asked for evidence of Paulsen's cosmic powers, King launched into a long,  rambling story of how he had a headache one day, had two aspirin in his hand  and was just about to take them when Paulsen walked into the room. Suddenly,  King said, in the fervored tones of a television evangelist, he felt a  "transfer of energy coming from Norm right into my eyeballs." King fixed his  visitor with a steady gaze and snapped his fingers. The headache, he said,  simply disappeared.  </P> <P> Craig Hansen, 40, joined the commune in his early 20s after dropping out of  college. Today Hansen, a gaunt, balding man, works the night shift in the  group's road-stop coffee shop, is paid $600 a month and sends Paulsen a $60  check every month.  </P> <P> Although Hansen and the other followers operate and manage the group's  businesses, Paulsen's son, who lives in Oregon and never was an official member  of the commune, is listed as president and head of the Board of Directors of  all the group's businesses, according to records filed with the Utah secretary  of state.  </P> <P> Hansen said he has no interest in financial matters and he trusts Paulsen  implicitly. He supported Paulsen's decision to rename the group the Builders,  even though their primary business is a demolition company.  </P> <P> Hansen and other followers say they are now waiting for Paulsen to find a plot  of land in the desert where he can begin another commune, a model New Age  community that they are convinced will spawn others just like it, until the  satellite communities will give the Builders a membership and prominence far  greater than the Brotherhood had in its glory days.  </P> <P> Paulsen's stay in California is only temporary, he said, and he will rejoin his  followers when the group makes their move -- probably to rural Arizona --  within the next few years. There, he said, members will grow their own food and  build a "full-spectrum healing center" and meditation retreat.  </P> <P> "I envision a place where all those who were once with us, and new ones as  well, will gather and teach and learn . . . a place for those who are getting  up in years to retire to."  </P></p>

			<p><P> April 16, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UNTANGLING ALLIANCES;  </P> <P> TOWARD AN UNDIVIDED EUROPE  </P> <P> Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in a conversation with reporters, put  forth two approaches to East-West rela tions in Europe: The first encourages  the Soviet Union to reduce progressively its political domination over Eastern  Europe in return for negotiated assurances that the Atlantic Alliance would not  move militarily beyond current dividing lines; the second deems negotiations  unnecessary because the Soviet empire in Europe -- and perhaps the Soviet Union  itself -- is disintegrating on its own. Baker, while expressing sympathy for  the negotiated approach, seemed to imply that he could pursue both options in  sequence with diplomacy needed only "if you had anarchy and a reaction by the  Soviets. "  </P> <P> Matters might have rested on this essentially theoretical level had not the  Baker remark evoked a flood of comments on both sides of the Atlantic, ranging  from denunciation of any such negotiation as a second Yalta to arguments that  Europeans, not Americans, should be the principal negotiators. I became  involved in the debate because Baker at first seemed to endorse a fragmentary  summary of a private conversation, a distorted version of which was then  "rejected" by an unnamed Administration spokesman -- although it is far from  clear precisely for whom this person spoke.  </P> <P> It goes without saying that the goal of U.S. policy should be the reversal of  Yalta, not the revival of Yalta. The opportunity for this exists because of the  increasing disillusionment of Eastern Europe, the policy of glasnost that makes  it possible to articulate this unrest and perhaps a growing Soviet recognition  that policing hostile populations drains resources from the imperatives of  perestroika.  </P> <P> But it is not possible to ease the Soviet Union out of Eastern Europe without  Moscow noticing; therefore the undoing of Yalta will surely be complex. The  strategy should be to enable the countries of Eastern Europe to associate  themselves -- on a case-by-case basis -- with the European Community while the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact continue at reduced  levels in Central Europe. Existing forums could conduct the negotiations: The  European Community would design the framework for its association with the  countries of Eastern Europe; the Vienna talks on conventional arms control  would provide a security framework for that process.  </P> <P> Precisely because such an evolution requires difficult -- and, for the Soviet  Union, painful -- adjustments, its direction must be understood by all key  players. A confidential dialogue between Washington and Moscow will therefore  be not only unavoidable but desirable. Its purpose should be conceptual: to  clarify the goals and methodologies of the process of unifying Europe. The  European Community would participate as an integral partner.  </P> <P> To be sure, if the Soviet Empire in Eastern Europe is disintegrating, diplomacy  might be unnecessary. On the other hand, once there is anarchy and the tanks  roll, it is too late for diplomacy.  </P> <P> In reality the policy of watchful waiting for the disintegration of Eastern  Europe is a paper option: Western unity is unlikely to survive the process of  coasting. Ironically, each of the alliances may be counting on the  disintegration of the other. If both turn out to be wrong, there will be  stagnation. If both turn out to be right, there will be chaos. If we are not  careful, regional conflicts may be settled while the focal point of crises  returns to Europe.  </P> <P> The Kremlin's reliance on centrifugal tendencies in the West can be found in  many pronouncements to the effect that Western unity will evaporate once the  image of a common enemy has been removed. In that view the withdrawal of U.S.  strategic forces from the continent of Europe under the Intermediate Nuclear  Force agreement will weaken the link between the nuclear defense of Europe and  America. As negotiations under the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks reduce  overall numbers, recourse to strategic nuclear weapons based in America or at  sea will seem less reliable or legitimate.  </P> <P> The probable trend of conventional arms-control negotiations could accelerate  the erosion of Western cohesion. The effort of elaborating an appropriate  balance to offset Soviet proximity, central geographic location and mobilizable  reserves and of inspecting for violations in the vast spaces of the Soviet  Union will surely be divisive. More important, the process cannot go far  without leading to a removal of some U.S. troops, a redeployment that will  probably accelerate with the passage of time.  </P> <P> The presence of American troops has become so much a fixture in European minds  that even their partial withdrawal will have a seriously adverse psychological  impact. Europeans -- especially Germans -- may complain about low-level flights  and other irritations. But a different reaction is likely to develop when it  sinks in that the remaining NATO forces will be stretched so thin as to  complicate the establishment of a credible defensive line against an adversary  able to concentrate at a decisive point. This would hit home at the precise  moment that the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear forces, combined with the reluctance  of West Germany to modernize the remaining nuclear forces, was moving NATO  toward a de facto denuclearization of CentralEurope. In this scenario, Eastern  Europe would not be the only part of Europe facing ferment.  </P> <P> The Soviet Union has put forward a formula to accelerate this ferment: the  concept of the "Common European House" from the Urals to the Atlantic. Many  European foreign ministers refer favorably to this idea even though it  relegates the United States to a secondary status, establishes a Soviet claim  to economic assistance based on geography and provides a basis for Soviet  domination of a denuclearized Central Europe. Moscow knows that if its notion  of a European House becomes conventional wisdom, the Alliance structure cannot  survive.  </P> <P> Two conclusions follow: a) arms-control negotiations can no longer carry the  full weight of East-West relations; b) a political concept of a united Europe  is needed to relate the existing separate negotiations on arms control, trade  and human rights to one another.  </P> <P> The West's internal cohesion requires it to put forward its vision of a united  Europe, because without it the economically and militarily strongest nation of  Europe -- the Federal Republic of Germany -- will surely pursue its own course.  </P> <P> For the turmoil in Eastern Europe falls directly on the fault line of the  division of Europe which cleaves the German people; no German statesman can  afford passivity. Even in normal times, Germany has rarely found the means to  reconcile the perils of its central geographic location with a sustainable  concept of its own national interest.  </P> <P> In part this is because Germany, unified only in 1871, never developed a  coherent concept of the national interest. Except for the Bismarck period,  1871-90, Germany's diplomacy was based on a restless quest for status which, by  threatening each neighbor individually, brought about the very nightmare of  hostile coalitions it dreaded. Historically, Germany's ties were either in  Central Europe with the Austro-Hungarian Empire or in the east with Russia. It  was not until 1950 that a decision in favor of the West was made.  </P> <P> In the last decade and a half that choice has been increasingly challenged. The  truism of the postwar period -- that the United States was essential to balance  a genuine Soviet menace -- has been shaken at both ends. U.S. policy has come  to appear opaque and less steady. The Soviet threat has diminished in West  German eyes; Mikhail S. Gorbachev has in fact turned into a sort of West German  folk hero.  </P> <P> Friends of West Germany do it no favor by muting a disquiet many Allied leaders  feel but are reluctant to articulate. It is impossible to travel through Europe  without becoming conscious of the concern of influential Europeans, not that  West Germany will leave the alliance, but that by pursuing all its options  between East and West simultaneously it will repeat -- with the best of  intentions -- the historic German debacle of self-isolation. Restless German  unilateralism could thus wind up splitting either Europe or NATO or both.  </P> <P> West Germany cannot by itself provide the necessary framework for healing the  split of Europe. If the Federal Republic challenges the Soviet Union in Eastern  Europe on a national basis, it would revive historic nightmares for the Soviet  Union and tempt Moscow into a demonstration of strength, perhaps over Berlin.  But if West Germany sought to avoid this danger by ever closer rapprochement  with Moscow -- as it would be tempted to do -- it would lead to a cooling of  relations with Washington. Bonn, in trying to be popular everywhere, could wind  up forfeiting its hard-earned reputation for reliability.  </P> <P> For these reasons, a reassessment of Allied purposes and relationships and the  elaboration of a coherent strategy are essential.  </P> <P> First, the Atlantic Allies must put forward their own concept of a united  Europe. If the Soviet Union participated without the United States, it would  dominate. If both the United States and the Soviet Union joined, Europe would  lose its identity. To avoid both hegemony and to achieve identity, the borders  of this new Europe must run from the Polish-Soviet frontier to the Atlantic,  not from the Urals to the Atlantic.  </P> <P> Second, there must be a concept of how to achieve the goal of reuniting Europe.  In the real world, progress can be made without the risk of war only if the  political freedom of Eastern Europe is somehow related to meeting legitimate  Soviet security concerns.  </P> <P> Neither America nor Europe can achieve this goal alone. The European Community  must accelerate political unification while developing a strategy for the  association of interested countries of Eastern Europe with its economic  institutions. Eastern Europe should know that this association is available to  any nation prepared to meet the Helsinki requirements of human rights and to  make clearly defined progress toward democratic institutions.  </P> <P> Once the European Community has established such a political framework, NATO  would be in a position to transform the conventional arms-control negotiations  from an esoteric numbers game into a systematic effort to accelerate greater  political freedom for Eastern Europe.  </P> <P> The existing NATO arms-control proposal foresees the continued presence of U.S.  and Soviet forces in Central Europe, albeit at reduced levels. This reflects  the reality that no European government is prepared to see a complete  withdrawal of U.S. forces, without which a total Soviet withdrawal cannot  occur. (I doubt that the Soviets would accept even such an offer, nor could it  be made without generating panic.) But to be compatible with greater political  freedom for Eastern Europe, three limitations are necessary:  </P> <P>  -- The principle of nonintervention into the domestic affairs of all  participants must be established in binding international agreements; in other  words, the Brezhnev Doctrine must be ended.  </P> <P>  -- U.S. and Soviet troops should be confined to base areas except for a  limited number of pre-announced maneuvers.  </P> <P>  -- Troops withdrawn from areas of limited armaments must not be reintroduced.  </P> <P> Why should the Soviets agree to such an approach? They might do so if Soviet  leaders are genuinely prepared to live in equilibrium with their neighbors. If  Gorbachev wants to transcend the endless conflicts that have marred the history  of his country, he should welcome an evolution that provides economic  assistance and normal security guarantees in return for political freedom for  nations whose restiveness would otherwise condemn the Soviet Union to policing  endless, unforeseeable crises.  </P> <P> In such an evolution Europe would restore its historic relationships. The  Soviet Union would have a military buffer but Moscow would disembarrass itself  of the costs and risks of sustaining unpopular regimes. The United States would  continue as the guarantor of the security of its allies while they assume an  increasing role in shaping their continent's political future.  </P> <P> History will not do the work for us. But it has given the Atlantic nations an  opportunity to do it for themselves.  </P></p>

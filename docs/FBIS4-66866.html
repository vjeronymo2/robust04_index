			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Anatoliy Yurkin] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 20 TASS -- Ratification by Russia of  the Convention on Chemical Disarmament is designed to stabilize  the situation in the entire world, said Lieutenant-General  Anatoliy Kuntsevich, a full member of the Russian Academy of  Sciences. He opened here on Wednesday the second international  conference on chemical disarmament, ``Moskon' 94,'' with a  presentation on problems of elimination of chemical warfare  agents.    Kuntsevich said Russia now possesses the world's biggest  stock of toxic agents. According to official data, it has  accumulated on its territory over 40,000 tons of products by the  military chemical complex, which is enough to poison every  living being on the globe.    The issue of recycling chemical warfare agents is out of the  scope of Russia's interests. Participants in the conference  noted that introduction of imperfect technologies might create  hotbeds of ecological tension not only on the cites of war gases  elimination but also in other regions. Experience gained in  this sphere by other countries, in particular by the United  States, cannot be copied in Russia. Developments by Russian  researchers are opposed by foreign experts just out of  considerations of competition. Some Western theoreticians and  industrialists insist that lewisite be incinerated, while  Russian specialists suggest extracting highly-pure arsenic out  of this hazard chemical agent.    Russian supplies of this valuable material used in making  solar energy plants designed to replace atomic stations in the  next century will somewhat squeeze Western arsenic producers on  the world market. Thus, purely scientific problems raised by  participants in the forum are acquiring a very different meaning.    Professor Vladlen Malyshev, adviser to the head of the  Committee for Conventional Problems of Chemical and Biological  Weapons under the Russian president, told TASS that ``Moskon'  94'' had drawn chemical researchers from many countries. In  coordination with their colleagues from the Russian Academy of  Sciences and producers, they are seeking ways of safest  destruction of Russia's huge stock-piles of toxic agents. In  doing this, the adviser said, we should first of all take into  account humane ecological problems and national interests.    ``At the same time, researchers and specialists of the  military chemical complex understand quite well that  ratification by Russia of the convention on chemical disarmament  will stabilize the situation across the world, but this truth  should also become an axiom for politicians, lawmakers and the  public at large,'' Malyshev stressed.</p>

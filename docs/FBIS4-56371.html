			<p>BFN     [Text] Irritated with the slowness of the constitutional  revision, Strategic Affairs Secretary Admiral Mario Cesar Flores  on 28 April predicted the risk of a rupture between the  executive, legislative, and judicial branches during the next  administration if the legal order does not change. For him,  whoever wins the elections will "be suffocated by the legal  order, opposed by the congressional majority." In a categorical  speech he delivered at BNDES [National Bank for Economic and  Social Development] headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, the minister  asserted that the executive branch is currently "handcuffed,  limited in its actions by the legal intervention of the other  government branches."    "With the juridical order we have, this administration, the  former one, the one before that, and the next one cannot govern.  The federal government was depleted while the states and  municipalities benefited. This will not change with the  elections. I fear that the situation may become worse after the  elections because whoever wins the elections will hardly hold a  majority in Congress."    Flores labeled the rural congressional bloc corporative,  and,  in protest against the maneuver that prevented the voting  session on the provisional measure creating the URV [Real Value  Unit], the admiral sent a message that seemed to include a  threat during the "Governability and Political System" debate:    "We have been living for the past 10 to 12 years under an  agreeable armistice that is part of our political culture, but  it is not an unconditional surrender. We need a longlasting  armistice that will lead us to peace."    The energetic speech by Flores, who also said the political  parties have become "hostages of corporations within a suicidal  congressional mechanism," surprised the rest of the speakers  who, although admitting the governability crisis, wanted to  avoid preaching chaos:    "I feel horror over those catastrophic forecasts," said  former Minister Joao Paulo dos Reis Velloso, superintendent of  the National Higher Studies Institute, after the debate.    Deputy Paulo Delgado (PT-MG) [Workers Party-Minas Gerais]  thought Flores "exaggerated somewhat in his speech:"    This demonstrates a difficult situation: the impasse in  Congress as a result of the explosive combination of the  stabilization plan, the constitutional revision, and the  elections.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Manojlo Tomic: "Karadjordjevo in Geneva"] </F>   [Text] After the latest peace negotiations in Geneva and  Brussels over Bosnia-Herzegovina, anybody could see that  diplomacy is, among other things, the art of "productive talk  and no action." And so, after those talks, everyone could say  that was grist to their mill. Milosevic and Tudjman will be  convincing their subjects that they made a "decisive" step  toward peace, offering one-third of the Bosnian territory to the  Muslims. It is so easy to offer something which does not belong  to you! The official Bosnia-Herzegovina leadership, on the other  hand, could try and convince their people that things are  nevertheless going their (our?) way, for regardless of Boban's  repeated rejection, Tudjman agreed that, in the transition  period, Mostar and Neum be under the EC and UN administration.  Or, as one can (not) guess from reports of the director of the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Television that "the talks with the Serbian  side aim toward the final and essentially righteous fulfillment  of the territorial demands of the Bosnia-Herzegovina delegation."    However, how can we believe all that? The validity of the  "pivotal" agreement, as West European diplomats call it -- on  the Christmas cease-fire -- could best be attested to by the  soldiers and citizens of Sarajevo, especially by those at Zuca  and at the foot of Trebevic. But let us not be ironical, which  is a common trait of every living inhabitant of Sarajevo and  Bosnia, and even of yours truly. Let us also put aside all  those stories about great strategies, interest zones, moral  dilemmas.... We would all like to know the answer to the  question whether the said agreements in Geneva and Brussels made  any step toward peace. Using the language of the futile  European diplomacy, the answer is in the affirmative. Greater  Serbian and greater Croatian hegemonists are on the way to  definitely grant the right to the Muslims-Bosnjaks to one-third  of the territory (the right to the entire Bosnia-Herzegovina  territory belongs to the Bosnians and not to the Bosnjaks).  They were not forced to do that by the EC, as one might think,  but by the Bosnia- Herzegovina Army. They would have signed for  peace between the Serbs and the Croats a long time ago, perhaps  in Geneva, and would be praised as peacemakers, had they  succeeded in dividing Bosnia on the ground. The  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army would not let them do that, not the EC.    The mystery about whether Tudjman and Milosevic reached an  agreement on dividing Bosnia in Karadjordjevo has been all  cleared up. Thanks to SKY's cameras, we saw Karadjordjevo in  Geneva. Leaning over the map, Milosevic, assisted by Karadzic,  was arranging the division of Bosnia together with Tudjman,  Boban, and their other blind followers. The mystery is  unraveled: Serbian and Croatian national leaders, deeply  convinced that they fulfilled thousand-year-old yearning of  their peoples, like common peasants haggling at the market,  publicly established the bazaar around Bosnia, its villages and  towns, which they never even heard of or visited, let alone felt  for in their souls. That scene must haunt every normal Serb and  Croat until the end of their existence, as a proof of the depths  to which their nations have sunk. There is no bottom any more.</p>

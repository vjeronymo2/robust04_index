			<p><P> April 1, 1989, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CAR OWNER SAYS FAKE BOMB WAS TO DETER RIDERS  </P> <P> A 24-year-old Kearny Mesa man, who told fire investigators that he rigged a  fake pipe bomb to the tailpipe of his car to deter friends from asking for  rides, was released Friday on $5,000 bail from County Jail, authorities said.  </P> <P> Paul Ferris of the 4200 block of Kirkcaldy Drive was arrested Thursday night on  suspicion of possessing materials to make an explosive device, said John Buono,  detective with the Metro Arson Strike Team.  </P> <P> Ferris' car was the subject of a lengthy investigation at Morley Field, Buono  said.  </P> <P> San Diego Fire Department Capt. Larry Cooke said the explosive-device team  answered a call just after 5:30 p.m. Thursday and found the pipe attached to  the 1984 Volvo.  </P> <P> Cooke said the device was a hollow pipe with a valve and wire attached to it.  </P> <P> Investigators were on the scene for more than five hours, Buono said. They  evacuated the area and X-rayed the pipe before determining that it was a phony,  he said.  </P> <P> Also summoned to the scene were agents from the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,  Tobacco and Firearms, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.  </P> <P> Ferris could face more charges, depending on what the district attorney's  office decides after the case is forwarded to it next week, Buono said.  </P></p>

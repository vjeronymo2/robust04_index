			<p>920403 FT  03 APR 92 / World Trade News: Greece awards water contract worth Dr50bn GREECE has awarded a Dr50bn (Pounds 152m) contract for a dam and tunnel project, to boost the Athens water supply, to a Greek-Austrian-Italian consortium of construction companies, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The consortium consists of three Greek companies, Aegek, Domika Erga and Meton, together with Jager of Austria and Seli of Italy. The public works ministry said Aegek and its partners submitted the lowest bid among six contenders. The project calls for a 90-metre high earth dam across the Evinos river in central Greece, together with a 30 km rock-cut tunnel to feed the Mornos reservoir north-west of the capital. The ministry said work would begin in the next two months, with completion due by the end of 1995. The Greek state investment budget will initially finance the project, but negotiations are under way to secure additional funding from the European Community, a ministry official said. The Evinos project was planned to come on stream in the mid-1980s but was postponed because of a funding squeeze. A sharp decline in winter rainfall in recent years means Athens faces a severe water shortage at a time when demand is increasing by 8 per cent yearly, according to the city water company. At present, the Mornos reservoir contains only five months' supply of water. The government may have to revive an emergency plan to bring water by truck from the Evinos if rainfall is light again this spring.</p>

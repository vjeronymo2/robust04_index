			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by I.A. Saurmelkh, I.A. Saumelkh, candidate of </F> agricultural sciences, Kustanay Scientific Production  Association; UDC 633.111.1''321'':631.526.32]    [Abstract] The spring wheat variety Karabalykskaya 85 was  developed at the Karabalyk Agricultural Test Station at the  Kustanay Agricultural Scientific Research Institute by the  method of individual seed selection from the hybrid population  Cesium 51 x Saratovskaya 39. It has been regionalized in the  Chelyabinsk Oblast since 1991. Karabalykskaya 85 is of the  variety lutescens. Its glume is shaped like an elongated egg  with pronounced venation, and its tooth is short, straight, and  blunt. Its grain is oval, glassy, and of a semiglassy  consistency, and 1,000 grains weigh 32-36 g. It is a  medium-maturing variety that ripens at the same time as  Saratovskaya 39. It has average resistance to damping-off and  has a rather high potential productivity that averages 3.46  metric tons/hectare, which is 0.31 metric tons/hectare higher  than the standard. The results of commercial tests of  Karabalykskaya 85 at various sovkhozes were fairly good: At the  Petropavlovsk sovkhoz in the Upper Ural Rayon of the Saratov  Oblast, its grain yield was twice that of Saratovskaya 29. Its  brown rust resistance is close to that of the standard, its  susceptibility to root rot is somewhat lower than that of other  regionalized varieties, and it is resistant to smut. The  processing qualities of the grain of Karabalykskaya 85 are high  and meet the requirements set for hard wheat grain.  Karabalykskaya 85 should be sowed at the optimum time for given  soil/climate zones at a rate of 4.0-5.0 million seeds/hectare.  The soft spring wheat variety Erythrospermum 35 was developed by  a team at the Karabalyk Agricultural Test station at the  Kustanay Agricultural Scientific Research Center and Kazakh  Grain Farming Scientific Research Institute by the method of  individual selection from the hybrid population Erythrospermum  29/70-19 x Lutescens 26/67-211. It has been regionalized in the  Kustanay, Kokchetav, Karaganda, and Dzhezkazgan oblasts since  1991. It is of the variety erythrospermum. Its spike is of  average length and compactness, and its glume is shaped like an  elongated oval with marked venation. The tooth of the glume is  of average length, straight, and sharp. The grain is red,  semielongated, and over average size (1,000 grains weigh 34-40  g). Erythrospermum 35 is a medium-maturing variety that matures  6-8 days later than the standard Saratovskaya 29. It has average  resistance to damping-off. In comparative variety tests,  Erythrospermum 35 outyielded the standard by 0.65 metric  tons/hectare at an average level of 3.3 metric tons/hectare (the  maximum yield of 5.4 metric tons/hectare was achieved in 1985).  It also demonstrated good results in commercial tests (a yield  of 0.67 metric tons/hectare, which was twice as high as the  yield of Saratovskaya 29). Erythrospermum 35 is highly resistant  to damping-off both under natural conditions and against the  background of an artificial infection. During the years of the  study, its rate of susceptibility to this disease did not exceed  6-8 percent, while the susceptibility of Saratovskaya 29 was  between 34 and 63 percent. Erythrospermum 35 is about as  susceptible to rust as Saratovskaya 29, but its grain is more  resistant to sprouting than the standard varieties, and it is  less susceptible to root rot than other regionalized varieties.  It should be sowed late (after 25 May) at a rate of 4-5 million  seeds/hectare.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Esteban Huertas] </F>   [Excerpt] President Guillermo Endara said yesterday that  "Panama must insist" on Cuba's reentry into the OAS, as has been  suggested by other countries of the region.    Endara said that the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, to take  place in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on 14 and 15 June, "will  not address the Cuban situation."    According to Endara, the chiefs of state "have met with  Castro at other summit meetings, to seek ways to democratize the  island" and have been unsuccessful for the last 30 years.    Whenever the issue is addressed, Endara said, "Castro always  approaches the discussion in a rational and open way, as the  dignified and responsible person that he is."    The Panamanian leader said he has spoken many times with the  Cuban statesman, whom he finds to be "an exceptional individual,  despite the political differences" that separate the two  presidents.

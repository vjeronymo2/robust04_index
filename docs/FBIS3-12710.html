The sources pointed out that al-'Amaliqah's attempt received  the support of Jihad elements and the fundamentalist militias to  besiege the battalions of the southern al-Wahdah Brigade and  clash with the Madram Brigade (partisan militias), but it failed  to achieve its aims. In fact it enabled the Socialist Party to  correct a mistake which had existed since January 1986, namely  reinforcing its military presence in Abyan and destroying  fundamentalist infiltration, which took place after the  establishment of unity.    Southern forces succeeded in storming the Afghan Arabs'  centers in the al-Maraqishah mountains. High-level political  sources arriving in Aden from Abyan the day before yesterday  said that 90 Afghan Arabs from the Jihad organizations have been  arrested and 30 killed. And that the others are being pursued  in the northern Abyan heights toward the northern governorate of  al-Bayda'.    The source accused northern army commanders of supporting  the  Afghan Arabs, who were stationed in Abyan, and of supplying them  with food and military equipment. The sources said that these  did not exist before unity and they began to arrive in Shabwah,  Hadhramout, and Abyan after unity. [passage omitted]</p>

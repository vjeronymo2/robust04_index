			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Markets Report: Danes, Dutch cut rates Interest rate cuts in Denmark and the Netherlands injected some life into sluggish pre-Christmas dealings and spurred speculation of further European easing before the end of the year, writes Conner Middelmann. The Danish central bank reduced its discount and deposit rates by 25 basis points to 6.25 per cent. The move did not come as a major surprise given the Danish krone's recent strength against the D-Mark and following statements from Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the central bank governor, that the bank intended to test the market with small interest rate cuts. The krone strengthened further after the move, closing at DKr3.910 to the D-Mark, after DKr3.916 on Monday. The Dutch central bank cut its special advances rate by 10 basis points to 5.80 per cent. The move was seen to have been prompted by the Dutch guilder's persistent strength against the D-Mark. The guilder is pegged to the German currency at a central parity of Fl 1.1267 per D-Mark, and for the last two weeks has traded below Fl 1.12. It finished at Fl 1.120, up from Fl 1.121 on Monday. However, it ceded its top ranking in the European Monetary System's exchange rate grid to the Irish punt, moving into second place. The northern European rate cuts fuelled talk that France and Italy would follow suit, boosting their currencies against the D-Mark. The Italian lira rose to a high of L975.25 per D-Mark and ended at L976.0, compared with L980.0 at Monday's close. 'There is a good chance that the Italian authorities will cut rates again before the end of the year - if nothing else as a reward for the passage of the (1994) budget,' said Mr Ian Gunner, international economist at Chase Manhattan Bank in London. The market has priced in a  1/2 percentage point cut in the 8 per cent discount rate. Italian rate cut hopes were intensified by preliminary data from eight major cities compiled by the University of Bologna, indicating that the December CPI rose 0.1 per cent on the month and was unchanged at 4.2 per cent year-on-year, below market expectations for a 4.3 per cent yearly average. Hopes for imminent easing also buoyed the French franc, which climbed as high as FFr3.4025 to the D-Mark before closing at FFr3.403, up from Monday's FFr3.409. According to Mr Julian Callow, European economist with Kleinwort Benson, 'there is room now for the French authorities to cut interest rates'. Belgium is also tipped to lower interest rates before the year-end, and disappointment that the Belgian central bank left rates unchanged yesterday caused the franc to slip slightly to BFr20.76 per D-Mark, from BFr20.75 on Monday. In Germany, the first regional December inflation numbers had little impact, although the month-on-month rise was slightly higher than expected. Bavaria reported a 0.2 per cent increase in the month to mid-December - slightly above expectations for a 0.1 per cent rise - and a year-on-year rate of 3.4 per cent. The three-month Euromark futures contract edged up 0.01 point to 94.47. The dollar continued its steady ascent against the Japanese yen, which remains dogged by worries over Japan's weak economy and political uncertainty. The US currency ended at Y111.05, up from Monday's Y110.55. In New York it finished at Y111.12. 'The US authorities appear to be shifting their position on the dollar/yen rate,' said Mr Gunner at Chase Manhattan. After lobbying for a strong yen in a bid to boost US exports to Japan, the US now appears to have tempered its stance on the growing recognition that a strong yen would impede Japan's recovery by dampening its exports, analysts said. Mr Stephen Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International, said: 'Talking up the yen is not in the US's long term interest; a strong Japan will be more likely to import US goods eventually.' Indicating that the US is comfortable with the current exchange rate trend, US Treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen said in a television interview that US currency intervention in regard to dollar/yen would not be necessary. The dollar was mildly weaker against the D-Mark, closing at DM1.7080, down from DM1.7135 on Monday. It ended trading in New York at DM1.7070. According to Kleinwort's Mr Callow, that is partly a year-end effect. 'Because of the US's position as a net debtor, a lot of money flows out of the US for interest payments around this time and that tends to weaken the dollar,' he explained. In the UK money market, the March short sterling contract dropped by 0.08 point to 94.73. Traders said this had little to do with a shift in the market's interest rate outlook, but rather was due to profit-taking in a thin market. However, one senior trader commented: 'At this level, the contract has pink ribbons on it saying: buy me]' The Bank of England's initial forecast of a Pounds 1bn shortage was revised slightly to Pounds 1.05bn. In early operations the Bank purchased Pounds 81m of bills for resale to the market on January 10 at 5 13/32 per cent. It later bought a further Pounds 168m, of which Pounds 40m worth was outright and the rest for resale to the market on January 10. In the afternoon it purchased Pounds 147m of bills and provided late assistance of around Pounds 675m.  ----------------------------------------              POUND IN NEW YORK  ---------------------------------------- Dec 21          Close    Prev. close  ---------------------------------------- Pounds spot    1.4885      1.4865 1 mth          1.4852      1.4830 3 mth          1.4804      1.4785 1 yr           1.4680      1.4662  ----------------------------------------</p>

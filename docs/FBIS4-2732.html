			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 12 (XINHUA) -- Rural people in  northeast China's Liaoning province are making a fortune in  urban areas these days, instead of hawking their farm and  side-line products for a living as they did a few years ago.    Like rustics in other parts of China, farmers in the  province  are now enjoying an increasingly important role in the urban  economy.    In Anshan, one of the province's largest industrial cities,  50,000 farmers are now engaged at construction sites in the  city. They earned more than one billion yuan last year,  one-third of the total earned by all builders in the city.    The rural builders have won out in fierce competitions with  urban builders owing to their flexibility in business operation  and a strong sense of responsibility as well as efficiency.    They have received national prizes for painting, glazed tile  stamping and terrazzo floor polishing. A construction team led  by Dong Shaowen, a former farmer, won the top national building  prize last year.    A village-run real estate development company in the suburbs  of Shenyang, capital of the province, has built more than 140  buildings for sale, covering a total floor space of 500,000  square meters.    In the coastal city of Yingkou, rural builders are playing  an  equally important role as urban builders in the construction of  a port in the city.    A farmer in the suburbs of Dalian, also a coastal city of  the  province, invested 400,000 yuan in the city's sports shop seven  years ago. The shop has now topped 30 million yuan in sales.  It has business with more than 600 enterprises from over 20  provinces and cities in the country.    Rural people are also found dealing with refrigerator  production, top-class shoe-making, department stores,  restaurants and entertainment centers.    Experts say rural people not only make money but also  re-invigorate their ideas in urban areas. With the market  economy being established in the country, rural people are sure  to play an even bigger role in the country's urban market.</p>

			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / International Company News: Trump sets up swap deal on Plaza Hotel MR DONALD TRUMP, the heavily-indebted New York property developer, is aiming to exchange a 49 per cent equity interest in Manhattan's Plaza Hotel for more favourable terms from bankers who have loans outstanding on landmark property. Mr Richard Wilhelm, president of the Plaza, confirmed the tentative deal yesterday. The debt-for-equity swap is understood to involve forgiving almost half the Dollars 600m debt outstanding on the Plaza, and setting a fixed rate on the remaining loan financing. Mr Wilhelm added that 'at this time, there no intention to do anything about the condominium plan' at the Plaza. Last year, stories that Mr Trump was considering converting much of the Plaza into condominiums, which would then be sold to individual buyers, gained wide publicity. However, the current climate in the US, and difficulties in the real estate market in particular, would present problems for such a scheme at this time. The Plaza deal is the latest in the long series of restructurings involving different parts of Mr Trump's casinos and property empire.</p>

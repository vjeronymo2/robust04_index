			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / The TUC At Blackpool: Unions to open base in Brussels THE TUC is to open an office in Brussels. Mr Bill Jordan, leader of the AEEU craft union, said yesterday the office would be cost-effective as unions did much business with the European Commission. Mr Jordan, launching a TUC 'Network Europe' to improve union contacts within the EC, said he was proposing a common European union card for members of engineering and metalworking unions, though he advised against interpreting such a move as the first step towards pan-European unionism. The problem of fostering co-operation across borders between unions with different bargaining cultures continues to prevent the establishment of a European works council at Ford. The German union I G Metall insists that only Ford employees can be on the council while the UK unions insist that full-time union officials must also have a voice.</p>

			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / The Lex Column: Barclays' happy return Unlike other banks which blame the weakness of UK loan demand for their stagnant balance sheets, Barclays is making a virtue out of the Pounds 10bn first-half fall in its customer lending. The bank says this reflects deliberate adjustments to its loan portfolio to eliminate assets which are too risky for the returns they offer. After the ravages of the recession during which Barclays was far too heavily exposed to property and construction, this is perfectly sensible. Barclays is right to make a start even before its sophisticated new approach to credit assessment and loan pricing comes into force next year. But weeding out the unwanted assets is a much easier job than adding new ones of the desired quality. For now Barclays is making a handsome return. Yet the bank admits that earnings cannot exceed 20 per cent of shareholders' funds indefinitely. Once the return slips it will need higher volume to maintain profit momentum. It cannot ignore the weakness at the operating level where profits fell by 8 per cent despite rigorous control over costs. The miracle cure designed by Mr Martin Taylor, Barclays' new chief executive, will not be complete until he has shown that safe lending does not mean no lending. Few indeed are the bankers who manage consistently to lend money at rates which are both competitive and remunerative. Barclays might steal a march if it can refine its risk assessment to the point where its judgment is sharper than that of other institutions. Even so its prospective growth does not appear to warrant a tier one capital ratio of 7 per cent. Rather than kowtow to the rating agencies, Barclays should consider using its retained earnings to pay some of its expensive preference share capital back. After all, it is easier to impose discipline on lending if capital is a scarce resource.</p>

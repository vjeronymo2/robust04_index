[passage omitted]    In his speech, Gao Dezhan said: Returning students have made  great contributions to Tianjin's reform, opening up, and  economic construction with great patriotic zeal, intelligence,  and wisdom. They are worthy of emulation. He ardently hoped  that the broad masses of returned students will give further  play to their own distinctive advantages, extensively contact  and attract more overseas students, colleagues, relatives, and  friends to return to China and Tianjin to work, and to introduce  trained personnel, funds, and information to promote Tianjin's  modernization. He said: The broad masses of intellectuals,  including the returned students, and all sectors across the  municipality will surely be able to invigorate Tianjin as long  as they rally around the party Central Committee with Comrade  Jiang Zemin as the nucleus, act closely in connection with the  party's overall situation of "seizing the opportunity, deepening  reform, expanding opening up, promoting development, and  maintaining stability," work with one heart and one mind,  struggle in unity, and immerse in hard work. The municipal  party committee and the government will continue to create an  external environment in which returned students can display  their intelligence and wisdom and make contributions, will  continue to earnestly ask for advice from them, and make joint  efforts to manage Tianjin's work well.    In his speech, Li Jianguo extended warm congratulations to  the federation of returned students on its establishment on  behalf of the municipal party committee and government. He  said: Since the founding of China nearly 45 years ago, batches  of students studying abroad have returned to the motherland and  Tianjin to participate in the development and played a very  important role in Tianjin's economy, science and technology,  education, public health, and various undertakings. Their pure  heart of cherishing and serving the motherland and their lofty  spirit of dedicating themselves to science and invigorating  China have been praised by the party and the people.    Li Jianguo said: Tianjin has several hundred thousand  specialized technical personnel and a group of specialists and  scholars who have great influence at home and abroad. This  backbone contingent is Tianjin's precious wealth and great  advantage and a symbol of Tianjin's status. We must grasp the  limited time before the end of this century, step up efforts to  train a new generation of academic and technical leaders and a  batch of young top personnel of domestic first-grade level and  international advanced level, and enable Tianjin to continuously  maintain the advantage of having trained personnel at home by  the early period of the next century.    Li Jianguo said in conclusion: To push the economy forward,  we must rely on science, technology, and education and give full  play to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of  intellectuals. We must do a good job in handling work regarding  returned students. It is hoped that the establishment of the  Tianjin Municipal Federation of Returned Students will serve as  a bridge for establishing ties and strengthening friendship with  the broad masses of returned students, exchanging learning, and  promoting Tianjin's economic and social development.</p>

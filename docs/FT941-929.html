			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / Farm wages board set for government reprieve The government looks likely to bow to pressure from farm workers and their employers by preserving the Agricultural Wages Board, which lays down minimum wage rates for 180,000 farmworkers. An announcement confirming the board's future is expected this week from Mrs Gillian Shephard, agriculture minister. Last week, after the board awarded a 4.9 per cent wage rise to farm workers, Mrs Shephard said she had been indundated with calls from all parts of the industry for its preservation. Last week's decision by the board came in spite of opposition from the National Farmers Union, although many farmers prefer the existing system because it ensures stability. The government last year scrapped the wages councils that laid down minimum levels of pay for an estimated 4.5m workers in low-wage sectors such as hotels and catering. Ministers appear to accept, however, that farm workers still need wage protection. A decision to retain the Agricultural Wages Board would be a relief to the Trades Union Congress, which has pressed for a reprieve, saying that abolition would lead to downward pressure on wages, create more unemployment in the countryside and result in lower investment. The TUC, in its written submission to the government, pointed out such a move would mean breaching the UK's obligations under the European Union's treaty of Rome, which states that the Common Agricultural Policy should ensure a fair standard of living for the farming community. The TUC also wants to increase the board's staffing to ensure more vigorous enforcement of pay awards, and favours protection for farmworkers who make complaints to the board about their pay.</p>

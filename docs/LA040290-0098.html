			<p><P> April 2, 1990, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH  </P> <P> ADMAN: As local advertising agencies have garnered national recognition for  their creativity, new production facilities are springing up here. . . . Philip  J. Salvati, president of the award-winning Costa Mesa ad agency of Salvati  Montgomery Sakoda, Inc.(D6), said that until a few years ago, agency executives  had to trek to Los Angeles for videotape or still-photo work. . . . Today, he  said, this work can be done in the county, making the trip north necessary for  only the most difficult shoots. Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons  </P></p>

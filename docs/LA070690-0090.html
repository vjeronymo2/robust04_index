			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EAST GERMANY'S 'COMING OUT' OPENS GAY FILM FESTIVAL;  </P> <P> MOVIES: 'IT'S NOT ONLY GAYS WHO ARE COMING OUT,' SAYS THE DIRECTOR, 'BUT A  WHOLE SOCIETY.' ONE HUNDRED FILMS FROM 15 NATIONS WILL BE SHOWN.  </P> <P> East German film director Heiner Carow thinks it's ironic that the  transformation of East Germany from communism to free enterprise is going to  make it more difficult for movies like his gay-themed "Coming Out" to be made  there in the future.  </P> <P> But Carow, in town for tonight's screening of "Coming Out" -- the opening-night  attraction of the eighth annual Los Angeles International Gay &amp; Lesbian  Film and Video Festival -- was expressing an isolated regret. Otherwise, he is  joyous about his homeland's political shift and the eventual reunification of  East and West.  </P> <P> "I'm very happy that so many essential things have changed, that the (Berlin)  wall is down, that everyone can travel," he said. "But on the other hand, we  have a lot of problems coming up."  </P> <P> For one thing, he is worried that the reorientation to free markets will dry up  funding for the arts.  </P> <P> Under a free-enterprise system, Carow believes, money for a gay-themed movie  would be hard to get. The evidence that he's right is overwhelming, considering  how few American films about gay people are made. For example, the makers of  "Longtime Companion," a current film about AIDS, faced major financial  obstacles.  </P> <P> "Nobody would finance my movie," Carow said through his son, Stefan, who  composed the score for "Coming Out" and who, on this occasion, served as his  father's translator.  </P> <P> In Carow's view, it's a reality of the marketplace that alternative films have  difficulty finding support. How many producers would finance a story about an  East Berlin schoolteacher discovering he is gay, he wondered. That is the  essential story line of "Coming Out."  </P> <P> The feature-length "Coming Out" is one of four films about gay and lesbian life  in Eastern Europe that will screen at the festival. (See box.) Its presentation  is co-sponsored by the Goethe Institute, L.A.'s German cultural center.  </P> <P> Although the festival will screen films from other nations in Europe and Asia,  executive director Larry Horne is particularly excited about the films  examining life in Eastern Europe. Until now -- and not surprisingly -- the  lives of gay men and women has been a taboo subject in the party line of the  Communist East.  </P> <P> Obviously, it existed, Horne noted. It just wasn't officially discussed.  </P> <P> He first encountered "Coming Out" at February's edition of the Berlin  International Film Festival held in the city's Western sector. Horne said the  movie "created a buzz because it was gay and because it was from East Germany."  It came at the height of the euphoria over the political changes in Eastern  Europe and the fall of the Berlin Wall.  </P> <P> When Carow was told that the general perception in the West is surprise that a  gay-themed film was made with government funds in a totalitarian state, he  nodded with a knowing smile. He said he understands that view.  </P> <P> But in practical terms, he said, the government mandated a film budget that had  to be awarded. There were 16 awards made annually -- with only slightly more  applicants. "If you fight the censors hard enough, you usually can win," he  said. But not always.  </P> <P> The first time he attempted to make a gay film was more than 10 years ago.  Under the hard-line East German regime of the time, it was not approved by  censors. The government-run film bureau, DEFA, rejected his pitch. As well as  angering the director, the rejection motivated him to keep trying. And over  time, things changed.  </P> <P> "In the last 10 years there has been talk of AIDS and, therefore, more talk of  homosexuals openly," Carow said. "Some articles were published and  documentaries were made about homosexuality. All these things were happening  and my attempt to write a screenplay was a part of this intellectual change,  which was spurred by Gorbachev."  </P> <P> With obvious pleasure, he added, "The totalitarian government of cement heads  was beginning to break a little, and they were not able to refuse changes."  </P> <P> The script for "Coming Out," much like the American musical "A Chorus Line,"  was based on extensive interviews that Carow and screenwriter Wolfram Witt  conducted with dozens of East Berlin gays. They used actual locations,  including a gay bar and its patrons for several smoky, decadent scenes  reminiscent of "Cabaret."  </P> <P> The movie went into production on Nov. 10, 1988, and premiered on Nov. 9, 1989  -- the very day the Berlin Wall began to collapse. In the days before, Carow  and his company feared that the film might not open, since there was talk of  police crackdowns and large demonstrations against the rule of former East  German leader Erich Honecker. Then, on the day of the premiere, when people  learned that the wall was coming down, "We were very much afraid that nobody  would attend the performance."  </P> <P> As it turned out, a large audience came. The applause was so strong at movie's  end that the creators and actors were called to the stage. As Carow sees it,  the film's story was symbolic and its timing was crucial.  </P> <P> "Every man, every woman, every citizen of East Germany needs his own coming  out. It is not only gays who are coming out. It is also a coming out of a whole  society."  </P></p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / Letters to the Editor: Facile yardstick for hospital chiefs' salaries Sir, Alan Pike compared the salaries of private-sector executives handling budgets of Pounds 110m with that of chief executives of hospitals with similar budgets ('Managers' top pay in hospitals is Pounds 95,000', September 10) . The inference was hospital heads were doing badly. There is a world of difference between (a) being responsible for an enterprise which must bring in its own turnover by selling a service or product and, in addition, controlling the expenditure necessary to create that turnover through a number of functions, and (b) responsibility for controlling a spending budget of Pounds 110m which is extorted from tax payers and handed to you. A commensurate salary would be about half the figure mentioned and much less than that currently paid to hospital chief executives. Many local authority department heads are also grossly overpaid. Interestingly, this facile yardstick should provide John Major with a salary of Pounds 279m a year. After all he handles a budget of Pounds 250bn a year.

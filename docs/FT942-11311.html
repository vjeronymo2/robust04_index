			<p>940506 FT  06 MAY 94 / UK Local Elections: A mathematical conundrum for Hillingdon's voters - Campaign Diary Strange goings-on in west London, where Labour put up three candidates in the Hillingdon East ward. Nothing odd about that, except that Hillingdon East elects only two councillors. Two of the hopefuls - Walter Kennedy and Len Smith - were described on the ballot paper as 'Labour party' nominees, while the third, Herbert Binding, as an 'official Labour' candidate. John Bartlett, Labour's Hillingdon agent, put the phone down when asked about the discrepancy. 'I don't answer questions about the elections,' he said. Less touchy officials said Binding was asked to stand by party HQ after it refused to endorse Kennedy because of alleged links with Militant Labour, the former Militant Tendency. The local party, which ran Hillingdon with a 1-vote majority, refused to disown Kennedy, a councillor since 1990. There may be more confusion. Kennedy's party membership will be reviewed shortly by Labour's National Constitutional Commission which takes a dim view of Militant activity. * * * Nobody emerges terribly well from the equally strange, but potentially tragic, goings-on north of the border, where two Labour MPs and a Conservative dignitary have received death threats. Tony Worthington, MP for Clydebank &amp; Milngavie, was born in Lincolnshire but has lived in Scotland for years. He was warned to 'leave Scotland or die'. George Robertson, shadow Scottish secretary, received a warning inscribed 'Traitor Scot RIP', and Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative party, also received a threat. The warnings, taken seriously by the police, purport to come from a shadowy organisation called Flame, and appear to be targeted at unionists and Englishmen. Some non-Scots living in the Highlands have recently received hoax letter bombs from Flame. Unfortunately, Labour's knee-jerk response was to urge the Scottish National party, probably Europe's most peaceful and least racialist nationalist movement, to disassociate itself from the threats. The SNP justifiably called that a blatant attempt to make political capital out of a dangerous situation. * * * Selective memory is a vital political tool. But it was a bit brazen of Islington's Liberal Democrats to claim in election literature that the local council has been Labour-run for 20 years. What about the Social Democratic party administration of 1981-82? It must have slipped the collective Lib Dem memory - rather like the SDP itself. * * * Spare a thought for Liberal Democrat campaigner Doris Ford, a South Tyneside councillor, who will have a painful permanent reminder of the local elections. Canvassing in the village of Boldon Colliery, she posted a leaflet through the letter box of an apparently empty house, only to have the tip of a middle finger bitten off by a dog. A neighbour retrieved the fingertip, but it could not be sewn back on. In spite of her injury, the doughty Mrs Ford, a 69-year-old retired publican and dog owner, was out yesterday encouraging potential Lib Dem voters. Labour has a majority of 50 on the 60-seat council, but the Lib Dems hope to give their rivals a nasty nip. Mrs Ford has not lost her sense of humour. 'Lots of people have asked me if it was a Labour dog,' she says. * * * It seems that Ken Clarke, the beer-drinking, football-watching chancellor, really does have those man-of-the-people tastes to which Tory spin-doctors are always drawing attention. Clarke issued a list of food prices this week, intended to show how much more things would cost if inflation had continued at the average rate in Labour's last four years in power. The list is full of things such as sliced bread, sausages, baked beans, instant coffee and teabags. By chance, Jack Straw, Labour's local government spokesman, also released a shopping list, designed to show what could be bought with the Pounds 40 difference between average council tax bills in Labour and Tory areas. No baked beans on Straw's list, but he won't starve. His modernist menu includes wholemeal bread, prosciutto, tagliatelle, Costa Rican coffee, extra virgin olive oil, carrot and coriander pate, Somerset Camembert, fresh ravioli with salmon . . . * * * Why are there no Conservative election posters in all those grand Westminster houses where Tory MPs have their London homes? Teresa Gorman, the rightwing MP for Billericay, put it down initially to the tardiness of deliveries by local Conservatives to her Lord North Street terrace, hard by the Houses of Parliament. But further inquiries suggest a more basic reason: Westminster South Conservative association didn't print any. Donald Stewart, the agent, says posters are a waste of time in a borough where most of the passers-by on any given street are likely to live somewhere else. The association has distributed leaflets displaying the candidates' names and the Conservative colours, but not many supporters bother to display them, says Stewart. The results will tell us whether Westminster Tories are shy or just over-confident. * * * Mike Summersby, leader of the Conservative group on Newcastle City Council, is clearly something of a dragon slayer. Not content with fighting a losing battle with Newcastle's overwhelmingly strong Labour group, Summersby is also a campaigner for proportional representation in council elections - a subject which gets short shrift from Conservative Central Office. Undaunted, Summersby points out that the Conservatives took 30 per cent of the vote at the last elections - in 1992 - for a return of six seats, or 8 per cent of the total. Labour took 44 per cent of the vote, but picked up 61 of the 78 seats, or 78 per cent. So complete is Labour's monopoly of power, says Summersby, that Conservatives are not even allowed a turn at being mayor. Given the hostility of the Conservative hierarchy, Summersby has few hopes for a rapid conversion to PR. But his hand may be strengthened by the procession of Tory councillors going into opposition, some in areas which have been blue for decades. * * * Hands up anyone who understands the council tax row. One of the features of a generally lacklustre local elections campaign has been the statistical dispute between John Gummer, environment secretary, and Jack Straw, his Labour shadow, over the size of bills in Labour and Tory areas. Labour got in first with a claim that average bills from Labour councils are Pounds 40 lower than in Conservative areas. Meaningless, says Gummer, who points out that averages simply demonstrate that houses in Conservative-controlled areas are generally more expensive than in Labour areas. Gummer prefers a band-for-band comparison, which works in the Tories' favour. Gummer won the intellectual battle, because his figures make more sense. But Labour's campaign team think Straw won the political campaign, if only because he succeeded in confusing everybody.</p>

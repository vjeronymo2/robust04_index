			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by station reporter Zhang Henan] </F>   [Text] On the eve of a traditional Muslim festival,  provincial and Xining city leading members visited 14 poor  Muslim households and presented them with flour, edible oil, and  tea. On the morning of 4 March, Vice Governor La Bingli; Wu  Youcai, director of the provincial civil affairs department; and  Xining Mayor Liu Guangzhong separately visited some Muslim  families in eastern, central, western and northern districts in  Xining, and inquired about their living and work conditions.    In the eastern district, Vice Governor La Bingli heard about  the living conditions of Ma Qiming, a helpless 78-year-old  elder, and Zhao Lianfeng, a centenarian. La said that taking  care of the elderly was the traditional virtue of the Chinese  nation. It was imperative to do a good job of comforting and  compensating the bereaved elderly and to resolve their  difficulties so that they might lead a happy life in their old  age.    It has been learned that to enable Muslims to spend the  festival joyfully, civil affairs departments at the provincial  and city levels delivered 500,000 yuan to poor Muslim households.</p>

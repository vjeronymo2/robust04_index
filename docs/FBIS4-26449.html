			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 21 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Vice President  Rong Yiren today urged British and American business people to  take advantage of China's reform and opening-up and lose no time  to strengthen economic and technical cooperation with Chinese  enterprises.    The vice-president made the call when meeting with C.R.  Sitter, president of Exxon Corporation and Lord Prior, chairman  of General Electric Company here this morning.    From the long run, the Chinese vice-president said during  his  meeting with Lord Prior, the series of fundamental reform  measures introduced in taxation, banking and foreign trade at  the beginning of this year, which were designed to promote a  socialist market economic structure best suited to Chinese  conditions, will make it more convenient and more favorable for  foreign investors to invest and conduct economic and technical  cooperation in China.    Despite the fact that China was not familiar with market  economy, Rong said, China has adopted all possible measures in  the course of deepening reform and opening-up and these have  laid a solid foundation for Sino-foreign cooperation in all  domains.    The vice-president said that the strengthening of  cooperation  between developed and developing countries will facilitate  economic recovery and growth of developed countries.    In a certain sense, he noted, it is the best way of  promoting  the development of the world economy by strengthening  "South-North cooperation. [no closing quote as received]    Rong told Mr. C.R. Sitter that China has always attached  much  importance to the development of energy industry. Although  tremendous progress has been made over the past decade in  China's energy industry, he added, it is still unable to keep  pace with the development of the entire national economy.    He said that China hopes that all internationally known  corporations such as Exxon would take further steps to  strengthen cooperation with China in energy and petro-chemicals,  including the utilization of funds and advanced technologies of  these corporations.    He told Mr. Sitter that all the reform measures introduced  in  China have yielded significant results as shown in the increase  of state revenue, stable foreign exchanges rates, and rising  foreign exchange reserves.    It is rather normal that some problems may occur in the  course of reform, the Chinese vice-president said. What is most  important is discover and solve them by taking practicable  measures.    Lord Prior and Mr. Sitter came to China at the invitation of  the China International Trust and Investment Corporation and the  China National Petrochemical Corporation. Their corporations  are ready to conduct a new round of cooperation with Chinese  departments in the development of the power industry and the  exploration and development of land and offshore oil.</p>

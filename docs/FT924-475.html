			<p>921224 FT  24 DEC 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Prices volatile in thin conditions WIDE PRICE fluctuations in many commodity markets this week resulted from relatively modest buying and selling orders in thin, pre-Christmas conditions. The sharpest movement was gold's Dollars 4.85-a-troy-ounce drop over Monday and Tuesday, which traders said was initiated by selling from an individual US trade house. As the price slid towards a support level at Dollars 332 an ounce one dealer told the Reuter news agency that 'under normal circumstances the volume traded would not have moved the market so much'. The gold price was steadier yesterday, gaining 55 cents to Dollars 332.85 an ounce, but was still Dollars 4.30 down on the week so far. The platinum price followed a similar pattern, recovering Dollars 1.10 at yesterday's afternoon fixing to reach Dollars 359.60 an ounce, Dollars 3.90 below last Friday's level, while cash silver was six cents down overall at 370.5 cents an ounce. Most base metals markets at the London Metal Exchange presented a mirror image of the movements in the gold market, slipping back a little yesterday following strong gains earlier in the week. Copper was a case in point. Modest Chinese buying and worries about copper workers joining a Polish general strike were less influential than technical factors in the three months delivery position's Pounds 54.50 rise to Pounds 1,489.25 a tonne over the first two days, dealers said. Mr Ted Arnold, analyst at the Merrill Lynch financial services group, pointed to the profound effect commodity funds, managing about Dollars 26bn, were having on traded metals markets. 'These funds tend to work primarily on technical analysis,' he said. 'While the data bases for these averages go back for many years, the big weighting is put on the last two or three years of performance. So a metal like copper tends to look very 'cheap' on a moving average and technical basis when it gets down to 95 cents a lb.' Sterling's decline against the dollar had also contributed to the advance and yesterday it counteracted a modest retracement in dollar terms as most of the buying interest dried up and light Japanese selling weighed copper prices down. At the close the LME three months position was quoted at Pounds 1,490.50 a tonne, up Pounds 1.25 on the day and Pounds 55.75 on the week. The movement on the day worked out at a fall of Dollars 16.50 in terms of the US currency. Other metals following this pattern were zinc, up Dollars 9 on balance for three months delivery at Dollars 1,077.50 a tonne, after falling Dollars 2 yesterday; nickel, up a net Dollars 100 at Dollars 5,932.50 a tonne, after a Dollars 20 retracement; aluminium, up Dollars 5.25 at Dollars 1,249.50 a tonne, after a Dollars 10.25 fall; and lead, up Pounds 5 at Pounds 306.50 a tonne, after being trimmed by Pounds 4.75. The exception was tin, which continued upwards yesterday to close at Dollars 5,857.50 a tonne, up Dollars 116.50 from last Friday's level. Dealers explained that yesterday's Dollars 55 rise followed a firm overnight performance on the Kuala Lumpur market. They also noted that there had been interest in purchasing 'call' (buying) options at strike prices Dollars 240 to Dollars 340 above the present level. Signs of Christmas cheer on the London Futures and Options Exchange's coffee market evaporated yesterday when the gains that had taken nearby prices to 20-month highs were virtually wiped out. The March position closed on Tuesday at Dollars 1,081 a tonne, up Dollars 26 from last Friday, having been boosted by expectations of a lower crop in Brazil and tightness in Colombian exports. But the price opened sharply lower yesterday following a forecast by the US Department of Agriculture that Brazil's 1993-94 crop would rise to 27m bags (60 kg each) from 24m bags in 1992-93. As a wave of profit-taking was triggered further losses were registered and the March price touched bottom at Dollars 1,052 a tonne before support appeared. At the close the price was quoted at Dollars 1,060 a tonne, down Dollars 21 on the day but still Dollars 5 up on the week. Dealers suggested, however, that industry buying interest had been evident and should help to limit the scope for further losses. The overall uptrend remained intact, they said, and the setback should prove fairly shortlived. Some psychological support was expected at Dollars 1,050 but more significant chart-based backing should emerge around Dollars 1,040. Cocoa futures prices, which had started the week with a small decline, rallied on Tuesday and yesterday to reach Pounds 693 a tonne for March delivery, up Pounds 21 on balance. The main surge on Tuesday reflected covering against short positions, rather than fresh buying orders, dealers said. And they thought the scope for further gains would be limited by the knowledge that producer selling was likely to be attracted if March cocoa breached the Pounds 700-a-tonne mark.</p>

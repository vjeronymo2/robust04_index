			<p>930203 FT  03 FEB 93 / Changes urged in medical research NEW MEASURES are needed to translate advances in medical research into improved patient care, the government's Advisory Council on Science and Technology said yesterday. Acost identified a 'development gap' in the transfer of Britain's 'world class' medical research to improved treatments. 'Frustrated inventors contrast British industry's reluctance to pick up technology at an early stage, because of the risks involved, with the enthusiasm shown by US and Japanese manufacturers for new product ideas and for their willingness to invest for the long-term,' the council said. To bridge the gap, Acost wants the government to set up a Medilink programme that would channel public and private funds towards exploiting ideas from universities and the National Health Service. It would be an extension of the existing Link programme of collaborative research. Other recommendations from the Acost medical research and health committee, chaired by Dr Peter Doyle, ICI research director, include more training for scientists in the use of patents and an opt-out system for organ donation to increase the supply for transplantation.</p>

			<p>940321 FT  21 MAR 94 / European Press Review Bonn Not a newspaper in Germany, however small, has been able to resist commenting on yet another hiatus in relations between Bonn and Paris. Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, had obviously ruffled some feathers during the negotiations to get Norway into the European Union last week. The Berliner Zeitung dismissed Mr Kinkel's playground bully approach to international diplomacy, while the General Anzeiger in Bonn warned the foreign minister not to go round smashing 'foreign policy china'. The Wiesbadener Kurier even suggested that Mr Kinkel's fuse was shorter than usual because his party, the Free Democrats, had performed so miserably in the Lower Saxony elections last Sunday. Feathers had obviously been so ruffled that Mr Francois Scheer, the ambassador in Bonn, decided to share his concerns with a group of German correspondents. He told journalists the two neighbours should be consulting more often and that Mr Kinkel had been a bit rough with the Spaniards who were demanding more fish in return for Norway's accession. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, Germany's most august daily newspaper, then caused waves by quoting Mr Scheer and on Thursday morning the ambassador was summoned to explain himself. Among close friends ambassadors are rarely summoned as the Deutsche Tagespost at Wurzburg pointed out: 'That is a well-tried method when it comes to dealing with banana republics. It is unacceptable as a means of exchanging views between France and Germany.' But defending 'German interests and goals' often called for a more forthright manner as the Allgemeine Zeitung at Mainz wrote: 'For ages Germany was accused of behaving like a political dwarf. Is it not normal that it should be just as tenacious as other countries and should not constantly have the heavy burden of the past in its sights.' As in the past the strain in the Bonn-Paris axis is explained by uncertainties surrounding the government's move to Berlin. The Leipziger Volkszeitung, however, is convinced that 'with the exception of European separatists or Republicans there is the broadest possible consensus in this country about the continued expansion of Europe. Since this is undisputable, there is every reason to forcefully rebut charges that German politicians are apparently fickle or too brash when it comes to discussing Europe.' Overshadowing last week's diplomatic tussle are a series of celebrations to mark the collapse of Nazi Germany 50 years ago. 'Unavoidably there are renewed complaints about some sort of new German danger,' wrote the Bild Zeitung, Germany's biggest-selling tabloid. 'The momentary tensions between Bonn and Paris are a symptom of this nervousness. That's why Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Kinkel are required to use all the sensitivity they can muster to persuade our French neighbours that Germany will continue to be an equally dependable but also equally entitled partner.' The biggest of the anniversary celebrations will take place in July in Normandy, an event Chancellor Helmut Kohl long hoped he would be able to attend because it would do him a world of good to be seen rubbing shoulders at such a European event. Some German newspapers, including the Berliner Morgenpost, take a rather different view: 'You cannot simply change the significance of historical events,' it wrote. 'The invasion is a matter for the then victors, not something for Germany which lost. Were England and Germany to commemorate Waterloo, they would hardly invite France.'

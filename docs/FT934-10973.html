			<p>931103 FT  03 NOV 93 / CBI attacks EC clean-up proposals EUROPEAN COMMISSION proposals to impose stricter liability on businesses to pay for pollution damage drew strong fire from the UK yesterday. The Confederation of British Industry said they were 'ill-founded' and would only result in contaminated land being left derelict. Mr Howard Davies, director-general, said there was 'no case for harmonisation in this area'. The CBI attack came as it issued a 32-page report on environmental liability. It singled out an EC green paper issued last May which proposed that EC environmental law be harmonised because pollution crosses geographical borders. The green paper argued for strict liability that would make owners responsible for cleaning up contaminated land regardless of whether they had caused the damage. The CBI's stance was supported by Mr Tim Yeo, the environment minister. He said yesterday: 'I share the CBI's view that the EC role needs to be carefully regulated. I don't believe, on grounds of subsidiarity, that there should be harmonisation of EC policy, and the UK has responded to the European green paper saying that.' Both the CBI and Mr Yeo also oppose suggestions that environmental groups should have the right to take polluters to court. Mr Yeo said: 'It is important to limit the number of people who can bring civil action for loss. That would be a retrograde step.' The CBI said that the government and the EC should rule out any moves to create retrospective liability for pollution damage, or widen liability. Where the polluter could not be found, the clean-up would have to be paid for by a partnership between the public and private sectors, making use of regeneration grants. The CBI report was sharply criticised by environmental groups. Friends of the Earth said the CBI was 'expecting the public to pay for the clean up of its members' industrial pollution legacy. The public has the right to expect the government to ensure that the cost of cleaning up is borne by the polluter, not the polluted.' The commission and the European parliament will be holding joint hearings in Brussels today on the green paper when industry groups will put their points of view. Mr Humphrey Norrington, vice-chairman of Barclays, will be among those testifying. Although he will be lobbying on behalf of EC banks, the UK banking industry has been leading opposition to the EC proposals. Bankers fear that they would be made liable for pollution costs incurred by their borrowers. Mr Norrington said last night: 'Banks are keen to help their customers be good environmental citizens. But if the EC forces us into a straitjacket the result may be the exact opposite.' Haunted by heritage, Page 15</p>

			<p><P> February 3, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER CUTTING AID TO ISRAEL  </P> <P> Wilson's article contains numerous statements which require rebuttal.  </P> <P> He wrote, "The PLO opposes free elections because it does not want to surrender  its power and influence to elected representatives." This is simply untrue. The  PLO does support free and democratic elections which would be held under either  United Nations or Palestinian auspices and not Israeli government auspices as  proposed by the Shamir government.  </P> <P> Also, one may legitimately ask just how democratic elections can be when  candidates will be deported if they declare support for the PLO? (Shamir's  policy.) If Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega announced that he would deport  (to Miami) anyone who supported the Contras, then how many people would  consider those elections democratic?  </P> <P> Wilson wrote, "Egypt's acceptance in principle of the Baker plan reinforces  Israel's position that negotiations must be limited to the authentic civilian  leadership of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, which further isolates the  terrorist elements of the PLO from the search for a diplomatic resolution."  </P> <P> Perhaps the senator is unaware of the situation, but Egypt is negotiating on  behalf of the PLO. Egyptian agreement does not "in principle" reinforce Israeli  desire to eliminate the PLO from the negotiating process. Egypt's acceptance  was authorized by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and its acceptance was predicated  upon PLO participation. The Palestine National Council is the authentic  civilian leadership of the Palestinian people.  </P> <P> Wilson concluded his article by urging Americans to "unequivocally" support  Israel. If the senator believes that Americans should uncritically accept  Israeli policies, then the senator does a disservice to the American public.  Americans have the right and the obligation to question our government's  policies.  </P> <P> Americans should unequivocally support the creation of a free and democratic  Palestinian state, existing in peace along side of Israel, and which may become  model for the Arab people in their quest for democracy.  </P> <P> ARCH MILLER  </P> <P> Chair, Media Committee  </P> <P> American-Arab Anti-Discrimination  </P> <P> Committee, Los Angeles  </P></p>

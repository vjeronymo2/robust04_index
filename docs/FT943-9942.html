			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / World Bond Markets: Tokyo The weakening of the yen and increasing prospects of an imminent economic recovery prompted profit-taking ahead of the September book closing last week, and the yield on the No 164 10-year benchmark bond closed at a 14-month high of 4.63 per cent. Interest rates have started to discount a widening belief that economic recovery is under way. The long-term prime rate, the rate at which banks lend to first-tier clients, is expected to be raised by 20 to 30 basis points this week, while the recent rise in short-term interest rates may also cause banks to raise the short-term prime rate. Banks covering for the rise in funding demand from companies ahead of the September six-month book closing has pushed up three-month certificate of deposit rates. Some traders expect the central bank to prevent short-term rates from rising further by supplying funds to the money markets. Meanwhile, the emergence of brighter prospects for the economy has kept investors on the sidelines. Last month inter-dealer trading volume plunged 36.2 per cent from a month earlier as the likelihood of a discount rate cut diminished. Such low volumes may exacerbate price fluctuations this week, since the US Treasury auction could prompt a shift in funds from the Japanese bond market by overseas investors.</p>

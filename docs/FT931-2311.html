			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Paris gathers pace on hopes of new rate cuts - Alice Rawsthorn finds that optimism is returning At first glance the prospects for the Paris stock market are scarcely scintillating, given that a new government is poised to take power against a backdrop of high interest rates, a vulnerable currency, stagnant industrial output and a bad set of financial figures. However, the CAC-40 index, which was stubbornly static last year, has already risen by about 8 per cent this year. Most analysts are now confident that it will rise further during the rest of the year. 'We are more optimistic about France than all the other major European markets,' said Mr Richard Davidson, European equities strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. 'The CAC-40 index has moved ahead in the first few months of this year and we'd expect it to rise as high as 2,300 by the year end.' Analysts base their optimism on the expectation that the Bundesbank will continue its policy of steadily reducing German interest rates, thereby allowing the French conservatives, who seem certain to return to power after the final round of voting in the parliamentary elections on March 28, to follow suit. That should alleviate the pressure on the economy, enabling it to return to recovery in early 1994. At present France is under intense pressure because of the impact of high real interest rates - of about 8 per cent with bank base rates at 10 per cent and inflation running at 2.1 per cent - on consumer spending and industrial investment. During the first half of last year, many French companies were able to compensate thanks to buoyant growth in exports. When the franc strengthened after the September currency crisis, they found it much more difficult to compete in the international marketplace. A number of prominent French companies have recently reported 1992 results illustrating the negative impact of the strong franc. LVMH, the luxury goods group, this week confirmed a sharp fall in net profits partly because of adverse exchange rates. Renault almost doubled net profits to FFr5.7bn in 1992 but fell into the red in the final quarter of the year. Michelin and Peugeot-Citroen were also hit by the hard currency. Meanwhile, the precarious state of the property market and the sharp rise in business failures have aggravated the problems of many financial groups. GAN, one of the largest insurers, warned on Wednesday of a collapse in net profits from FFr2.3bn in 1991 to only FFr400m last year. That followed reports of falls in profits from both Union des Assurances de Paris and the Axa group. The banks are also in a sickly state, with the market now braced for a grim announcement from Credit Lyonnais, which has already disclosed that 1992 was its worst year for two decades. The rate of real GDP growth in France fell in the final quarter of last year for the first time since the Gulf war. The Bank of France's business surveys suggest that industrial output probably fell in January and stabilised in February. That raises the threat of a second successive quarterly fall in real GDP during the first three months of this year, which would mean that the economy was technically in recession. The stock market has already absorbed this gloomy news and is concerned more with the timing of future rate cuts, than with the present problems of French companies. 'Sooner or later French rates will fall - hence the buoyancy of the market,' concluded the latest analysis from Flemings Research. 'The outstanding issue is how much damage will be done to the economy in the meantime.' Most analysts are confident that the 'damage' will be limited. The corporate sector does, after all, have the underlying advantage of relatively low debt levels and industry is also reaping the benefits of the high levels of investment during the late 1980s. Moreover, France, thanks to the socialists' commitment to sustained low inflation, is likely to be able to make deeper interest rates cuts than other major economies. 'There is more leeway (in France) for an easing of long rates than in the other Group 5 countries,' said a recent report from Banque Indosuez in Paris. The critical question is whether the new centre-right government will be as zealous in its attachment to the franc fort strategy of protecting the French currency as the socialists. Most prominent conservatives have already made reassuring statements about the need to sustain a strong currency. There is, however, a possibility that the new administration could come under pressure from the chauvinistic RPR faction led by Mr Charles Pasqua and Mr Philippe Seguin, who championed the anti-Maastricht campaign in last autumn's referendum. That has triggered speculation that the next government might allow the franc to leave the ERM, if it comes under renewed market pressure. 'The franc will still be a strong currency even if it does leave the ERM,' said Mr Davidson of Morgan Stanley. 'There is a possibility of its floating for a while, but its true strength should then come out. It certainly isn't a negative influence over the market.'</p>

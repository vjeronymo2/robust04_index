A  diplomat from the North Korean Embassy in Vienna met with an  IAEA official in charge of the North Korean nuclear problem, but  did not present his country's position on the problem, he said.  The source said that he could not say there had been  significant progress.    The North Korean diplomat just listened to the IAEA's  position and opinion on the place and date for consultation on  when and how the IAEA will inspect the nuclear sites, and did  not say anything about Pyongyang's position, according to the  source.    The diplomat said that he would notify the IAEA of  Pyongyang's position after he received instructions, but given  that North Korea agreed to allow nuclear inspections earlier in  the day, detailed consultations between North Korea and the IAEA  will take place this week, the source said. He said he expected  progress toward inspection, including an agreement on a venue  for negotiations, to be made soon.    IAEA Spokesman Hans Meyer said that North Korea had not made  any proposal or given any notification about official contacts  or official consultations.    The IAEA's position was officially unchanged from the end of  1993 except that positive progress was being realized in the  North Korean-U.S. contacts, Meyer said.</p>

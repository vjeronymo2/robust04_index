			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> GOVERNOR CHANGES HIS TUNE ON LOAN  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian on Thursday said he may have been misinformed when he  recently allowed the state to risk $15 million in general fund money on an  unsecured loan to help with the construction of an Olympic Training Center in  Chula Vista.  </P> <P> The admission came after Deukmejian tried to explain why he decided last week  to veto as "unnecessary" special legislation requiring the San Diego National  Sports Training Foundation to put up collateral for the controversial loan,  which comes at a time when the state is cutting back drastically on social  services.  </P> <P> Deukmejian said he penciled out the provision because he had already been given  written assurances by the foundation that it would repay the loan. "And  negotiations for such a contract are under way," he said.  </P> <P> The governor allowed that he may have been under a false impression, however,  when reporters pointed out that the contract for the loan had been signed in  June, and that it doesn't require the foundation to offer security for the  deal.  </P> <P> A state official told The Times after the contract was made public that the  agreement was "unusual" and could lead to the state losing its money if the  foundation folded or walked away from the deal.  </P> <P> "That wasn't the information that I had," Deukmejian said. "My information is  that a contract has not yet been signed. . . . I don't have the right  information. If that's in fact so, I would like to see what that contract  says."  </P> <P> Asked what action he could take, Deukmejian said he couldn't rescind last  week's veto and that it would take new legislation to require the collateral  once again.  </P> <P> Reiterating his longstanding concerns that the loan be safe, Deukmejian said:  "I will take a look at it and see what it says, if in fact there is a contract,  see what it says, and I will want to be satisfied . . . that there is  sufficient guarantee that this money will be repaid."  </P> <P> Deukmejian's comments Thursday were his first since news about the unsecured  loan drew howls of protest this summer from a number of legislators who labored  over an austere state budget that cuts deeply into social programs.  </P> <P> The budget battle between Deukmejian and the Legislature dragged on 31 days  into the current budget year and was resolved after the governor cut $753  million from programs such as mental health and education.  </P> <P> One of those lawmakers, Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim), said Thursday he would  contact the governor's office to say he'd be "pleased" to reintroduce the  collateral requirement, which would have to be rushed through the Legislature  during its remaining three weeks before adjournment.  </P> <P> "I'm very heartened to hear that he wants the loan secured. That's more like  the George Deukmejian that I've known," said Seymour, who has lambasted the  arrangement as a "bad deal."  </P> <P> The controversial loan has raised eyebrows since last year, when foundation  officials won approval from the Legislature to borrow $5 million a year for the  next three years. Foundation backers, including shopping center magnate Ernie  Hahn, sought the money as part of its fund-raising efforts to build a  state-of-the-art, $60-million training center on the western shore of Lower  Otay Reservoir.  </P> <P> The bill, passed by lawmakers in the waning hours of the 1989 session,  originally stipulated that the money be repaid through the sale of specialized  license plates. Yet critics claimed the financing scheme was a "sham," and the  Department of Motor Vehicles estimated it would take 142 years to sell enough  plates to pay back the $15 million.  </P> <P> Taking heed, Deukmejian signed the loan bill only after extracting a written  promise from the foundation that it would repay the money if the license sales  went bust. He disclosed the promise in an unusual message accompanying the new  law.  </P> <P> Those assurances, however, did not translate into financial security when the  Department of Commerce subsequently negotiated the loan agreement with the  foundation. The contract had no requirement for collateral, and Jack Stewart,  the department's chief deputy director who negotiated the agreement, admitted  to The Times that it was a "very unusual" deal that put the state's money at  risk if the foundation went belly-up. Stewart was on vacation Thursday and  couldn't be reached for comment.  </P> <P> The revelation prompted Seymour and other legislators to insert special  language in this year's budget bill calling for "a letter of credit,  collateral, or other negotiable form of security" to cover the first $5 million  installment, which is supposed to be forwarded to the foundation by Dec. 31.  But, when the language reached Deukmejian's desk, he used his blue pencil to  cut it out of the law.  </P> <P> At Thursday's press conference, Deukmejian said the "reason I did it was at the  time that I signed that legislation, I issued a specific statement about that  bill in which I said at the time that I had received assurances in writing that  the organizations supporting this Olympic training center would enter into a  contract with the state to guarantee the payment of that money. And  negotiations for such contract are under way."  </P> <P> Told that a contract already exists with provisions for an unsecured loan,  Deukmejian said he may have been misinformed and that he wanted to see the  written agreement.  </P> <P> After the press conference, Deukmejian press secretary Bob Gore accepted  responsibility for Deukmejian's apparent misimpressions.  </P> <P> Gore said he "made a mistake" by telling the governor that the Department of  Commerce was still working on the deal, when in fact it was "working on getting  us a copy of the contract."  </P> <P> He also said the governor's office had not been tracking the legislative furor  over the training center loan. "The issue, on a global scale of things, didn't  register," he said. "There were a lot of other things to worry about. I didn't  know about the contract."  </P> <P> Hours later, Gore modified the story: Deukmejian knew about the June contract  all along. What the governor was referring to in the press conference was an  unfinished "addendum" that would require collateral from the foundation, he  said.  </P> <P> "There are, and have been, for the past three weeks, the negotiations the  governor referred to, discussions between the Department of Commerce to get  collateral, to guarantee the loan," said Gore. "The foundation realizes the  necessity to find collateral. What they're negotiating is an addendum to the  contract that will satisfy the governor's signing this."  </P> <P> But David Nielsen, foundation executive vice president, said Thursday that  there are no negotiations going on, and that the nonprofit group will approach  the state in several weeks with an offer for collateral -- an offer prompted by  the legislative outcry, and not from Deukmejian's office.  </P> <P> "We always felt that we had a legally binding agreement with the Department of  Commerce," said Nielsen. "On the other hand, we heard the concerns that were  expressed and felt that we should respond to them."  </P></p>

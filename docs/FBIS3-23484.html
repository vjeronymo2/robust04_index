			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] [passage omitted] A team of Metropolitan Police  searched a shophouse in Bang Kapi where they found another steel  water tank, 25 sacks of fertilizer, electrical wiring and 50  other items believed used in assembling the bomb.    Police said the investigators were led to the three-story  shophouse by a water tank shop on Ramkhamhaeng Road whose  address was on the side of the bomb found on board a rented  truck in front of the Lumphini Police Station on Thursday.  [passage omitted]    Police said they questioned staff at the water tank shop who  confirmed they had delivered two tanks to a house on Sukhaphiban  Road at the order of a foreign buyer.    Police said they found a receipt which showed the fertilizer  had been ordered from a shop in Thon Buri.    The shop had been rented to a Mideast-looking man who spoke  Thai about four months ago, police said.    Metropolitan Police Commissioner Chaiyasit Kanchanakit said  investigators have identified the Mideast-looking man who drove  the truck and rented the shophouse.    He said the man had rented the house since August last year  and had transferred money to the house owner to pay for the rent  from a province in the South.    Interpol has already been contacted to look for the man who  might have left the country, he said.    Up to four foreigners lived in the house, he said, but the  landlord believed they had now left Thailand.    Pol. [Police] Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said, based on the contents  and materials used to make the bomb and the items found  yesterday at the house, police and intelligence agencies decided  the terrorists belonged to the same group which exploded a bomb  at the World Trade Center in New York.    The bomb used at the World Trade Center on February 26 last  year was said to be made of the same concoction known among U.S.  Federation Bureau of Investigation agents as a "witches' brew".  [passage omitted]    Chaiyasit said he was "50 percent" sure the terrorists are  still in the Kingdom. [passage omitted]    He said the information given by the owner of the truck, the  water tank shop staff and the motorcyclist indicates the  Mideast-looking man who rented the truck and bought the water  tanks was the same person.    The man communicated with his hands and spoke both English  and Arabic.    Pol. Lt. Gen. Chaiyasit said he was confident there was more  than one, probably three to four, people involved in the plot  and they would have had to have been in the country for some  time because the person who drove the truck appeared to know  Bangkok's roads.    Police Director-General Pratin Santipraphop said he believed  at least two Mideast-looking men were involved in an  international plot to blow up the Israeli Embassy.    But the names of the two suspects are still unknown and it  is  not sure if they are still in Thailand, he said.    Pol. Gen. Pratin. said police yesterday searched several  areas of Bang Mot and Ramkhamhaeng in search of the suspects.  [passage omitted]    A Syrian tourist, Mohammad Hazamail, 35, was detained at his  rented room at Phetchaburi Apartment yesterday by Immigration  police and taken immediately to Lumphini police station for  questioning and identification by the motorcyclist.    The man was released later after being cleared. [passage  omitted]</p>

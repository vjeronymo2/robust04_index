			<p><P> June 2, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE;  </P> <P> PEOPLE RIDE ON SATURDAYS TOO  </P> <P> If the board of the Orange County Transit District was wondering what its  ridership thought of a proposal to discontinue door-to-door dial-a-ride service  on Saturdays, it got its answer at a recent hearing. More than a dozen blind or  wheelchair-bound supporters of the service turned out to protest the idea.  </P> <P> Some of them, by the way, arrived by dial-a-ride.  </P> <P> The idea of cutting such service back on Saturdays may make some sense to bean  counters, but it doesn't make much sense for people who have to rely on it  seven days a week.  </P> <P> The service serves about 1.4 million people a year in Orange County, about 3%  of the total district ridership. Anyone can ride the vans by appointment, but  the service is subsidized for the elderly and disabled. But on Saturday, there  are about 1,000 riders now. That's a lot.  </P> <P> The idea of cutting out that day was prompted by a desire to make the service  more cost-effective. The board asked its staff to come up with some proposals  and received a recommendation to drop Saturday service and add an hour to the  weeknight operations. The Saturday program was, the reasoning went, the least  efficient of the services.  </P> <P> But what the board heard from its riders is that the elderly and disabled who  use the service are just like the rest of the transit district ridership: They  have jobs to go to and errands to run on Saturdays.  </P> <P> What a bad idea. The board heard the message, and now will decide at its June  18 meeting what to do. It ought to keep Saturday service for the disabled and  elderly, with the understanding that such service is essential.  </P></p>

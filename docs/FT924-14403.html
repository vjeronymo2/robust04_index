			<p>921009 FT  09 OCT 92 / International Company News: L'Oreal confident of continuing advance L'OREAL, the French company which is the world's largest cosmetics group, yesterday announced that it had continued its profits growth during the first half of the year. The company - with brands such as Lancome, Ambre Solaire and Giorgio Armani perfume - saw pre-tax profits rise by 16 per cent to FFr2.2bn (Dollars 456m) in the first six months of this year. It said it anticipated further profits growth at a similar rate during the second half. L'Oreal, which has recently been building up its interests in pharmaceuticals to complement its existing business in cosmetics, hair care and fragrances, saw sales rise by 15.8 per cent to FFr19.9bn during the interim period. The group's sales increased at the slightly slower pace of 10.4 per cent on a strictly comparable basis. L'Oreal said yesterday that its first-half sales had been inflated by the recent acquisition of two laboratories, Delagrange and Delalande, by its Synthelabo pharmaceuticals subsidiary. Although L'Oreal was confident that it would be able to maintain profits growth at its present level in the second half, it said that the increase in sales might be slightly slower. One of the main planks of L'Oreal's expansion strategy in the 1980s was to move into more upmarket product areas. L'Oreal two years ago took a 50 per cent stake in Orcofi, a consortium of luxury goods companies which is run as a joint venture with the Recamier family. Orcofi next week is staging a lavish relaunch for Lanvin, the Paris fashion house intended to be the linchpin of its portfolio. Lanvin, which is being relaunched at a time when the global luxury goods market is under enormous pressure, has so far produced sizeable losses for the Orcofi partners, including L'Oreal.</p>

Boris Nikolayevich, you have said repeatedly that  you are prepared to take account of the results of the election  campaign - the elections which took place on 12 December - and  the voters' mood in your domestic policy measures. Do you  intend to make any adjustments in your foreign policy,  particularly in relations with the United States?    [Yeltsin] I believe that our relations with the United  States  are developing in a very stable, precisely coordinated fashion,  and in a manner that truly befits partners. However, there will  of course be a certain adjustment, especially with regard to the  social sphere. We consider that, in contrast to Vancouver, we  will not bank on the humanitarian sphere and direct social aid.  That is our business. What we are asking the American side to  do is to open up the American market, to lift restrictions, to  help us with our debts, to assist in supporting reforms by  helping with the conversion of military enterprises, and so on.  We are not asking for direct social aid, because the people of  the United States themselves need such social support. It would  be simply frivolous to help with unemployment in Russia without  guaranteeing employment in their own country.    We think therefore that this is our affair, and from these  forms of support, the restructuring of the debt, the structure  of changes in the economy, we will begin to look for some kind  of social guarantees for our working people in order to reduce  poverty, the level of poverty that exists in our country today.    [Gautness] Helen Gautnuss. Do you mean that you are going to  retreat from shock therapy a little, to act slightly more  moderately in order to help people?    [Yeltsin] No, we shall continue to act in a resolute manner  when it comes to reform, and in this respect the President of  the United States is agreeable to support such a course.    [Clinton] Could I respond just briefly to the last two  questions from my perspective? I commend President Yeltsin for  his adherence to continuing the path of economic reforms. If  you look at 1993 as compared to 1992, if you consider to what  extent the deficit was reduced as a percentage of gross income,  if you consider how inflation fell and money stabilized, I think  that very good progress has been made in work on including the  Russian economy into the global economic system. We had very  long talks about what can be done, what kind of assistance the  United States could provide to recognize that there are certain  difficulties connected with these changes, and to let the  Russian people know that efforts are being made to solve these  questions.    But I also have to tell you that I believe that people  (?will  see the benefits) they could not see last year. This year, as  investments and trade grow and people in the world see that the  president is tackling this issue seriously, I think that  advantages will be created. This is linked to developing a  system of social support and job training, and all this should  be created. I think that this will be a great help in many  respects.    In addition, I would like to say in response to your  question  that, in my view, President Yeltsin has been, it appears,  criticized in some quarters for relations with America, the  implication being that we are somehow trying to direct the  course of Russian policy. This is not true. The people of  Russia themselves should determine their future. The only thing  I would like to do is to say that if we share common values, a  vision of the future, dreams of political and economic freedom,  and respect for neighboring countries, I would like to be an  equal partner because I believe that this is a great country,  and that the whole world -- and Europe in particular -- are  interested in Russian reforms succeeding. So I must say that  our relationships with Russia have been absolutely correct all  this time, although some people are trying to characterize them  wrongly.    I have come here as a friend and partner. We have our own  problems in the country, [passage indistinct]. We should be  partners and Russia should determine its own future.    [ITAR-TASS correspondent Sizov] I have a question to both  presidents. During the Brussels visit the Russian president and  the Russian side addressed NATO and the United States with a  request to exert more influence on Ukraine over the issue of  nuclear weapons. How far have Russia's hopes been justified with  the signing of agreements just now at the talks which have taken  place in Moscow with the president of Ukraine? Thank you.    [Yeltsin] Well, I think our hopes have been justified  extremely quickly. Today an agreement was signed with Ukraine  on the destruction of all nuclear weapons in Ukraine and on  their transportation to Russia to be destroyed there. Of  course, as concerns the uranium, we should offer compensation  and give fuel uranium for weapon-grade uranium. We agree with  this, since we will also be processing weapon-grade uranium into  fuel uranium with American help.    Given that an agreement was signed today on uranium, I  believe that today the agreement with Ukraine, the trilateral  agreement signed by the three presidents, is a historic decision  in which not only Russia but the United States, and U.S.  President Bill Clinton personally, have played a major role.    [Clinton] I am fully satisfied with this agreement. I want  to compliment President Kravchuk again because I believe he has  really shown great interest in obtaining security for his  country, which has become stronger and which after this  agreement will become stronger economically over the next years,  due to the fact that investors will support this decision to be  a non-nuclear state. Just like [passage indistinct] this was,  after all, President Yeltsin's proposal that we establish this  trilateral process. I have enjoyed working on this, we worked  on it intensly, Vice President Gore worked on it, and of course  our whole team worked on it. I assure you that I will  personally continue to work on this intensly. I think that a  strong and independent Ukraine is very important for the  creation of an integrated Europe, which we are working on in our  partnership.    [Unidentified correspondent in English] A question for both  presidents. President Yeltsin, you have undertaken today, and  President Clinton has agreed, to encourage and continue economic  reforms on a large scale, but time demands that institutions be  created which can soften the effects of these reforms. The last  elections showed that 15 percent of those elected support this  policy. How can this policy be continued, bearing in mind the  opposition there will be in parliament? President Clinton,  without direct aid, what can international institutions do to  help President Yeltsin?    [Yeltsin] First of all I do not agree with your figures that  15 percent of Russians support the reforms; that is not true,  absolutely not true. It is necesary to see how people voted for  the Constitution. The Constitution is the support for the  reforms, not individual personalities, not voting for individual  parties and blocs, but voting for the Constitution which  determines the future of Russia and its reform. This is where  the citizens of Russia determined their choice, and that was  around 60 percent.    As regards support by world institutions: We talked about  this. Incidentally we discussed about 30 or more issues --  internal issues, Russian ones, U.S. ones, bilateral relations,  international relations, and so on, security issues -- a large  spectrum of issues. And I believe that, of course, the fact that  a package was adopted in Tokyo, and that unfortunately the G-7  has a very inert attitude toward implementing this decision --  this is the main thing. [sentence as heard]    Bill Clinton has personally fulfilled his obligations, what  he promised in Vancouver. He has practically handed over the  first package -- 1.6 billion. The second package of  approximately the same amount, which is passing through  Congress, will also be provided in 1994 and 1995. As regards  the pledges of the G-7, the seven countries, here unfortunately  the situation is significantly more complicated. They made a  decision, but there has only been minimum implementation. This  pains me, and it also pains my friend, Bill Clinton.    [Clinton] Let me respond to your question. I think it is  important to tell you what we are doing. First of all, the  agreement on uranium is extremely important. It guarantees a  steady stream of commercial...[pauses] It is a business deal.  It guarantees that money will be received each year for a long  time to come. Now in addition to that, I have asked for $900  million in aid from the 1995 budget, and if you take that  together with the 2.5 billion in the second package for all the  republics of the former Soviet Union -- most of it will go to  Russia -- there will be more than a billion dollars in aid in  each of the next two years.    In addition, we have reached agreement with the G-7  countries  on a number of other things which I think will help as well. We  are opening an office here headed by an American, a G-7 office  to make sure that all the commitments involved are complied  with. We are going to work toward trying to get the funds -- I  am confident we will -- to Russia's energy customers, so that  they can pay their bills for the energy that Russia is  providing. It is a business deal that will give them a  considerable amount of money.    We offer technical assistance, all that the president has  requested, and we are trying to help to provide for social  services, [word indistinct] scenario, and the program for staff  training in order to soften the negative consequences of  reforms. This week we are again starting to allocate money  [words indistinct] to the fund for the development of small  enterprises. I would also like to stress that the willingness of  President Yeltsin to continue along the path of economic  reforms, it seems to me, is viewed positively by the  international financial institutions. This will make it  possible to free billions of dollars of assistance within the  next couple of months for investments.    Following Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown's visit in  March, there will be a significant increase in trade and  investments on the part of the United States. So we intend to  work very hard on this. It seems to me that this will affect  [word indistinct] the citizen of Russia. The point is that  there is always a gap between the time when a decision is made  and the time when people can actually feel the effect of this  decision on their lives. This is exactly what I was trying to  explain during my walkabout yesterday while shaking hands with  Muscovites. All of us who care very much about the potential of  this country and the greatness of this country must be  interested in this. I think that all this will be felt in the  life of the average Russian citizen. I think that this will  have a significant effect in the next few years.    [Unidentified correspondent] Vesti, Russian television.  Millions of Russian viewers are watching us and smiling. Boris  Nikolayevich, I have a question for you. Taking into account  the composition of the new Russian Parliament, can one envisage  certain problems with the ratification of agreements and accords  signed with Western partners? It might be that the Parliament  will toughen its foreign policy. Do you, as president of the  Russian Federation, feel that the situation restricts and  complicates your relations with the United States and its allies  in the face of this fact?    [Yeltsin] I do not think we have that sort of Parliament.  This Parliament is wiser, more intellectual, and more  experienced. I believe that the upper chamber will, generally  speaking, pursue the line taken by the president and the  Government, while the State Duma will gradually reach that  position and realize that to drag out and fail to ratify major  international treaties and agreements -- such as that concerning  the destruction of chemical weapons and so on -- is simply to  show disrespect for their own people. I also hope that the  members of Parliament will remember, as I said in my message,  that they are envoys of the people and that the people have told  them how they ought to behave. They ought to conduct themselves  with a high standard of political culture. Of course, our  parliamentary system is young, but I believe nevertheless that  it will operate constructively.    [Bennett] Nancy Bennett from AP. President Clinton, what are  your impressions after experiencing Moscow firsthand? What is  your assessment of the threat the ultra-nationalist movement  poses to the movement for democracy?    [Clinton] Well, those who are in the Parliament are, after  all, there as a result of democracy. I think these are two  separate things, because you have to respect the democratic  process and in every democratic process no one is satisfied with  the outcome of all elections, I can tell you that. In that  sense, I do not think they present a threat to the democratic  process. Now I think what is happening here is that Russia,  which is and has been a very great country for a very long time,  is doing what countries are required to do at some point or  other -- I mean redefining what greatness means and creating a  vision for the future. When times are difficult, and the  Russian people have been through some difficult times, there are  always, in every age and time, people who can generate some  support by defining greatness in terms of the past. But in the  end, the only people who achieve real success are those who  define greatness in terms of the future. That is why I believe  that the reformist movement will prevail. If you look at the  nature of the global economy, and if you look at the processes  that move and change people's lives, I think history has always  sided with the reformers. I also believe what would happen is  that you can have some interesting discussions in that Duma, and  I keenly follow the news at the moment. It is nice to be in a  place where some other president is having problems with his  parliament. [laughter]    President Yeltsin has made an important point here: When  these issues are discussed, and when you move from the rhetoric  of the campaign, which is always abstract, to the real problems  of real people, there is a possibility of a new consensus  emerging. The only thing that I would say to all the people in  this new Duma is that you have enormous opportunities and  responsibility. You are the first ones in your country to be  elected constitutionally and democratically. You must be ready  to listen to Russia and to tackle issues. I would not think  that America and other countries should dramatize it. I think  it is a start of a great and exiting path, and we should wish  you all the best and see what happens.    [Moderator Kostikov] The protocol circumstances force us to  reduce the time of the news conference. So, one last question  each from the Russian and American sides. Go ahead, Markov,  RIA-Novosti.    [Markov] Vladimir Markov, Russian Information  Agency-Novosti.  I would like you to make your point of view, Boris Nikolayevich,  and yours, President Clinton, more specific as regards the  latest decisions of the NATO Council on the possible eventual  entry of other states into the organization, particularly those  that are contiguous with Russia. Do you see the possibility of  Russia itself ever joining NATO, and on what terms?    [Yeltsin] I think that the initiative of President Bill  Clinton and some Europeans not to accept anyone into NATO  country by country, but to declare everyone partners in order to  preserve peace and security, is a good formula, since drawing  one more line, dividing once again into black and white as the  saying goes, is no good. It is another matter that the moment  will come, at some time, when possibly both Russia and all the  others will unite, but precisely together, in one packet as  people say, and that will then ensure security for everyone. I  am also against dismemberment one by one, and for that reason I  very actively support the initiative of the U.S. President as  regards Partnership for Peace.    [Clinton] The whole idea behind the Partnership for Peace  was  to develop a post-Cold War mechanism for countries that share  the same commitments -- in this case a commitment to respect the  territorial borders of their neighbors, a commitment to civilian  control over the military, a commitment to joint planning and  training and military exercise -- that these countries could  work together aiming towards eventual NATO membership, if they  so wish, and if that is the direction that appears to be the  best for security of the post-Cold War world. That is, NATO  members clearly foresaw this possibility of such an expansion,  but this Partnership for Peace is a real thing now, and even now  we are inviting everyone, we have invited all the former Soviet  republics, all the Warsaw Pact nations and the other non-NATO  members in Europe, to be part of the Partnership for Peace.    All were told that this would also lead to eventual  membership in NATO, but our objective is to create for the first  time in the history of nation states, an undivided, united  Europe, united around political freedom, economic freedom,  military cooperation and respect for one another's borders --  something that has never happened before. I think we share that  vision, and I think that we have a particular responsibility to  work towards that vision.    [Moderator Kostikov] This will be the last question. Rita  Braver, CBS.    [Braver] President Clinton, did you discuss the subject of  Bosnia and what was the nature of this discussion? Does  President Yeltsin agree with NATO's stated intention of carrying  out air strikes if the situation does not improve in Sarajevo  and Bosnia?    [Clinton] First I asked the NATO representatives, my NATO  colleagues, to discuss this question with great precision. I  want to describe with great precision what they voted for. They  voted to reaffirm that air strikes could be considered if  Sarajevo is in very great danger, in the sense that the United  Nations is unable to work in Bosnia, if the United Nations is  unable to work in Sarajevo, if there are no hospitals, if there  is no humanitarian aid, medicines, and so on. They voted to ask  the armed forces to consider what can be done on the basis of  the air force in order to help the transfer of troops from  Srebrenica and the opening of Tuzla for humanitarian aims.    I would like to stress this because there is great  understanding and a resolution directly aimed at creating a  peace treaty for Bosnia. All of this is aimed at helping the UN  mission and also to preserve people's lives until the sides  conclude measures.    I think that I should probably allow President Yeltsin to  speak for himself about what NATO has done with regard to  Bosnia. We have different points of view on Bosnia. Yesterday  evening we discussed whether there is anything else our sides  can do independently or together to put an end to this conflict;  that is, we want people to stop killing each other and conclude  a sensible peace under which they can live normally, even if  just for their children's sake. We did not reach any final  results. Quite a frank conversation took place and several  things were said and I think that we can work together.    A more detailed account may give rise to a central hope. I  think that we had a very honest and frank conversation. [passage  indistinct] It is very important because these air strikes have  become a sort of psychological test. NATO enumerated three  possible spheres of military actions. All of this aimed at  helping the UN mission. This cannot, in the final analysis,  resolve the conflict. The NATO leaders said that in the final  analysis the sides must, themselves, reach agreement on this.  President Yeltsin and I discussed whether we can do anything to  help a possible decision. We reached no final results but a  basis was created for further discussions.    [Moderator Kostikov] Thank you, gentlemen, the news  conference is over. Thank you. Goodbye.    [Clinton] Boris said he agreed with my characterization of  our conversation.    [Yeltsin] If you are dissatisfied because I did not reply,  well, in the first place, you put your question to President  Clinton and not to me. But to touch on my opinion, then we  really did have a discussion. There are some differences  between us but, as I said in my speech, we are not in agreement  on everything and everywhere. We really do have differences, but  the most important thing is that there was goodwill, there was  partnership to find common decisions, and I believe that we  shall find common decisions. Thank you.</p>

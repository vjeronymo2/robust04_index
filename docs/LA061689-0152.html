			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> GENERAL REBUFFS LIKUD ON UPRISING  </P> <P> Israel's chief of staff, in his strongest rebuff to right-wing politicians  demanding a military solution to the Palestinian uprising, has said that only  mass deportation, starvation or genocide can stop the revolt.  </P> <P> Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron's remarks, broadcast today, followed growing calls from  Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's Likud Party for the army to crush the  18-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.  </P> <P> "People ask why we don't end the intifada (uprising)," Shomron told businessmen  in a speech in Ashkelon on Thursday night. "Anyone who wants to end the  intifada must remember that there are only three ways to achieve this --  transfer, starvation or physical elimination -- that is, genocide."  </P> <P> Likud strongman Ariel Sharon, who masterminded Israel's 1982 invasion of  Lebanon, is demanding that the uprising be crushed before Israel allows  Palestinians to hold elections to choose peace negotiators.  </P></p>

			<p>931022 FT  22 OCT 93 / Brussels pushes through regional aid share-out THE European Commission yesterday pushed through the main part of its share-out to member states from the Ecu157bn (Pounds 121.8bn) regional aid budget for 1994-99, overriding last minute protests from Ireland and complaints from Italy. Brussels also warned the UK again that it stood to lose 'a significant amount' of its entitlement of aid from the 1989-93 budget, because of failure to observe obligatory requirements to match EC funds with equivalent sums from the national budget. Yesterday's decision came after overnight meetings between Mr Dick Spring, the Irish foreign minister, Commission president Jacques Delors, and Mr Bruce Millan, EC regional policy commissioner. Dublin accused Mr Delors of going back on his word to guarantee Ireland IPounds 7.8bn (Pounds 7.4bn) from the new structural aid programme. Nevertheless, the Commission yesterday allocated Ireland IPounds 7.2bn - the lower end of the band discussed at marathon meetings of the EC council of ministers last July, when Ireland had threatened to veto the whole programme. Mr Millan said yesterday: 'I think we've got a very fair and equitable distribution here.' He pointed out that the Commission was obliged to share out the money on objective criteria, like population, income per head, unemployment levels and size of rural workforce. Ireland, which under the last aid programme received twice as much per capita as the three other poorest EC member states, Spain, Portugal and Greece, was getting 'extremely good figures', he insisted. But he held out hope for higher allocations for Ireland, announcing there would be a mid-term review, which could reallocate funds from member states whose aid programmes were performing badly, to those who were making best use of the EC finance. Ireland, he acknowledged, 'is a very good performer'. Italy, one of the worst performers under the Ecu63bn programme for 1989-93, got a new allocation of Ecu14.9bn, or Ecu1.9bn less than it was expecting. The funds allocated yesterday were for 'Objective 1' or backward regions, which overall receive Ecu93bn of the structural aid budget. In 1992 prices, Spain got around Ecu38bn, Greece and Portugal more than Ecu19bn, Germany nearly Ecu14bn for its eastern Lander, and France and the UK over Ecu2bn each. The UK allocation for Objective 1 areas, for Northern Ireland, Merseyside and the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, came out at Ecu2.36bn for 1994-99, in 1994 prices, at the top end of expectations. But Mr Millan said he was concerned Britain would not be be able to take up its full entitlement under the current programme because of the continuing dispute over how the UK accounts for the money. 'That situation will have to be remedied very quickly,' he said, otherwise the money will be lost by the end of the year. He also confirmed that the UK was in danger of losing 'a fairly large sum of money' it could seek from the European Social Fund for retraining the unemployed, because it had failed to claim in line with devalued pounds following sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism last year. Mr Millan would not put figures on the UK's unclaimed allocation but said 'there is still a significant amount to be claimed before the end of the year'. By contrast, much higher amounts unclaimed by Italy  - because of a failure to come forward with plausible projects  - had been reprogrammed into projects which were successful.</p>

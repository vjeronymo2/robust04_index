Boris Kakubava, who had been elected to the Georgian  parliament by the population of the Abkhaz region, said that the  Union of Liberation of Abkhazia, headed by him, did not wish to  confront the current Georgian authorities. That was why the  union was not planning protest rallies on the eve of the  official visit to Georgia by the Russian President Boris  Yeltsin; although, after Boris Yeltsin's departure these rallies  would undoubtedly be held if Georgian authorities failed to meet  the following demands worked out by the union:    a. By no means should Russian or any other country's armed  formations be brought into the territory of the Abkhaz region.    b. Russian armed formations currently stationed in the  Abkhaz region should leave the territory of the Georgian  Republic.    c. The Russian-Georgian border on the river Psou should  be restored.    d. Russia should admit her participation in the war  against Georgia and repent for the crime.    e. Beginning of the negotiations with the Gudauta  authorities should be considered as a serious mistake by the  Georgian authorities, and a vote of no confidence should be  passed in the entire Georgian delegation at the Geneva talks.    f. The status of Abkhazia within the composition of  Georgia should be decided in the process of working out  Georgia's new constitution.</p>

			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Romania to ease currency controls Romania is easing regulations on companies' hard currency holdings and is planning to devalue the leu by about 25 per cent in the next few weeks, the national bank has announced, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest. At the same time, the government yesterday cut subsidies on many basic foods and electricity, pushing up prices sharply, while cushioning the blow with limited pay rises and cash handouts. The new currency measures are part of a package of economic reforms drawn up with the help of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. They were designed to clear a backlog of import payments, restore the confidence of the business community and encourage foreign investment, Mr Mugur Isarescu, governor of the national bank, said.</p>

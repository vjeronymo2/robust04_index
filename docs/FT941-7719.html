			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / International Company News: Matsushita Electric sees fall Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics company, said yesterday that it is giving its wholly-owned subsidiary NL Finance a grant of Y80bn (Dollars 753m) to help reduce its interest burden arising from bad loans, writes Our Financial Staff. A further Y100bn will be made available to the subsidiary in the form of soft loans. The grant has forced Matsushita to cut its 1993 - 94 group pre-tax profit forecast to Y120bn against Y168.35bn in 1992 - 93. Net profit is expected to fall by 44 per cent on turnover down 7 per cent. The company reported a 3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the three months to end-December to Y47.1bn. NL Finance was set up in March 1992 to take over the loans of another Matsushita unit, National Leasing. Its current loan book totals Y340bn. TDK, the Japanese magnetic tape and components manufacturer, suffered a 46 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y5.1bn in the three months to December, from Y9.49bn for the same period a year earlier, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo. Net profit was 62 per cent lower at Y1.94bn, compared with Y5.06bn, on sales of Y116.54bn, 15 per cent down on the year-earlier figure of Y136.52bn.</p>

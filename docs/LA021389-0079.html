			<p><P> February 13, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TOWARD EQUALITY;  </P> <P> EXPLORING A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE;  </P> <P> AN ESSAY BY BOB BAKER;  </P> <P> QUESTIONS FOR A DEMON WITHIN  </P> <P> What burns inside us? Why can't we watch the Big Spin without somebody  alongside us commenting dourly about the number of Spanish-speaking winners?  Why can't we watch a professional basketball game without someone alongside us  feeling obligated to mention that everyone on the court is black? Why, after so  many painful decades of introspection about prejudice and racism and  discrimination, does the awful self-consciousness remain?  </P> <P> Wasn't it supposed to eventually dissipate, this awareness of skin color and  the monstrous little acts it produces? Wasn't there eventually supposed to be a  generation so sensitized to the evils of discrimination that it would train  itself to stamp out the demon inside all souls that finds something wrong in  all that is different? Wasn't Los Angeles -- the new Ellis Island, teeming with  so many racial and ethnic cross-currents, so many new faces, so many people  starting over -- supposed to become the kind of place where the old demon died,  where it was harder to be racially conscious because there were so many races?  </P> <P> Not yet. The demon lives. It lurks in new ways.  </P> <P> In the civil rights era everyone knew what discrimination was. It was being  refused lunch or a job or a ballot. It was black and white because it was  written in black and white. Now it is written, with equal force, that there can  be no discrimination, not for any reason, and we take comfort in the knowledge  that much of the discrimination has died.  </P> <P> Our comfort blinds us to the fact that much of the prejudice that fueled the  discrimination of old lives on. We have made it easier to ignore the fact that  hatred continues to percolate from generation to generation, flaring like an  evil genie.  </P> <P> An Arab-American businessman finds racial graffiti on his building. A UCLA  teacher of Chinese descent walking on campus hears two white male students yell  a racial epithet at her and tell her, "Go home!" A Jewish teen-ager who asks  other boys why they wear the symbol of a fish to proclaim their Christianity is  ridiculed and showered with pennies.  </P> <P> It happens, a handful of acts of overt violence but mostly defacement and  insults. We tell ourselves it does not happen often enough to be regarded as a  social problem. After all, how often do we see these sorts of things? They are  rarely reported to police or to the county Human Relations Commission, which  each year releases a report of perhaps 200 incidents of racial and religious  vandalism and violence.  </P> <P> Isolated incidents, we tell ourselves. Anecdotes, not stuff of a pattern. Amid  all the non-racial violence that confronts Los Angeles, discrimination seems  trifling. After all, no one is being lynched. How concerned must we be? Look at  what passes for racism these days, we tell ourself. Does it matter -- does it  truly matter -- if a few feelings are hurt because the winning entry at a Long  Beach sand sculpture contest features a caricature of a grinning Chinese man  emerging from the other side of the Earth, with the title, "Wrong Beach."  </P> <P> Yes, it matters.  </P> <P> It matters because each tiny abrasion that we produce as we rub against people  of different backgrounds is an unrepairable tear in the fabric of society. It  matters because each incident gives implicit permission for another to follow.  It matters because children hear these things and feel them, and the argument  that no law has been broken by a racial joke or a racial slight does not make  up for the spirit that has been broken.  </P> <P> Discrimination in Los Angeles in 1989 is not fire hoses in Selma, Ala., in  1964. It is the woman speaking Chinese who cannot catch the right bus because  the driver, pressured by a schedule to keep, just shakes his head and closes  the door. It is the Mexican-American comedian who recognizes that his career  depends on telling jokes that allow Anglo audiences to laugh at Latinos and  confides that he sometimes feels like a guard at Auschwitz, just doing his job,  a job that involves inadvertently tearing another small crack in the wall of  racial dignity. It is a black woman who moves into a middle-class white  neighborhood and is so conditioned to expect the worst that it takes her months  to stop suspecting racists behind every shrub. It is the Asian teen-ager who  has become philosophical beyond her years. "Like, America is mixed, right?" she  asks rhetorically. "But I don't think it's going to be one nation. People don't  try to be like one."  </P> <P> Some people do. In one Los Angeles classroom, a Korean student from Paraguay  gives answers in Spanish to a companion from El Salvador while a Romanian  immigrant student asks a Mexican teacher's assistant how to say don't forget in  Spanish. At a gas station, an Armenian man in oil-stained coveralls who prides  himself on speaking not merely his native tongue but English, Spanish, Turkish,  Farsi, French and Italian sees a Spanish-speaking woman approach him and asks  in heavily Middle-Eastern-accented Spanish, "How may I help you?"  </P> <P> The stories you are about to read are largely undramatic. Nobody dies. In a lot  of cases, nobody even cries. Mostly they ache, and they wonder about life's  cruelties, and they sigh and go on with their lives, each time a little more  guardedly, each time a little more skeptically. They never forget the demon.  </P> <P> Nor should any of us.  </P></p>

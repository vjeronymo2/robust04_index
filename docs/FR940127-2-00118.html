Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In its filing with the Commission, OCC included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. OCC has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The purpose of the proposed rule change is to amend OCC's By-Laws and Rules to accommodate cash-settled foreign currency options such as have been proposed for trading by the PHLX. In general, these amended By-Laws and Rules will apply the same procedures OCC currently uses to clear and settle transactions in existing options to the clearance and settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options. However, unlike OCC's procedures with respect to other foreign currency options, cash-settled foreign currency options will be settled by requiring clearing members to pay to or receive from OCC the amount of U.S. Dollars that reflects the difference between the spot price <FOOTCITE>4</FOOTCITE>  and the exercise price of the underlying foreign currency. <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  Cash-settled foreign currency options that are in-the-money by any amount on the expiration date will be automatically exercised. Options not automatically exercised will expire unexercised. Clearing members will not be permitted to submit exercise instructions with respect to cash-settled foreign currency options. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 4 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The term ``spot price'' with respect to an option contract on a foreign currency means the price, in terms of U.S. dollars, quoted by various commercial banks in the interbank foreign exchange market for the sale of a single unit of such foreign currency for immediate delivery, which generally means delivery within two business days following the date on which the terms of such a sale are agreed upon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Currently, all OCC-cleared index options are cash-settled. The procedures proposed for exercise settlement of cash-settled foreign currency options are similar to the procedures for exercise settlement of index options. Pursuant to OCC Rule 1806, index options settle by OCC either paying to or collecting from the exercising or assigned clearing member the difference in U.S. dollars between the exercise price of the index option and the exercise settlement value ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> i.e. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> , the value of the index as reported by the reporting authority designated by the options market where the option is traded). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Pursuant to the proposal, the definitions of ``clearing member'' and ``option contract'' in Article I of OCC's Bylaws are amended to add references to cash-settled foreign currency options. The definition of ``exercising clearing member'' is amended to make clear that when used with respect to an option that is subject to an automatic exercise, including cash-settled foreign currency options, the term refers to the clearing member in whose account an option so exercised is carried. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

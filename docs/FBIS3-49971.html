			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Slobodan Rakitic, deputy of the Serbian </F> Renewal Movement, by Cvijetin Milivojevic; place and date not  given: "We Represent the Origianl Depos"]    [Text] [Milivojevic] Does the open letter of a group of  federal deputies of the Democratic Movement of Serbia [Depos]  mean that there exist two Depos's -- the one that was registered  last year, and another, that ran in the recent elections as a  coalition?    [Rakitic] We are deputies of the Depos that was founded in  1992. That DEPOS still exists, it still has its Presidency, its  Council, its founding documents, and a large membership. That  Depos is registered as a political organization, which is the  only relevant thing for us.    In our letter we inform the public that we shall work  autonomously within the Serbian Renewal Movement [SPO], keeping  in mind that the SPO long ago ceased to be a democratic party,  meaning that all the important decisions are made by the  chairman of the party alone. The chairman of the SPO alone made  the decision that SPO deputies were not to take part in the  assembly debate on no confidence in Nikola Sainovic's cabinet,  and he alone withdrew that decision again.... For these recent  elections Vuk Draskovic formed a new coalition, naming it Depos  again, which is false. The Presidency of Depos did not want to  protest, fearing a negative impact on the election results of  the democratic opposition. Because of the event on 1 June  [Draskovic's arrest], because of Draskovic's hospital treatment,  and later because of the elections, we, as deputies, did not  protest. However, as soon as the elections were over, we  decided to end our political abstinence. We consider that the  issues of democratic relations within the SPO can no longer be  postponed.    That we are right is proven by the fact that our  denunciations have not been denied by a single word -- the SPO  leadership has tried, using already proven rhetoric, to  discredit 11 respectable SPO members, among them even several  founders of the SPO.    [Milivojevic] So you still feel members of the SPO, do you?    [Rakitic] We still feel SPO members, but we believe that in  general terms something must be changed in the opposition  parties. It is necessary to legalize factions and trends in the  parties. Different opinions are a normal occurrence, just as it  is normal that, in global terms, we hold unified views on  certain issues. Unfortunately, the way in which the meeting of  the Main Board is supposed to be held speaks of a different  attitude -- the meeting will be a trial to the unlike-minded,  who dared oppose the chairman of the SPO. If they expel us from  the party, then we shall still call ourselves Depos deputies. I  expect that the Depos Presidency and Council will soon meet to  solve disputes between the original Depos and the new one that  has no continuity. That is to say, we shall be acting as an  opposition party, although we are already being attacked in  advance for only benefiting the cause of the Socialist Party of  Serbia [SPS].    Furthermore, it is very sad that the party's leadership has  ordered telegrams to be sent by SPO regional boards condemning  us. In addition, we are receiving threatening telephone calls,  and we are being blackmailed, while rumors about a secret  meeting between Slobodan Milosevic and myself have already  started to circulate. Such paranoia only shows that the question  of democracy is an essential question for the democratic  opposition. Tomorrow we are holding a meeting at which we shall  make a decision regarding our further steps. Yet, if they have  already condemned us in advance, I see no reason why we should  attend the meeting of the Main Board.    [Milivojevic] Does your open letter have anything to do with  the previous attempt by non-partisan people to institutionalize  part of Depos?    [Rakitic] Yes, it does. That idea is very close to us, and  I believe that such a Depos would be deprived of all those  shortcomings that the opposition is suffering from, such as, for  instance, the cult of the personality, and suchlike.    [Milivojevic] Have you had any contacts with chairman  Draskovic recently?    [Rakitic] Yes, on the eve of the very elections, when he  asked me to take part in the work of the campaign committee.  However, in view of everything that was happening in the party  while Draskovic was in prison, in view of all the accusations  against me that have been delivered by the people who were on  hunger strike and were behaving like a group of religious  fanatics encircled by a rope -- I do not see any way to talk to  people who are not ready to start a democratic dialogue. All  the more since it was Draskovic alone who made the decision on  the coalition, as well as the decision on the candidates for  assembly deputies.    I know that we shall be linked to the SPS, and the State  Security Service, and it will be said that the right moment has  not come yet, and so forth. It turns out that one is a good  member only when one keeps silent, and supports what the  chairman and his closest aides do. Otherwise one will be told  that "the opposite attitude suits the regime." In that case any  action is made impossible, which we do not accept.  <H5>  [Box, page 4] </H5>   Belgrade -- "One needs only several facts out of many to see  that the SPO lacks any democracy. The current SPO differs in no  way from the Communist Party from the time of Tito's autocracy.  The SPO has become a private firm of the Draskovic family,  which employs many relatives of theirs," it is said in the open  letter to the Main Board of the SPO, that was written by nine  former republican deputies and members of the Main Board of the  SPO, among whom are Dr. Aleksandar Taskovic, Dr. Ivan  Milutinovic, Dr. Predrag Mijailovic, and author Mladen Markov.    "The staff policy of the party is completely in the hands of  Vuk Draskovic and his wife. The basic criterion is the personal  affinity and loyalty toward the Draskovics. The bodies that are  in charge of the staff policy according to the SPO Statute are  regularly bypassed. Also, the financial dealings of the party  are far from being under any control, something on which the  Main Board has never received any report," the letter states.    Still, Draskovic is receiving many letters of support. Until  yesterday, letters were coming in from Nis, Paracin, Decane,  Kragujevac, Gora, Vlasotnice, Kladovo, Osecina, Ruma, Pozarevac,  and Zajecar....</p>

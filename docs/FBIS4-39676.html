			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by ITAR-TASS analyst Vladimir Gondusov] </F>   [Text] Moscow 8 June TASS -- While Russian, Ukrainian and  Crimean politicians are busy debating the fate of the Crimean  peninsula and of the Black Sea Fleet based there, Ukrainian  nationalists are acting to destabilise the situation in the  region.    Groups of volunteers from the Ukrainian National Assembly  (UNA- UNSO) [Ukrainian National Self-Defense] are reportedly  getting ready for a massive landing in the Crimea on 17 June,  causing alarm not only in the Crimean capital of Simferopol but  also in Ukraine's Kiev.    Assistant to the president of the Republic of Crimea Aleksey  Baksheyev said the threats of Ukrainian nationalists are quite  substantial. He told ITAR-TASS that he did not rule out the  possibility that some of the groups had already penetrated the  peninsula and added that he has information about the possible  activity of the nationalists among the population.    Aleksey Baksheyev's information about the possible acts of  provocation in the Crimea is confirmed by the press centre of  the Black Sea Fleet. The centre on Wednesday circulated  information about forming a volunteer group for "an active  recreation" in the Crimea by the nationalist forces in Lvov.  The volunteers intend to "propagate the ideas of Ukrainian  statehood and nationalism in the peninsula." Tens of  self-styled "propagandists" will be accommodated in the  recreation centres around Alushta. They travel to the peninsula  with vouchers worth 2.5 million karbovanets, 90 percent of the  price being paid by the UNA-UNSO organisation.    The UNA-UNSO volunteers include many people with warfare  experience acquired in the flashpoints of the Commonwealth,  including Transdniestria. As concerns their motives, they said  it was primarily the desire "to protect the interests of the  Ukrainians residing in the Crimea."    Sources in the Crimea said that Lvov nationalists are the  most active in choosing the Crimea for "summer vacationing".  But groups of nationalists are being formed also in other  regions of Ukraine. Their advance guards are already in the  peninsula, where they arrived in pairs or individually in order  to avoid provoking suspicions. Their task is to reconnoiter and  prepare for the arrival of the main force.    Deputies of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments told  ITAR-TASS that they were against such moves. In their view,  against the background of positive developments in the  negotiating process involving Moscow, Kiev and Simferopol,  nationalist activity can only build up more tension but is  unable to exert any positive influence on the situation.</p>

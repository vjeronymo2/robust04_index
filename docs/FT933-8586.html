			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Transatlantic demand provides measure of support US BUYING was reported again in Germany, France, Spain and Portgual, taking some bourses higher and trimming earlier losses elsewhere, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT consolidated Thursday's gains, the DAX index closing another 1.63 higher at 1,906.58 for a rise of 2 per cent on the week. Turnover fell from DM12.2bn to DM9.4bn. Volkswagen supported the foreign buying thesis, in spite of continued speculation about the job security of some of its top management. The shares incorporated Thursday's post gains, and more, to close DM15 higher at DM399.50. Elsewhere, Lufthansa was still inspired by its second quarter turn from loss into profits, the shares rising another DM10.30 to DM148.30, up 11.9 per cent on the week. In engineering, KHD rose DM6.30 to DM123.30 with Swiss-based buying reported. In chemicals, Schering saw profit-taking after gains on its new MS drug, and fell DM22 to DM942. PARIS ended virtually flat on the week with the CAC-40 index 13.87 down on the day, but well off its worst at 2,148.00. The government's apparently unswerving devotion to austere economic policies dented expectations of short-term official rate cuts. Turnover was healthy, but lower at FFr3.58bn. The mood was not improved by first-half corporate revenue figures. Michelin, where first half sales fell 12 per cent, and where there were profits to be taken, fell FFr3.30 to FFr192.20; Rhone-Poulenc, with first half turnover down 5.9 per cent, slid FFr3.80 to FFr158. MILAN was enlivened by exceptionally heavy trading in Ferruzzi in otherwise quiet conditions as the market wound down to the end of the monthly account on Monday. The Comit index eased 1.99 to 588.97, for a 1.3 per cent advance on the week. Ferruzzi added L55.4 or 20.31 per cent to L328.2 in volume of almost 59m shares. Mr Matteo Amoretti of Albertini in Milan said many investors had been confused about the share's correct price level when it resumed trading on Thursday after a two day suspension. 'They decided yesterday it had become a penny share, similar to an option or warrant with no maturity. There is very little downside risk but there is upside potential in the event of a recovery,' he said. ZURICH returned to its record-setting ways, although some profit-taking emerged in banks after their strong showing on Thursday. The SMI index rose 10.5 to 2,461.0, 1.6 per cent higher on the week. Nestle, the most actively traded share, rose SFr25 to SFr1,080, taking its advance over the week to 6 per cent, after recent weakness. MADRID rose on lower-than-expected July inflation data and expectations of diminishing interest rates. The general index climbed another 2.74 to 281.22, up 4.1 per cent on the week, and turnover stayed high at Pta25.6bn, fractionally higher than Thursday's figure. ATHENS surged 2.6 per cent to a year's high as the Greek parliament approved the long-awaited bill for the privatisation of OTE, the state telecommunications company. The general index rose 23.87 for a weekly rise of 3 per cent. LISBON continued its climb, the BTA index rising another 41.7 to 2,390.1. Mr John Ferreira of Carnegie International gave the credit to US buying on Portgual's low and falling interest rates, and economic recovery hopes after the escudo devaluation. STOCKHOLM advanced to a year's high in heavy trading, and the Affarsvarlden index rose 6.2 to 1293.3, 3.4 per cent higher on the week. S-E Banken A shares rose SKr9.5 or 15.8 per cent to SKr69.5 after a press report about plans for a new share issue. OSLO was up 1.7 per cent in record turnover of NKr1.4bn. The all-share index rose 9.69 to 590.28, up 8 per cent on the week.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Actuaries Share Indices  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- August 13  THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                          Open    10.30     11.00    12.00 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1272.67  1273.22   1273.30  1271.45 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1354.60  1355.91   1357.15  1355.98                         13.00    14.00     15.00    Close FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1274.66  1275.74   1276.00  1276.24 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1360.06  1357.92   1357.96  1354.67  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                        Aug 12    Aug 11    Aug 10     Aug 9     Aug 6 FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1280.84   1274.70   1261.80   1269.95   1272.34 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1359.88   1354.98   1348.51   1352.97   1348.44  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90) High/day: 100 - 1277.19; 200 - 1360.21 Low/day: 100 - 1271.45 200 - 1354.50.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

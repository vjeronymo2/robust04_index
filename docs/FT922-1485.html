			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / International Company News: Two French bank heads replaced THE HEADS of two of France's nationalised banks, Credit Industriel et Commercial (CIC) and Societe Marseillaise de Credit (SMC), have been replaced in the French government's regular three-yearly review of the senior management of state-controlled companies. Mr Jean-Pierre Aubert, 49, has replaced Mr Francois Caries, 65, as chairman of CIC, the federation of regional banks controlled by Groupe des Assurances Nationales (GAN), the public sector insurance group. Mr Aubert has for the past three years been chairman of CIC-Paris. GAN took control of CIC in 1989, the year that Mr Caries became chairman. The takeover followed a turbulent period for the bank which had been heavily exposed to a number of bad loans including those to the collapsed Al Saudi Banque. The CIC banks have since undergone radical rationalisation to try to control costs and improve profitability. This programme is expected to continue under Mr Aubert's chairmanship. CIC recently reported a 12 per cent fall in profits for last year to FFr714m (Dollars 137.3m). The new chairman of SMC will be Mr Jean Matouk, 54, taking over from Mr Jean-Paul Escande, who has headed the bank since 1982. Mr Matouk, a former adviser on economic and financial affairs to President Francois Mitterand, is now head of the Caisse Nationale de l'Energie. SMC, which is under-capitalised, fell into the red in 1991 by moving from a profit of FFr11m into a loss of FFr17.4m.</p>

			<p><P> June 22, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE BEAT: 'HEARTS' A PLAY AT CROSS-PURPOSES WITH ITSELF  </P> <P> Murnon Barrow. Kelpy Lockwood. Molina Claflin. Playwright Gabriel Walsh has his  own, curious way of doing things, and it begins with his characters' names in  "Hearts," at the American New Theatre.  </P> <P> The names are halfway to the point of sounding ultra-authentic, yet also  halfway down the primrose path of literary pretension. They're odd, yet they  don't really sing, nor do they suggest the characters themselves.  </P> <P> In a word, the names, like the play, need work.  </P> <P> Only when "Hearts" is over is it clear that Walsh has been at cross-purposes  with himself. On one hand, he wants to paint a faintly sardonic view of the  desperate lives of three people trapped in the marginalia of a big, nameless  American city. He's fond of having one of his people calling another on their  delusions and/or self-deceptions, only to have the tables turned. He's very  interested in suggesting that these three have the minds to make some kind of  success, but couldn't get past certain hurdles.  </P> <P> On the other hand, Walsh wants to make a thinking person's love story, an Erich  Segal tale with loopy dialogue. He believes that he can set up a triangle  between people too tired to love, only to find that love will win out in the  end.  </P> <P> It doesn't work. Richard Eden's Murnon, lumbering around his apartment on  crutches (he's survived a death leap off a bridge, but it's still too blatant a  device), is so thoroughly absorbed in his own inner seriousness that he's an  emotional blank. Though Morton Lewis lets us inside Kelpy's private madness,  which allows him to paint but not live a very good life, he always seems an  added-on voice, an agent of the plot.  </P> <P> Director Michele Martin as Molina is curiously -- considering the title -- the  only one with heart, but together enough that we wonder why she hangs around  such losers. (The reason she provides, related to a death wish, doesn't sound  right coming from Martin.)  </P> <P> Martin's directorial approach is a faintly updated version of  Method-with-sweat, as if seeing the actors put out will make us believe. But  Walsh's confused play won't be resolved so easily, although Thomas Brown's  half-dingy, half-romantic lights and set make an asset of "Hearts' " mixed  signals.  </P> <P>  At 1540 Cahuenga Blvd., on Fridays through Sundays, 8 p.m., until July 8. $10;  (213) 960-1604.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> The Cast's 'Fault Line' Has a Few Faults  </P> <P> Life can get awfully goofy in earthquake country. You may dismiss John Heaner's  "Fault Line," at the Cast Theatre, as a slightly apoplectic one-joke play, but  it's also emblematic of something larger. California has always been a  wonderful, living source for writers, partly because its geology and culture  share such profound instability. If "Fault Line" is nothing else, it is  absolutely Californian.  </P> <P> Ted Schmitt, the Cast's late artistic director and guiding light, always had a  keen sense for Californian plays; watching "Fault Line," the first Cast  production since Schmitt's untimely death, is to see Schmitt's ideas live on.  </P> <P> In fact, Heaner's play would be a kind of definitive tribute to Schmitt, if  only it were a better work. The notion of a soldier of fortune-style  survivalist (J. Marvin Campbell) preparing for the Big One, only to have a  mild-mannered vagrant (Jason Reed) barge in on him from out of nowhere, is  funny by itself, and a sly tribute to the absurdists. Heaner even takes the  absurd allegiance a step further, when the men basically trade positions of  power in a kind of seismic dance of death.  </P> <P> But it ends up being nothing more than musical chairs, with Campbell's macho  frustrations and Reed's ultra-sanguine manner, under Harvey Perr's direction,  wearing out their comic welcome. The unlikely entry of a phone repair woman  (Sweet Baby J'ai) seems a kind of admission that Heaton hasn't figured out yet  where his play is going. In that way, too, it is very Californian.  </P> <P>  At 804 N. El Centro Ave., on Wednesdays and Thursdays, 8 p.m., until July 19.  $5; (213) 462-0265.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> Sewell's 'Winter Crane' -- Studied, Serious, Strained  </P> <P> In one sense, Richard C. Sewell's Anglicized Japanese tale, "Winter Crane," is  a natural maiden voyage for the newly reorganized Fountain Theatre. Artistic  directors Deborah Lawlor and Stephen Sachs have planned some interesting  multicultural programming for the theater (everything from children's theater  in Spanish to an adaptation of Vikram Seth's California verse novel, "The  Golden Gate"). "Winter Crane" is quintessentially multicultural: a play by a  white American about medieval Japan with non-traditional casting.  </P> <P> In another sense, "Winter Crane" isn't the kind of exciting send-off a new  theater group might hope for. Director Anne Drecktrah is certainly not abetted  by the text. Sewell has too few play-writing instincts and too much reverence  for Japanese folk tale tradition: the action perpetually freezes as one of his  characters recites a life story. The stasis is odd for a story of a warrior who  discovers love and peace while in exile from his lords.  </P> <P> And Drecktrah's ideas for enlivening "Winter Crane" produce both museum theater  and the feel of a pretentious student effort. During these moments of studied  recitative, choreographer Bonnie Oda Homsey's dancers move across the stage  with strained attempts at visual interpretation of the story being told.  </P> <P> The actors, though, are the most strained of all, especially Rob Narita's  clenched-teeth manner with his warrior, Uto. The more studied and serious  "Winter Crane" becomes, the more it comes perilously close to a parody of  Kurosawa's great film odes to samurai culture.  </P> <P>  At 5060 Fountain Ave., on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 7  p.m., until July 22. $14; (213) 663-1525.  </P> <P> </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Arizona Triangle' Gets Stranded in the Desert  </P> <P> Take away all of its literary allusions, its metaphorical themes of hunters,  sisters and the eternal mother/daughter matrix, and Stacy Roberts' "Arizona  Triangle" at the Callboard Theatre is your basic cautionary tale of what  happens when good women do a dumb thing like hitchhiking alone on a desert  highway.  </P> <P> In fact, the play might be enjoyable if it were just a thriller, riding on the  elixir of plot. The ingredients are there, but, instead, Roberts attempts to  draw characters with seemingly deep Oedipal and other complexes. Her dialogue  veers between the unadorned and the decorative, as if co-written by competing  voices. And while her sisters (played with as much conviction as possible by  Roberts and Jeannine Wiest) wrestle with their family demons, they step into an  extremely unlikely conflict.  </P> <P> That's in Act II, at the mesa pad of Bobby (Paul Caruso). In accord with the  play's insistent ambitions, Bobby isn't just a wily scumbag; he's a symbol of  America gone rotten. You may admire how director Steven Nash moves things  along, or how Richard Hoover and Jim Barbaley's set and Ken Booth's lights  convey a world on the edge of an abyss. But there's no getting away from a play  whose execution simply can't hold the weighty ideas it's reaching for.  </P> <P>  At 8451 Melrose Place, on Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m., Sundays, 3 and  7 p.m., indefinitely. $18-$20; (213) 466-1767.  </P> <P> </P></p>

			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / Observer: Parallel rulers Like meets like at 10 Downing Street today with prime minister Major's first visit from his gangling Swedish counterpart Carl Bildt. Besides sharing the same dry sense of humour and conversational style, the two Conservative leaders aren't all that far apart in appearance, although the Scandinavian is fresher of face. Something else they have in common is an affinity with German chancellor Helmut Kohl, somewhat on the lines of two nephews to an uncle. Bildt sees John Major as a strong ally backing Sweden's bid for European Community membership by 1995. The UK premier wants to make widening the community a leitmotif of Britain's EC presidency in the second half of this year. While the Swede's election win came earlier - he took over last October - he also has a recent personal victory to celebrate. He has just struck a telling blow for his industrial policy by forcing the automobile group Volvo to back away from its controversial plan to take over the Procordia pharmaceutical and food company. But their talk won't be only of triumph. Yet another resemblance between them is that Bildt, too, is presiding over his country's worst recession since at least the Second World War.</p>

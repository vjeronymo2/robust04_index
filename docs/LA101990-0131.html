			<p><P> October 19, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> SUSPECT IS SOUGHT IN SHOOTINGS OF 3 MEN  </P> <P> Police were searching Thursday for a man suspected of shooting and wounding  three men as they stood in front of an apartment complex at 1600 W. 1st St.  </P> <P> The shooting, at about 7 p.m. Wednesday, was apparently unprovoked, police  spokeswoman Maureen Thomas said.  </P> <P> "The three victims were waiting for friends outside of the complex, and the  suspect had been drinking beer a short distance away," Thomas said. "The  suspect walked over to the group and words were exchanged before the man pulled  out a small-caliber handgun and fired three to five shots, striking all three  of the people in the group."  </P> <P> The victims, whose names were not available, were taken to Western Medical  Center, where they were treated for wounds described by Thomas as "not  life-threatening."  </P> <P> "One person was hit in the elbow by gunfire, one was hit in the upper arm and  one was hit in the hand and the leg. That person's leg was actually broken by  the bullet," Thomas said.  </P> <P> One man was released Wednesday night. The other victims remained at Western  Medical Center, where they were listed in stable condition.  </P> <P> The assailant, described as a Latino in his 30s, ran to the rear of the  apartment complex immediately after the shootings and drove away in a white or  red pickup.

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Members of the group Al Arqam from Malaysia are  now active in Chiang Mai and Phrae Provinces under the guise of  businessmen and pilgrims. They have tricked provincial  officials into joining the group by promising them trips abroad.  The new members were promised a visit to Malaysia free of  charge; the single members were promised a chance to find a  spouse. The group was earlier reported to have come from  Malaysia to recruit men for arms training in Thailand. The  Malaysian Government has asked the Thai Government to monitor  the group's activities.    On 25 June, Al Arqam organized a meeting of members at the  Nakhon Phrae Tower Hotel in Phrae Province. About 500 members  from 15 countries attended the two-day meeting. Thai officials  have been monitoring the meeting, which drove many hotel guests  away due to fear of sabotage.    Abu Ya, president of Al Arqam told newsmen after the meeting  that his group has no intention of carrying out sabotage or  toppling the Malaysian Government as alleged by certain  Malaysian ministers who fear that his group might be recruiting  men to train for terrorist activities in Malaysia as the prime  ministerial [as published] election approaches. Abu Ya said his  group consists of businessmen who come to Thailand to find  business partners. [passage omitted]</p>

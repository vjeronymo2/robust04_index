			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / UK Company News: Buoyant retail side behind WH Smith rise 27% to Pounds 113m SIR SIMON Hornby, chairman of WH Smith Group, said he was not expecting any cyclical recovery in the company's retail markets in the current financial year. However, he said the pace of benefits from Smith's pursuit of scale economies and systems was increasing. Sir Simon was reporting on results for the year to end-May which showed a 27 per cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 112.7m. Despite the recession, the group's retail chains - which sell newspapers, books, stationery, recorded music and videos - increased sales by 10.8 per cent to Pounds 1.3bn, while sales of its distribution activities - news, office supplies and books - rose 8.1 per cent to Pounds 905.9m. Sales in its DIY joint venture fell from Pounds 214.2m to Pounds 209.8m. Sir Simon said the group had increased market share in virtually all its retail businesses. He said the recent reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission of the newspaper distribution industry would not cover magazines, which was the growth area of the market. Smith's magazine sales rose 10 per cent in the year. The MMC would look at the relationship between newspaper publishers and wholesalers for the first time. Although the office supplies market was down 9 per cent Smith's sales were up 10 per cent. Sir Simon said this business would become 'a major cash producer' and had won 67 new accounts worth Pounds 12m a year. A new distribution centre was being built. A rights issue last year and sales of peripheral businesses had prompted a Pounds 146.7m fall in net borrowings to Pounds 85.2m - 20 per cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 435.4m, up Pounds 185.6m. Interest charges were down from Pounds 28.2m to Pounds 3.4m. Profits also benefited from a Pounds 9.2m pension credit. However, this was down from Pounds 11.2m the year before and Mr John Napier, finance director, said the credit could be expected to dwindle over the next few years. Sir Simon said that capital expenditure of Pounds 67m had been financed from internal resources and spending of Pounds 65m in the current year would be too. See Lex</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Mystery surrounds Caparo 'US purchase' Mystery last night surrounded an announcement by Mr Swraj Paul, the Anglo-Indian businessman, that his privately-held Caparo steel and engineering group had made its biggest acquisition ever by acquiring 'a Dollars 400m US steel firm'. Mr Paul told Reuter in New Delhi that a deal to acquire the un-named Pittsburgh-based company was signed early yesterday. Officials at Caparo's London headquarters were trying to contact Mr Paul yesterday for further clarification, after he had faxed them a message saying a letter of intent had been signed to buy 'a major American steel plant'. The announcement caused confusion among steel industry observers. Caparo is known to be interested in buying Sharon Steel, an integrated producer which is in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. But that company is based in Sharon, Pennsylvania rather than Pittsburgh. And the plant which Caparo said it has bought makes 1.2m tonnes of hot-rolled coils, 60,000 tonnes of cold-rolled coils and 90,000 tonnes of galvanised sheets, which one analyst said did not sound like Sharon. It is assumed that the Dollars 400m (Pounds 258m) in Mr Paul's announcement refers to the revenues of the company rather than the transaction price. Caparo has already expanded in the US. Its North American sales were Pounds 111m last year out of a total of Pounds 360m following the acquisitions of Bull Moose Tube in 1988 and Bock Industries in 1990. Caparo is thought to be the front-runner in the bidding for Sharon, although a Dutch-backed group is also said to have made a cash bid.</p>

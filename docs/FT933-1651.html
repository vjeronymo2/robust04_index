			<p>930923 FT  23 SEP 93 / Pakistan to seek Dollars 2.6bn from donors MR Babar Ali, Pakistan's finance minister, is due to meet representatives of donor countries in Washington on Monday to seek up to Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.7bn) in fresh commitments. The meeting is a substitute for this year's annual aid-to-Pakistan consortium meeting which was originally scheduled to be held in Paris. That meeting had to be cancelled twice because of the country's political upheavals. A general election is due on October 6. In recent months some Pakistani officials have been worried that a request by a short-term unelected government would be to Islamabad's disadvantage. 'Donors may question whether policies will remain intact after the October elections when a new government comes to office,' said one. However, recent economic reforms by the government of Mr Moeen Qureshi, the interim prime minister, have largely been welcomed by donors, western economists in Islamabad say. Among the reforms are government commitments to reduce a chronic budgetary deficit, increase spending on the social sector and reduce tariffs over the next four years. Mr Qureshi has also said recently that he had received assurances from Mr Nawaz Sharif and Ms Benazir Bhutto, the two main prime ministerial contenders, that his government's policies will not be reversed. In addition, the IMF has agreed to provide up to Dollars 377m in standby credits, under a recently negotiated deal. That move is expected to strengthen Pakistan's case with its donors, officials add.</p>

			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / International Company News: Charter stands by bid for Esab after shares rise Charter, the UK industrial group, said yesterday it stood by its bid for Esab, in spite of a further rise in the Swedish welding group's shares above the offer price following a sharp upgrade in the company's profits forecast. Esab shares rose to SKr355, SKr10 ahead of Charter's Pounds 260m (Dollars 400m) recommended June bid, after it announced a surge in half-year profits after financial items to SKr195m (Dollars 25.19m), compared with SKr23m in the same period last year. The Gothenburg-based group, the world's largest supplier of welding equipment, added that it expected full-year profits of about SKr390m, well ahead of its previous forecast of SKr320m. It said income targets set for the coming few years would be reached earlier than expected. The results fuelled speculation in Stockholm that Charter, which already holds 53 per cent of Esab, might fail in its target of capturing 90 per cent by the deadline of this Friday. Several Swedish institutions that hold the bulk of the outstanding shares have yet to make up their minds and have made clear they are closely examining claims that the Charter bid undervalues Esab. But Mr Charles Parker, Charter commercial director, said yesterday that the UK company regarded the latest rise in Esab's share price as a blatant attempt to force it into increasing the bid price. He said the fundamental assessments which led to the offer at SKr345 - at the time a 20 per cent premium - had not changed. 'The offer stands as it is,' he said. Esab attributed the dramatic turnround to a cost-cutting programme which during the past two years has seen the workforce fall by some 1,700 to just over 7,000 at the end of June. Group sales in the first six months rose to SKr3.74bn from SKr3.38bn as demand in Esab's main markets in Europe remained slack. Operating profits after depreciation grew to SKr222m from SKr93m. Return on capital in the year to June was 13.7 per cent, compared with 9.1 per cent in 1993. Mr Lars Westerberg, chief executive, said he expected that sales growth would continue, sustaining profits growth.</p>

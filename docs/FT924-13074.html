			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound resilient as rates are cut STERLING fell two pfennigs immediately after the Bank of England signalled a one point cut in base rates, but bounced back to close at DM2.4475, writes Emma Tucker. Dealers were not convinced that the currency's apparent resilience would last and said they expected further falls next week. The market had already discounted at least a half point cut in UK base rates, which meant that much of the shock of the one point cut in rates to 8 per cent was absorbed. However, dealers felt the latest cut indicated a shift in the government's approach to economic policy. Recent signals on policy have been mixed and the market has been unsure whether the government intends to give priority to the exchange rate or the domestic economy. 'The government has sent a signal to the foreign exchange markets that its policy, if there is one, is to focus more on domestic growth than the exchange rate. That is not something that foreign investors will like,' said Mr Avinash Persaud, senior currency economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. The market is now discounting 7 per cent base rates by the end of the year, which will exert further downward pressure on the currency. In addition, the recent high volatility of the pound means that investors are demanding a higher risk premium on the currency, also likely to push it lower. Sterling had already shed over five pfennigs this week even before yesterday's rate cut was announced. The loss was prompted by the worsening economic and political situation in the UK which convinced the market that an easing was inevitable. However, veiled attempts by the government and Bank of England to defuse the rate cut rumours had put the market off the scent in recent days. Thus, according to dealers, yesterday's cut had a whiff of panic about it. The pound closed 1 1/2 pfennigs lower on the day, and was over 7 pfennigs lower than at the beginning of the week. Against the dollar it closed down over four cents at Dollars 1.6570. The dollar shrugged off poor trade figures in European trading to end slightly firmer against the D-Mark. It was mainly boosted by by the rate cut in the UK. Dealers argued that the cut would put pressure on other European countries to ease monetary policy which in turn would keep up the pressure on the Bundesbank to cut rates sooner rather than later. In London the dollar closed higher against the D-Mark at DM1.4765 compared with Thursday's close of DM1.4475. Other European currencies were overshadowed by the reaction of the free-floating pound to the base rate cut.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- October 16                                          THE EUROPEAN SERIES Hourly changes             Open       11.30       12.00       13.00  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       994.01     995.35      995.46      996.51 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1066.47    1068.72     1067.37     1070.21  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                               Oct 15       Oct 14       Oct 13  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100           986.39       992.09       999.62 FT-SE Eurotrack 200          1061.28      1074.77      1085.38  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes             14.00      15.00       16.00       Close  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100       995.82     994.96      996.07      996.54 FT-SE Eurotrack 200      1067.61    1065.75     1066.34     1066.23  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                     Oct 12         Oct 9  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100                 984.55         987.08 FT-SE Eurotrack 200                1069.79        1070.52  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value  1000 (26/10/90)  High/day: 100 -  997.59  ; 200 -  1071.31 Low/day: 100 -  992.79  200 -  1063.25  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

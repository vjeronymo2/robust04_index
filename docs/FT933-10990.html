			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei eases but Australia surges ahead EARLY gains which followed arbitrage buying were eroded when investment trusts and financial institutions took profits and share prices closed lower after trading within a narrow range, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei average fell 76.71 to 20,380.14, after a high of 20,545.75 and a low of 20,361.34, for a week's rise of 4 per cent. Foreign and individual investors were seen buying. Volume totaled 350m shares against 365m. Declines led advances by 526 to 460, with 185 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks closed down 0.14 at 1,659.91. In London, the ISE/Nikkei index fell 0.94 to 1,257.07. Share prices failed to react to the election of Mr Yohei Kono, chief cabinet secretary, as the leader of the Liberal Democratic Party, which is likely to be the new opposition party. Speculation that the new coalition government, which will be formed next week, will implement income tax cuts in an effort to gain support buoyed some housing and consumption related stocks. Continued worries over construction companies' involvement in the spate of bribery scandals depressed the sector. Mr Rokuro Ishikawa, chairman of Kajima, resigned as chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, although he denied any links between the scandals and Kajima. Kajima fell Y25 to Y790, Hazama lost Y9 to Y465 and Shimizu retreated Y26 to Y830. Nikkatsu, the most active issue of the day, jumped Y10 to Y28 on reports that Namco, a video game maker, was considering extending financial aid to the bankrupt movie maker. Namco fell Y70 to Y3,660. In Osaka, the OSE average closed up 77.79 at 22,464.15 in volume of 12m shares. Roundup THE Pacific Rim saw further records set. AUSTRALIA soared to post-1987 crash highs after the Reserve Bank eased monetary policy and gold bullion rose beyond USDollars 400 an ounce. The All Ordinaries index closed 15.5 higher at 1,844.0, for a week's rise of 2.1 per cent. Turnover was ADollars 876.2m with rises outpacing falls by four to one. In the media sector News Corp eased 1 cent to ADollars 8.48, while Nine Network gained 10 cents to ADollars 3.60. Fairfax added 1 cent to ADollars 2.32. NEW ZEALAND broke through the 1,800 level for the first time since March 1990, assisted by another sharp rise in Telecom, which closed at a record high, up 14 cents at NZDollars 3.68, following Thursday's good first quarter results. The NZSE-40 index finished 33.73 higher at 1,816.04 in turnover of NZDollars 4.05m. HONG KONG moved firmly ahead as investors bought blue chips, particularly in the utilities sector, and the Hang Seng index ended 89.03 or 1.3 per cent higher at 6,988.96, for a weekly rise of 3.5 per cent. Turnover dipped to HKDollars 2.78bn compared with Thursday's HKDollars 3.06bn. MANILA rebounded on strong buying of blue chips and mining issues. The composite index gained 12.68 to a record high of 1,751.21, up 2.5 per cent on the week. Turnover was strong at 675m pesos. TAIWAN reversed early gains to close moderately lower in thin trade after the central bank cut its secured loan rate by 50 basis points after Thursday's close. The weighted index, which had risen some 20 points in early trade, soon fell back, ending 28.42 down at 3,994.20, off 0.8 per cent on the week. Turnover was TDollars 12.7bn against Thursday's TDollars 13.6bn. Many brokers said that the rate cut was positive, confirming the central bank's commitment to a monetary easing that began in April; but investors were disappointed that the central bank did not do more. JAKARTA saw activity rebound with heavy trading in several liquid stocks which took the official index 2.67 higher to 356.72. BOMBAY moved sharply higher in spite of end-of-session profit-taking by speculators and the BSE index rose 99.4 to 2,332.14.</p>

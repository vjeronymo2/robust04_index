			<p><P> April 11, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE: LAGUNA SECA TRACK CALLED DANGEROUS, BOYCOTT URGED  </P> <P> Barry Sheene, a former world motorcycle racing champion, said Tuesday in  Brisbane, Australia, that the United States Grand Prix cycle race should be  moved away from the Laguna Seca track in Monterey, Calif., and urged a rider  boycott if the race is held there again next year.  </P> <P> Sheene, the 500cc world champion in 1976-77, made his plea after Australian  Kevin Magee was critically injured when he crashed in the race there last  Sunday.  </P> <P> Magee, who broke a leg in a fall at the same track last year during an incident  in which Bubba Shobert suffered serious head injuries, was still listed in  critical condition Tuesday at San Jose Medical Center, where he had surgery to  remove a blood clot on his brain.  </P> <P> Australian Wayne Gardner, another former world champion, and American Kevin  Schwantz also fell during the race, and four-time world champion Eddie Lawson  broke his right heel and left ankle during a fall in practice.  </P> <P> Sheene, a commentator on Australian television, said of Laguna Seca in the  Brisbane Sun: "The place is a dump. If I was still riding, there is no way I'd  race there."  </P> <P> He said the main dangers at Laguna Seca were the lack of runoff areas and the  skid-inducing white markings.  </P></p>

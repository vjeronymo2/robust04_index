			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had a short  meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman in Jerusalem today.  But before the meeting with the Israeli president, he [Klaus]  had talks with Binyamin Netanyahu, chairman of the right-wing  opposition Likud bloc, who is a staunch opponent of the present  Israeli Government's policy on Palestinians.    Talks between President Weizman and Vaclav Klaus centered  mainly on the general situation in the Middle East while Klaus'  discussions with Binyamin Netanyahu concentrated on the level of  privatization in both countries and on economic reform in the  Czech Republic.    Prime Minister Klaus commented to Czech radio on his talks  [with Netanyahu].    [Begin Klaus recording] This is a political party that puts  emphasis on similar principles as the political party [Civic  Democratic Party], which I lead, and [on similar principles] as  the government coalition that rules in the Czech Republic. We,  therefore, preferred to talk about our views on civic, social,  political, and economic matters. The Middle East issue or the  question of Palestine did not dominate our discussions. [passage  omitted] It is absolutely evident that the Czech Republic is,  in these areas [of privatization], the country with a greater  private sector, the country with a lesser tax burden, the  country with less regulatory measures and state intervention in  the economy. These were matters the Israeli party was  exceedingly interested in. [end recording]</p>

Muslims and Croats definitively agreed only  on another meeting. The presidents of Croatia and Bosnia,  Tudjman and Izetbegovic, will meet in Bonn on Saturday [8  January] to agree on further details for a cease-fire in central  Bosnia. Currently, the Muslims are engaged in a successful  offensive against the Croats there.    However, cease-fires are not a way out of the crisis,  European Union negotiator Lord Owen says:    [Begin Owen recording, in English with superimposed German  translation] We have never argued for cease-fires. We have  always said that there must be a political solution, and I have  not changed my opinion about that. Only after a political  agreement has been achieved can there be a ceasefire. [end  recording]    However, the political agreement is not yet there. The  Croats still do not want to discuss access to the Adriatic Sea  for the Muslims in the Croatian town of Neum. Only the Croatian  town of Ploce is being discussed as the location of a Muslim  free port.    There is no agreement on future borders, either. Only  meetings between various Muslim and Croatian committees have  been agreed, which are supposed to discuss details of an  exchange of prisoners and of humanitarian aid.</p>

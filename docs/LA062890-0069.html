			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRINCIPAL CAUGHT IN TUG OF WAR OF SCHOOL POLICIES;  </P> <P> EDUCATION: WESTCHESTER HIGH AMONG THE 70 SCHOOLS IN A PILOT PROGRAM TO TEST  SCHOOL-BASED MANAGEMENT. BUT THE PRINCIPAL MAY BE 'BUMPED' INTO ANOTHER JOB  BEFORE THE PROGRAM STARTS.  </P> <P> Westchester High School Principal Eileen Banta is caught between the old way of  doing things in the Los Angeles Unified School District and what may be the  wave of the future.  </P> <P> If you find her back at her desk in Westchester next September, it will be mean  the school board and district is committed to supporting a system of  self-governance known as school-based-management, said Helen Bernstein, United  Teachers of Los Angeles president-elect.  </P> <P> If Banta is not, Bernstein said, school-based management is doomed. "It's a  revolution, and you have to change the rules."  </P> <P> Westchester High is one of 70 schools in a pilot program that will try  school-based management next year, a daunting task in a district noted for its  centralized bureaucracy.  </P> <P> This partnership approach, with the involvement of principals, teachers and  parents, is expected to sweep through the schools in the next several years.  </P> <P> But this is also the year of budget cuts, and Banta is ensnared in the  belt-tightening effort in a district where seniority rules. She has been told  to prepare herself to be "bumped."  </P> <P> That means an administrator whose job was eliminated by the board's efforts to  trim the bureaucracy is entitled to go back to being a school principal,  creating a domino effect in the district.  </P> <P> Proponents of the teamwork approach say it will be disastrous to switch  principals in mid-stream. Banta's possible replacement, an as-yet-unnamed  district administrator, may not share her philosophy or priorities, which are  incorporated into the school's proposal to rule itself.  </P> <P> A principal's role in the development and implementation of school-based  management is pivotal. "They are the ones who have to set up the team to move  the issue," said school board member Warren Furutani. "If you don't have a  team, it's not going to work."  </P> <P> The issue goes beyond Banta to a handful of other principals on the short list  to be bumped and, Bernstein insists, to the heart of the matter of local school  rule.  </P> <P> Why, she asks, would any school go through the time-consuming, sometimes  fractious process of reaching consensus on the direction of the school if the  principal might not be there to help implement the plan?  </P> <P> According to Bernstein, other urban districts that have adopted school-based  management have included provisions protecting principals from transfer for a  specified number of years. If an exception is not made for Banta and others in  her situation, "there will be no school-based management" in Los Angeles,  Bernstein said.  </P> <P> Banta's faculty agrees. In a letter to school Supt. Leonard Britton, the union  representative at Westchester described the faculty as "distraught" at the  prospect of losing Banta.  </P> <P> Each of the four principals at the school in the last seven years "has been  totally different in style, goals and strengths," wrote teacher Adrienne  Zeigler. "There is no generic principal."  </P> <P> The issue is slated for resolution at the school board budget-cutting session  today. The board could opt to exempt principals at schools in the pilot  project. Westside board member Mark Slavkin said he will present a way around  the dilemma by moving to rescind the $500,000 budget cut and keep the  administrators, so they will not be in a position to bump anyone.  </P> <P> Slavkin said only about six secondary school principals in the district are  threatened by the cuts. "My goal is to save all the secondary school  principals," as a way of maintaining continuity at the schools.  </P> <P> This solution solves another dilemma for Slavkin, who is trying to keep the  Venice High School principal, who is not in the pilot program, from being  bumped. If an exemption is granted to principals in the pilot program, the  Venice principal would zoom to the top of the transfer list, which, Slavkin  said is unfair.  </P> <P> Slavkin agreed that his proposal is really a way around a problem, not a  long-term solution, which requires careful policy consideration in a less  pressured atmosphere, he said.  </P> <P> His plan may also be a way around the school administrators' group, the  Associated Administrators of Los Angeles, who have urged the district to adhere  to its seniority policy or risk legal action. "Not the least of our concern is  (UTLA's) involvement in the assignment of principals," said Walker Brown,  executive director of the association.  </P> <P> Britton has told the board by letter that he is opposed to making an exception  for those principals at schools on their way to self-rule.  </P> <P> "Any time you run into waiving rules, you run into the system," said board  member Furutani.  </P> <P> Banta, meanwhile, is unhappy at the prospect of leaving just as Westchester is  about to participate in the new program. "You get so into your job at this  level, you can't imagine anything else," said Banta, who describes 15 hour days  immersed in her assignment.  </P> <P> She was finishing a successful first year as principal when the ax fell. A  "we-regret-to-inform-you letter" landed on her desk a week ago, she said. "It  just took us by shock. . . . 72 hours ago I could barely form words."  </P> <P> The notification that she was in line for transfer next year had nothing to do  with Banta's job performance, the letter stated. To the contrary, Banta draws  kudos from her faculty, parents and Slavkin.  </P> <P> The letter to Banta arrived at the time the school was mailing ballots to  parents, outlining their proposal to partially run their own school next year.  The faculty had already approved the plan by a wide margin.  </P> <P> The proposals were wrought from a laborious process and represent a meeting of  the minds between the principal, the faculty and the parents on the goals and  direction of the school, located on Manchester Boulevard, west of Lincoln  Boulevard, near the border of Westchester and Playa del Rey.  </P> <P> But Banta, while acknowledging her transfer would be disruptive, is optimistic  that school-based management will prevail at Westchester. "There is no turning  back," she said. "If you write a good proposal it will stand on its own merits  and we wrote a good proposal."  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with National Defense Minister Yerasimos Arsenis </F> by correspondent Anna Panayiotarea; place, date not  given--punctuation as published]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] [Panayiotarea] Reliable  sources tell me that along with reforms in the Armed Forces  leadership, you are planning for full-time units of specialized  soldiers to handle new weapons.    [Arsenis] Indeed. New technology demands that some soldiers  serve more than the average term. We have the voluntary  five-year service term, but its purpose is limited. The main  body of the Armed Forces includes the regular recruits. We  should have some specialized soldiers.    [Panayiotarea] Will there be reform in the composition of  units? For example, will a regiment, as we know it now...    [Arsenis] Yes. The basic defense doctrine we have dates back  to 1985. Today, we face a new situation. The meaning of danger  and stability have changed. We should also deal with our  defense budget perhaps with fewer numbers in the military. If  possible, with a smaller defense budget. To do all this, we  need mobile, more effective, and modern forces.    [Panayiotarea] Is NATO forcing this reform or is it your  initiative?    [Arsenis] It is our initiative, but there is also a parallel  move by NATO. Previously, NATO gathered its forces on borders  to face the danger from the East, the Soviet bloc. This threat  no longer exists. The meaning of common security has changed,  hence NATO's structure is changing. They go together.    [Panayiotarea] But our defense against Turkey does not run  parallel with NATO...    [Arsenis] Unfortunately, this threat exists. It is the  primary threat facing Greece. Lately, there has been an effort,  an unsuccessful one in my opinion, by the Turkish side to  artificially revive the crisis between Greece and Turkey, aiming  to create problems for Greece during its Presidency of the  European Union.    [Panayiotarea] So, our defense policy toward Turkey remains  firm?    [Arsenis] Of course. The reform of the Armed Forces we  discussed is designed primarily to deal with this basic threat.    [Panayiotarea] Well, what is NATO's role now that the former  Warsaw Pact is close to becoming part of NATO and there is no  longer a threat?    [Arsenis] Brussels found the ideal solution. The 16 NATO  members will remain members, but NATO will be open to ad hoc  cooperation with other countries, mainly European, and of course  with Cyprus. In that way, we will have greater, flexible  cooperation with the 16 NATO members as the main body. [passage  omitted]    [Panayiotarea] Before the election, you discussed a popular  defense. What did you mean? Did you mean the TEA [National  Defense Battalions]?    [Arsenis] There is a need to implement it soon. It is not  the TEA. We have many kilometers of border without defense  depth. We have a demographic problem; we have few young people  to enlist in the Armed Forces. So, the people who do not  participate in the Armed Forces must be used as support in time  of need.    [Panayiotarea] To take up arms?    [Arsenis] Not necessarily. Let us take an island for  example. Beyond its tactical army, the population is there to  help in a defense plan in case of emergency. If, for example,  the water reservoir is bombarded, the well- organized locals can  take care of it so there will be no need to send the army to  repair the system. In February, I hope we will circulate the  relevant draft bill to the involved ministries and discuss it  with the political parties. I hope to secure the support of all  the parties in the Chamber of Deputies.    [Panayiotarea] What about the defense of Cyprus?    [Arsenis] It is a high national priority. We are two  independent states of Hellenism facing a threat from the same  source -- Turkey. We can and should coordinate our defense  plans. When we discuss a unified defense space, we are actually  discussing coordinating our defense plans so that together we  can be more effective than we are alone.    [Panayiotarea] But don't some say that you alone decided who  will be the new National Guard commander?    [Arsenis] We will abide strictly by the procedure prescribed  by the form of bilateral cooperation. The commander of the  Cypriot National Guard will be appointed by a joint decision.

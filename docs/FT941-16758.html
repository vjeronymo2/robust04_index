			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Axe hovers over 33,000 steel workers The west European steel industry may have to cut more than 33,000 jobs in 1994, the European Commission warned yesterday. It said 1994 would be particularly bad for job losses in the steel industry, which is being forced to restructure to cope with lack of demand and overcapacity. According to the most recent figures submitted by the 12 EU member states, 337,500 people are employed in the EU steel industry - more than a third of them in Germany. The Commission said in its 'forward programme' for the steel industry, published yesterday, that job losses 'might well reach or even exceed 10 per cent of the workforce' in 1994. It warned that the greatest impact would be felt in Germany, Italy and Spain, but all member states except Denmark and Ireland would be affected by job losses. However, Brussels also sent a strong signal to EU steel producers that they must not shy away from promises to cut production as soon as possible. 'The fundamental restructuring announced by the (EU) steel industry is. . . still vital and the fact that there are no prospects of an improvement in the steel market means that urgent decisions have to be taken regarding a reduction in production capacity,' the Commission warned. The Commission forecasts that production of crude steel will slip from an estimated 128.9m tonnes in 1993, to 126.5m tonnes in 1994, with net actual consumption remaining unchanged at just over 116m tonnes. Just before Christmas, EU industry ministers approved Ecu6.8bn of state subsidies for publicly owned steelmakers, in exchange for capacity cuts amounting to more than 5m tonnes. The Commission is now urging non-subsidised steel producers to carry out their side of the bargain, and cut production by a further 25m tonnes, to ease overcapacity. Private steelmakers have protested strongly about the compromise on subsidies and predicted dire consequences. Commission officials said demand was unlikely to pick up in 1994. But they said EU rescue plans - including the deal on state aid and previously agreed programmes of financial support, and protection from cheap non-EU steel imports - would help ease steel producers' financial situation in the second half of 1994.</p>

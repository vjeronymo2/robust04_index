			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL REPORT;  </P> <P> WEEKDAY UPDATE;  </P> <P> RAMS;  </P> <P> COX, JOHNSON LISTED AS QUESTIONABLE  </P> <P> Injury Update: Wide receiver Aaron Cox and tight end Damone Johnson, both of  whom missed last Sunday's 38-23 victory over the Browns in Cleveland, are  listed as questionable for this Sunday because of sore hamstrings; cornerback  Bobby Humphery is probable despite a calf injury. All three practiced  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Coach John Robinson agreed with New York Giant Coach Bill Parcells'  controversial decision to bypass a field goal and go for the touchdown on  fourth and goal while trailing the San Francisco 49ers, 7-3, Monday night. The  Giants failed on the try and lost by the same score.  </P> <P> "I'd have gone for it," Robinson said without hesitation. "If you kick the  field goal, the 49ers get the ball at the 30 probably, 25 or 30. Which is far  different than at the nine. . . . You may never get the ball back. My thought  was, you aren't ever going to get down there again. I would've gone for it. And  the way it turned out, I would've been wrong." TIM KAWAKAMI  </P></p>

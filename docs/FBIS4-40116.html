			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ukraine's people's deputy and presidential </F> candidate Valeriy Heorhiyovych Babych by unidentified  correspondents of the newspapers DEMOKRATYCHNA UKRAYINA, HOLOS  UKRAYINY, URYADOVYY KURYER, KIYEVSKIYE VEDOMOSTI, PRAVDA  UKRAYINY, UKRAYINA MOLODA, NEZAVISIMOST, the Russian "Economic  News Agency," and other mass media recorded by Yuriy Kornyev and  Oleksandr Yaholnyk; place and date not given: "I Was Honest in  Business, I Will Be Honest in Politics"]    [Text] [Correspondent] The newspaper NOVOSTI carried  Leonid Kuchma's commentary on your participation in presidential  elections in which he alleges that you are a "man of straw."  What can you say in this connection?    [Babych] When I registered myself as a candidate for  Ukraine's Supreme Council deputy, there were 17 persons  altogether, who were put to the vote. I swore that I would not  say a single bad word about any one of them and will not  characterize their actions or conclusions.    I have now made the same promise to God: I will not say a  single bad word about a single presidential candidate. I  believe that our people are sufficiently intelligent and wise.  Thus, both rank-and-file people and professionals will sort out  various approaches and truths. I do not want to impose my  opinion upon anybody instead of giving a direct answer. As  regards the question that was answered by Mr. Kuchma, I can say  this: I never was a prostitute in business and I will never be  a prostitute in politics. I believe that this characterizes my  actions in business in full. Those people who worked with me  know: I never betrayed anybody and never changed my views. I  went into politics for one simple and clear reason: I am sick  and tired of pleading and persuading others -- "Rescue the  economy." I have realized: Unless we ourselves assume control  over the state and create a legislative foundation at the  highest level, we will have to wait a long time for alms, but  there will be no economic stabilization. Today, I have emerged  from the "trenches," and I am ready to place my experience,  knowledge, and views of life at the scaffold of politics in  order to achieve a considerable improvement of the situation in  the economy.    [Correspondent] Have you resigned as president of the  investment company "The Ukrainian Financial Group" [UFG] in  connection with your election as a Supreme Council deputy?    [Babych] Yes, on 13 May I signed a document on giving up my  powers in connection with becoming a Supreme Council deputy and  my nomination as a Ukrainian presidential candidate. My  functions have been passed on to the acting president. I can  only be relieved of my duties by the meeting of shareholders.  The meeting was appointed for July-August. I would like to say  goodbye to the shareholders and thank them for the confidence  that they gave me for three years. I have already practically  abandoned all these affairs.    It is physically impossible to combine the election campaign  with running the UFG financial matters. That is why I have  adopted this path. I have become fully immersed in politics. I  am firmly convinced and will prove to others that today's  politician must be an economist, financier, and market-oriented  businessman, who has one goal: To enrich the state and the  people. I believe that this is our time -- the time of the  people who know how to do something real for the people.    [Correspondent] Who is financing your election campaign?  And how?    [Babych] Within the framework of the Law on Elections.  Quite a number of friends offer me funds and assist with  technical means. As they say, I have not prostituted myself to  any structure -- it is not in my nature. I went to elections  with what I personally have and with the support of my friends.  This question is emphasized because some people are lying in  wait for me to take the first thousand dollars [as a bribe] in  order to immediately trumpet it to the whole world and  compromise me.    [Correspondent] The week of the parliament's work gives rise  to sad reflections. If you become president, is it possible to  work with such a parliament and implement what you have planned?    [Babych] You are not right. One should not be afraid of  reaching compromise and must develop skills in finding a common  language with different people. We must totally abandon methods  of "coming to power" and for the sake of power, which ruthlessly  suppresses particular groups of differently minded people. We  must understand a simple thing: When people come to power and  not to managing the state, the system will compel them to look  up Communists, Rukh [Ukraine's People's Movement for  Perestroyka] members, Greens or whites. I am convinced: This  approach of the exclusive nature of one's own ideas and their  exclusive correctness is pernicious for any nation or state.  The programs of various parties or movements do not differ  much. Their goal is the achievement of Ukraine's well-being.  The question lies in something else: How to do that? Today,  there are already people in Ukraine who know how to do that.    [Correspondent] Can Pynzenyk or Pylypchuk [economists and  political figures] head the Supreme Council Economic Commission  for Economic Reform?    [Babych] Reformers may head commissions. However, executive  structures must be manned with professionals who know what to do  and not by dilettantes who come with advice and collect advice  on what needs to be done. For a long time, I worked in  Derzhplan [State Planning Committee] and at the Council of  Ministers and saw with my own eyes how much harm to the economy  dilettantes may cause by their activity. I witnessed how two  deputy chiefs, guided by purely ambitious motivations, refused  to sign a joint document, even though, as a result, Ukraine lost  hundreds of millions of dollars in old prices.    It is already clear to many people that a team must assume  executive control. Whether good or bad -- a team. A creative  team and not a team of those who will pocket wealth. That is  why I am in favor of a stringent system of a team assuming  control.    Regarding a legislative basis, I am quite comfortable in my  attitude toward the assembly of people of different  nationalities and political parties that have gathered at the  Supreme Council. Yes, discussions must be held there, various  issues must be disputed and resolved, and they must be  implemented by a team. The main question, which was not  answered by the preceding parliament and which must be resolved  by the parliament of the present convocation, is what we are  going to build. Inflation has driven the economy into such a  situation that a question naturally arises: What methods will  we employ in the management of the economy -- administrative  state, that is to say socialist, or market-oriented ones? This  question is presently the principal one. Unless we answer it,  all our subsequent efforts will be in vain. The present  mechanism is only advantageous for department bureaucrats. They  successfully use what suits them best. For example, they get  money through the state system and pay for communal and other  services through the same system, but when it comes to dividing  the capital earned by the enterprise, they suddenly recall that  a market mechanism exists and that something must go to their  own pockets. Therefore, either the administrative state system  -- then it is necessary to introduce regulation, standard  freezing of prices, subsidies, and so on -- nothing so terrible,  in principle. Or, as I prefer, a different platform: I believe  that, today, we should not return to what, as we have seen from  our own experience, leads to an inefficient economy. We must  proceed to a market economy. We must proceed, in our deeds,  from the interests of the individual and his family.    [Correspondent] There recently was a session of the  presidium of the All-Ukrainian Association of Enterprises. What  plans were adopted there? Did the Ukrainian entrepreneurs reach  an agreement?    [Babych] The All-Ukrainian Association of Enterprises  practically unites all unions, with the exception of three --  the unions of cooperators, joint ventures, and small  enterprises. It took us a long time to think about the  expedience of holding the congress, because everybody is sick  and tired of political battles and reasoning, such as "let us  protect ourselves more." However, the majority of the members  of the presidium agreed that it was, after all, worth getting  together in order to feel the atmosphere of approaches and views  prevailing in the nonstate sector. At present, the executive  management elaborates the organizational aspect of the matter.  It will complete its work in the near future, and we will  announce the date for holding the congress. Everything will  proceed in a businesslike atmosphere. We will exchange ideas on  a number of problems, especially those that presently give rise  to differences, for example, about the contractual form of  ownership: Is it worth supporting it further or is it  temporary? Small enterprises require serious analysis. We will  also discuss specific commercial and finance proposals on  international cooperation and will familiarize the delegates to  the congress with proposals on credit lines that are presently  being elaborated.    [Correspondent] When [Mayor of St. Petersburg] Anatoliy  Sobchak was a people's deputy of the USSR, he published a very  interesting book with a quite symbolic title: "The Coming to  Power." It may be firmly stated: You, Valeriy Heorhiyovych,  are already in power. How do you understand power as a  Ukrainian presidential candidate?    [Babych] I understand the concept of power as such that  needs to be taken away from the president and the Cabinet of  Ministers. Power should not continue just to come. If [koly] I  become president, I will try to see to it that more powers are  transferred to lower structures, where they must exist in order  to protect the interests of the people and of the individual.    Today, leaders of farms, departments, and even ministers  come to power and not to the management of an industry or of the  country. Therefore, we must put an end to this "Coming to  Power." The U.S. president does not come to power, but to the  management of the state. In our country, superpower is  concentrated in the hands of subjective individuals, who cannot  always guarantee objective resolution of particular issues. No  matter how hard they try, this will be a subjective approach.  On the other hand, if a person comes to MANAGEMENT, the range  of his influence upon resolving state and economic problems is  narrowed, and he can influence and interfere in the national  economic and, even more, in the state system by about 10-15  percent. There are restrictions that must be urgently applied  to superpower.    [Correspondent] There is presently much talk on strong  executive power. What is your interpretation of this issue?    [Babych] I believe that in working on a decision, it is  always necessary to consult others and not just once. At the  same time, a single person must manage the country's economy.  Just imagine: Three plant directors have been appointed at one  go. Will there be an effect? In this case, everybody realizes  that there will be no result. However, why are we applying such  a model to the whole state and hoping to achieve positive  results? There will be none! There must be one tough team that  will work for one goal -- tough, but not in terms of methods,  but in subordination and mutual subordination. It must be  headed by a single commander who bears the entire responsibility  for the team and who is ready to be answerable before the people  for everything.    [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward the fact that  the former leadership set the minimal fixed capital required for  registering small enterprises at 37 million karbovantsi [K],  having thereby placed a barrier to their joining the business  sphere? Will not this affect the activity of big business,  which you represent?    [Babych] Small businesses must exist. This is why: They  create a potential medium for, let us put it this way, the  emergence of promising businessmen and entrepreneurs. In other  words, it is a desirable medium, which must discover the talents  and abilities of a certain circle of people who want to dedicate  themselves to business, which is, incidentally, very difficult  and not for everyone. Every person must decide for himself what  he wants to be -- master, performer, owner, co-owner, or a  simple state official. The state does not stimulate small  businesses. The state does not stimulate anything. The fiscal  system of taxes that is presently in use has practically led  production and the sphere of services, not to mention small  businesses, to an impasse.    My position and my program in this respect are clear: The  first thing that needs to be done today is to fully stimulate  the production activity of any person who wants to work, whether  in the state or nonstate sector. We are obliged to welcome  those people and those persons who want to work and create good  conditions for them.    First of all, there must be a sensible taxation policy,  including in the sphere of external economic activity. The  Ministry of Finance, which continues to degrade, must finally  realize that contributions to the budget must come from the  circulating capital that circulates in commerce and in  production. Turnover alone must contribute to the budget. At  the same time, it is desirable to lower taxes imposed upon the  population and upon production, and the state must stimulate  what it needs. At present, in our country, when the question of  Ukraine's survival is at stake, I would say, the policy of the  stumbling-block approach prevails.    Some people say: Russia has much oil -- let us also urgently  look for oil in our country. Let us look for diamonds and gold.  This must be immediately stopped, and we must abandon the  principle of raw-material development. Today, the only  salvation for the country's survival and for ensuring economic  stability is in the technological breakthrough. The state must  give urgent support to science, to the implementation of  technologies, and to the efficient utilization of production  capacities. I was, for example, surprised when I read that  Leonid Makarovych [Kravchuk] agreed to introduce preferential  taxation for builders. Those who are again going to put  something down the drain, have again obtained preferential terms  for taxation. This is not right. It is only science,  technology, and the creation of scientific hi-tech production  complexes, where science works for achieving the end result --  the output of absolutely essential technology, equipment,  machinery, and consumer goods -- which have the right to  preferential terms. Then we will emerge at the appropriate  level. Otherwise, we will always remain an appendage to anyone  -- Poland or Hungary. It is ridiculous: Hungary is presently  supplying us with meat and so on. The tax constriction and the  credits and finance system stifle the producer both in the state  and nonstate sectors. Unless serious measures in the opposite  direction are taken, the noose will choke the commodity producer  and we end up with food rationing....    [Correspondent] How do you assess the course of market  reforms in Ukraine?    [Babych] We have found ourselves on the verge of ruining  market reforms. The world community is watching us very  attentively. Those people who sit in their offices do not,  perhaps, imagine the lightning speed with which Western  investment, banking, financial, and governmental circles respond  to the events in Ukraine. After Mr. Moroz was elected chairman  of the Supreme Council, foreign investments through the  Ukrainian Financial Groups were immediately suspended. There  was one question: Please give a distinct definition: Is he a  Socialist or a Communist? Restoration of planned economy?  Following the election of the two deputy Supreme Council  chairmen, the reaction was similar. Therefore, those people who  sit in governmental offices and in the parliament do not even  realize that the adoption of any decision must conform to the  interests of the state and world community. We have become too  important and independent people. We have failed to realize one  thing: There is no such thing as pure independence in this  world. Everything is integrated, whether we want it or not, into  mutual economic and financial relations. This must be  distinctly understood by our young parliament, which is yet to  learn the experience of statehood, since the first period in its  work resembled the approach usually exhibited by teams on the  block: Let us create teams on our block and start pulling the  rope in order to determine which team is stronger. I believe,  however, that in two or three months, people will realize that  they did not come to the parliament in order to stand up for the  interests of regions, departments, or factions, but for  resolving nationwide problems. I hope that by the end of the  year, if the people do not disband us by that time, real state  work will start, and every faction and every deputy will realize  that he is responsible for the state, and not for a party or  industry; that he is responsible for the 52 million people  living on this territory.    [Correspondent] An idea is being considered of how to  stabilize credits -- to grant them in a different form, via  authorized banks.    [Babych] Still, I consider the problem of elaborating a  distinct and efficient mechanism for repaying credits to be a  major one. Why do many of our structures not receive credits  abroad? Because there is no mechanism for their repayment.    Behind all of this, one can see maneuvers of the Cabinet of  Ministers, which is trying to create a semblance of activity.  There are borderlines for any Cabinet of Ministers and for any  person, and they are incapable of overstepping them. I call it  a barrier or a limit to human possibilities. In most cases,  people themselves put them. In my life, I repeatedly broke that  barrier. One needs to have vigor to overstep it. Our  government is made up of generally good and normal people, but  they have a limit to the possibilities of elaborating a  decision. They must do one of two things: Either take one step  forward and say that we must proceed along the road of the  market and implement specific reforms or honestly give way to  others, who are not afraid to do this very difficult job. It  takes courage to make such a step. This applies to the  parliament, president, and Cabinet of Ministers. Unless this is  done, there will be an impasse zone, a dead zone. However,  there is a hope that people capable of overstepping that  borderline will come and they will know what is the main thing  and what to do next.    [Correspondent] As a candidate for Ukrainian president, are  you in favor of Ukraine's territorial integrity or do you admit  some variants? Do you see ways for resolving the Crimean  problems?    [Babych] My approach to this problem is unambiguous. Once,  when Ukraine was disassociating itself from the USSR, we  welcomed that event. We also believed that we were doing the  right thing when the community of the people populating Ukraine  voted for life in a separate state. They believed that it was  correct. I believe that the process of the disintegration of  Russia and possibly also of Ukraine has not been halted.    With regard to the Crimea, I have the following approaches.  I will say openly: I personally and a group of my specialists  made proposals well in advance, proposals which anticipated the  present development of events in the Crimea and we offered  recommendations for what had to be done for the Crimea not to  raise the question of seceding from Ukraine. In all cases, I  put the economic factor above all. Politics is a greater  economy and not the other way around. We are constantly being  misled. Those old times when states were divided by wars,  cudgels, and so on have passed. At present, states, markets,  and territories are divided at the expense of economic  decisions. Therefore, the Crimean problem should have been  resolved earlier, one and a half or two years ago, through  giving the Crimea economic incentives and tying it to Ukraine,  so that it would have simply been disadvantageous for it to  secede. This was not done. There were hopes that the new  constitution and possible use of force would restrain the  people, who might suddenly want to leave Ukraine. Consequently,  if the majority of the population votes for the Crimea's  secession from Ukraine, then, I am afraid, there may arise a  situation in which the constitution and the will of the people  residing in the Crimea will not conform to the mutual interests  of not only Ukraine, but also of the world community. We will  be confronted with the problem of the emergence of a new state  on the territory of Europe. I would also like to stress: There  is no need to stir up passions around this question. It is  necessary to try and convince the Crimea, just like any partner  or friend, that it would be economically unprofitable for it to  sever ties with us, and to promote a transformation of mutual  economic relations. Even now, it is still not too late to  create such conditions of mutual understanding precisely on the  economic platform, so that it would be worthwhile for the Crimea  to remain within Ukraine and work together. In my opinion, any  other approach will be fraught with negative phenomena to the  point of a civil war.    My position with regard to territorial integrity is  straightforward: Ukraine is indivisible. However, I repeat:  When the people have voiced their will, one needs to proceed  from the position of what the people want. When 90 percent of  Ukraine's population voted for the secession from Russia, should  there have been a war with Russia? If Russia failed to keep us  within the Union economically and to prove the expediency of  such union, then let us also treat other peoples' will in the  same way. We must learn to convince people and not to break  them.    [Correspondent] How serious is the outflow of capital from  Ukraine to the Crimea?    [Babych] Such a problem exists. During one of the meetings  with head of the government Mr. Zvyahilskyy, I also asked: What  measures have been taken in response to [Crimean President]  Meshkov's economic edicts? I understood that the government,  the Ministry of Finance, and the National Bank did not react to  Meshkov's step in any way. Meshkov has a rather good team of  professionals who have found an ideal method of knocking out  from under Ukraine its economic and financial footstool, not  even stool, but precisely the footstool, the last footstool  being taken away from it. A thoroughly considered economic blow  below the belt. A huge amount of capital flows away from  Ukraine. It is time for our major leaders to realize that they  must react in time to these or other actions. I can say that  Meshkov has made a brilliant move, which is advantageous for  him, but if we don't make a reciprocal move, no monetary mass at  all will remain in Ukraine. What then? To take submachine guns  and go and get what money is available? Such a development of  events can be predicted, but I do not think that the National  Bank has sufficient combat capabilities. Other methods and  approaches are necessary here.    [Correspondent] How do you see Ukraine's National Bank  [NBU]? Is is worth placing the NBU at the mercy of the  parliament?    [Babych] I do not share the opinion of those who believe  that the National Bank must be thrown to the mercy of the  parliament or Cabinet of Ministers. The National Bank must be  at the head of the state's financial system. It must receive a  distinct set of regulations on mutual relations, in other words,  a financial policy, from the legislative body -- the Supreme  Council. All other problems must be resolved by it  independently. It must have a priority in the economy -- a  stabilization of the national currency. Everything else  constitutes levers of the mechanism for implementing reforms in  the economy. Therefore, any economic reform which intensifies  the inflation process has no right to exist. We must  consciously agree to a certain inflation process, but a specific  one, through the National Bank. Enormous masses of coupons and  capital have been frozen, but the people wait. Circulating  capital is simply insufficient. It is consequently immediately  necessary to stop financing those industries whose output is not  in demand and goes to warehouses, and to help such enterprises  to appraise the situation. Here, the main thing for the state  is to stabilize its national currency.    [Correspondent] President of the Russian "Economic News  Agency" Sergey Turanov telephoned the Press Center and said that  they learned with interest that a Ukrainian entrepreneur,  well-known in Russia, has become a candidate for the Ukrainian  presidency. On behalf of the agency, Sergey Turanov asked us to  put the following question: "How do you see the future of  mutual economic relations between Ukraine and Russia, especially  today?"    [Babych] Much has already been said about this. I very  seldom change fundamental approaches, especially when I am  convinced of their correctness. In 1991, prior to signing the  state agreement between Russia and Ukraine, we signed, at our  own initiative, an agreement between the entrepreneur circles of  the two countries. There is also my signature under that  document. At that time, I had to hear everything from our  National Guard -- that I was selling Ukraine and so on. I never  sold anything. I am not selling anything now. Even to global  and nonglobal problems, my approach is only from the economic  point of view. Any restriction of economic possibilities and  slow circulation of capital are economically harmful. I am in  favor of integrating maximum possible conditions for production,  circulation of capital, finance, and so on. I can answer the  question in the following way: I am against creating closed  economic circles. There must be specialization and the division  of labor on an international scale. All possible and impossible  industries should not be concentrated on a single territory.    [Correspondent] If you become president, how do you see the  struggle against the mafia and corruption?    [Babych] I will say clearly: It is necessary to combat this  evil. However, we should not forget this: When we blame the  Ministry of Internal Affairs and other bodies which must  struggle against this phenomenon, we must remember that under  the uniform and under the shoulder boards there is a human being  who has a family and who needs a normal salary so that he will  not look for additional sources of income. We must approach all  these processes from the point of view of the economy. It is  necessary for all our structures to have, in their everyday  activity, the interests of the people at the foreground. It is  only with methods of the economy that we can fight the corrupt  mafia.    [Correspondent] It is known that an edict on currency  regulation is sitting on the president's desk. The Supreme  Council has also prepared such a law. What is your point of  view?    [Babych] Currency regulation is what must be done. However,  it is not a panacea for rescuing the economy. I think that  practically nothing will change over the next two or three  weeks. I read that project. It is ineffective and will not  introduce any cardinal changes into currency regulation. I  believe that, unless a new premier is elected within the next  two or three weeks, a premier who would have freedom of action,  nothing will change. All the more so since all the rayon and  oblast leaderships have now practically given up management of  the economy, are only interested in their own election affairs,  and are occupied with elections of deputies, mayors, and  governors. Therefore, a month of anarchy is guaranteed for  Ukraine. However, I hope that this anarchy will end on 26 June.    [Correspondent] If, in the stage of the presidential  election campaign, President Kravchuk introduces the hryvnya,  how will this affect Ukraine's economy?    [Babych] I consider introduction of the hryvnya, without  three main preconditions, to be a political adventure,  irrespective of who initiates this action -- the president,  parliament, or some other persons. This would be yet another  case of deception of the people. I have become convinced: In  our country the state is the worst thief -- it robs the  population particularly badly. I can prove this on any examples  -- not once did the state turn out the pockets of the population.    Introduction of the hryvnya is only possible on three  conditions. First, the creation of a stabilization fund and the  unconditional arrest of the hyperinflation. Second, indexation  of the funds held by the population, so that the people would be  encouraged not to spend and not to get rid of the coupons mass.  Third, a change in the financial and credit and taxation policy.    It is only under such conditions that we will be able to  resolve the question of introducing the hryvnya. I have long  been insisting on introducing the hryvnya, because the hryvnya  will resolve many problems. If we do this, we will eliminate  the so-called panic buying. Today, nobody -- not a single  person -- wants to keep coupons. If we stop this process we will  see how the market will become saturated, not like today, when  some leaders boast that a stabilization in the economy has  occurred as well as a stabilization of the market, although it  is a different matter: Meat stays on the shelves not because  the market is saturated, but because the people have no money to  buy it. I reiterate that introduction of the hryvnya without  ensuring these conditions is a political adventure.    [Correspondent] How do you see the future of atomic power  engineering in Ukraine?    [Babych] I am not a professional for making far-reaching  forecasts. However, I am sure that we will not abandon atomic  power engineering, even though the shadow of Chernobyl is  hanging above us. I was a member of the Governmental Commission  for Eliminating the Consequences of the Chernobyl Catastrophe.  Let us hope, with God's help, that this will never happen  again. I will be able to give a more detailed answer to this  question after I study additional information on the problems of  power engineering.    [Correspondent] What is your attitude toward privatization  in Ukraine?    [Babych] It is negative toward that privatization, which is  presently under way. We have not prepared economic or financial  mechanisms for implementing privatization. At present, the  state structures responsible for privatization have grown so  corrupt that commercial structures, in their development, did  not even dream of anything like that. Enterprises are handed  over to unworthy persons. You know where the problem here lies?  To distribute "bricks" among everybody is not a problem. It is  more difficult to make those "bricks" provide profits. This is  a very big problem. When we say that privatization is a gift for  the people, we are once again deceiving the people.    I am in favor of the joint-stock form of ownership. This  form is more open and more accessible. It does not tie up every  one of its owners to some "property." If a person obtains his  part in the form of shares, he can sell them, exchange, or  deposit. With our privatization we have again tied up the  people to the "brick," and have not made them owners of anything  real. For example, in Great Britain, over two years, 5 percent  of state property was privatized. We for our part want to carry  out privatization of 90 percent of property. This is not  serious. We generally tend to run now to the left and now to  the right. This is not the way to establish market relations.  This is not a basis for establishing a market. This is not a  basis for establishing private ownership, but yet another shady  enterprise. In my opinion, the present privatization model must  be revised. The process of privatization must be halted in  order to prepare a normal financial and economic mechanism and  only after that advance forward.    [Correspondent] Valeriy Heorhiyovych, speak louder, so that  you would be HEARD. At the parliament.    [Babych] My voters in Western Donbass have heard me. I was  a complete stranger when I came there and said: "My principle  is to come to you as a stranger and leave as a friend." If the  people believe that I am not a stranger, I will probably become  a friend to them.</p>

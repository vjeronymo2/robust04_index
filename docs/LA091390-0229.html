			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CHARTER SAVINGS BANK IS PUT UP FOR SALE  </P> <P> Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach and three other failed California savings  and loans were among 65 government-run thrifts nationwide that federal  regulators put up for sale Wednesday.  </P> <P> Regulators hope to sell or close the institutions by the end of the year, said  Kate Spears, a spokeswoman for the Resolution Trust Corp., which manages and  liquidates failed thrifts.  </P> <P> The 65 small- to medium-size thrifts hold a total of $9.7 billion in deposits.  </P> <P> Regulators also expect to offer for sale a number of major thrifts -- those  with assets that exceed $1 billion -- during the government's fiscal quarter  ending Dec. 31.  </P> <P> Besides Charter, regulators are peddling Brookside Savings and Southwest  Savings, both in Los Angeles, and Time Savings in San Francisco.  </P> <P> Charter, which has $281.9 million in deposits, was declared insolvent and  seized by regulators June 15, after securities losses and losses resulting from  its 1988 acquisition of a troubled S&amp;L wiped out its capital. The FBI also  is investigating bank fraud and embezzlement charges stemming from Charter's  collapse.  </P> <P> With the pending sale of Charter, only one failed county thrift, Lincoln  Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, remains in such bad financial shape that the  government is not offering it for sale. The only other failed county thrift  still operating is Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington Beach, which  regulators hope to sell by the end of the month.  </P> <P> Since the agency was created 13 months ago, it has seized five county thrifts  and assumed management of five other failed thrifts. Nine other of the S&amp;Ls  that have collapsed since 1985 were either sold or closed by RTC's predecessor  agency, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.  </P></p>

			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / Bush takes campaign trail south PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday began a campaign train trip through the south-east, aimed at convincing the region's 'Reagan Democrats' that he can deliver a better economic performance in a second term. Mr Bush will travel from Atlanta, Georgia, through South Carolina to Raleigh in North Carolina in an attempt to secure victories in states once thought to be certain bets for the Republicans. While Mr Bush's chances are still estimated to be good in South Carolina, in Georgia and North Carolina he looks increasingly vulnerable to Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic contender. The president has to contend with the special appeal of an all-southern Democratic ticket; an advantage pressed home by Mr Clinton and his running mate, Tennessee Senator Al Gore. But the Bush camp believes the race is still close enough for him to win respectably in the south. Polls show that he trails Mr Clinton by fewer points in southern states than he does nationally.</p>

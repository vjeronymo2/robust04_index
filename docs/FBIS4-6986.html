			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 23 KYODO -- Despite brighter prospects  of the future course of the economy, many companies remain  cautious in their recruiting policies for the next fiscal year,  according to a KYODO NEWS SERVICE survey.    The survey showed that most of the companies that were  polled  and that have already decided their recruiting plans for next  spring intend to reduce their workforce, although most believe  the economy will pick up by the end of the year.    Of the 150 major companies nationwide polled, only 60, or  about 40 percent, have already worked out recruitment plans for  the year starting in April 1995, reflecting the lingering  uncertainty over the economic outlook.    Only four of the 60 firms are willing to boost the number of  recruits for next spring, while 37 plan reductions and 19 will  keep this fiscal year's level.    The prudency about recruiting came despite a finding in the  same survey that most of the companies polled think the economy  has bottomed out or will hit bottom by the end of the year.    Those which projected an economic recovery during the  October- December quarter this year numbered 54, while another  22 firms answered that the economy has already hit bottom. The  two groups and others which forecast a pickup by the year-end  account for a dominant 77 percent of the 150 companies polled.    The survey, taken in mid-April, showed that labor policies  are particularly austere in such industrial sectors as  construction, dogged by the after effects of the series of  bribery scandals, high yen-hit automakers and electronics  makers, and airlines suffering from dwindling earnings.    For instance, major contractor Kajima Corp. plans to halve  the number of recruits for next spring to 200, while Taisei  Corp., also a leading builder, has decided on a 20 percent cut  in its fast-track career staff.    Leading exporters like Toyota Motor Corp., Mitsubishi Motors  Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. cited the dismal  business climate and the murky economic outlook as reasons for  recruits-cutting programs.    Japan Air System plans to employ no new recruits next fiscal  year, while Japan Airlines also will hire only pilots.    Steelmakers like Kobe Steel Ltd. and Nippon Steel Corp.,  which are in the midst of drastic labor reductions, and  foodstuff and pharmaceutical makers, including Ajinomoto Co. and  Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., also have decided to slim labor.    In contrast, Japan's telecom giant Nippon Telegraph and  Telephone Corp. (NTT), leading computer maker Fujitsu Ltd. and  video game behemoth Nintendo Co. are among those willing to  increase the labor force, especially for their promising new  businesses such as multimedia.    The KYODO survey also found that an increasing number of  companies are shifting to more flexible employment and see no  need to cling to a longstanding Japanese corporate custom to  collectively recruit in spring.    In a question about future employment policies, two thirds  of  the 129 companies which came up with answers said they will  continue spring-time recruitment but many of the others said  they are studying employing more experienced workers and  recruiting not only in the spring but in other times of the year.    The latter group includes consumer electronics giant Sony  Corp., known for its maverick labor policies, Mitsubishi Motors  Corp. and Jusco Co., a leading supermarket operator.</p>

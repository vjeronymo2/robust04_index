			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / International Company News: Skandia stages sharp recovery at nine months SKANDIA, the Swedish insurer, yesterday announced a SKr3.95bn (Dollars 477m) nine-month management operating profit and said it was on course for a full-year result 'which may be amongst the best we have ever achieved'. This is a dramatic turnround from 1992 when the group had a management operating loss of SKr3.74bn due to heavy credit insurance losses, falling property values and large claims from Hurricane Andrew. Group performance this year has been helped by a one-time SKr1.45bn gain from the sale of its 26 per cent stake in the German life insurer, Hamburg-Mannheimer.</p>

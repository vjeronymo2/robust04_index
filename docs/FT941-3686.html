			<p>940315 FT  15 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Rugby hits Pounds 63.8m and encouraged by outlook Pre-tax profits of Rugby Group, the supplier of cement to the UK, European and US construction industries, rose by more than a tenth last year, from Pounds 57.6m to Pounds 63.8m. On the back of the improvement the final dividend is being lifted from 3.6p to 3.92p making a 6.77p (6.45p) total. A 1-for-1 scrip issue is also proposed. Most forecasters had expected Rugby to do no more than hold the dividend at the previous year's level. The rise in operating profits from Pounds 52.8m to Pounds 64.6m, of which acquisitions accounted for about Pounds 2m, was also higher than expected. At the pre-tax level, profits were held back by a Pounds 1.2m loss on the sale of the group's French glass business at the end of last year. Earnings per share rose by 10.7 per cent to 14.5p (13.1p). Turnover increased by 16.2 per cent, from Pounds 650.1m to Pounds 755.4m. The group, which also signalled that it was looking for acquisitions, was moderately encouraged about the state of construction markets in the US and Australia and in the UK. Mr Peter Carr, managing director, said that UK cement sales had risen by 5 per cent during the first ten weeks of this year compared with the corresponding period of 1992. Sales were not expected to continue to rise at this rate but could still increase by about 3 per cent this year provided the housing market recovery was not undermined by tax increases and spending cuts on road building maintenance were not too deep. Cement prices on average had risen by 4 per cent at the beginning of the month. These, unlike increases in previous years, were expected to hold although perhaps not by the full amount. UK cement profits, boosted by a Pounds 1m pension refund, rose by 5.4 per cent last year Pounds 17.7m. UK joinery profits, benefiting from the housing market recovery and helped by price increases, rose by 20 per cent to Pounds 17.6m. Australian cement and lime profits, assisted by additional capacity, improved by 6.8 per cent to Pounds 12.5m. COMMENT Rugby's reputation as a well managed building materials group is deserved. It has ridden out the recession well and rewarded its shareholders with an early return to dividend increases. Profit forecasts are likely to be upgraded in the light of yesterday's figures but the rate of recovery in the UK could be slow. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 76m would put the group on a prospective p/e of 19. Most of Rugby's virtues are already recognised in this rating. Future fireworks may depend on acquisitions.</p>

			<p>920722 FT  22 JUL 92 / Business and the Environment: A case of sink or swim - Politicians and businessmen are working together to clean up the Mediterranean As the dust settles on last month's Earth Summit in Rio, environmentalists are shifting their focus from global to regional issues in a series of post-Rio gatherings designed to assess the implications of the summit for specific parts of the globe. The first big meeting of its kind came earlier this month, with a two-day conference of business and political leaders to discuss ways of improving environmental protection in the Mediterranean without sacrificing industrial development and growth. Organised by the Aspen Institute in Italy, the meeting, appropriately held on a cruise liner sailing between Genoa and Corsica, brought together environmental luminaries such as Carlo Ripa di Meana, the European Community's Commissioner for the Environment until earlier this month, and Giorgio Ruffulo, the former Italian environment minister, whose job Ripa di Meana has just taken. Among the senior businessmen present were Gabriele Cagliari, chairman of Italy's state-owned Eni energy and chemicals group, while the whole affair was chaired by Gianni De Michelis, Italy's former foreign minister. The Mediterranean is a test case for many wider environmental issues, notably oil and marine pollution. Aspen rules mean all discussion is off the record, and delegates cannot be quoted. However, as one senior Egyptian floridly, noted: 'We, the 17 countries of the Mediterranean basin are hosts and guests, serving and being served at the one common round table, the sea, our common but colourful dish. We get what we produce and what we present; whatever we give to the sea, it gives back to us, multiplied and magnified; if good we reap the best and if bad we harvest the worst.' The Mediterranean's problems are immediately apparent. Three years ago, millions of holidaymakers curtailed their seaside vacations unexpectedly as an army of summertime algae invaded Adriatic beaches. The problem has not recurred, at least as severely, but the Mediterranean continues to serve as one of the world's biggest liquid dustbins. Some 120 coastal cities discharge their sewage into its waters, around 85 per cent of it untreated. It is estimated that 24 per cent of Mediterranean beaches are unsuitable for swimming because of the sewage risk alone. Meanwhile, within the cocktail of industrial waste finding its way into the sea are around 120,000 tonnes of mineral oils, 60,000 tonnes of detergents, 3,800 tonnes of lead, 2,400 tonnes of chromium and 100 tonnes of mercury. Intensive agriculture in countries bordering the Mediterranean means that huge quantities of farm chemicals also drain into the sea. And estimates of other chemical discharges include 800,000 tonnes of phosphorous, 320,000 tonnes of nitrogenous compounds a year and 120,000 tonnes of phenols. Delegates saw little sign of the chemicals. But sailing from Genoa, Italy's leading oil port, they had first-hand evidence of one of the biggest pollution hazards afflicting the Mediterranean. Around 35 per cent of the world's petroleum products transported by sea pass through its waters, contributing to the roughly 500,000 tonnes of crude oil pollution a year, according to one estimate. Not surprisingly, discussions were long on the problems and short on solutions. However, the conference brought a range of regional environmental issues into relief. None more so than the potential conflict between the need for urgent industrial development in less-developed Mediterranean states and the environmental risks. Faster economic growth is a priority for poorer states in the region, which are also facing huge population increases, as many north African delegates underlined. Algeria's population will have grown fivefold between 1950 and 2025 if current predictions prove correct. By contrast, it would take France 2,000 years to raise its population as much, based on the current rate of change. And whereas in 1950, two thirds of the total populathen 350m people - lived in countries on the sea's northern fringe, by 2025 the same proportion will be to the south, while the overall population will have risen to 540m. Meawnhile, income differences are likely to become more acute. As matters stand, per capita annual income in the region ranges from only Dollars 600 in Egypt to Dollars 19,490 in France, according to World Bank figures. But while environmental concerns have grown in rich, industrialised countries like France, Italy and Spain, which border the Mediterranean and use its waters to service a variety of seaboard and water-dependent industries, many of the less-developed countries in the region, particularly in north Africa, aim to create just a fraction of that coastal industrial infrastructure. The demand for electricity alone is set to rocket in states on the Mediterranean's southern and eastern flanks. From a present annual generating capacity of around 110bn kWH, capacity is expected to rise to 900-1,100bn kWH by 2010, according to one expert. In the absence of new technologies, the increase will have immense effects on water use for cooling and evaporation. Hence the main focus of the meeting was on the potential role of European business in helping the Mediterranean's poorer nations continue their industrialisation process, which is essential to provide the resources for their growing populations, without destroying their own environments and the common heritage formed by the Mediterranean itself. With the sea recognising no political boundaries, pollution from one Mediterranean country can quickly end up elsewhere at the whim of the wind and tides. Surprisingly, demands for more resources, either from individual governments or from the EC, the most important political entity in the region, were conspicuous by their absence. Numerous environmental measures for the Mediterranean are already in place, both at EC level and unilaterally on the part of certain member states. 'Money which comes from the developed countries can only be supplemental,' noted one speaker. Likewise, few present called for halting industrial development in poorer parts of the region. Even committed environmentalists accepted that the economic needs spurred by explosive population growth meant greater industrialisation was inevitable, and indeed desirable, if political systems were not eventually to collapse under the demographic strain. Instead, the emphasis was on 'sustainable development' for the region, and closer monitoring of environmental risks and new industrial projects which could worsen the damage. In an on-the-record press conference after the meeting, De Michelis stressed the conference's call for the prompt application in the Mediterranean of Agenda 21 - the environmental programme approved in Rio - to make the region a guinea pig for similar action elsewhere. His demand for a new Mediterranean Investment Bank drew less approval from delegates, many of whom stressed the adequacy of existing bodies for development aid and environmental monitoring. But all agreed that better co-ordination between such institutions was an essential for governments and big business in the region to tackle the linked priorities of environmental protection and sustainable development. Only by improved co-operation between existing environmental bodies and organisations like the European Commission could action be taken to 'map' the environmental problems of the region prior to closer assessment. And only by improved 'networking' between big companies could industry contribute to regional needs by 'benchmarking' to learn from the example of companies already performing best on environmental protection.</p>

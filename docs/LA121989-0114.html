			<p><P> December 19, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: COUNTYWIDE  </P> <P> The 12th in a series of video store robberies occurred just after 10 a.m.  Monday, police said. Since September, video stores in National City, Chula  Vista and San Diego have been robbed, apparently by the same person, San Diego  police spokesman Bill Robinson said.  </P> <P> The latest store to be hit was Blockbuster Video in the 3000 block of  Clairemont Drive in San Diego. A man in his late 30s, wearing a camouflage hat,  blue sweat shirt and gray running shoes, showed a handgun to employees and made  off with an undisclosed amount of money, Robinson said. Although the attire has  been different, the physical descriptions of the person have been similar, he  said.  </P> <P> Lt. Jerry Moody said the robberies occurred within the same three-hour time  frame, adding that all but three of the stores have been part of the  Blockbuster chain. The store robbed Monday was also the first store robbed, on  Sept. 26, Moody said.  </P></p>

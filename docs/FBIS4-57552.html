			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on economic activities monitored through 19 May.    The National Statistics Institute has reported that the  Consumer Price Index increased by 3.52 percent in April. The  accrued inflation in the first quarter of the year added up to  11.65 percent as compared with 16.1 percent in the corresponding  period in 1993. Food and beverages, transportation, and  communications registered the highest price increases.  (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 3 May 94 p 8)    The trade deficit continued its upward trend in February,  reaching $51.8 million. Exports grew by 6.5 percent while  imports increased by nearly 17 percent in the first two months  of 1994, resulting in a $122.3 million deficit. The reasons  behind the trade deficit are: lack of competitiveness, the  increase in salaries, the cost of living, the decline in the  price of some products on the international market, and the  reduction of tariffs that spurred purchases of imported goods.  (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 4 May 94 p 9)    The Central Bank's net international reserves increased by  $2.3 million in April, totaling $1.2587 billion. International  reserves have increased by $56.8 million so far this year. The  monetary base shrunk by $201.5 million last month due to a  $208.8 million drop in the net domestic credit granted by the  Central Bank. (Montevideo EL PAIS in Spanish 5 May 94 Market  Indicators Section p 1)    Despite the fact that Uruguayan exports to Common Market of  the South, Mercosur, member countries increased by 25.1 percent  in the first two months of the year, its trade deficit with  these countries added up to $78.7 million, thus registering a  43.1 percent increase compared with the corresponding period in  1993. There is a trade deficit of $48.3 million with Brazil and  a deficit of $32.7 million with Argentina, while the surplus  with Paraguay amounts to $2.3 million. (Montevideo EL PAIS in  Spanish 5 May 94 Market Indicators Section p 1)    According to figures released by the Central Bank, Uruguay  grew by an average 3.3 percent per annum in the four years of  the Blanco Party administration. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR  ECONOMICO in Spanish 6 May 94 p 10)    The State Board of Sanitation chairman has reported that  public water rates increased by 11 percent as of 1 May.

The financial position of the public sector has been  deteriorating since last year, when after recording a $51  million surplus in the first quarter, it showed a deficit  amounting to 1.5 percent of GDP by the end of the year.  (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 9 May 94 p 11)    According to data released by the Central Bank, private  consumption in Uruguay grew by 25.7 percent from 1990 to 1993.  (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in Spanish 10 May 94 p 8)    The Central Bank reported on 9 May that the central  government registered a $12.6 million surplus in March. The  accrued government surplus in the first quarter of the year  totals $29.2 million. Despite these positive economic  indicators, the government's accounts continued to deteriorate  in the first quarter of the year, as revenues grew by 1.9  percent while expenditures increased by 11.6 percent.

(Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR  ECONOMICO in Spanish 11 May 94 p 9)    Uruguay's net external debt has dropped by 27 percent over  the last four years due to a 47 percent increase in net  international reserves. The per capita debt has declined from  $1,021 to $753 over the last four years. Nevertheless, the total  gross external debt has increased by 12.9 percent in the period  under consideration. It amounted to $7.89 billion at the end of  1993, thus representing 57 percent of GDP. The net external debt  totals $2.373 billion. (Montevideo EL OBSERVADOR ECONOMICO in  Spanish 11 May 94 p 9)    The Central Bank has reported that investments in fixed  capital grew by 11.8 percent in 1993 while private consumption  increased by 4 percent.

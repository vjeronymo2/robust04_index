			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / International Company News: Mortgage group sold for Dollars 328m SEARS, Roebuck, has sold its mortgage banking group to a Pittsburg-based bank holding company for Dollars 328m in cash. The sale is the latest in a series of planned spin-offs designed to trim Sears' financial businesses. The Sears Mortgage Banking Group, part of Coldwell Banker Residential Services, consists of Sears Mortgage Corp, Sears Mortgage Securities Corp and Sears Savings Bank. PNC Bank, which is buying the group, will add the units to its own retail banking operations. PNC Bank is the 11th-largest US bank, with Dollars 51bn in assets and 550 community banking facilities in north-eastern US. Mr Edward Brennan, Sears chairman, said: 'The successful completion of this transaction is another important step in Sears' previously-announced repositioning which will continue to enhance shareholder value.' Mr Brennan said efforts to sell the Coldwell Banker residential brokerage business were proceeding 'on schedule'. Industry analysts said an employee-led buy-out of the Sears property unit had been discussed, but apparently has not gained sufficient support. In the first quarter, the Coldwell Banker unit recorded a net loss of Dollars 7.7m, down from a profit of Dollars 3.8m the year before. Sears Mortgage last year was the seventh-largest mortgage writer in the US, generating Dollars 11.8bn in loans. It services a loan portfolio of Dollars 27.2bn. Sears Savings Bank has assets of around Dollars 6.7bn, mostly in residential mortgage loans. Sears Mortgage Securities is one of the leading conduits for securitising private home loans in the US and has a portfolio of Dollars 8.7bn. The sale to PNC is the second major asset sale for Sears this year. In February, Sears sold 20 per cent of its Dean Witter Reynolds and Discover Card units in an initial public offering. The offering, which was oversubscribed, brought in more than Dollars 800m. Sears plans to complete the Dean Witter spin-off later this year. Sears has also said it would sell portions of its profitable Allstate Insurance business.</p>

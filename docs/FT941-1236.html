			<p>940325 FT  25 MAR 94 / Ingenuity - The FT Engineering Review (8): Foundry finds a giant niche - DPC tells Paul Cheeseright what was involved in its decision to switch to the heavy castings market / Profile: Deritend Precision Castings Deritend Precision Castings has been looking for size and not just in the normal corporate sense of expansion. Rather it has sought and found the ability to cast ever larger components for use in power station turbines. Production of these large components by investment casting, as opposed to fabricating or forging, is what earns it a specialist market niche. Plenty of companies can cast the small components but, said Mr Paul Farrow, managing director of DPC, 'there is only one other site in the world capable of casting large casings,' and that is in the US. This concentration on the heavy component end of the turbine market is of relatively recent duration, but in some respects it has saved the company. DPC has been a foundry player since 1948 and a leader in UK investment castings. By the late 1980s it was under threat. 'People come up with cheaper products. You've got to offset this by coming up with a product which is better and for which there is a high entry cost,' said Mr Farrow. At the same time the company 'perceived a requirement for large investment cast components for the industrial gas turbine which would substitute for forgings and fabrications'. The market analysis went further. It forecast that, with any peace dividend, there would be problems with sales to the defence and aerospace industries. So there was a case for trying to shift the direction of sales. The share of the industrial turbine makers in DPC's customers has risen to 85 per cent from 48 per cent in 1988. Supplying the industrial turbine market has been a focal point of Triplex Lloyd investment. Triplex Lloyd acquired DPC in 1989 and its power division, of which DPC is a part, has consistently raised profits. DPC's own sales have been on a steadily rising trend as the power business proved almost invulnerable to recession. DPC had annual sales of Pounds 7m in 1988, just before the Triplex Lloyd takeover. In the year to March 1993 sales were Pounds 18.6m and for the financial year just finished they will probably turn out to be about Pounds 20m. The way the activities of the group have been switched round is apparent in its international market share. In some areas, like the very large vacuum castings, it has 100 per cent, but at the level of the smaller castings its share drops to 12 per cent. The larger products now account for 30 per cent of DPC's business. The cost of this switch in the emphasis of DPC's business so far has been Pounds 5m on equipment with another Pounds 1m left to spend and between Pounds 1.5m and Pounds 2m on product development. This enabled it to handle castings weighing up to 500 kg, compared with only 30 kg previously. To handle such heavy castings, a fresh approach to the making of the wax moulds into which the metal is poured has been required. Larger furnaces have been needed. Because the weights involved have increased there has had to be a greater reliance on robotics. The creation of larger and larger castings has meant that strains in the metal alloys, different from those in smaller components, have needed new metallurgical insights. With the new equipment, DPC will be able to push its sales up by 50 per cent to Pounds 30m a year. But the arrival of new equipment has meant changes to the physical lay-out of DPC's plants at Droitwich, Worcestershire. There production is concentrated in two plants - Vines Lane, which has been redeveloped, and Berry Hill, half a mile distant, where finishing takes place and support services are situated. Like other engineering companies, DPC has coalesced its move to new products and new techniques with a change in manufacturing organisation. It too has adopted cellular manufacturing. At Vines Lane, the cells are based on the large products, the smaller products and a jobbing operation which produces components to special order in small quantities. Introduction of cellular manufacturing has had familiar effects. The lead time for orders has been reduced from 16 weeks in 1991 to between eight and 12 weeks, with the aim of coming down to eight. The overall capital base - that is fixed assets and working capital - has been reduced by eight per cent. 'We have stopped component tourism,' declared Mr Farrow - that is half-made products do not wander around the plant any more. These changes were accompanied by a new emphasis on training and DPC management now claims that each employee is multi-skilled. These investments in equipment, products and people have kept DPC in the game it has chosen to play. The gas turbine market has grown steadily. 'It has probably reached a peak in terms of placing orders,' said Mr Farrow. 'But there is a spares requirement later and this has not started. Over the next 10 years we don't see any decline in the total of parts required.'</p>

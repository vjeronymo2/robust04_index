			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / China stresses 'strong desire' for HK accord CHINA yesterday stated its strong desire to reach an agreement with Britain on Hong Kong, as negotiators met in Beijing for the 14th round of talks on the colony's political development. Mr Lu Ping, director of Chinese government's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, said in an interview with the Financial Times: 'We very much want to have an agreement; it's good for Hong Kong as well as China and Britain.' China recognised that both sides would need to make concessions to reach an agreement. 'In diplomatic talks there should always be mutual compromise,' he added. British and Hong Kong officials would not comment on the latest round of negotiations which are due to end today. But they have seen little evidence of a change in the Chinese position indicating a desire to reach swift agreement. Mr Lu said wide differences remained on both main areas of dispute: the so-called 'functional constituencies' which make up a part of Hong Kong's 60-strong Legislative Council, and an 'election committee' that will elect 10 members in 1995. He attributed the lack of progress to a fundamental difference of approach. Britain wished to secure agreement on the 'through train,' a guarantee China would not dismantle pre-1997 political arrangements after its takeover in that year, before agreeing to the details of the 1995 polls. China, on the other hand, wanted to settle the details of the election arrangements in 1994 and 1995 before agreeing to the 'through train.' 'The reason we agreed to hold talks is precisely because we want to have a 'through train',' Mr Lu said. 'We are fully for it but our desire is that we must first talk about the train itself. If we do not agree on that, the train cannot go through.' Mr Lu said China planned no changes in Hong Kong's basic liberties, such as freedom of the press, the rule of law and freedom of religious belief.</p>

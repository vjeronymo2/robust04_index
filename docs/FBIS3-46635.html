Formations of helicopter gunships and transport helicopters  flew above Paju, Yonchon and Chorwon Counties in an exercise of  air support to ground attack units and war materiel airlifting.    Such war exercises of the South Korean puppets are  premeditated provocative acts to incite North-South  confrontation and increase the danger of war.</p>

			<p><P> December 10, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> EXPANSION IN THE WORKS FOR GRAND SLAM CUP;  </P> <P> TENNIS: OFFICIALS OF THE TOURNAMENT, WHICH DEBUTS TUESDAY, SAY THEY PLAN TO  INCLUDE WOMEN IN THE EVENT.  </P> <P> It has been criticized and snubbed by leading players, but organizers of the  Grand Slam Cup, the richest tennis tournament in history, are already  considering expanding the event to include women.  </P> <P> The Grand Slam Cup, which starts Tuesday in Munich's Olympic Hall, is offering  a $6-million purse, with $2 million for the winner in the 16-man field.  First-round losers will collect $100,000, more than many tournaments pay to the  winner.  </P> <P> The purse has been described by Boris Becker as "perverse." Becker, John  McEnroe and Mats Wilander are skipping the inaugural event although they were  eligible.  </P> <P> Andre Agassi is also absent. The American, ranked fourth in the world, first  signed to play, but later announced he would pull out. Facing a fine and a  suspension, Agassi reversed his decision again and said he would play.  </P> <P> But Agassi suffered a rib injury during the Davis Cup final between the United  States and Australia 10 days ago and pulled out again.  </P> <P> This time he has a legitimate excuse but breaking the contract the first time  could still cost the flamboyant 20-year-old a hefty fine.  </P> <P> Despite the criticism and controversy, the Grand Slam Cup has attracted eight  top 10 players. From the top 10, only Agassi and Becker, No. 2 in the world,  are missing. The field is led by top-ranked Stefan Edberg and No. 3 Ivan Lendl.  </P> <P> Also playing are U.S. Open champ Pete Sampras; French Open winner Andres Gomez  of Ecuador; Michael Chang, Brad Gilbert, Aaron Krickstein, David Wheaton and  Kevin Curren; Goran Ivanisevic of Yugoslavia; Jonas Svensson and Christian  Bergstroem of Sweden; Thomas Muster of Austria; Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte  of France, and Andrei Cherkasov of the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Asked if organizers planned to expand the event to include women, tournament  director Bill Dennis said: "Clearly, yes. This has already been intensively  discussed between the ITF, the women's association WITA and us."  </P> <P> The Grand Slam Cup is being organized by the International Tennis Federation in  conjunction with the directors of the four Grand Slam events.  </P> <P> The Assn. of Tennis Professionals has been opposed to the Grand Slam Cup,  fearing that it was interfering with its own season-ending showcase tournament.  </P></p>

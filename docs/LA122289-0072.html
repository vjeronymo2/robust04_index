			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> SIMI POLICEWOMAN FILES HARASSMENT SUIT  </P> <P> A Simi Valley policewoman has sued the city, charging that she was sexually  harassed and improperly demoted because she was blamed for misconduct charges  brought against her ex-husband, one of seven officers named as defendants.  </P> <P> In a suit filed Wednesday in Ventura Superior Court, Officer Florence Trapani  says she became the target of a biased internal investigation, was improperly  removed from her post as a drug abuse resistance education (DARE) officer and  was warned she would receive no help from other officers in an emergency after  she was reassigned to patrol duties.  </P> <P> Trapani alleges that she was blamed for the personnel problems of her  ex-husband, Michael Bender, a popular detective.  </P> <P> Trapani's suit asks for an unspecified amount of money for loss of income and  suffering.  </P> <P> "We're mainly looking to get her reputation back," said her attorney, William  Rehwald of Woodland Hills. He said Trapani, 32, has been on stress leave from  the department since her reassignment in August. Bender, 34, also is on leave.  </P> <P> Simi Valley City Atty. John Torrance, City Manager Lynn Koester and Police  Chief Lindsey (Paul) Miller declined comment. Officials have said privately  that the Police Department became ensnared in the divorce and ensuing child  custody fight between the two officers.  </P> <P> Bender and Trapani were divorced in 1985. Trapani had been widely recognized  for her work in the DARE program. Bender was named the department's officer of  the year in 1983 and has repeatedly earned the title "Toughest Cop Alive" in  the biennial World Police and Fire Games.  </P> <P> Rehwald said the couple's divorce became a smoke screen for gender  discrimination in the Police Department.  </P> <P> Eight of the department's 105 officers are women.  </P> <P> According to Rehwald, Trapani's problems began last winter when she accused  Bender of attempting to fondle her in the police gym. During the department's  ensuing investigation, evidence surfaced that Bender had secretly taped  conversations with his ex-wife and others, a violation of state law. The  district attorney's office declined to prosecute.  </P> <P> The department's charges of sexual harassment and making illegal tapes were  eventually sustained against Bender. He has appealed to the city Personnel  Department. Bender faces a possible 10-day suspension and pay cut of $115 per  month for a year.  </P> <P> Harassment of Trapani by other officers became so intense that Miller decided  to transfer her to the Ventura County Police Academy as a training officer  until the controversy died down, Rehwald said. The suit says Trapani was told  in writing that her reassignment was temporary and that she would be returned  to the DARE program in six months.  </P> <P> According to the suit, she was removed from the DARE program instead and  assigned to patrol duty, only to be told by a supervisor that fellow officers  would not back her on the street or respond to her radio calls for help.  </P> <P> Named as defendants were the city of Simi Valley; Miller; Bender, and Officers  Michael Brewer, Rex Jones, Gary Collins, Ron Lompart, John St. Laurent and Glen  Peterson.  </P></p>

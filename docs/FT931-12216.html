			<p>930129 FT  29 JAN 93 / Obituary of Arthur Hellyer: Gardening writer ARTHUR HELLYER, garden-ing correspondent of the Financial Times, died yesterday aged 90 after a short illness. He had lived most of his life in Sussex and died at the Royal Gardeners' Benevolent Fund Home in Henfield, West Sussex. He started writing for the FT in the 1950s. One of the most distinguished careers in British gardening started in 1916, when the young Hellyer was ordered by his father to dig up the lawn and grow vegetables because German submarines were threatening British imports. Hellyer spent three years farming in Jersey before working for eight years at a general nursery in south-east England. In 1929, he moved from the potting shed to the printing shop when he became an associate editor of Commercial Horticulture, moving on to spend 30 years with Amateur Gardening. He was a fully trained expert, willing to be photographed in sensible jerseys - sometimes with a reassuring pipe in hand or mouth - to tell readers exactly how to lay a land drain, dig a trench, or make cabbage crop fertiliser. After the second world war, Hellyer was offered the editorship of Amateur Gardening, which he held for 21 years. His weekly column for the FT began 33 years ago with an article on the definitive art of weed control. Everyone who knew Hellyer came to admire his clarity, generosity, grasp of science and knowledge of plantsmanship. He leaves three children, Peter, Edward and Penelope. His wife, Grace Charlotte, died in 1977.</p>

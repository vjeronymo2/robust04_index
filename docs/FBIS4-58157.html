			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by News Research and Commentary Group] </F>   [Text] As you have heard in the news, Edib Bukvic, the  deputy prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina, left Tehran this  morning and was seen off by the vice president for legal and  parliamentary affairs of the Islamic Republic of Iran this  morning.    In the past three days, the Bosnian deputy prime minister  held talks with high-level political and cultural officials of  our country. In addition to issues pertaining to bilateral  relations, the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the future of  the country were also discussed and assessed.    The visit by the Bosnian deputy prime minister to Tehran  almost coincided with the last few days of the Croatian  minister's visit to Tehran. This provided a suitable  opportunity for a positive diplomatic effort in Tehran for  bringing the stances of the two countries closer. This is  extremely important in assisting the Bosnian Muslim nation in  its current difficult situation. In the course of these talks,  the establishment of a Bosnian-Croatian confederation, which was  proposed a few months ago and was approved by the Bosnian  parliament, was also discussed. This plan appears to be  welcomed by the two sides involved.    While in Tehran the deputy prime minister signed three  memoranda of understanding for cooperation in the political,  technical, scientific, and cultural fields with Iranian  officials. Of course, in the current difficult conditions,  these memoranda are more symbolic [preceding word in English]  and indicate the wishes of two Muslim countries for cooperation  in all fields. The Iranian nation, more than all the friends of  the Bosnian nation, has displayed the greatest support and  sympathy for the oppressed people of that country and special  relations will be forged with Bosnia-Herzegovina in the future  as well.    However, in the current circumstances it is significant that  the Iranian Government and people will muster all their efforts  to ease the hardships of the Bosnian Muslim people and to help  them extricate themselves from the present crisis. While doing  this they will certainly encounter the animosity and plots of  the common enemies of the Muslims.</p>

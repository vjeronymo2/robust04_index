			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / Chicken talking to a duck China must be integrated into the world economy to encourage it to be a co-operative and constructive global player, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding leader, told an economic conference in Singapore yesterday. He said he had underestimated how passionately the Chinese feel about national sovereignity and described Hong Kong's governor Chris Patten's talks with the Chinese government officials about the future of the colony as 'like a chicken talking to a duck'.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A law adopted by the House of Representatives  provides for renaming the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural  Resources the Ministry of Agriculture, Natural Resources, and  Environment. AKEL [the Restorative Party of the Working People]  abstained from the vote, claiming that a simple change of  ministry name would be a move without substance if there is no  prior discussion and correct decisionmaking on the structure of  departments that will deal with environmental issues.  Democratic Party deputy Nikolaos Mousiouttas also abstained  from the vote, claiming that the importance of environmental  issues is diminished when they are simply made part of another  ministry.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Respondent argues that the Department failed to address new evidence and arguments submitted by the RTG in the questionnaire responses on the record of this review which show that the BOT benchmark methodology is more representative of short-term commercial lending rates in Thailand than the Department benchmark methodology used in Steel Wire Rope. The respondent explained that the BOT compiles a database from monthly balance sheets and semi-annual income statements submitted by Thai commercial banks from which the BOT calculates a weighted-average commercial interest rate for short-term borrowing. Respondent asserts that this BOT benchmark has been consistently used in all Thai cases previous to Steel Wire Rope and was most recently verified in the 1989/90 administrative review of carbon steel butt-weld pipe fittings from Thailand.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Respondent also argues that the Steel Wire Rope benchmark is premised on a misunderstanding of the minimum loan rate (MLR) and minimum overdraft rate (MOR). Respondent asserts that the MLR and MOR are merely an indication of the commercial bank's prospective short-term lending rates, and that banks are free to make commercial loans below either the MLR or MOR. Commercial banks usually indicate high MLRs because certain loans cannot be made in excess of their MLRs. Further, the MOR carries a higher interest rate than regular loans and is used only when a loan has not been repaid by its due date. The MLR and MOR are ``prime'' rates from the perspective of the commercial banks, and exporters, as secured borrowers repaying in hard foreign currencies, often receive commercial loans at rates below these rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, respondent contends that the MLR and the MOR do not reflect the actual lending practices of commercial banks, and the Department should instead use the BOT benchmark to recalculate the benefits from all short-term loan programs found countervailable in this review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department has considered all the information submitted in respondent's questionnaire responses which explain in detail the methodology and sources of information used to calculate the BOT benchmark. However, using the data submitted by the respondent in the responses resulted, as it did in the final determination and order in Steel Wire Rope, in a BOT benchmark which was lower than the average of the monthly prime rates (MLRs and MORs) as compiled by BOT from commercial banks and published in the 1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin, and less even than the interbank lending rate reported in the government's response. Contrary to respondent's assertions that the MLR and MOR are merely indications of the commercial bank's prospective short-term lending rates, throughout the BOT Annual Report and Quarterly Bulletins, the MORs and MLRs are reported both as commercial banks' interest rates to prime customers or as prime rates (See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BOT 1990 Annual Economic Report <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at p. 51 and 55; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> December 1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , at p. 12 and Table 22,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> p. 32). Also, the prime rates are published in the BOT Annual Report under Thailand's Key Economic Indicators at page one. Further, it was found in Steel Wire Rope, that most of the commercial bank's short-term loans were made at the MOR/MLR rates. This is confirmed by the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 1990 BOT Quarterly Bulletin <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , Table 12 at p. 17 and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> BOT Annual Economic Report <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at p. 53. Finally, because the interbank lending rate is the rate at which a commercial bank obtains its funds, the BOT benchmark, which is less than the interbank lending rate reported in the government's response, demonstrates unmistakably that the BOT benchmark does not reflect commercial realities.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on these facts, the Department is not persuaded that the information submitted by respondent on the record of this review more accurately reflects the actual interest rates for commercial short-term financing in Thailand than the published MLR and MOR. Therefore, we determine that it is appropriate to continue to use the average of the MOR and the MLR as our benchmark interest rate in these final results of review.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 2: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Respondent contends that the Department should apply the 1989 benchmark rate to the benefit calculations for loans made under the EPC program in 1989 and repaid in 1990. Respondent argues that this methodology matches the appropriate benchmark rate to the time when the terms of the loans, including the interest rates, were set.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department's practice is to select a benchmark interest rate at the time the government and the firm agree on the terms of the loan, which in this case was when the loan was received. (See, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order; Steel Wire Rope from Thailand) (56 FR 46299, September 11, 1991). Therefore, we agree that the 1989 benchmark rate should be used for calculating the benefit of EPC loans received in 1989 but on which interest was paid in 1990 and have recalculated the benefit from this program. The revised net subsidy from this program is 0.32 percent  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> ad valorem. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment 3: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Respondent claims the Department did not follow its recent practice of accounting for EPC loans with repayments made both during and outside the review period. Respondent argues that, in calculating the benefit from this program, the Department should include the entire loan if partial repayments are made before and during the review period and exclude the entire loan if repayments are made during and after the review period. RTG specifically requested corrections to be made to 22 loans with payments both inside and outside the review period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

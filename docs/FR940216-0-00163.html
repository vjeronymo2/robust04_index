Inclusion of Sub-Octane Blendstock in Compliance Calculations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA has included conventional gasoline and gasoline blendstock <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 86 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  that is intended for downstream oxygenate blending in the set of products that must be included in the compliance calculations of refiners and importers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 86 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 80.2(s) defines gasoline blending stock or component as ``any liquid compound which is blended with other liquid compounds or with lead additives to produce gasoline.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most base gasoline that is used in downstream oxygenate blending operations meets the definition of gasoline and as a result must be included in refiner/importer compliance calculations without regard to the provisions related to blendstock. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 87 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Base gasoline meets the gasoline definition where the gasoline has the properties of gasoline that also is sold for use without oxygenate blending. For example, one common practice is to blend 10 vol% ethanol with 87 octane gasoline to produce 89.6 octane gasoline, and 87 octane gasoline is commonly sold for use without oxygenate blending. 87 octane base gasoline therefore meets the definition of gasoline.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 87 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 40 CFR 80.2(c) defines gasoline as ``any fuel sold in any State for use in motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines, and commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline.'' (footnote omitted).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Most ``sub-octane'' blendstock specifically designed for oxygenate blending also meets the definition of gasoline, because gasoline having similar properties is sold in certain regions of the country and at certain times of the year. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 88 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  For example, 85 octane blendstock_a ``sub-octane'' blendstock_is sometimes produced with the intention that with the addition of 10 vol% ethanol this blendstock will become 87 octane gasoline. However, because 85 octane gasoline is sold in the mountain states in the winter, 85 octane blendstock meets the definition of ``gasoline'' and is not a ``blendstock'' under the definition of that term even when it is blended with ethanol.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 88 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> For purposes of this discussion, ``sub-octane'' blendstock is blendstock that has an octane below 87.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Potentially there are ``sub-octane'' blendstocks that become gasoline solely through the addition of oxygenate and that have octanes that are lower than the octane of any gasoline sold anywhere in the United States. Such a product would not meet the definition of gasoline, but would be a blendstock.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA nevertheless believes that the refiner or importer who produces or imports ``sub-octane'' base gasoline product, rather than the oxygenate blender, should include the product in its compliance calculations for several reasons. First, the emissions performance of such products is determined primarily through its basic properties and not by the addition of oxygenate. Second, to the extent that a refiner or importer produced or imported ``sub-octane'' base gasoline in 1990, thus contributing to the quality of the gasoline pool in 1990, such product should be part of that refiner's or importer's conventional gasoline pool in 1995. Third, the refiner or importer of such product is likely to be more sophisticated than oxygenate blenders in defining the quality of conventional gasoline necessary to meet the requirements of the anti-dumping program, and in meeting the range of anti-dumping requirements that apply to refiners. Oxygenate blenders, who often are truck splash blender-distributors, are not required to meet anti-dumping standards (for reasons discussed above), but placing the responsibility of accounting for ``sub-octane'' base gasoline on oxygenate blenders would result in these parties becoming ``refiners'' who are subject to the full scope of anti-dumping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, if refiners and importers who produce or import ``sub-octane'' blendstock could avoid including this product in their compliance calculations, the anti-dumping enforcement requirements would have to be expanded to include complex (and expensive) product tracking and accounting mechanisms designed to ensure product of this type ultimately is accounted for, and is included in the compliance calculations of only a single party. EPA believes, therefore, that it is appropriate for the refiners and importers of ``sub-octane'' blendstocks to include such products in their compliance calculations under the anti-dumping program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This requirement for refiners and importers to include sub-octane ``blendstock'' in compliance calculations is consistent with, but less far-reaching than, the proposal contained in the 1992 SNPRM that refiners and importers would be required to account for all blendstock produced or imported.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Compliance Calculations for Blendstock That Is Blended With Gasoline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the SNPRM 93, EPA proposed that parties who produce gasoline solely by combining different blendstocks could determine compliance on the basis of the properties and volumes of the blendstocks without performing a full analysis of the final blends. This compliance determination approach also was intended to apply to parties who add blendstocks to finished gasoline which has been included in another party's compliance calculations. Under this proposal, refiners and importers would insert the properties and values of the blendstocks into the equations for the complex and simple model standards. EPA now believes this compliance calculation approach is appropriate only for simple model standards, but not for complex model standards because blendstocks have parameters that are outside the range of the complex model.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This approach is included in the final rule for refiners and importers subject to the simple model because a blender-refiner can calculate the volume-weighted averages of sulfur, T&hyph;90, olefins, and exhaust benzene using blendstock analyses only.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

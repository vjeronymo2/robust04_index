			<p>BFN     [Text] Singapore, May 19 (XINHUA) -- China is no longer a  centrally-planned economy as the market mechanism is now in the  dominating position in the country's economic activities,  China's Vice Premier Li Lanqing said here today.    In his keynote speech at the international conference "Waves  of the Future - ASEAN, Vietnam and China: Opportunities for  World Business," the Chinese vice premier told the 800-strong  audience: "market mechanism has taken a leading position in the  national economic activities" and China is now ready to better  integrate its economy into the world economy as a whole."    "Market regulates 84 percent of the country's industrial  activities, leaving 16 percent of the industrial goods subject  to planned production and allocation," Li elaborated.    Of all agricultural product sales by farmers in China,  mandatory plan covers only 12.5 percent, while of the total  retail sales, only 5.9 percent is priced by the government, he  added.    China's economic system has undergone significant changes,  Li  said, adding that a multi-form ownership pattern including state  ownership, collective ownership, private ownership, individual  ownership, foreign investors' ownership and common stock  ownership, which are developing simultaneously with the state  ownership as the mainstay, has taken shape in the country.    "Market mechanism has been playing an ever increasing role  in  allocating resources and providing growing impetus to the  domestic economic development," he said.    Li Lanqing arrived here Wednesday night to attend the  international conference jointly organized by the Asia Society,  Dow Jones and Company, Inc., and the Institute of Policy Studies  of Singapore.    He will also co-chair the inaugural joint steering council  meeting on the Suzhou industrial township project on Friday.</p>

			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / London expected to lag EC city league GREATER LONDON will see the slowest economic growth of the European Community's main city areas for the first half of the 1990s, while Greater Manchester will be second from the bottom of the EC league, a report from a group of research bodies says. The European Economic Research Consortium forecasts in a report on prospects for EC and Austrian city regions that five of the 10 slowest-growing areas will be in the UK. It expects the fastest-growing UK city region to be Edinburgh, ranked 23 out of 32, followed by Cardiff and Birmingham at 24 and 25 respectively, while the Glasgow-Strathclyde area is forecast to be 27th. These areas are expected to achieve annual increases of at least 2 per cent in gross value added between 1989 and 1996, while the value added to goods and services produced in London is expected to grow by only 1 per cent a year in that period. For Manchester, the consortium forecasts annual value-added growth of 1.4 per cent. Madrid and Berlin are expected to be the fastest-growing EC cities with annual value-added growth of 4.7 and 4.5 per cent respectively. The UK cities' poor growth outlook reflects the deep UK recession. But London has special problems including traffic congestion, high costs and de-industrialisation, while Manchester will be affected by a further decline in its textile and defence-related industries.

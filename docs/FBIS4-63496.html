			<p>BFN     [Text] We have received a statement from the press service  of the commander of Ukraine's National Guard:    As has become well-known, Valeriy Kuznetsov, Crimea's  minister of internal affairs, has disseminated false information  that the subunits of Ukraine's National Guard, which are  deployed in Simferopol, were supposedly brought to combat  readiness and received an order to storm the town's vital  facilities. In truth, the Simferopol guardsmen's military unit  personnel are in their barracks.    On the evening of 21 May, Viktor Mezhak, first deputy  chairman of the Crimea's Supreme Council, visited the unit with  a group of deputies, who ascertained that the guardsmen had  normal everyday concerns unconnected with some kind of emergency  preparations. In particular, Aleksandr Kostikov, commander of  the unit, reported that he had not received any orders and had  not given the order to his subordinates to prepare for any  emergency actions.    And here Valeriy Kuznetsov resorted to deceit to have a  reason for his own provocative actions. At about 1800 [1500  GMT] on 21 May, the minister brought the employees of the  Crimean Internal Affairs Ministry to increased combat readiness  and armed them with automatic weapons. He ordered them to carry  out reinforced protection of the television and radio center,  the telephone exchange, and the Supreme Council of Crimea.    The press service of the commander of Ukraine's National  Guard states: The guard's subunits are in the places of their  permanent deployment. The citizens of Simferopol may be calm.  Ukraine's National Guard is not preparing for the assaults  invented by Mr. Kuznetsov.</p>

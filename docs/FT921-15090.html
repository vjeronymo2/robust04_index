			<p>920113 FT  13 JAN 92 / The FT European Top 500 (10): A new Incentive for growth INCENTIVE is a newcomer, in 232nd place, to this year's FT500. It is a highly diverse Swedish industrial and investment group which was floated on the Stockholm bourse last July for the first time after its creation out of Asea's Swedish holdings independent of the Swedish-Swiss engineering giant Asea Brown Boveri. Mr Mikael Lilius, chief executive and president, has been given a clear remit by the company's dominant Wallenberg owners - to transform Incentive into an industrial company with its core activities based in engineering. 'We must have new habits, new traditions and a new culture,' he explains, keen to assert that the name may be the same but the new Incentive will be different from the old one, though even the company's own employees have trouble understanding this. Mr Lilius is in his element in transforming industrial companies. Before being hand-picked for the top post by Mr Curt Nicolin, the legendary lieutenant of the Wallenberg empire and Incentive's chairman, Mr Lilius worked for Huhtamaki, the Finnish company, where he pushed through an important restructuring of its activities. His strategy for Incentive has been spelt out for everybody to appreciate. As many as seven companies in the old Incentive group with total sales of Skr7bn (Dollars 1.2bn) and accounting for around a quarter of its profits are to be sold off. These include Orrefors, the high quality glassware concern; Gense, specialists in the design and manufacture of table utensils; and AKA the maker of environmental niche products. 'Some of our best activities are being divested,' admits Mr Lilius. 'But these do not fit into our core strategy.' But he is in no hurry to relinquish them and believes it will take up to two years to complete their sale. At the same time Incentive's remaining operations are to be concentrated in five designated business areas - transportation; construction and environment; materials handling; process industries; and the world famous photographic concern, Hasselblad. 'We are strong, with total revenues of around SKr10bn,' asserts Mr Lilius. 'We are therefore in a position to grow now in our core products without taking any major risks. You could say at the moment we have more money than good ideas for expansion.' Although highly confident about Sweden's industrial future once the recession is over, he believes Incentive's growth will take place mainly abroad through acquisitions and direct production. But the company is not going to be exclusively industrial even after the completion of its core strategy. From a capitalisation viewpoint, Incentive's investment portfolio will remain important. Of its shareholder's equity capital totalling SKr17bn, as much as SKr12.5bn is at present derived from its stock. In the first half of 1991, 70 per cent of the company's SKr671m profits was earned from its share-holdings. Incentive will remain the dominant share owner in Asea, where it holds 25 per cent of voting rights and share capital, in Electrolux with 48 per cent of voting rights and 11 per cent equity, and in the world's biggest welding company Esab, with 49 per cent voting rights and 44 per cent share capital. Mr Lilius hopes Incentive's own industrial activities will account for an increasingly larger part of its earnings in the future. By the mid 1990s the company could become another aggressive Swedish player on the wider European stage, further proof that the Wallenberg empire is not going to fall apart in the face of increasing corporate challenges.</p>

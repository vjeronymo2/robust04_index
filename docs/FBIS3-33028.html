			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Edwin Gongora; from the "Up to Date" newscast] </F>   [Text] A number of congressmen have expressed opposing  views concerning the speech delivered by Dr. Bryan Atwood,  [special envoy for the U.S. secretary of state and worldwide  administrator of AID]. While opposition deputies view the U.S.  warning as a wake-up call for the government to adopt a firm  stand against the promoters of violence, Arena [Nationalist  Republican Alliance] Deputy Gloria Salguero Gross says the  violence has its origins in the past.    During his speech to the congress, Atwood said that friendly  countries are concerned about the escalation of violence  reported over the past few days in El Salvador. Nevertheless,  Salguero Gross said that incidents reported thus far have been  isolated cases that should not be sources of concern.    [Begin Salguero recording] I believe the irrational events  that have taken place lately are normal following the violence  our country has experienced. However, each and every Salvadoran  should take an interest in putting at a distance those  individuals who still have sick minds and destructive thoughts.  [end recording]    Meanwhile, the opposition takes a different view. In their  opinion, Atwood's warning exposes the government's lack of  interest in resolving the violence issue and in severely  punishing the perpetrators of violent acts which, in the opinion  of many deputies, may block economic aid to El Salvador if it is  not resolved in a timely manner.    [Begin recording] [First unidentified congressman] The  government has shown a lack of interest in resolving the  problem. There are such cases as the National Civilian Police  and the violence that prevails among political party members.  It is obvious that the government has much to do in this area.    [Second unidentified congressman] It is up to the government  to pay attention to this issue and to attempt to counteract any  form of violence, regardless of where the perpetrators may be or  the level of influence they may have in the decisionmaking  process. [end recording]    Over the past few days there have been attacks on members of  political parties, which have heightened fears of an escalation  of violence that could hamper the political campaigns which, up  until early February, remained normal.</p>

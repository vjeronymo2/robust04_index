(``MMD''), a subsidiary of Dow, under which MMD would be required to manufacture and supply the drug dicyclomine for a potential new entrant and to provide the dicyclomine formulation and other intangible assets to expedite that potential new entrant's entry as a manufacturer into the dicyclomine market. In addition, under the proposed Consent Order the potential new entrant would be required to certify its good faith intention to manufacture dicyclomine. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Consent Order has been placed on the public record for sixty (60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments received during this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60) days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments received and will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make final the agreement's proposed Order. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> On October 4, 1993, MMD and Rugby-Darby Group Companies, Inc. (``Rugby'') signed an agreement whereby MMD acquired all of the stock of Rugby's generic pharmaceutical business. The proposed compliant alleges that the acquisition violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 18, and Section 5 of the FTC Act, as amended, 15 U.S.C. 45, in the market for dicyclomine hydrochloride capsules and tablets in the United States. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Consent Order would remedy the alleged violation by establishing a new entrant into the U.S. market for dicyclomine capsules and tablets to replace the competition lost as a result of the acquisition. The proposed Consent Order would require MMD to enter into an agreement with a potential new entrant within twelve (12) months from the date the proposed Consent Order becomes final. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The agreement would require MMD to manufacture and supply dicyclomine, as well as to license the relevant dicyclomine technology, to a Commission approved potential new entrant. MMD must continue to supply the potential new entrant with dicyclomine until the potential new entrant has begun manufacturing dicyclomine with FDA approval, or for seven (7) years, whichever is shorter. The price at which MMD may contract to supply dicyclomine to the potential new entrant may not exceed 48 percent of the Average Wholesale Price charged by Rugby as of July 2, 1993. The potential new entrant must certify its good faith intention and actual plan to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine capsules and tablets for sale in the U.S. In the event that MMD fails to enter into such an agreement with a potential new entrant, or that the potential new entrant discontinues or fails in its efforts to obtain FDA approval to manufacture dicyclomine within seven (7) years, the proposed Consent Order provides that MMD shall consent to the appointment of a trustee by the Commission. The trustee will be responsible for locating a potential new entrant that will obtain the necessary approvals and sell dicyclomine into the U.S. market. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed Order will also prohibit for a period of ten (10) years, Dow and MMD from acquiring any interest in assets used for the development, manufacture or sale of dicyclomine without prior approval from the Commission. The proposed Order will also require MMD to provide to the Commission a report of its compliance with the provisions of the Order within sixty (60) days following the date this Order becomes final, and every sixty (60) days thereafter until the Commission has approved a potential new entrant. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One year from the date the Order becomes final and annually thereafter for nine (9) years, Dow and MMD will be required to provide to the Commission a report of their compliance with the Consent Order. The Consent Order also requires Dow or MMD to notify the Commission at least thirty (30) days prior to any change in the structure of Dow or MMD resulting in the emergence of a successor. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposed Order, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretation of the agreement and proposed Order or to modify in any way their terms. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> Donald S.

But the nations issued a last, uncompromising  demand for Iraqi troops to withdraw or face "the perils of a devastating war."  </P> <P> Hints of compromise emerged in mixed signals from Baghdad, but in general the  government's hard line toward Kuwait remained unaltered. In several interviews,  Hussein has stuck to his contention that Kuwait is an inalienable part of Iraq.  </P> <P> Latest Gulf Deployment Figures:  </P> <P> * U.S. troops: 280,000+  </P> <P> * Allied troops: 220,000  </P> <P> * Iraqi troops: 510,000  </P></p>

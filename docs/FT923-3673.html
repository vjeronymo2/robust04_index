			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / International Company News: Procordia buys Swedish Match for SKr1.37bn PROCORDIA, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical conglomerate jointly owned by Volvo and the Swedish state, announced yesterday it was acquiring for SKr1.37bn (Dollars 267.3m) Swedish Match, the world's leading match and disposable lighter manufacturer. At the same time it also revealed that it was selling its sugar producing subsidiary for around SKr2.4bn to Danisco As, Denmark's sugar producing company, which will bring Procordia around Skr600m profit. Swedish Match, which is owned by a consortium of international companies including Citicorp Venture Capital in London, will become a subsidiary of Procordia's tobacco and confectionery business, United Brands. It is hoped that the agreement can be finalised on 15 September. Mr Klaus Unger, vice president of the company's United Brands division, said yesterday that the products of both businesses complemented each other and provided strong possibilities for co-operation in the European consumer market. The purchase of Swedish Match will provide Procordia with a company that has an annual turnover of around SKr2bn and employs 4,400 people. As a result of the acquisition, the Swedish company's United Brands division will have a SKr8bn annual turnover, with nearly 10,000 employees. Swedish Match was once run by the famous Swedish industrialist Mr Ivar Kreuger who shot himself after his empire collapsed in 1931. Swedish Match has had several owners since it was bought in March 1988 by Stora, the Swedish forestry group, for SKr5.9bn. In November 1989 Stora sold Swedish Match consumer products, which included Wilkinson Sword, for SKr3.93bn to a group of international investors, including Gillette of the US. As a result of this the Monopolies and Mergers Commission in the UK investigated the sale and ruled that Gillette had to undo the effect of the merger in the UK market. Commenting on the sale of its sugar business - Sockerbolaget - to Danisco, Mr Goran Linden, Procordia's vice president, said that the deal would ensure a stable future for the Swedish sugar industry. He added that the divestment was also in line with the company's strategy to divest itself of all but its core business in food, pharmaceuticals and bio-technology. The acquisition will make Danisco the fourth largest sugar producer in Europe.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Company News: TNT slips to ADollars 51m loss as airline price war intensifies TNT, the Australian transport group, yesterday blamed recession and stiff competition for a net equity accounted loss of ADollars 46m (Dollars 34.50m) in the six months to December, compared with a profit of ADollars 49m last time. The loss increased to ADollars 51m after taking account of abnormal items, mainly provisions for diminution in the value of non-current assets and unrealised foreign currency translation adjustments. Equity-accounted revenue increased 2.5 per cent to ADollars 2.5bn. TNT said it had been hit by freight transport problems in Australia and South America, and heavy losses in the domestic airline operations, jointly-owned with News Corporation, Mr Rupert Murdoch's media group. Analysts had expected a substantially smaller interim loss following a loss of ADollars 115,000 in the first three months, but the group appears to have been badly hit by price-cutting in the Australian aviation market. Ansett Transport Industries, which operates one of Australia's two main domestic airlines, contributed a loss of ADollars 25.5m after abnormal items, compared with a loss of ADollars 7.3m in the earlier period. Morael, which operates the smaller Eastwest Airlines, contributed a net loss of ADollars 18m, compared with ADollars 5.3m a year earlier. The group said it expected an improvement in the results of its wholly-owned businesses if economic conditions improve as expected in its main markets. However, the directors warned that the aviation businesses would have a 'difficult' third quarter because of continuing uncertainty in Australia. Price-cutting pressure eased following the collapse of Compass, a small independent airline, but is likely to increase if Compass or another small airline returns to the market, as seems likely. The federal government is also expected to announce today that Qantas and Air New Zealand are to be given rights to fly on domestic routes in Australia. On a positive note, the directors said the flotation of 70.4 per cent of TNT Freightways, the group's US trucking business, had been completed. The ADollars 400m proceeds of the flotation will enable TNT to further reduce debt, which fell from ADollars 3.7bn to ADollars 3.5bn during the period. Interest expense declined from ADollars 110m to ADollars 98m. The group also said it expected to complete a joint venture arrangement with five European post offices during the current quarter. TNT announced recently it has reached agreement with Federal Express, the US freight carrier, to co-load express freight on daily transatlantic flights. Both initiatives are expected to help reduce the costs of TNT's European express freight network. TNT said the world recession had reduced revenue growth in most of the countries in which it operates. Revenue was flat in the UK, and lower in Australia, Canada and South America.</p>

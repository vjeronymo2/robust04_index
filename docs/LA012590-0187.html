			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: SUPER BOWL XXIV;  </P> <P> DENVER BRONCOS VS. SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS;  </P> <P> 49ERS' TAYLOR DOESN'T TALK A GOOD GAME, HE PLAYS IT  </P> <P> Look who's talking.  </P> <P> John Taylor showed, sat and spoke.  </P> <P> Stop the presses.  </P> <P> At the Super Bowl, this is news.  </P> <P> The sight of San Francisco's Taylor doing an interview is something you don't  see every day. It's as rare as an out-of-state license plate in Hawaii. It's as  strange as a movie in which John Wayne drives a car.  </P> <P> Why is Taylor so reluctant?  </P> <P> "I figure the less I say, the less anybody can quote me," he said. "The less  people hear about me, the less they know. Out of sight, out of mind."  </P> <P> So, why talk now?  </P> <P> "They came and drug me out here," Taylor said.  </P> <P> In a survey of Bay Area media people by a Palo Alto paper, a survey that  determined 49er leaders in categories ranging from Most Intelligent (Spencer  Tillman) to Most Boring (Mike Cofer) to Funniest (Matt Millen) to Mr. Nice Guy  (Jamie Williams), the hands-down winner in the voting for Mr. Uncooperative was  the hands-up wide receiver, Taylor, who would ignore requests from reporters  without so much as a grunt, walking right past them.  </P> <P> So, on one side of the 49er offense we have Jerry Rice, the wide receiver who  complained after winning Super Bowl XXIII most-valuable-player honors that he  doesn't get the publicity he deserves.  </P> <P> On the other side we have Taylor, who wants publicity about as much as he wants  a toothache. "If it costs me recognition or money, well, then it's money I  never saw," Taylor said. "I don't care."  </P> <P> A member of the 49er public relations department asked Taylor to do an  interview as a personal favor to her.  </P> <P> "I would have just stayed in the locker room until the team picture," he said.  </P> <P> He is a widely popular wide receiver in San Francisco's camp, who is gaining  fame week by week, like it or not. Taylor just signed a two-year contract worth  $1.4 million, after having earned $200,000 this season.  </P> <P> It may not be the four-year, $15-million monster deal that Will Clark was  inking with the San Francisco Giants at virtually the same hour, but it's not  bad, not bad at all for a guy from Delaware State who never caught a pass in  high school.  </P> <P> It's also not bad for a guy who, in 1988, drew a 30-day suspension for failing  a drug test. Taylor reportedly is still considering legal action against the  league for that suspension. All he will say for the time being is, "You get  dealt a hand, you play it."  </P> <P> Taylor caught only four touchdown passes in 1988 but all went for 65 yards or  more. That's his specialty. This season, his 10 touchdown catches included the  back-breakers of 92 and 95 yards against the Rams on Dec. 11 at Anaheim  Stadium.  </P> <P> More and more, people started talking less about just "Jerry Rice" and more  about "Rice and Taylor."  </P> <P> "I'm just getting the ball more," Taylor said, shrugging as though to say  there's no mystery to it. "There's only so much you can do without the ball."  </P> <P> It was suggested, good-naturedly, that it's as if the 49ers had Jerry Rice  cloned.  </P> <P> "I'm a clone of myself," Taylor said indignantly. "I'm no clone of anybody."  </P> <P> Clearly, here's a guy who would rather be anyplace but here.  </P> <P> Taylor prefers the peace and quiet. He and his brother, Keith, spent part of  their childhood outside Philadelphia playing football in a local cemetery,  where it was nice and quiet. Besides, Taylor said, it was the only place in the  neighborhood with grass.  </P> <P> Out of Pennsauken (N.J.) High, Taylor enrolled at a predominantly black  institute in North Carolina called Johnson C. Smith University, where everyone  knew him as Jake.  </P> <P> He was getting an education, but he was a long way from getting to a  seven-figure contract playing pro football.  </P> <P> Transferring to Delaware State, he abandoned baseball and went out for football  for reasons that were obvious to him. Taylor, a man of few words, put it as  simply as it could be put: "I figured if I can catch a little ball, I can catch  one four times the size," he said.  </P> <P> Guess so. He was three-time all-conference, snagged 33 touchdown passes and  broke four punt returns for scores.  </P> <P> Before long, he was making leaping catches as a 49er and doing the sort of  broken-field running that separates the big-play receivers from the rest.  </P> <P> Taylor's second catch as a Niner was the last of Joe Montana's record-breaking  22 completions in a row.  </P> <P> Quietly, he went about his business. He didn't even tell anybody last summer  that he was dedicating the 1989 season to his mother, Alice, who died on the  Fourth of July of a brain aneurysm.  </P> <P> Just talking about it now chokes him up.  </P> <P> "I was happy the way I played for my mother," Taylor said. "If the spotlight  comes my way, fine. If it doesn't, I know inside myself what I've done. It will  make my mother proud of me, and that's all that really matters."  </P> <P> That says a lot -- about her and about him.  </P></p>

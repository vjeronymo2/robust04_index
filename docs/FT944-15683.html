			<p>941017 FT  17 OCT 94 / Survey of International Telecommunications (6): German telecoms giant roused by call of the new - Supplier profile / Siemens faces a challenge as rivals move ahead on prices and technology The German industrial group Siemens is facing challenges in one of its strongest areas: telecommunications. It remains one of the world's telecoms leaders, with equipment ranging from multi-million-dollar telephone switching systems to mobile phones representing nearly a quarter of its DM81.6bn sales last year. But there are threats to the group from three sources: privatisation, recession and technology. Until about four years ago, Germany's state-owned telecoms monopoly, Deutsche Telekom, bought much of its switching and transmission equipment from Siemens and did not drive too hard a bargain over price - 'it was a cosy arrangement between PTT and domestic supplier,' says Mr Jeremy Ledger, telecoms analyst at Dataquest. But it was an arrangement that could not last, as the experience of other countries proved. By the late 1980s, British Telecommunications, the privatised UK operator, was adopting more open procurement policies, as were Vodafone and Mercury, newly-licensed competitors in the UK mobile and long-distance sectors respectively. Siemens was not a spectator on the UK scene: in 1989 it bought a 40 per cent stake in GPT, the GEC telecoms equipment subsidiary and one of BT's principal suppliers. But it was not under the same pressure at home. Indeed, the fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 led to an Indian summer for the old regime in the form of a DM60bn Deutsche Telekom programme to upgrade eastern Germany's antiquated phone system. Dr Erwin Hardt, head of Siemens' public communication networks group, rejects accusations by North American suppliers that Deutsche Telekom pays - or paid - up to four times the going international rate for its network equipment - 'they are not comparing like with like,' he insists. 'Our prices typically include associated software, while US operators pay for software on top. Take the two together, and our prices are about the same.' However, Dr Hardt admits that the Indian summer is over. The European recession was intensified for Siemens by a drop in orders from eastern Germany and by the growing impact of privatisation as operators far beyond Britain began putting unprecedented price pressure on their suppliers. Deutsche Telekom was one of them. Again, the figures are in dispute. Dr Hardt says that prices for transmission and switching equipment have fallen, in real terms, by about *something in here (HP) * 7 per cent in each of the last three years, and 'somewhat more' in Germany. Dataquest's Mr Jeremy Ledger says that prices for key transmission products have fallen in Germany by as much as 20 per cent over the past year as Deutsche Telekom has awarded large orders abroad. Either way, the trend is alarming for Siemens. Last year it reported a fall in new orders and looks on nervously as Alcatel of France - which has a substantial German telecoms business - repeatedly downgrades its profit forecasts. Few question the strength of many of Siemens' product ranges, notably its EWSD switching system, or its commitment to research and development, which accounts for some 15 per cent of sales in the communications divisions. But alone they are not enough to sustain margins and guarantee market share. Then there is the question of new technology, notably the burgeoning demand for mobile communications. Both Alcatel and Siemens have been dramatically outclassed in the market for cellular infrastructure and handsets by two smaller European suppliers, Ericsson of Sweden and Nokia of Finland. Motorola, the US electronics group, also has a significant European presence in the mobile sector, where it is a leading handset supplier. Dr Hardt claims that the Scandinavian suppliers were 'lucky' that the cellular boom started in the Nordic states 'where all those isolated summer homes created an instant demand.' He is convinced that Siemens' 'greater and superior' R&amp;D, particularly in the switching technologies where a number of cellular suppliers are 'weak,' will triumph 'ultimately.' Yet Dr Dietrich Botsch, of Siemens' private communications systems group, recognises the scale of the task facing the group if it is to establish itself as a leading mobile communications force: 'We missed out on the analogue developments in the cellular field, but are concentrating our resources on new digital GSM systems. We believe we can generate the volumes that will make us a serious contender.' Siemens is also attacking its high cost base. It has just opened a software house in India, where overheads are significantly lower, and plans to employ 1,000 programmers within three years. Within Germany, moves are afoot to introduce seven-day working: 'Our unions now realise that such steps are important to productivity,' says Dr Botsch. Then there is marketing. Like the rest of the telecoms industry, Siemens has had marketing thrust upon it. The telecoms divisions now employ more than 300 marketing staff where five years ago there were 15. Although two-thirds are engineers by training, their career development and skills are fundamentally different from the mono-engineers of old. 'It used to take two years to get from a first idea to a finished telephone,' says Dr Botsch. 'Now it takes six months. Two years is the entire life-cycle.'</p>

			<p>930610 FT  10 JUN 93 / Italian MPs to curb 'suspect' secret service THE Italian parliament is to seek broader powers to monitor more closely the activities of the country's intelligence services. The tighter controls were promised yesterday by Mr Ugo Pecchioli, a senator for the Party of the Democratic Left and newly elected head of the parliamentary intelligence committee. The move follows the shake-up last Friday by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, the prime minister, of the senior ranks of the intelligence services. The government and parliament are anxious to bring the intelligence services under strict scrutiny following suspicions that some of their members or ex-members may have had a hand in recent bombings in Rome and Florence, formally attributed to the mafia. The authorities suspect a repeat of the 1970s when it is thought that the mafia, right wing organisations and the secret services sought to create tension in order to swing public opinion away from the left. The intelligence services are divided into the SISMI and SISDE. The SISMI is responsible for intelligence gathering and operations to protect national security and carries out most of the services' foreign activities. The SISDE is concerned with domestic intelligence. Under legislation approved in 1977 when the services were first reorganised, parliament can only be informed of their activities by the prime minister. However, Mr Ciampi discovered after the May 27 car bomb at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence that the intelligence services are not obliged to inform fully the prime minister of their activities. This, coupled with the suspicion that the two services harboured agents linked to the mafia and extreme-right wing groupings, led to last week's personnel changes. New deputy directors were appointed for both services and new heads were appointed to three of SISDE's four operational divisions. Yesterday Mr Pecchioli, who fought with the partisans during the second world war, said it was vital to establish 'if there had been people acting outside orders or if there have been lapses of inefficiency' in the recent car bombings. He said parliament's control was far too limited, especially now that the cold war had ended. He said insufficient effort had been made to clean out an intelligence community compromised by links with the secret masonic lodge P2.</p>

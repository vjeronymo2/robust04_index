			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / Arts: True spirits of the fin de siecle - William Packer takes a progressive look at the work of the Nabis movement This exhibition of the work of the Nabis continues the Reunion des Musees Nationaux's fine series, begun more than a decade ago, of major studies of the great French painters of the later 19th century, this time in partnership with the Kunsthaus at Zurich. For the first time, however, it is given not to a single master but to a group or movement that more than any other, perhaps, represents the true spirit of the 1890s and the fin de siecle. It is in the nature of young artists, full of idealistic ambition, to rescue art from the ever sorry state into which it has fallen, and that the like-minded should form themselves into a group in order to set it on the single path of righteousness - of which they alone are sure. It is equally in the nature of art itself that it should resist such worthy simplicities. As such artists mature, so inevitably the group falls apart. The Nabis held together, albeit ever more loosely, for a dozen years, which is unusually long a time for these things. The natural paradox of this exhibition is that while it celebrates their commendable community of spirit, its actual substance is the story of their burgeoning individual talents. They were all young men, brought together in the summer of 1888 by Paul Serusier from among his friends associated with the Ecole des Beaux Arts and the Academie Julian. The founding nucleus consisted of Pierre Bonnard, Henri Ibels, Paul Ranson and Maurice Denis; Rene Piot, Kerr-Xavier Roussel and Eduoard Vuillard were brought in from outside, and later on, among others, Aristide Maillol and Felix Valloton. The name came a little later. Nabi is the hebrew word for prophet, enthusiast, seer: and here was this group of young artists in whom, as Serusier would write in 1889, the state of enthusiasm had become habitual. They would meet every week, bringing with them an 'ikon' each, a work of to be put up for general discussion. But their interests were more closely focused than that might suggest. They were, in Denis' words, devotees of symbolism, and their importance lies in the link they made in their work, building on the freer painterliness made available to them by the impressionists and putting it to the service of a more deeply personal and metaphysical expression. Looking back now across a full century, we can see that 'impressionism' for too long masked other and no less fundamental concurrent influences upon the course of modernism. Symbolism was one that was at least as important and enduring, and which, now we choose to recognise it, we may see at once at work in all of Picasso, in much of fauvism and expressionism, and in all surrealism. In our own day, the conceptual echoes still reverberate. The Nabis in their own day knew rather better, and were immediate in recognising the importance of what Gauguin, Van Gogh and Emile Bernard had achieved even before 1890, to say nothing of the work of earlier mentors such as Puvis de Chavannes, Millet, Moreau, and even our own Burne-Jones, all of whom have been left critically unconsidered until comparatively recently. Gauguin and his disciples at least gave credit where it was due. It is a weakness of this exhibition, only marginally corrected in a massive and splendid catalogue that not everyone will buy, that such antecedents should not have been made manifest. The rule of this series of exhibitions has been always to stick to the immediate subject, but with a group rather than a single artist, especially one that initially was so polemical, the rule should have been broken. The omission is all the more odd given the no less reasonable inclusion of several wood-block prints to illustrate the influence of the Japanese masters. Gauguin indeed is the ghost at this feast. Serusier had been with him in Pont-Aven, considered him an honorary Nabi in any case, and remained in correspondence with him in the South Seas, regularly urging him to associate himself with the group. He was simply revered. 'What Manet was for the generation of 1870', said Denis, 'Gauguin was to that of 1890 . . . He freed us from all the shackles that the idea of copying brought to our instincts as painters.' 'How do you see those trees?' Gauguin had asked Serusier. 'They are yellow. Then paint them yellow; that shadow, rather blue, paint it with pure ultramarine; those red leaves? make them vermilion.' Serusier's small Pont-Aven landscape of 1888 is called le Talisman simply because that is what it became for the Nabis, the true image and touchstone of their painterly principles. And it is in its very painterliness, rather than any symbolic intent, that its prescience lies. It is a bridge 20 years into the future, all the way indeed to the fauves and the expressionists of der Brucke itself. For it is in the painterliness of the Nabis that their final dissolution is foreshadowed: in the love and sensual indulgence in paint almost for its own sake, and, in the print-making especially, the delicate attention paid to surface and its formal graphic sophistication. Colour may always carry with it its own symbolic charge, albeit ambiguous, abstract and unspoken. What we see in the work of the Nabis as it progresses through the 1890s is openly symbolic or mystical imagery giving way by degrees to the imagery of the domestic and the everyday, though always cast at a certain remove in terms of the decorative and the exquisitely refined. And how positively these individual talents declare themselves. This is not the place to dilate upon the greater, familiar talents of such as Bonnard or Vuillard, but the petits matres are matres still. Valloton and Roussel especially are as outstanding as they are surprising. Nabis - 1888-1890: Grand Palais, Place Clemenceau, Paris 8, until January 3: sponsored by Aerospatiale.</p>

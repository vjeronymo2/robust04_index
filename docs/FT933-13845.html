			<p>930716 FT  16 JUL 93 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (8): The search is on for recovery stocks - Although many analysts are already upgrading their earnings forecasts for this year in both the US and the UK, the hard evidence for this has yet to come through INVESTORS MADE money in the second quarter, based on the FT-Actuaries World Index. But stock and sector selection was critical, and overall the important Wall Street and London markets just about marked time, with total investment returns even under-performing money market rates. The World Index overall gave sterling-based investors a 6.7 per cent return, against 9.7 per cent in the first quarter of the year. Japan again compensated for some poor performances elsewhere, notably in Europe where France and Germany ended the quarter in negative territory. Tokyo produced a total return of 19 per cent in sterling terms, following a January-March positive outcome of 19.5 per cent. Part of this gain was in the currency, and Japan has yet to get back to the heady days of 1991. But fund managers late into Tokyo have done very nicely. The second quarter showed that country selection can be a funny old business. Italy has been rocked by political scandals, and some big-name companies, such as Ferruzzi, are in trouble. Yet the Italian market for local investors rose by a fifth, and higher still in sterling terms. The uncertain investment rationale there would appear to be that things can only get better. Some other markets, which had performed well towards the end of 1992 and in the first quarter of this year, had setbacks, notably Mexico, Spain and Australia; but Switzerland, with a close-on 6 per cent return for sterling investors in the first quarter, pushed ahead to yield almost 50 per cent better in the April-June period, the solid Swiss franc taking over the secure European currency role from the D-Mark. Austria, another semi-hedge against a weakening German currency, managed a return of around 4 per cent. All of the geographical regions that make up the World Index ended the quarter in positive territory. The Pacific area overall produced a return of almost 18 per cent, though less than half that if Japan is excluded. Hong Kong had another heady quarter, but in often volatile trading, the market consensus being that the colony and China will somehow work out an amicable post-1997 arrangement. But in the meantime there are bound to be major investment scares. Geographical section was important for fund managers in the second quarter, but sector-picking was even more important. Investors sensed some economic recovery in the US and Britain and a bottoming out in Japan, but continental Europe is still faltering. Low world interest rates are driving more money into equities, especially in the US where a growing number of mutual funds are looking at investment opportunities outside their domestic market, and increasingly at index-tracker instruments. The search is now on for recovery stocks, rather than secure recession-proofed holdings. Cyclical stocks are in demand, although not as yet in the consumer area where spending remains erratic. The World Index consumer goods and services sector showed a return of less than 2 per cent in the quarter; but banks and other financial institutions were some 17 per cent ahead, while electronics and heavy engineering had returns at or near the mid-teens. Utilities came in at about 7 per cent; the retail sector had a negative return compared with some 3.5 per cent last time. And what is the outlook for the remainder of this year? Most fund managers are sitting on tidy profits and will want to nurture them. The problem is that there is no real return to be made on the money markets, unless they take a punt on currencies, and US long bond yields are at or near historic lows. Everyone is looking for recovery stocks, particularly in the medium-size corporate sector, and selecting successfully there requires a lot of local market knowledge. No doubt the third quarter will produce Italian-style performances, but the major markets may well be in sideways mode, although many analysts are already upgrading their earnings forecasts for this year in both the US and the UK. The hard evidence for this has yet to come through.</p>

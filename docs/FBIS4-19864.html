			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [APA report: "Neofascists' Call for Osimo Revision Alarms </F> SVP"]    [Text] Bolzano/Rome/Vienna -- The demands of Italy's  neo-fascists for a revision of the Osimo Treaty, which sets down  the Italian-Slovene border, has given rise to great concern in  South Tirol. Siegfried Brugger, chairman of the South Tirolean  People's Party (SVP), said during the weekend that the behavior  of the neo-fascists gives "reason for concern, particularly in  South Tirol and in Europe." The rightist "Union for South  Tirol" has already come out in favor of "preparing a revision of  the unjust border at the Brenner."    Next Thursday [28 April], the SVP leaders will meet with  Foreign Minister Alois Mock in Vienna to discuss potential steps  to be taken by the "protective power" Austria. Mock has come  out in favor of watching the development in Italy with great  attention. The SVP sees South Tirol's autonomy increasingly  threatened as a result of statements from circles of the Italian  rightist alliance.    According to a report by the Rome daily LA REPUBBLICA, in  summer 1991, shortly after the crumbling of Yugoslavia,  neo-fascist leader Gianfranco Fini sounded out potential Serb  reaction in Belgrade to Italy's efforts for a revision of the  Osimo Treaty and a return of Istria to Italy. Renowned Serbian  politicians more or less gave Fini the go-ahead at that time.    After a talk with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro in the  course of the consultations about the forming of a new  government, Fini stressed that the point is "a revision of the  treaties of Osimo, not of the borders." The new Italian  Government is to strive for corresponding negotiations with the  governments in Zagreb and Ljubljana, Fini said.    The party's foreign policy spokesman, Mirko Tremaglia, and  another prominent politician, Roberto Menia, have justified the  demand for a new negotiation of the treaties of Osimo by saying  that these treaties were concluded in 1975 with the state of  Yugoslavia, which no longer exists. In their view, Slovenia and  Croatia are not automatically Yugoslavia's legal successors.</p>

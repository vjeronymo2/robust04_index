			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Equity Markets: Investors leave Wall Street stuck in neutral  -New York The second-quarter reporting season is in full swing, but Wall Street is stuck in the summer doldrums. A fresh tide of corporate results will sweep through Wall Street this week, but any positive impact is likely to be limited to a few individual stocks. Certainly last week's activity suggests as much, despite predictions of a midsummer rally. If the corporate sector demonstrated its profitability in the face of a steady rise in US interest rates during the first half, the argument went, cash would start flowing back into equities. In the event, several of the market's bellwethers turned in outstanding performances. Most notably IBM, Motorola and Apple. All handily beat forecasts and were rewarded with big jumps in their share prices. But the buying enthusiasm never spilled over to the technology sector in general. Even worse, Compaq and Intel were hammered in spite of turning in decent quarterly performances. 'The market is stuck in neutral,' says Mr Gregory Nie, technical analyst at Kemper Securities in Chicago. Indeed, investors seemed to be in the mood to nit-pick. Take the case of United Technologies. It posted net income 32 per cent ahead of the year-earlier level and in line with Wall Street's expectations. But analysts cited concerns over tight margins in its automotive components arm and other details of the report. By the end of the day, the stock was marked down 6 per cent. General Motors and Ford lead the list of big companies set to unveil their results this week. Both are expected to come in at the high end of expectations, but their stocks may not fare so well. Ten days ago, shares in Chrysler dipped even though the company posted record profits. Investors are concerned that the recovery in motor vehicles has already passed its peak. The recent data suggests economic growth is moderating, but the stock market was reminded last week that the Federal Reserve's policy-makers were not away on summer holiday. With Mr Alan Greenspan hinting that interest rates may need to be lifted before autumn, the wait-and-see posture assumed by many equity investors is likely to be sustained at least until after the Fed's August 16 policy-making session. To complicate the picture, technical conditions in the market are not favourable, with the relationship between advancing stocks and their volumes to declining stocks and their volumes approaching what analysts describe as an 'overbought' position. 'We could easily go sideways for quite some time, with outside risk we could slip into a second leg of a correction,' warns Mr Nie. 'Playing your cards close to your vest makes sense in the near term.'</p>

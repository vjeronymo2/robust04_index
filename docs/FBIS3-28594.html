Regarding the expense  in purchasing an airborne warning and control system (AWACS),  which the DA is demanding to be included in a budget for fiscal  1994, Aichi pointed out, among other things, the need to give  consideration to Japan-U.S. relations. He demanded that the  expenses be included in the budget, saying: "I want the  expenses to be approved when the Finance Ministry's draft budget  will be unofficially announced. The ministry is scheduled to do  that on 10 February prior to your trip to the United States."</p>

			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / TSB to end commission for life sales staff TSB is to merge its banking and insurance sales force as part of a shake-up. The banking group said yesterday that it will pay its insurance sales staff a salary rather than commission. It will introduce a package made up of a basic salary, a team bonus based on branch sales and customer service performance, and a personal bonus which will be based on overall performance rather than specific product sales targets. TSB said that, under the new regime, bank managers would take on the supervision of staff selling banking and insurance products. The move, which comes into effect on November 1, is the final stage in TSB's bancassurance strategy, it said. Mr John Elbourne, retail director, said the shake-up meant the bank was 'offering best advice across the total product range and creating the most fully integrated banc-assurance structure in the UK'.</p>

			<p>940226 FT  26 FEB 94 / Outdoors: Unsung lady of the stream - Fishing It was a peach of a day, all the more glorious for confounding expectation. The man on the radio had forecast November dankness and chill. But as I bowled along the Roman road that points at Salisbury, the flannel above peeled away to reveal a soft, blue sky and a soft autumn sun. The wide, bare spaces of the downs glowed, and the foliage of the oak and beech copses was suffused with coppery life. In short, it was grand to be out and about, with a fishing rod in the back of the car and a long-held ambition to fulfil. As I rolled down in to the Test valley, I spared a thought - being a compassionate man - for the millions chained to their desks, eyes trained on screens, ears jammed to telephones. I reflected that the sweetness of the song of the birds, and the healing quality of sunshine, were distinctly enhanced if you were the only one around to enjoy them. My ambition was to fish for grayling with a fly rod, in the grayling's true season, which is autumn. I had caught them before in the UK, but always by accident, when fishing for trout in summer. In such circumstances they are something of an annoyance. The grayling's reputation has never stood as high in England as in continental Europe. The species is widely distributed, but it does best in the southern chalk streams. And there - on the Test, Avon, Kennet etc - it must compete with the trout for the angler's attention. At best, the grayling has tended to be regarded with condescension, occupying a position in the fishy world roughly equivalent to that of the gentlewoman's companion in the human world. At worst, it has been the victim of persecution by intolerant ideologues and ignorant snobs who think it unworthy to share hallowed water with the noble trout. The continentals are free from this absurd prejudice. On travels a few years ago in eastern Europe, I found the grayling as highly esteemed as the trout, or more so. The Poles and the Slovaks have developed specialised tactics for catching them in the rivers of the Carpathians. Having watched a Polish wizard whisk out a score of good fish in an hour and a half, I tried to emulate him. But the control of two heavy nymphs while wading a foaming mountain torrent was completely beyond me; and I retreated to the quiet corners where I managed a grayling or two on a dry fly. Now, on this November day, I was to try - courtesy of a kind friend and his father - for English grayling on the Test at Timsbury. Fishing there in high summer for trout, I had caught a couple of big grayling during a hectic hatch of sedges. But in autumn the nymph was the thing - or so I had read. There are nymph fishers and non-nymph fishers, and by inclination I am of the second category. I like to see my fly on the surface. But the nymph sinks, and for me the perennial problem with it is to tell when, and if, a fish has taken it. As a rule it has not, but this is not a great deal of use. The experts tell you that you must watch the fish under water, and strike when it opens its mouth to absorb the nymph. Now, there are doubtless men keen-sighted enough to spot a pair of small, white lips opening and closing through several feet of water. But I am not one of them. The alternative is to watch your leader, and strike when it behaves unnaturally. But I cannot see the leader either. So, employing a tip from a pleasant young man in the tackle shop in Stockbridge, I tied on a piece of orange wool treated with floatant. This was splendidly visible, and I spent a considerable amount of time watching it bob down the current. It went under but once. I struck, and nothing happened I began to have doubts about the nymph. Luckily for me, the mellowness of the weather encouraged an excellent hatch of olives, and I came across a little shoal of grayling feeding keenly at the surface. I caught one immediately on a dry fly, and a gorgeous sight it was, with its silver, black-spotted flanks and bristling red-membraned dorsal fin. Aha, I thought, I am going to make a killing. A series of clumsy casts then persuaded the rest of the shoal to stop rising. With the sun sinking fast, I went back to the nymph. And I had a fish at once, even lovelier than the first - for it was bigger, a good 1 1/2 lb. I could not bear to kill it, so I let it go. The lady of the stream is how some felicitous writer dubbed the grayling; and I felt that, as a gentleman, I had paid my respects.</p>

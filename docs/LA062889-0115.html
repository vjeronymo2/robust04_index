			<p><P> June 28, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> PADRES, DODGERS PROVING NOTHING;  </P> <P> THEIR OFFENSES SPUTTER TO A 2-2 TIE THROUGH 12 INNINGS  </P> <P> Padres vs. the Dodgers at Chavez Ravine. Not so long ago, the stars would come  out at night for this series. Fans would debate Garvey vs. Guerrero at first,  Nettles vs. Madlock at third, Williams vs. Lasorda in the dugout.  </P> <P> No more. It's two weeks before the All-Star break, and instead of a glamorous  showdown of No. 1 contender meeting the defending world champion on its home  turf for the first time, it has turned into a barroom scrap of two teams  staggering to stave off elimination. Tuesday night, they staggered into the  13th inning tied, 2-2.  </P> <P> And you can be assured that no one was debating the relative merits of Bip  Roberts vs. Jeff Hamilton.  </P> <P> "Hell, who thought it'd turn out like this?" Padres Manager Jack McKeon said.  And that was beforehand.  </P> <P> The game was a microcosm of why the the crowd of 37,385 was watching the two  worst run-scoring offenses in the land.  </P> <P> There were 26 strikeouts, 15 by the Padre offense, through the first 11 1/2  innings of their 2-2 game.  </P> <P> There were two extra-base hits.  </P> <P> And, of course, there were the Padres, who stole this show of offensive  ineptitude. After scoring two runs in the fifth on Roberto Alomar's two-run  single, the Padres' next hit did not come until 17 batters later, when Luis  Salazar doubled with two out in the 10th. That was only the second ball hit by  the Padres that even went out of the infield during that stretch.  </P> <P> Really, there's no need to look further than the first baseman of each team --  Jack Clark of the Padres, Eddie Murray of the Dodgers -- to find the roots of  these teams' offensive woes.  </P> <P> Clark, escaping the wrath of New York, and Murray, fleeing the impoverished  land of the Orioles, were supposed to be resurrecting their baseball talents,  remember? Clark was going to have an MVP-type season, the Padres told everyone,  and if you didn't believe them, you could watch 'em all on TV in late October.  The Dodgers had a sneaky suspicion the Padres might be right, so they rescued  Murray from Baltimore and told the Padres that they'd have to get by them  first.  </P> <P> Funny how this game works.  </P> <P> Clark, who entered the night hitting .213 with nine homers and 39 RBIs -- oh  yeah, and 85 strikeouts -- struck out three more times and had two singles and  a walk, which led to Flannery's run-scoring single.  </P> <P> Murray, hitting .236 with seven homers and 41 RBIs coming in, went one for six  with three strikeouts and a broken-bat double.  </P> <P> Who would have imagined that a fellow by the name of Mickey Tettleton would  have four more homers than Clark and Murray combined?  </P> <P> "I don't know what you call it, a slump or whatever," Clark said, "but it's  like a nightmare that won't go away. If we were in first place, maybe you could  have a little more patience. You could tell the guys, 'Thanks for holding me  up, I'll be there for you in the second half.'  </P> <P> "But this? This? I don't know how to deal with it. Last year was my toughest  year in baseball, but I could deal with it. This, I have no idea.  </P> <P> "I'm fighting myself every day. I don't know whether my swing will come back  now, or whether I'll be totally screwed up for the year.  </P> <P> "I've got pride, lots of pride. But I have a real hard time finding it  warranted for me to get a paycheck. I have a real hard time finding it  warranted for me to be in the lineup.  </P> <P> "I keep thinking I'll come around, hoping that I'm just around the corner. But  to tell you the truth, I don't even feel close. Sometimes, I feel like I don't  even know what I'm doing."  </P> <P> His teammates must have had the same kind of feeling Tuesday, with just five of  their outs reaching the outfield.  </P> <P> They were up to their usual tricks again, managing to hit just one ball out of  the infield in the first three innings and blowing a scoring opportunity in the  fourth when Garry Templeton flied out with two runners on.  </P> <P> Remember now, this production was coming off someone who had not pitched in a  big-league game since the third game of the World Series on Oct. 18 and who had  reconstructive surgery on his left elbow nine days later.  </P> <P> Understandably, the Dodgers' John Tudor began to tire in the fifth, and the  Padres finally took advantage. They opened the inning with consecutive singles  by Mark Parent and Shawn Abner, moved into scoring position on a sacrifice bunt  by Bruce Hurst and loaded the bases on Bip Roberts' walk.  </P> <P> Roberto Alomar, the man who drew McKeon's wrath Saturday night when he failed  to cover first on a bunt and was threatened with an all-expenses trip to Las  Vegas, appeared to pull another boner when he swung at the first pitch instead  of waiting to see if Tudor could solve his control problems.  </P> <P> "People don't realize it, but there's a lot of luck in this game, too," McKeon  said.  </P> <P> Whatever, it paid off for Alomar as he slapped a single to right, scoring  Parent and Abner. Ricky Horton relieved Tudor after he had thrown 69 pitches  and promptly induced Tony Gwynn to ground into a double play, ending their  offensive bonanza.  </P> <P> The Dodgers came right back in the fifth inning with three singles, and with  one out, all that stood between a tie game was a single to the outfield by  Mario Duncan, who was batting a cool .500 (seven for 14) with three RBIs as a  pinch-hitter this season.  </P> <P> Hurst struck him out on three pitches.  </P> <P> Next up was Mario Duncan. Three pitches later, he hit a chopper to Clark, who  bobbled the ball, but recovered in time to toss it to Hurst covering the bag.  </P> <P> Hurst, though, was unable to escape unscathed in the sixth and seventh innings  when he gave up leadoff singles, each coming back to haunt him. Mickey Hatcher  drove in Kirk Gibson for the first run in the sixth, and Alfredo Griffin tied  the game in the seventh by driving in Jose Gonzales.  </P> <P> Hurst pitched a one-two-three eighth inning and foiled a Dodger rally in the  ninth but was left with the only satisfaction of not being the losing pitcher.  </P> <P> Padre Notes  </P> <P> Padre Manager Jack McKeon benched catcher Benito Santiago for the second  consecutive game Tuesday, starting Mark Parent instead. "Benny won't like it,"  McKeon said, "but that's tough. It's not a one-man team. He's still going to  catch his 125 games. He (Parent) caught a good game Sunday, the team played  inspired, we won, so I'll stay that way. Who knows, maybe I'll start him again  tomorrow, too?" . . . Parent, who has started consecutive games on just one  other occasion this season (four in a row from May 6-May 10) simply shrugged  his shoulders and said, "Hmm, Benny must be in the doghouse again." . . .  Santiago, who recognizes that Parent's two-run homer Sunday surely must have  had something to do with him being on the bench, said: "I'm getting used to it  by now." . . . McKeon and Cardinals Manager Whitey Herzog have been chosen by  the National League as coaches in the 1989 All-Star game, joining Dodger  Manager Tommy Lasorda and his staff. . . . The Gwynn brothers, Tony of the  Padres and Chris of the Dodgers, exchanged the lineup cards at home. . . . The  Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds are discussing a trade that would send pitcher Tim  Leary to the Reds for outfielder Kal Daniels. Daniels is hitting .231 with one  homer and six RBIs in 29 games after undergoing arthroscopic surgery this year;  Leary is 6-5 with a 3.12 ERA. . . . Dodger General Manager Fred Claire has  never made a trade with an NL West team, but Cook already has made three,  sending Dennis Rasmussen to the Padres, Buddy Bell to Houston and Jeff Treadway  to Atlanta. . . . Padre third baseman Bip Roberts failed for the first time in  three starts, and just the fourth time in his past 12 starts, to lead off the  game with a hit, grounding to shortstop. . . . Alfredo Griffin was in the  Dodger lineup as the leadoff hitter for the first time since Sept. 26, 1988. .  . . Dodger outfielder Mike Marshall, on the 21-day disabled list with lower  back problems, took batting practice for the first time since May 31. He said  that he expects to be playing again within a week. . . . The second game of the  three-game series is scheduled at 7:35 tonight with Ed Whitson (9-5) and Mike  Morgan (5-6) as the probable starters. Dennis Rasmussen (2-5) is scheduled  Thursday against Fernando Valenzuela (4-5) who has won four consecutive starts  after being winless for 51 weeks.  </P></p>

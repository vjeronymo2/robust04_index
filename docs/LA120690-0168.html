			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> NICHOLS INSTITUTE EXPECTS TO BUY LAB IN HOUSTON  </P> <P> Continuing its expansion drive, Nichols Institute said Wednesday that it has  reached a preliminary agreement to buy MPC Laboratory in Houston for $12  million.  </P> <P> The cash acquisition is expected to be completed in the spring of 1991 and will  bring the total number of medical laboratories in Nichols' network to 15 in  eight states, said James Whitmer, the company's chief financial officer.  </P> <P> MPC serves physicians, hospitals and clinics in south Texas and Louisiana, and  generates annual revenues of about $11.5 million, Whitmer said.  </P> <P> Since 1986, Nichols has pursued a strategy of acquiring one to three  laboratories annually to steadily broaden its geographic presence. The  laboratories that have been acquired provide routine tests for local hospitals  and physicians and funnel more complex tests to Nichols' more sophisticated  reference laboratory at its headquarters in San Juan Capistrano.  </P> <P> In the past Nichols has purchased laboratories in California, the Pacific  Southwest and the Midwest.  </P></p>

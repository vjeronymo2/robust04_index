At the end of  the session, conferees approved a number of reports on the  future of illegal drug trafficking in the region. The reports  outline possible preventive measures and call for vigilance by  regional states over the emergence of new trafficking methods  and techniques. They also call for the adoption of measures to  reduce illegal production in the region, which should be  followed by measures to reduce illegal demand for drugs in  consuming countries; the promulgation of appropriate  regulations, the adoption of other measures to effectively  implement the provisions of the 1988 agreement; and the exchange  of information on criminal organizations involved in illegal  drug trafficking in the region.    The reports also stressed the need for collective efforts  and  vigilance, especially at border monitoring posts, in order to  ensure greater effectiveness in organizing the traffic of  sulfates, and for supporting the recommendations of the  international conference on chemical operations. The reports  urge governments to extend support for the database of the  international commission for controlling narcotics, ensuring a  swift exchange of information among competent authorities, and  for issuing national legislation that prohibits the possession  of some critical chemical substances.    On cooperation in the field of cross-border investigations,  the reports stressed the need for close coordination to exchange  information and enable the authorities to fully achieve their  objective of spotting and arresting the traffickers. The  reports noted the need for coordination among international  organizations to prepare model training programs in the field of  combating money laundering and for coordination with Arab and  international centers to improve the performance of workers in  the field of combating drugs in the Near and Middle East. The  reports stress the need to promote cooperation among the World  Health Organization, Interpol, the customs cooperation council,  the international commission for monitoring drugs, the Arab  center for security studies and training, and the Arab Interior  Ministers' Council. They also stressed the need for cooperation  with the world network for regional intelligence communications  through the special bureau that is scheduled to be set up in the  Middle East in April 1994, and for preparing programs that deal  with the issue of treating and rehabilitating drug addicts.</p>

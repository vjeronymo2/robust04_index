			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] The National Counterterrorism Directorate  [Dincote] on 10 February confirmed the definite division of the  Shining Path into two antagonistic factions, which could lead to  the subversive organization's total defeat. [passage omitted]    Police also discovered a Shining Path training camp the  so-called "People's Liberation Army" and "People's Help" had  been using for training, physical preparation, and the use of  guns and explosives.    Police reported on 10 February that the training camp was  located at the top of Casablanca Hill, in the Jose Carlos  Mariategui shantytown, near Miguel Castro Castro prison in San  Juan de Lurigancho.    During the raid on the area, police found explosives and the  inscriptions of the aliases of the 10 [number as published]  alleged terrorists arrested.    According to the Dincote report, they have been identified  as  Miriam Tarazona Trujillo (21), alias "Rocio," and Jorge Manuel  Linares Bustamante, 25, alias "Francisco" or "Santiago." The two  are members of the PCP-SL [Peruvian Communist Party-Shining  Path] defense department "leadership cell."    Police agents presented to the press the following  individuals as "People's Liberation Army members:" Rolando  Hector Limachi Arevalo, alias "John," responsible for the  southern zone; Marco Antonio Huamani Soriano, alias "Mario,"  from the political command; and Shiomara Velasco Chavez, alias  "Edith," from the military command.    Police also presented "combatants" Miguel Angle Santillan  Coronel, alias "Jefri;" Jesus Honorato Alfaro Barrientos, alias  "Helton;" Oswaldo Cuya Garcia, alias "Luis;" and Carmen Consuelo  Llanos Inga, alias "Laura."    Also presented in striped uniforms were communicators  Alejandro Arturo Mayta Manrique, 33, handicapped -- he walks  with an orthopedic leg with a lot of difficulty; and Jose Carlos  Lopez Torres, 25.    According to Dincote, the last two are allegedly members of  the Shining Path's "People's Help" apparatus support department  (health section).    The Dincote agents stressed that with the arrest of these  individuals, police neutralized terrorist activities being  planned for metropolitan Lima's southern area.    In the individuals' possession police found six sketches of  streets, markets, and religious temples drawn by the PCP-SL  People's Guerrilla Army to be used in the sabotage of bank  offices and Pension Fund Administration (AFP) offices, and to  paint walls, distribute pamphlets, and murder policemen.    Dincote charged the arrested subversives with the  destruction  of five bank branches, Guido de Surquillo's bakery in San Juan  de Miraflores municipality, and the frustrated homicide of a PNP  [Peruvian National Police] lieutenant whose last name is Valle.    They also were held responsible for the sabotage against the  Peruvian Radio Television (Channel 7) station and Latin  Frequency (Channel 2) building on 14 January 1991 and 5 June  1992, respectively.</p>

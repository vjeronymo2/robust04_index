			<p><P> June 7, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RILEY'S FAST BREAK;  </P> <P> THE L.A. LAKERS' COACH HAS RISEN QUICKLY TO THE TASK OF MARKETING HIS LOOKS AND  INSPIRATIONAL SKILLS.  </P> <P> For Coach Pat Riley, there's a lot more riding on a third consecutive Los  Angeles Lakers National Basketball Assn. championship than another ring on his  finger.  </P> <P> A series win over the Pistons could also mean hundreds of thousands of  promotional dollars in his pocket. Much of it comes from motivational speeches  he gives to corporations such as Exxon -- which earn him up to $15,000 each.  And while Riley is currently a pitchman for six products -- from Southern  California Chrysler-Plymouth Dealers to Transamerica -- marketing experts say  he has yet to really cut the mustard as a big-time, national TV spokesman.  </P> <P> That, however, could change with all the speed of a Magic Johnson no-look pass.  In fact, if the Lakers beat the Pistons for a third straight championship, some  sports marketing experts project that Riley could soon be earning well over $2  million annually from a combination of his speeches, personal appearances and  commercials. That's several times more than his base annual salary with the  Lakers, which is reportedly $650,000.  </P> <P> In a brief telephone interview Tuesday from his hotel room in Troy, Mich. --  hours before the game -- Riley said his success as a product pitchman goes hand  in hand with his success as a basketball coach.  </P> <P> "I turned down offers for years," said Riley. "I had to develop my credibility  as a coach before I could become a credible product spokesman."  </P> <P> These days, Riley seems to get as much air time selling Chryslers for the  Southern California Chrysler-Plymouth Dealers Assn. as he gets for coaching the  Lakers. He is also a West Coast spokesman for Pepsi. Riley was featured in an  ad for Rolaids, a regional print campaign for Transamerica Life Cos., and  appeared with a cavalcade of stars in a commercial for Revlon that ran during  the Academy Awards. He is also under contract to Reebok, although he has yet to  appear in any of the athletic shoe maker's ads.  </P> <P> "All of these things are a direct result of my coaching. If I wasn't a good  coach, they'd fall by the wayside," said Riley. "Of course, I'm not going to be  a coach forever, so I hope some of these relationships can continue once my  career as a coach does end."  </P> <P> That is probably years off. Of more pressing concern to Riley -- and those who  consult Riley on his business ventures -- is how the Lakers fare against the  Pistons.  </P> <P> "Everybody loves a winner," said Marc Reede, president of Promotional  Sportstars, a Beverly Hills firm that books all of Riley's speaking  engagements. "If he loses, there might be certain bookings he won't get. Some  might say, 'Gee, let's give (Detroit Coach) Chuck Daly a call.' "  </P> <P> But whether the Lakers win or loose, Riley is charging more than ever these  days for personal appearances. In fact, Riley has recently raised his speaking  fees to $15,000 from the $10,000 that he charged last year when he gave about  60 speeches during the off season, said Reede.  </P> <P> "We're to the point now where we have to be very selective about his  engagements," said Reede, who estimates he is now getting 10 to 15 calls daily  about Riley's availability. "We thought it would be a way to cut demand if we  raised the price, but most people we see don't even blink when we say $15,000."  </P> <P> In fact, Riley's first corporate speech after the season ends will be June 27  in Dallas, when he is scheduled to speak to Abbott Laboratories executives on  the topic "Staying One Step Ahead of the Posse." During the off season, he is  also scheduled to speak to such diverse groups as Arby's Roast Beef and First  American Title. Reede said Riley writes all of his own speeches.  </P> <P> "After the speeches," said Reede, "he signs every photo and shakes every hand  and makes everyone feel important."  </P> <P> Still, it may be some time before Riley pulls in the kind of fees that some of  his peers are getting. Former football coach and current CBS television sports  analyst John Madden, for example, earns nearly twice what Riley does for a  single speech -- nearly $30,000.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Growing National Celebrity  </P> <P> Riley's biggest handicap, say marketing executives, is the advertising world's  general perception of him as a West Coast commodity.  </P> <P> "Right now, his appeal may be more skewed to the West Coast," said Bud Stanner,  senior vice president at International Management Co., a Cleveland sports  marketing firm. "But that can change. Pat Riley is a very, very marketable  sports celebrity. His team gets lots of TV exposure. He's attractive. And he's  smart."  </P> <P> Riley's other marketing problem is his lack of available time. Unlike retired  coaches -- such as Madden -- who have plenty of time to stand in front of TV  cameras, Riley's free time is mostly limited to the off-season months of July  through October.  </P> <P> "He has a schedule that could choke a horse," said John Morgan, senior director  of marketing at Reebok International. "Now, in particular, we should be doing  ads with him. We'd love to get a full day to shoot a commercial with him, but  it's not possible."  </P> <P> Just ask the officials at Southern California Chrysler-Plymouth. They had to  pack four TV commercials and 10 radio spots featuring Riley into just a few  days of filming. "It's very tough to spring him loose," said Dan White, manager  of the Studio City-based Southern California Chrysler-Plymouth Dealers Assn.  "He doesn't have the time to devote to us that we'd like."  </P> <P> That hasn't stopped Chrysler from paying Riley what experts estimate is  $100,000 annually -- plus the use of a $23,000 Chrysler New Yorker. And next  year, Chrysler's Los Angeles ad agency Bozell expects to start placing Riley  inside the cars -- instead of almost always standing outside the vehicles  tossing around a basketball.  </P> <P> "I think he's a hell of a coach," said Jim Preston, sales manager at Domenich  Basso Chrysler-Plymouth in downtown Los Angeles. "And I hope he keeps his job  with Chrysler. But to tell you the truth, I can't say anyone ever came in here  and said they were sent by Pat Riley. Of course, we still get some people who  say Ricardo Montalban sent them."  </P> <P> </P> <P> THE MONEY IN MOTIVATION  </P> <P> A third NBA championship would improve Laker Coach Pat Riley's earning power as  a celebrity.

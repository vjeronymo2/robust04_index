			<p>941210 FT  10 DEC 94 / London Stock Exchange: Coats hit by broker review Textile group Coats Viyella tumbled 11 to 192p on heavy turnover of 7.8m shares as one of the company's brokers cut its forecasts and another securities house also reduced its estimates. Blue-blood broker Cazenove never comments on market intelligence but rivals said it had reduced its 1994 forecast by Pounds 10m to Pounds 155m and next year's figure by Pounds 20m to Pounds 170m. Meanwhile, SG Warburg took a gloomy view of the whole sector and argued that Coats, being on a higher relative p/e than the market was most vulnerable to a fall. Analyst Mr Lawrence Rubin said rising raw materials, unseasonally warm weather and sluggish sales could push down the sector by 5 to 10 per cent against the market. Pending statements from Courtaulds Textiles on Friday and Coats around December 21 he reduced to Pounds 152.5m for this year and Pounds 162m for 1995.</p>

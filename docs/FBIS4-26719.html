			<p>BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, June 24 (XINHUA) -- About 30,000  passengers have been held up in this provincial capital of  Guangdong because of serious flooding which hit six southern  Chinese provinces from the middle of this month.    According to officials with the Guangzhou Railway  Administration, by this morning, the station had cancelled 44  passenger trains to other cities across the country since June  15, when it first stopped operating the No. 142 passenger train  to Chongqing city, Sichuan Province.    Some 100,000 passengers' trips in all were affected by the  cancellations.    The officials said they had to cancel more passenger trains  to Tianjin, Hangzhou and Kunming today and tomorrow. Almost all  the passenger trains now starting from Guangzhou going  southwards have arrived later than scheduled.    They predicted that train services at the station would not  be fully back to normal for several days.    For the past week the station has been staffing three extra  counters round the clock to deal with returned train tickets.    The number of passengers using the local civil air service  also plunged sharply compared with normal times. Many groups  who had planned to travel here for sightseeing or business  returned their air tickets and cancelled their plans.    But officials with the Guangzhou Baiyun Airport of China  South Airlines said that, in the past several days, the number  of air passengers seemed to be climbing again, as more and more  people switched to air travel from rail.    Water transport from Guangzhou to other areas was also  forced  to stop, until the water route from Guangzhou to Huizhou resumed  the day before yesterday.    The flooding on the Beijiang and Xijiang rivers has driven  the water level in the Pearl (Zhujiang) River up swiftly,  causing some areas of Guangzhou to be flooded and affecting  local transport.</p>

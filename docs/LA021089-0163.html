			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOT, HIP &amp; HAPPENING: ROLLS LIST MORE LATINOS, ASIANS  </P> <P> The numbers of Latino and Asian students in Orange County schools are still  climbing, while the number of Anglo students continues to fall, according to  figures released recently by the county Department of Education.  </P> <P> The total enrollment for this school year in the 28 school districts in the  county is 350,903, up from 344,969 for last year. Anglo students represent  58.6% of this year's total, down from 61% for the previous year. Their number  decreased to 205,505 from 211,080 in 1987. The number of Latino students  increased 11% over last year, the reports shows, and the number of Asian  students increased 5%.  </P> <P> Fifteen years ago, when the Orange County Department of Education first began  collecting figures on the racial and ethnic composition of its enrollments,  Anglos represented 85.9% of the total.  </P> <P> The trend in Orange County, which has been apparent for several years, mirrors  what is happening statewide. The State Department of Education reported last  September that for the first time, Anglo students were no longer the majority  in California schools. Their numbers this school year make up 49.2% of the  state total, according to a tally made just after the start of the 1988-89  school year.  </P> <P> In a competition against 48 others, Saddleback High School senior Rodelee Cruz  won the title of Miss Drill Team California in a pageant at Aviation High  School in Manhattan Beach. She placed first in modeling and in drill team  routine to take the title. She will compete for the national title April 1 in  Los Angeles.  </P> <P> "People who work sitting down get paid more than people who work standing up."  </P> <P>  -- Ogden Nash (1902-1971)  </P></p>

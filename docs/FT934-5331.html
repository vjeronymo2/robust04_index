			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / International Company News: India begins bank sale with public offering THE State Bank of India, the country's largest bank, is to launch a Rs22.4bn (Dollars 713m) equity and bond flotation on December 15 as a first step to its privatisation, writes RC Murthy in Bombay. Mr D. Basu, chairman, says a Rs12.4bn share issue will reduce the state's stake to around 68.8 per cent from 98.2 per cent. The bank will also offer floating-rate bonds worth Rs10bn. The shares will be offered at Rsl00, against the market price of Rs240, and foreign institutions will be given an opportunity to buy into the bank. The SBI is the first among 26 state-owned banks to offer equity to the public.</p>

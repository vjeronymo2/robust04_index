			<p>BFN     [Text] Chengdu, April 29 (XINHUA) -- Rural work must  center around guaranteeing the supply of agricultural products  and increasing farmers' income, a senior party official said  recently in central China's Sichuan Province.    Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the  Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and member of  the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks  during his recent inspection of rural areas of Sichuan, a major  agricultural province in China.    The countryside of China is undergoing a transformation from  bare subsistence to a comparatively wealthy lifestyle, and from  traditional to modern agriculture, according to Wen.    Two major strategic tasks lie before the development of  agriculture and the rural economy, namely, the guaranteeing of a  sufficient supply of agricultural products and the stable growth  of farmers' income, Wen said.    He pointed out that to reach the two targets, rural reforms  must be deepened to develop the rural economy in line with the  overall planning and requirements of establishing a socialist  market economic system.    Above all, the initiatives of farmers must be protected and  mobilized and the status of agriculture as the foundation must  be strengthened to guarantee its stable development, he noted.    Policies in favor of the development of major agricultural  products, mainly reasonable price and purchasing policies, must  be stipulated; high-efficiency and high-yield agriculture must  be developed, relying on science and technology; and the  government, collectives and individuals must all increase  investment in agriculture to strengthen its comprehensive  production capability, he said.    To increase farmers' income depends fundamentally on the  overall development of the rural economy and the improvement of  the rural economy's comprehensive efficiency, he pointed out.    He stressed that reforms must be deepened to realize the two  major targets. The official also stressed the importance of  market machanism in the distribution of resources agricultural  production and the supply of agricultural products.    On the other hand, the government must enhance the macro  control of agriculture, mainly through economic and legal  methods, to support and protect agriculture, improve the  stability and prosperity of the market and better protect the  interests of farmers and consumers, he said.    While the summer harvest is in sight, the late-stage  management of wheat must be strengthened and at the same time  the preparatory plowing for late spring crops must be stepped  up, Wen Jiabao pointed out.    Purchase funds for the harvest must be guaranteed to lay a  solid foundation for a harvest for the whole year, he noted.</p>

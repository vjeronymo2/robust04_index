			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Guangzhou, March 16 (CNS) -- The worrisome social  order in Guangzhou will be improved with an expected injection  of RMB [renminbi] 600 million into an improvement of police  equipment and facilities, city Mayor Mr. Li Ziliu said today.    Mr. Li made these remarks at a team discussion for Guangdong  deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) during the NPC  session in response to concern over the problem of social order  which is an important issue arousing great concern from the  Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, both of  which are currently being held here. Vice Chairman of the  Standing Committee of the Guangdong People's Congress, Mr. Fang  Bao, who was formerly in charge of the province's  law-enforcement work, said he was mainly worried about the  question of social order because it had become more critical in  the province than in other cities in recent years. Guangzhou, a  gateway to the province, first recived an impact from worsening  social order with some 50,000 criminal cases registered in the  municiality alone last year.    Mr. Fang said that the social order problem had been quite  serious in recent years even though much work had been done in  this sector. It was up to the public security police to deal  with public order, he said, while security teams comprised of  local residents had been set up as an auxiliary force to the  police. Some entities and government departments, however, had  not done their part in the maintenance of public order.    Mr. Li put the proper dealing with social order as the main  task in Guangzhou for the coming years. An injection of RMB 600  million will be used to improve salaries and police quality in a  bid to arouse the enthusiasm and morale of the police force.  The spending will also be used to improve police equipment and  facilities, creating better conditions for the police force.</p>

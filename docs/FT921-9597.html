			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Boiler factory to be closed POTTERTON Myson, part of Blue Circle Industries, yesterday announced the closure of its domestic boiler factory at Birtley, Co Durham, with the loss of 302 jobs. The company, which hopes to redeploy about 10 per cent of the Birtley workforce, said output would be transferred to the factory's sister plants at Padiham, Lancashire, and Warwick. Acquisition of Myson Group in late 1989 had given Potterton Myson more manufacturing capacity than was needed to meet expected demand. That was the main reason for the Birtley closure, the company said.</p>

			<p>920204 FT  04 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee prices tumble as pact hopes evaporate COFFEE PRICES continued to fall in both London and New York yesterday as any hopes of progress at this week's International Coffee Organisation talks disappeared. Last week's news that the Colombians were not sending a delegation to London from Bogota left New York's arabicas market sharply down on Friday. The Colombians have been angered by the failure of Brazil, the world's biggest coffee producer, to come up with a coherent policy on coffee in spite of months of consultation. The London May robusta contract closed last night at Dollars 887 a tonne, down Dollars 23 on the day, while in late trading the New York May arabica contract was down more than 2 cents at 73.30 cents a lb. Mr Nestor Osorio, Colombia's ICO representative in London, said yesterday that his country's commitment and interest in moving towards an international coffee agreement with economic clauses had not changed. The only way forward was to agree a method of controlling supplies, he said. However, there appeared to be no sense of urgency among other producers after two and a half years of depressed prices since the organisation's export quota system collapsed. Tomorrow the ICO working party is due to meet. Its mandate is to explore ideas for a renewed coffee agreement, and present its findings to the full ICO council in April. Consumers are not expecting any progress in this week's talks, and most analysts agree. But some delegates do not feel this week's meeting is necessarily the last before April, and that more talks are likely at the end of March, by which stage, Brazil is likely to have a clearer idea of its own internal and external policy. Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures broker, does not rule out the possibility of real progress being made this week. He believes there is a chance the market will be surprised and that progress can be made towards a revitalised quota scheme, pointing out that Brazil has not said it is against quotas. He also believes the US to be very much in favour of a new pact. Another analyst pointed out baldly: 'If the market at this level can't persuade them to be just a teeny bit constructive, what will?'</p>

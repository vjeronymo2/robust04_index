			<p><P> May 16, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH;  </P> <P> MOLA CORP. LOSES VOTE ON TRACT MAP  </P> <P> In a victory for residents, the City Council failed Monday in its weeklong  attempt to give the initial approvals required before Mola Development Corp.  can build a controversial $200-million project in the city.  </P> <P> After a week of marathon special meetings, the council adjourned its Monday  meeting at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday without approving a tentative tract map for the  development.  </P> <P> "This was a victory for the people," said Councilman Frank Laszlo, an opponent  of the Mola project. "They gave their message loud and clear" that the new  council sworn in Tuesday should vote on the project.  </P> <P> The City Council approved items amending the city's General Plan and adopting a  parcel map to clear the way for the development, but stopped short of approving  a tentative tract map for the project. A 4-1 majority of the council believed  that approving the tract map might give Mola a legal right to expect final  approval of the project.  </P> <P> However, not all city officials agree with this assessment. City Atty. Greg  Stepanicich said an initial approval does not give Mola that right, which comes  when the company's development agreement with the city has received two  approvals.  </P> <P> Outgoing Councilwoman Joyce Risner, who wanted to approve the Mola tract map,  was disappointed that the council failed to pass it.  </P> <P> "I don't think it would have made that much difference" in the event of a legal  challenge, Risner said.  </P> <P> Mola now holds an option on the 149-acre Hellman Ranch parcel where the company  wants to build a 329-unit residential project. The development also includes 41  acres of restored wetlands and 26 acres of public parks.  </P> <P> Mola has been trying to get the project approved for more than four years. The  City Council passed the project last fall, but the approvals were invalidated  by Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Ronald L. Bauer in March because  they were granted while the city was without a state-mandated plan for  accommodating future housing needs. The new City Council is scheduled to  consider the project May 29.

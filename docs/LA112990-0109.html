			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LIBERIA REBELS SIGN TRUCE; POLITICAL EFFECT UNCLEAR  </P> <P> Liberian rebels signed a cease-fire agreement Wednesday, but a West African  summit ended without a clear-cut political settlement to the country's 11-month  civil war.  </P> <P> Rebel leader Charles Taylor embraced some of his bitterest enemies after  accepting an immediate cease-fire.  </P> <P> The ceremony was hailed as a breakthrough by leaders at the summit of the  Economic Community of West African States.  </P> <P> But Taylor at once made it clear that he does not recognize the interim  government installed in Monrovia, the Liberian capital.  </P> <P> "The document that we signed states very clearly that no group in Liberia is  recognized as an interim government," he told a news conference.  </P> <P> After 11 months of fighting, Taylor and his foes agreed to join other Liberian  groups in talks on political arrangements before free elections.  </P> <P> Interim President Amos Sawyer, sworn in only one week ago in Monrovia as part  of a West African community peace plan agreed to in August, appeared the  biggest loser at the Bamako summit.  </P> <P> A statement issued at the end of the summit referred to a "future interim  government" -- effectively disowning Sawyer's.  </P> <P> The cease-fire accord was also signed by representatives of the two other  warring factions -- Prince Johnson's Independent National Patriotic Front of  Liberia and the Armed Forces of Liberia of former President Samuel K. Doe, who  was killed by Johnson's men in September.  </P> <P> These two groups are allied to a Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force  sent to Liberia in August.  </P> <P> Johnson's group underscored the confusion over Liberia's political leadership,  saying that it supports Sawyer.  </P> <P> Taylor, making V-for-victory signs, looked pleased at the outcome of the first  extraordinary summit in the 15-year history of the West African economic group.  </P> <P> Apart from not recognizing Sawyer, he said he would remain in charge of the  territory under his control, which he puts at 90% of the country.  </P> <P> Cease-fire details have yet to be worked out.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, March 4 (YONHAP) -- The National Assembly, on  the last day of its special session Friday, is to adopt revised  election bills providing legal and systematic grounds for the  political reform advocated by President Kim Yong-sam.    Negotiations on revision of the election law, the political  fund law and the local autonomy law resulted in an eleventh-hour  compromise between the ruling and opposition parties earlier  Friday.    The revised legislation is expected to stand as a turning  point for the establishment of "a new political culture" in this  country, where politicians could engage in activities "that do  not need money," as the slogan of the Kim Yong-sam  administration goes.    In a nutshell, politicians on both sides could compete on an  equal footing from now on, unlike in the past when  pro-government politicians enjoyed abundant campaign funds and  strong organizations while oppositionists had to resort to  demagoguery.    In an interview with the Korean Broadcasting System (KBS)  Thursday night, President Kim described the new political laws  as "revolutionary" and said they are needed if Korea is to join  the ranks of "advanced" nations in the true meaning of the term.    The new election law provides punishment for parliamentary,  gubernatorial, mayoral and local assembly candidates who spend  more than the legally mandated amount during the permissible  period of campaigning.    The spending limit for a presidential candidate is 22.5  billion won, down from 36.5 billion won. A candidate for the  National Assembly can spend up to 53 million won, down from 120  million won. The amount is smaller for candidates running for  local office.    An election will be nullified if a candidate spends more  money than legally allowed or if a candidate's family or  campaign workers are found to have violated the election law.    Candidates convicted of violating the election law will be  banned from running for elective office for 10 years.    The new law abolishes the system of paid campaign workers  and  prohibits political parties from holding rallies during  campaigning periods. Such rallies had served as occasions for  bribing voters in the past.    All candidates are required to disclose their personal  assets. They are also allowed to make as many outdoor campaign  speeches as they want.    The political fund law allows an individual to contribute up  to 150 million won to political parties, up from the current  limit of 100 million won. The government's subsidy to political  parties will rise to 800 won from 600 won per eligible voter.    The revised local autonomy law stipulates that all four  local  elections be held at the same time. It also calls for increased  allowances for local council members and their aides paid by the  state.</p>

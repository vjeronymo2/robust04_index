			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / China to hold first public auction of cultural relics CHINA is to hold its first public auction of cultural relics, among them pre-1795 objects formerly strictly banned from overseas sale to preserve the national cultural heritage. The auction, to run for three days from October 11, is a big departure from past practice. A US businessman recently offered Dollars 100m to buy a terracotta warrior from the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang, but his offer was turned down. The Chinese Communist party has tirelessly denounced foreigners for plundering and pillaging its ancient temples and Silk Road treasures in the late 19th and early 20th century, dismissing claims that the plundered objects were saved from destruction during decades of turmoil and chaos in China. Now it has been tempted into the market to compete with Sotheby's and Christie's in a bid to take some of the profit from the lucrative illegal relics traffic, run by highly-organised gangs of professional grave robbers and smugglers aided by corrupt police and customs officers. It is almost impossible to stop the cultural crooks operating across vast stretches of remote rural China, or restrain the dealers, collectors, museum curators and scholars outside China who make the illicit trade possible. China's Bureau of Cultural Relics has no money to spend to police the movement of large quantities of precious Chinese artifacts through foreign auction houses to overseas museums and the homes of wealthy western collectors. All across the country, China Daily reports, treasures hundreds and even thousands of years old are being lost to natural and man-made hazards. Some historical relics have been reduced to rubble and the vandalism of the cultural revolution is still not repaired. Thieves take advantage of the lag in excavating tombs and historic sites caused by lack of funds, digging them up and smuggling them out of the country. This year police in Shaanxi province in China's northwest, dealt with 846 cases of tomb robbing and 130 cases of smuggling cultural relics. They siezed over 3,300 relics and arrested 1,622 criminals. The proposed auction is aimed at recouping some of the losses to this murky underground antiques market by selling off relics at a profit abroad, taking advantage of sky-high prices for Chinese objets d'art, and generating some revenue for further excavations. The most famous of all China's archaeological digs, the pit near the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shihuang, where the 7,000 strong terracotta army was buried two millenia ago, is still only one quarter restored. Foreign money already goes to preserve some major treasures. Tomb frescoes in the Xian historical museum are partially funded with Italian money. American Express adverts in the Forbidden City testify to US conservation money. At October's auction 2,188 objects will go under the hammer, over 200 dating back to the 11th century BC. Co-sponsored by the Beijing Cultural Relics Bureau, the Beijing Auction Market and a Dutch company trading in Chinese antiques, the auction is expected to attract 1,000 international buyers. Ten per cent of the objects to be sold are privately owned, but their owners' names are not revealed. Lots include Chinese porcelain, jade, jewellery, antique clocks and watches, paintings and calligraphy, gold, silver and bronze, even old cars once used by VIPs.</p>

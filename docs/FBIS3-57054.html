In This Struggle  It Remains Unclear at Present Who Will Be Able To Break the Ural  Range"]    [Text] Yekaterinburg -- Many local analysts regard the  change of governor in Sverdlovsk Oblast as a victory for one  commercial and industrial clan over another. The 14 January  announcement that the oblast's former government was resigning  en masse was no coincidence. Yeltsin's decision to dismiss  Rossel is thereby disputed. The conclusion: The Ural lobby is  heterogeneous, and a new breed of politicians have emerged who  can dictate their will not only in the government but also to  the president himself.    The working career of Aleksey Strakhov, the oblast's new  governor who has replaced Eduard Rossel, is quite standard:  student construction detachments; the territorial administration  of the State Committee for Material and Technical Supply;  Yekaterinburg City Hall. Recently he preferred to be the first  deputy, in other words to control the essence of things while  staying in the shadows. The rapid finish by the "gray horse"  came as a complete surprise to the oblast's population....    Such a "demarche" by Yeltsin also came as a surprise to  Eduard Rossel, who believed that the writing and publication of  the constitution of the Ural Republic gave unlimited power to  him and to those close to business circles. Yes, Rossel's  protectionism with regard to firms such as "Inter-Ural" (90  percent of copper exports) and "Ural-Titan" (32 percent of all  the world's titanium) gave Eduard Ergartovich the right to  consider that he was de facto both the export-industrial leader  and the political leader of the Urals. The draft constitution  of the Ural Republic assigned to him his own security council,  his own militia, his own court, his own banking support, his own  foreign economic relations department.... That is, Eduard Rossel  was becoming Akinfiy Demidov [18th-century industrialist] under  the living Peter....    But, if you recall, Peter I sent Captain Tatishchev to found  Yekaterinburg (to counteract the mayhem of the Demidovs). Now,  271 years after the Demidovs' dominion in the Urals, history has  repeated itself.    It seems that the former governor did not attach great  significance to Yekaterinburg City Hall's attempts to win back  its agreed rights. Meanwhile, Yekaterinburg's industry, real  estate, and advertising space are worth many firms blessed by  Rossel.    Yekaterinburg's struggle against the arrogance of the oblast  authorities began long ago. I believe that Arkadiy Chernetskiy  and Aleksey Strakhov, first deputy head of Yekaterinburg,  absolutely disliked the idea of the Ural Republic, in which they  could remain "responsible for the capital's sewers." A huge  proportion of the oblast center's real estate, including that  leased by foreign consulates, would then have become the  republic's property.    Now the entire government of Sverdlovsk Oblast is following  Rossel in resigning! Yeltsin is being given to understand that,  along with Rossel, he "dismissed" those who had been responsible  for finances, transport, health care, and trade in the oblast  ever since Boris Nikolayevich was first secretary here, in the  Urals. Today it is stupid not to admit that the oblast lived  thanks to these officials' years-long experience and colossal  connections!    The president's circles believed that an opposition to the  old industrial-monopoly and commercial clan would come into  being in Yekaterinburg thanks to Strakhov's promotion. Such a  struggle is better than one between the region and the center.  Boris Nikolayevich is now getting -- in the person of Rossel and  his business circles -- not only a sovereign-economic opposition  but also a tough political one. It is paradoxical but, having  previously overcome the Moscow lobby, Yeltsin came right up  against the Ural lobby. Evidently, he must understand that this  will be the case with every territory where "loyal colleagues  and friends" remain.    Within a matter of days Eduard Rossel created the "Ural  Transformation" nonparty sociopolitical association to nominate  its candidacy for the Federation Council. Rossel is cunning  when he calls his association a "nonparty" one. He simply did  not want to associate his name with the Party of Consolidation,  whose representative is Aleksandr Tikhonov, leader of the  "Inter-Ural" Joint Venture. Precisely this party elaborated the  new "Regional Development Concept," and it has the backing of  the "Industrial Union" with the aggrieved military-industrial  complex. "Ural Transformation" can be nonparty only in the  sense of the treasury ruble's transformation into the  nontreasury dollar....    The fight to the death is continuing. I believe that  Sverdlovsk Oblast's old government will flow into the new  commercial structures and substructures of Rossel's business  circle. Strakhov will have a hard time. The monopoly will  endeavor to leave him in the role of the oblast's chief  supplier, for they never lived in the age of competition and  will never tolerate it! In the Federation Council Rossel will  promote the principle of Russia's territorial division as a  counterweight to national-territorial division and might become  a Russian national hero.    What will the nonparty Yeltsin do in this situation?</p>

Speaking at a news conference in Moscow on Wednesday,  Chubays  said that "there is a threat to the course of reform, although a  potential one." "There is not a single decision of the  government which could be regarded as a move to slow down or  stop reforms," he said.    Chubays stressed that the government will adopt a budget for  the first quarter of the year shortly. "Only after that will we  be able to understand whether the government is ready to  continue the course of reform which was pursued in 1993. It  will also become clear whether the government will continue the  programme adopted in September 1993," he said.    "Only after that can one give a final assessment of the  government reshuffle," the vice-premier said.    Speaking about his plans for the future, Chubays said that  he  "intends to bear responsibility for the course of privatisation  to the end." "The programme of privatisation continues to  develop. According to our programme, bigger and more efficient  enterprises will be put on auction in February, March and  April," he added.    Chubays expressed the confidence that the "programme of  privatisation will be implemented in full and within the terms  envisaged by the presidential decree."</p>

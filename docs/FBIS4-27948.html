			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["General Director of DPRK General Department of the Atomic </F> Energy Sends Letter to General Director of IAEA" -- KCNA  headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Pak Yong-nam, general  director of the General Department of the Atomic Energy of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea, sent a letter to Hans  Blix, general director of the International Atomic Energy  Agency, on June 6 regarding the wrong "conclusion" of the IAEA  Secretariat that the technical possibility of later measurement  of fuel rods at the five megawatt experimental atomic power  plant in the DPRK was lost.    The letter says:    I very much regret to know that you made a "hasty  conclusion"  that the agency could not provide assurance about the  non-diversion of nuclear material, alleging as if the technical  possibility for later measurement of core fuel rods would have  been lost at the 5 mw experimental nuclear power plant.    We have agreed, a few days ago, to the agency's deputy  director general's proposal on the consultation by exchange of  telexes in respect of the refueling campaign and requested the  agency to provide us with a scientific and technical answer to  the manner proposed by us for preserving the technical  possibility for later measurement of fuel rods. Nevertheless,  you have not yet answered our proposal and transmitted to the UN  Security Council an unreasonable report in which facts were  misrepresented, speaking ill of us as if we had not yet replied  to the agency's letter.    Moreover, what we cannot but make an issue of is the fact  that you have ignored our unique status based on the suspension  of the effectuation of our withdrawal from the NPT [Nuclear Non-  Proliferation Treaty]. This our unique status has been created  and recognized by the USA and IAEA. For these reasons, they  agreed to the inspection for the continuity of safeguards  knowledge, and so far the agency has conducted not the routine  and ad hoc inspection under the safeguards agreement, but the  inspection for the continuity of safeguards knowledge.    At present, the refueling campaign, too, is being conducted  in the presence of the IAEA inspectors and under the IAEA  surveillance and containment on the basis of the above-mentioned  principles.    The IAEA inspectors, too, who are present during the  refueling have recognized that there is no diversion of nuclear  material from the reactor. Speaking of the verification of the  core history alleged by the agency, the matter will be resolved  automatically if our unique status will be removed.    At present, we are conducting the refueling campaign  preserving the technical possibility for later measurement of  fuel rods on the assumption that our unique status will be  removed. The fuel discharge operation has been carried out  channel by channel, channel group by channel group in sequence,  and 40 rods from 4 channels have been discharged into one  basket. All the operations of core discharge including the  identification numbers of baskets and channels, sequence of rods  in a channel, and the position of baskets in the spent fuel pond  have been kept on the accounting and operating records by  operators and confirmed by the IAEA inspectors every day.    This shows that the refueling operation is conducted in such  a manner as preserving the possibility of reconstructing the  channels of fuel rods and the sequence of rods in the channel,  if necessary. The adequacy of the manner of preserving the  technical possibility for later measurement has been proven not  only theoretically but also experimentally. This is the only  rational method suitable to our unique status. All the facts  show that the agency can verify whether the nuclear material  from the reactor has been diverted in the past, at the time when  our unique status is removed.    Nevertheless, it was referred in your reports to the IAEA  Board of Governors and the UN Security Council that "any future  measurement of that fuel would have no practical value because  they would have to be based on operators' records which are  unverifiable and also because it would not be possible to  reconstruct the configuration of fuel rods in the core." This  shows that you seem to have no interest in a fair solution of  "our nuclear issue," in keeping with your prejudiced political  view in advance. Our practical experience from the past agency  inspections shows that the more we accepted IAEA inspections  with our maximum goodwill and generousness, the more artificial  obstacles the agency made to the solution of our issue, leading  us to serious situation, in attaching an unreasonable condition  to us every time.    We made our position clear during the February board meeting  in 1993 that the inconsistencies could be clarified if the  agency verifies the fuel rods from the core during the refueling  campaign. However, at that time, the IAEA Secretariat objected  to our proposal, alleging that the inconsistencies could not be  resolved in such a manner and made the board adopt the  resolution of "special inspection of two ordinary military  sites".    After the last March inspection, the IAEA Secretariat  transmitted to the UN Security Council the matter of the  "non-completed inspection activities" alleging that it is  indispensable for the agency to carry out the smear taking from  the glove boxes and gamma mapping in the building 3 at the  radiochemical laboratory in order to verify non-diversion of  nuclear material, upon the return to Vienna by the agency  inspection team that had completed the activities for the  continuity of safeguards knowledge. When we permitted the  agency to conduct "non-completed inspection activities" as a  special exception, the agency this time said to us that it is  indispensable to measure the fuel rods from the core, which was  a matter already denied by the agency in the past.    On one hand, the agency inspection team cancelled the  agreement on the archive samples for clarification of the  inconsistencies during the past inspection, and on the other  hand, the agency says that it is indispensable for the agency to  make "special inspection of two ordinary military sites" to  verify non-diversion of nuclear material. This shows that the  IAEA Secretariat continues to join the USA in their hostile  policy towards the DPRK to make our ordinary military sites open  one by one under the pretext of the inspection.    The current development of the refueling campaign bears  resemblance to the IAEA's pressure campaign at the beginning of  1993 when the agency cooked up the non-existent  "inconsistencies" on the basis of the false intelligence  information provided by a third party and imposed on us the  so-called "special inspection of two ordinary military sites",  on the basis of the "inconsistencies." I think such  unreasonable acts of the IAEA are unprecedented events in the  history of safeguards.    I would like to remind you that, for these reason, we could  not but withdraw from the NPT last year.    In the light of the above, we cannot but doubt whether our  nuclear issue can, indeed, be resolved through further  consultations with the IAEA.    Recently, the IAEA Secretariat has laid obstacles to our  normal nuclear activities concerning the refueling operation at  the beginning of the campaign, intentionally avoiding the  presence of the IAEA inspection team. On the other hand, at  present, they have added another obstacle to a smooth solution  of our nuclear issue by making a hasty conclusion that the  agency could not provide assurance about the non-diversion of  nuclear material. All these are very irresponsible and hasty  behaviour where by the objective reality has been intentionally  misrepresented.    Accordingly, the IAEA Secretariat will have to bear the full  responsibility for all the consequences arising from such wrong  conclusion and unreasonable behaviour. If the IAEA Secretariat  takes our nuclear issue to the UN Security Council and continues  to resort to only pressure on the basis of "hasty conclusion"  that the technical possibility for later measurement of the fuel  rods has been lost, widening its unfairness and partiality, we  will not feel any longer the need that we are subject to the  unreasonable binding of the IAEA Secretariat and cannot but go  over to the next process of our peaceful nuclear activities.</p>

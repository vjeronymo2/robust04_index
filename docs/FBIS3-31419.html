Yesterday, Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav Republic of  Macedonia -- FYROM] had the opportunity of experiencing such a  pleasure.    Macedonia kept its cool while the most irreconcilable  opponents against its international recognition, namely the  Socialists, won the elections in Greece. The Macedonians still  remained calm when the Greeks withdrew from the UN negotiations  about Macedonia because of the country's new name and flag.    When political circles in Athens threatened to close their  country's borders with Macedonia, the ruling forces in Skopje  briefly commented that this could not be serious.    When the EU member-countries, one after the other,  established diplomatic relations with Macedonia, the Greek  Minister of European Affairs Theodhoros Pangalos started  behaving like a drunken third class actor, getting on the  Western powers' nerves. On that occasion Macedonia experienced  a certain satisfaction which was hardly noticeable, nevertheless.    The confession of certain Greek diplomats who admitted that  the dispute with Skopje is a lost cause for Greece was also  accepted without any comment on the part of Macedonia.    The official recognition of Macedonia's sovereignty by the  White House was the latest confirmation of the fact that  Macedonian politicians are betting on the right card.    Since the very first day of its separation from former  Yugoslavia Macedonia has been conducting a consistent policy  aimed at winning the good will of the United States. This  applies to all Macedonian political actions starting from a  courageous minority policy, such as none of the Balkan countries  dares to promote (as a matter of fact, the results followed in  due time, and the police just managed to prevent an Albanian  separatist conspiracy) to the Macedonian government's persistent  and heroic struggle which was finally crowned by the stationing  of a U.S. "blue helmets" contingent in the republic.    According to some political observers, certain actions of  other Balkan countries, such as Bulgaria's refusal to allow U.S.  nuclear arms to be deployed on its territory, and last but not  least, the stubborn behavior of Greece, are positively  contributing to Macedonia's good relations with the West.    Until yesterday Washington was the last hope for Athens.  Since yesterday the U.S. is the strongest shield for the  protection of Macedonia's independence. There is even more --  by the act of establishing diplomatic relations with Macedonia  the White House assumed the role of chief actor -- temporarily  in charge of the Macedonian drama and reversed the positions.    Athens, which relied on its international contacts, on its  traditional presence in West European affairs, and on its  membership in the European international organizations, suddenly  appears to be in a situation very similar to that described as  international isolation.    Macedonia, whose government, until recently, used to  complain  about the Western countries' lack of interest and about the  inconsistency of their behavior toward Macedonia, finally  awaited the moment of sticking its tongue without any risk. As  a matter of fact Macedonia did so yesterday by proposing to  resume negotiations with Athens, with a somewhat offensive  magnanimity.</p>

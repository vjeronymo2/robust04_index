			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Andrey Petrovich Bykov, deputy director of </F> the Russian Federal Counterintelligence Service, by Ye.  Golubeva; under the "Dossier" rubric of the "Utro" program;  place and date not given]    [Text] This is the first time a scientific and practical  conference being held in our country on individual, public, and  state security and the Russian special services is open to the  press. A speech by Sergey Stepashin, director of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS], made it clear the FCS has  completed its reform for the time being and has begun  functioning. The FCS's role must grow in combating organized  crime and its politization, terrorism, and political extremism.  Apart from purely counterintelligence activities, also put  forth were the goals of protecting state and commercial secrets  as well as a certain amount of protection for private  enterprises participating in the national economy. By the way,  a representative of the Foreign Intelligence Service announced  that the question was being examined of channeling information  beneficial for the country's economy to commercial structures.    A concept of national security has not been formed in our  country. While the national interests of the USSR were often  obstructed, whether as a concession to its allies' interests or  in order to fight its opponents, today Russia can have both  allies, competitors, and opponents. However, our national  interests must be free from ideology. Today there is an opinion  in the West that Russia cannot undertake peacekeeping missions  in conflict zones bordering the territory of the CIS; supposedly  this will be indicative of imperial deportment. However, Russia  is a member of the UN and can carry out this mission under UN  aegis. Second, who outlines the limits of the United States'  national interests? However, this is rhetorical. Let us talk  about individual security with Andrey Petrovich Bykov, deputy  director of the Russian FCS. By the way, confidential sources  told me that Andrey Petrovich, who is a doctor of technical  sciences, is also one of the leading experts on defusing  homemade, non-standard explosive devices of previously unknown  configurations.    [Begin recording] [Golubeva] The subject is individual,  public, and state security and the special services. For the  first time, the individual is placed at the forefront .    [Bykov] That is because while we have always discussed state  security as a conceptual problem of guaranteeing the security of  the Soviet Union, today, as we shift to the building of a new  rule-of- law democratic society, and since we are about to join  the world community, we all must observe world standards; that  includes the special services. All international documents, as  well as the human rights declaration, view individual security  as the first priority. It is not completely understood yet how  individual security can be achieved in our changing state.    [Golubeva] What is your opinion?    [Bykov] I cannot fully answer this question either. It is  precisely the goal of today's conference to develop conceptual  and pragmatic approaches to the everyday activities of the  special services--and the FCS among them--which would allow us  to solve this problem of individual, public, and state security  and the legal activity of the Russian special services. We can  issue statements on guaranteeing individual security, but we  still have not developed the mechanism for it. After all, there  are a lot of problems here-- information, personal, physical,  and economic security of the individual. There are no legal  documents today which would fully define the aspects of this  huge problem, which is not only a state problem but one of the  individual and society, of every one of us. Using a rather  vulgar expression, I would even call it street security, among  other things.    [Golubeva] How long will it take to develop the mechanisms  for protecting the individual in our society?    [Bykov] I am a very pragmatic person, so I will refrain from  categorical prognosis because the country's situation today is  fairly unstable; the financial, banking, and credit system is  very unbalanced; and these issues determine to a large extent  the implementation of all the prerequisites, without which it is  impossible to talk about personal security.    [Golubeva] Are positive relations emerging today between the  FCS and the government and deputies?    [Bykov] The government, State Duma, and Federal Assembly  reachs an understanding on all principle questions. The same  applies to the government structure and the president's  administration. We are corrected on certain issues. This is  probably an inevitable process, and reaching an accord is always  a result of work achieved by both sides.    [Golubeva] Do you have the right to make corrections?    [Bykov] Well, we present our proposals.    [Golubeva] Can you confirm these numbers: There were  135,000 staffers in the Federal Counterintelligence Service  until the last reform; there are 75,000 today.    [Bykov] Yes, that is correct.    [Golubeva] Has there been any change in relations between  the Russian and U.S. special services following the Ames affair?    [Bykov] We have witnessed no changes yet in those areas in  which we cooperate with the U.S. special services. Our contacts  in fighting international terrorism, the drug trade, and the  arms trade continue at the same level as before. After all, we  cooperate with the German special services even though we  recently exposed their agent. There is no contradiction.    [Golubeva] Is there any hope the names of the 20 identified  spies who worked against Russia will be made known to the public?    [Bykov] When the situation is ripe, we will relate it all in  detail. You understand, they did not work in a vacuum, and  every case branches off extensively, so it is not proper to tell  everything at once.    [Golubeva] My "Dossier" rubric features six of them; 14  remain.    [Bykov] The time will probably come when all 14 of them  feature in your file.    [Golubeva] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

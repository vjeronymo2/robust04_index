Yesterday there was a meeting  with representatives of the Defense Ministry, and a special  group was formed for dealings with the Federation Council  Committee. Your ITAR-TASS correspondent was told this by Petr  Shirshov, chairman of the Committee for Security and Defense  Questions.    In its work the committee intends to "cooperate with the  corresponding committees of the State Duma and also to expand  contacts with the corresponding committees of the CIS  countries." Petr Premyak, deputy chairman of the Committee for  Security and Defense Questions, believes that the committee  especially needs to cooperate with the corresponding committees  in the Ukrainian parliament and in the parliaments of the Baltic  states.    In Petr Shirshov's opinion, the committee will be guided in  its activity by the Russian Federation Constitution, will also  monitor the execution of the laws, and where necessary will  prepare proposals and submit them in the form of legislative  initiatives.</p>

			<p><P> April 11, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ADVICE FOR DICK CHENEY  </P> <P> Regarding Eugene Carroll's column on Cheney's approach to dealing with  individual service chiefs (Op-Ed Page, March 29), I just want to express my  disagreement with the ex-rear admiral and applaud Cheney. Certainly, some new  approaches must be explored to jolt the services out of their parochial  attitudes, including having the commander-in-chief encourage early retirement  for those military men who won't follow orders and accept some fiscal  responsibilities. Carroll would have Cheney clasp hands with just the folks who  cause the problem.  </P> <P> This fine example of the military mentality wants to blame the defense industry  for poor procurement decisions by the Pentagon. That's analogous to my blaming  the department stores for permitting my wife and I to overextend our credit  cards.  </P> <P> I have a real concern for what might be coming out of the Center for Defense  Information with a deputy director who's looking for someone else to blame.  </P> <P> BYRON RAMEY  </P> <P> La Crescenta  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item by Vjekoslav Radovic] </F>   [Text] New York, April 19 (TANJUG) -- Only a few hours  after Bosnian Moslem presidency President Ejup Ganic, to his own  admittance, "implored and begged" the U.N. secretary-general to  do something about Gorazde, Butrus Butrus-Ghali asked NATO  Secretary- General Manfred Woerner to mount air strikes against  Bosnian Serb positions.    The Russians were again not consulted and this caused a very  angry reaction of Russian U.N. Ambassador Yuliy Vorontsev.    Following Butrus-Ghali's announcement, Vorontsev stormed out  of the Security Council session saying that air strikes could  not be launched without approval of the Security Council and  that otherwise the U.N. would be directly involved in the  Bosnian war on the Moslem side.    Senior reporters at U.N. headquarters say they have not seen  such reaction from Russia since the time of the Cold War.    Vorontsev argued that although air support to U.N. troops on  the ground was "the sacred duty" of the world organization, air  strikes were something completely different because they would  automatically draw the U.N. in war operations, not only in the  air, but on the ground too.    The United Nations should decide whether it wants war or  mediation and the Security Council should rule on this matter,  said Vorontsev.    Those who support air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions  maintain that the U.N. does not need special authorization of  the Security Council to launch the strikes and invoke Resolution  836 of June 8, 1993 to support their position.    Para 10 of Resolution 836 says that U.N. member-nations,  individually or through regional organizations and arrangements,  can undertake, under the authority of the Security Council and  in close cooperation with the secretary-general and the U.N.  Protection Force (UNPROFOR), all the necessary measures,  including the use of air power in and around the U.N.-designated  "safe areas" in Bosnia- Herzegovina, to support UNPROFOR in  carrying out its mandate.    A heated debate will probably ensue in the Security Council  about the interpretation of this provision.    Butrus-Ghali and the majority of the council members believe  that the provision gives them a free hand. The Russians, for  their part, could come out with a counterargument that the word  "authority" in the text stands for special approval of the  Security Council, which could create an impasse.    Vorontsev's argument that it is completely wrong for the  United Nations to become involved in the Bosnian war on the side  of only one of the belligerents may finally prevail. "This is  our position and we will strongly defend it," Vorontsev was  categorical.</p>

			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Letter: UK should press for D-Mark to be revalued, says Kinnock Sir, This morning I can write without having my words treated as formal Labour Party policy. I do so to urge that the government takes a real lead amongst the ERM countries in pressing for an immediate revaluation of the D-Mark. If the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer have urged this step in their frequent meetings with their German counterparts in the last month, it has remained a rather better kept secret than usual. In any case, if they have been rebuffed they should - they must - keep on trying. A D-Mark revaluation would reduce inflationary pressures in Germany - with complementary benefits in lower German interest rates, enhance the flow of capital into Germany required for reconstruction in the east and thereby, via higher German imports, contribute to higher output and employment throughout Europe. It would also allow other ERM countries, Britain in particular, to avoid the heavy costs which loss of credibility would impose on any unilateral devaluation. If there are some ERM members - France might be an example - whose governments are against a D-Mark revaluation, the British government should exercise maximum influence and point out that they, too, should benefit from a revaluation as an alternative to the interest rate pressures which will inevitably persist given the combination of current exchange rates and inflationary pressures in Germany. There are some who might argue that it would be unbecoming for the British government to try to persuade the Germans to aid the British economy and the rest of the Community by revaluation. But such an approach would be a great deal more elegant than Norman Lamont's plea to the Bundesbank not to increase interest rates. Much more important, it would be part of the package of measures which are required to lead the European Community away from stagnation, and provide Britain with an alternative to the devastating high real interest rate policy being pursued by the government.

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / UK Company News: Licence loss hits Serif Cowells SERIF COWELLS, the USM-quoted printing, publishing and leisure group, tumbled from profits of Pounds 1.34m to losses of Pounds 2.21m pre-tax in 1991, described by the company as 'a traumatic year of change'. The final dividend is passed. Last time there was a final of 0.5p for a total of 2p. Sales declined sharply to Pounds 34.4m (Pounds 62m), mostly because of the loss in 1990 of the licences to distribute Trivial Pursuit and Nintendo. On top of that, 'the depressed economic conditions severely affected market demand and significantly reduced margins in all group companies', according to Mr John Pryke, chief executive. Group operating losses emerged at Pounds 724,000 (profits Pounds 3.2m). Other income rose to Pounds 307,000 (Pounds 222,000), interest charges were sharply down at Pounds 748,000 (Pounds 2.08m) and there was a Pounds 1.04m exceptional charge relating to the reorganisation of continuing operations. To cut gearing, the company undertook a programme of disposals - an extraordinary charge of Pounds 3.18m (Pounds 44,000) related to this, and in the year borrowings were reduced by Pounds 1.7m. Gearing is currently about 30 per cent: at the year-end it was 65 per cent. Losses per share worked through at 10.1p (earnings of 3.5p).</p>

			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / Survey of Cornwall (6): Sea, sun and sand - Tourism becomes the county's biggest employer FROM the long beaches of the wild north coast to the rocky inlets and bays of the south, few counties in the UK can offer the coastal variety of Cornwall whether interests focus on fishing out of the picturesque villages like Mevagissey and Looe on the south or surfing on the huge strands at Newquay and elsewhere on the northern shore, or building sandcastles or walking along the rugged cliffs. The Scilly Islands in the far west also attract great attention. It takes two hours to reach them by boat from Penzance; 15 minutes by fixed wing aircraft; and 22 minutes by helicopter. Inland there is the beautiful Bodmin Moor, and lots of other stunning scenery. Accordingly, Cornwall remains one of the favourite holiday spots in Britain. A plan drawn up for the Tourism Action Plan Programme estimates that with more than 3m visitors Cornwall in 1989 was the seventh busiest holiday county in England in terms of holiday trips, second after Devon for numbers of holiday nights; and third largest recipient of holiday spending after Devon and London. Following the collapse of tin mining and other manufacturing activities, tourism is Cornwall's most important industry. A University of Bradford study undertaken in 1987 reckoned it accounted for 33,042 jobs and the British Tourist Authority in 1986 put the number at 33,603. This is about 21 per cent of all jobs in Cornwall, more than twice the level estimated to be employed in the tourism industry in Devon. More than half these jobs were full time. In 1989, total tourism expenditure was put at Pounds 585m by the English Tourist Board. In addition to hotel bills, this included cash spent in shops and restaurants, on self-catering and ancillary professional services. In spite of the apparent buoyancy, however, all is not entirely well. Cornwall clearly continues to attract lots of visitors. For example, almost one third of all holiday makers are perennial returners. Almost one third also go to Newquay. These are predominantly young people for its night life as well as its go long beach. But historically the industry has been in decline. At the end of the 1970s there were nearly 4m visitors and Pounds 350m was spent in 1979. . Given inflation and the more restricted criteria on which spending was calculated this was probably per capita more than today. The reasons for the decline, also found in other British resorts, are that the advent of the package tour to the Costa Del Sol replaced the British old style, long-stay, bucket and spade summer holiday. People turned to Europe and beyond. Partly to arrest the trend long-a three year Tourism Development Action Programme was set up in 1989 to look at the possibilities. A joint venture of the English Tourist Board and the local authorities and tourism organisations, the TDAP, found that while long holidays are not generally increasing in numbers and value, other types of tourism are. Cornwall still has an average length of stay of seven days, longer than in which is long compared to south-east coastal resorts such as Brighton and Bournemouth. The TDAP set out to develop short breaks and business tourism markets to encourage more visitors to stay and develop business outside of the main season. It has attempted to improve, grade, develop and market accommodation the visitor needs. It has tried to improve tourist information centres, and sign-posting to target the wealth of heritage centres, not just ancient castles, fine old houses and maritime centres but also industrial museums and artefacts. It has helped to establish the Cornwall Creative Network which has identified 136 different kinds of specialist holidays which can be taken in Cornwall. They range from fishing and bird watching to brass rubbing, flower collecting and Cornish language courses. Some developments have taken place independently, such as the upgrading of Land's End by one of Mr Peter de Savary's companies. According to one of Mr de Savary's colleagues, when the group bought the 120 acres of Land's End in 1987 for Pounds 7m it was virtually derelict and cliff erosion made many of the walks unsafe. It has spent Pounds 4m on shoring up the cliffs, refurbishing the hotel and building a heritage centre. Land's End still attracts 700,000 visitors a year, its previous total. . But while they used to stay only eight minutes, during which they might buy little more than a postcard, they now stay for nearly three hours and spend Pounds 6 per head. Another example of value being added to tourism is at Falmouth, where Mr De Savary has built a marina and flats. The most striking development, however, has been in the growth of self-catering holidays. These are no longer taken in the old-style post second world war prefabs or parked caravans, but in cottages and houses bought as investments and/or second homes. They are usually renovated to a high standard. Because of tax concessions some businesses have bought groups of them, which are managed by agencies. But even a single cottage owner can run it as a business and set all costs against income (even interest on loans to buy it) and avoid capital gains tax until retirement. The conditions are that the house be let for at least 140 days a year and that no single tenancy should exceed 31 days in any seven months. As a result of the mushrooming of these houses and cottages, 60 per cent of all holidays in Cornwall are now taken in self-catering units and the season has been lengthened. The self-catering holidays have become equally controversial for a different reason. Local people do not like outsiders bidding up property prices thereby putting them beyond the reach of young residents. Although Cornwall's tourism is changing and the decline appears to have been arrested , through self catering and the growth of foreign and other visitors, it has not been without cost in some Cornish eyes.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ASCE 7&hyph;88: Wind Load Provisions in Model Codes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Building codes in each State or local jurisdiction control the design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and construction of buildings and structures in that jurisdiction. Most  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> communities in the United States adopt, in large part, one of the three model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building codes: the National Building Code of the Building Officials and Code  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrators International (BOCA); the Standard Building Code (SBC) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Southern Building Code Congress International, Inc. (SBCCI); or the Uniform  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Building Code (UBC) of International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Wind load provisions in these model building codes are based on the ASCE 7&hyph;88  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard, but with some modifications.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard considers all of the factors that influence the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> magnitude of wind loads on a building. In addition to wind speed, those  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> factors include: (1) Terrain surrounding the building, (2) shape of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building, and (3) desired safety of the building frame and components. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model building codes use most of these factors from ASCE 7&hyph;88, but modify some  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the factors based on experience; because of tradition, other factors are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> not considered.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some provisions of model building codes are adopted from industry  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manuals. The use, adoption, and modification of wind-load factors by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model building codes result from an attempt to simplify the wind-load  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions and react to the concerns of affected industries and special  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interest groups. In general, these modifications by model code agencies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in lower design requirements for wind forces than would be required  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> under ASCE 7&hyph;88.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Even with these modifications, final wind loads for most buildings are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> fairly consistent in all model building codes. All three of the major model  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building codes incorporate the basic wind speed map of ASCE 7&hyph;88, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reference the ASCE standard in whole or in part, but either modify the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard or require additional prescriptive design and construction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions. In addition, all three provide the use of ASCE 7&hyph;88 as an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative to be applied at the discretion of the designer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, the model building codes do not cover the design or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction of manufactured housing. The only control local governments have  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> over manufactured housing and mobile (manufactured) home parks is through  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain zoning regulations, or anchoring, set-up, or installation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements. As noted by one commenter (150) and discussed in the next  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section of this preamble, incorporation of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> critical to ensuring continued acceptance of manufactured housing by local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> jurisdictions in high wind areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Building Codes in Southern Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Generally, the local jurisdictions in Florida have adopted modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the SBC or South Florida Building Code (SFBC). As one of its primary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recommendations in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew, the 18-member Dade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> County, Florida, Grand Jury stated that the 35-year-old South Florida Building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code must be rewritten to duplicate the tougher, national wind standard of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASCE 7&hyph;88. The Grand Jury recognized ASCE 7&hyph;88 as a standard that more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequately reflects the design strength necessary for windows and doors. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> acknowledgment of the Grand Jury's recommendations, the Dade County Building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Code Committee adopted (effective January 1, 1994) the Wind Loads section of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASCE 7&hyph;88, using Exposures C and D, only. The Grand Jury further recommended  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that Dade County officials issue a moratorium on the permanent replacement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured homes until officials could be assured that the replacement homes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standards. Further, noting that lower standards are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applied to manufactured housing than to conventional housing, the 1992 Fall  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Term Grand Jury asserted that ``the low standard amounted to discrimination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against those persons unable to afford the costs of conventional housing.''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In its Final Report, filed August 4, 1993, the Dade County Grand Jury  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referenced the initial Grand Jury findings regarding the engineering  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> advantages of the ASCE 7&hyph;88 standard and commended its adoption into the SFBC.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Grand Jury reported that:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> [T]his additional and essential modification of the SFBC should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provoke a wide-ranging improvement of most of our building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> designs, methods and products. It should also result in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> building of structures that will provide greater safety and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> security during a hurricane.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> In order to protect those living in and near manufactured homes, the Grand  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Jury has reiterated the recommendation that a moratorium be instituted on the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation in the County of any new mobile homes that do not meet the wind-loading standards of ASCE 7&hyph;88.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In addition, the SBCCI, after assessing the damage caused by Hurricane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Andrew, concluded that standards applicable to manufactured housing need to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reviewed to bring them up to the level of other construction types, unless  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> society is willing to consider manufactured homes to be expendable. The SBCCI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> said that even if manufactured homes are considered expendable, the issue of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the hazard they present to neighboring buildings and structures needs to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed. Accordingly, they further concluded that steps need to be taken to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> strengthen the structural frame, enforce tiedown provisions, and assure that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the installation of homes is done by those who are knowledgeable in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements of the code. Unless these issues are addressed, the SBCCI  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believes there will continue to be great costs associated with hurricane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Improved Anchoring and Foundation Systems  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Enforcement of anchoring and tie-down systems for manufactured housing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> construction has generally been considered a State or local government and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their building officials' responsibility. Section 3282.303 of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manufactured Home Procedural and Enforcement Regulations (24 CFR part 3282)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> urges, but does not require, State Administrative Agencies to monitor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation of manufactured homes. Thus, standards for foundations and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchorings and enforcement of those standards are not uniform among the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> States, and in some States are nonexistent. For example, the State of Florida  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has statewide laws related to installation, but enforcement of those laws is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> left to local building officials, while Louisiana is one of 23 States that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not regulate installation of manufactured homes at all.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

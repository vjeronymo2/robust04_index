			<p><P> January 24, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NORIEGA'S 'COCAINE' MAY BE JUST FLOUR  </P> <P> A white substance found wrapped in banana leaves in a house in Panama  frequented by Manuel A. Noriega was not cocaine as the Army believed, but a  material used in voodoo, the Pentagon said Tuesday.  </P> <P> "It's bonding material," said a Defense Department spokeswoman, Army Maj. Kathy  Wood.  </P> <P> "It's a substance they use in voodoo rituals."  </P> <P> However, the Army's Criminal Investigation Division -- which conducted tests on  the material -- would not immediately identify the substance other than to  describe it as "bonding material." There was speculation that it was flour or  cornmeal used in making tamales.  </P> <P> On Dec. 22, Army Col. Mike Snell, the commander of a U.S. infantry task force,  told reporters that his troops had found 50 pounds of cocaine in a house  frequented by Noriega at Ft. Amador, a military base used jointly by U.S. and  Panamanian forces before the Dec. 20 U.S. invasion.  </P> <P> The two-story building was inhabited by a Brazilian woman believed to be  Noriega's "sorceress."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Durban April 13 SAPA -- Seven people were massacred  in battle-scarred Ndwedwe township north of Durban on Tuesday  [13 April], the Natal security committee said. About 11 people  were travelling in a minibus and distributing pamphlets in the  area, when they were stopped by a crowd of people.    Two men escaped and alerted the authorities. A subsequent  police search found seven hacked and burned bodies in the  Thafamazi area of Ndwedwe. Their vehicle was also set ablaze.    By late Tuesday, however, police detained six people under  emergency regulations. Ndwedwe has been dogged by intense  political fighting over the past ten years.    [Johannesburg SABC TV 1 Network in English at 0500 GMT on 13  April say the seven people were killed "while handing out  pamphlets of the Transitional Executive Council in Ndwedwe north  of Durban." "According to eyewitnesses, the seven who were  killed were kidnapped by a group of men at a school yesterday.  They were interrogated by their kidnappers and dragged into a  bush where they were shot and hacked to death. The police said  the attackers had perhaps mistakenly connected the group to a  political party. Four arrests have been made."]</p>

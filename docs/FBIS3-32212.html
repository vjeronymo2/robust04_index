This  will be one more effort by the two countries to intensify  bilateral trade relations.    Last year Brazilian imports from Qatar totalled $112  million,  basically in oil, while exports to that country amounted to only  $29 million in chicken and iron ore.    The decision was made during the visit to Brazil by Qatar's  Foreign Affairs Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim Bin-Jabbur Al  Thani.</p>

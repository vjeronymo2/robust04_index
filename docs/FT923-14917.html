			<p>920704 FT  04 JUL 92 / Arts: The forgotten Impressionist - The RA is holding the first major retrospective of Sisley's work THE IMPRESSIONISTS have basked in popularity in recent years. The record-breaking attendance of the Royal Academy's Monet in the 90s exhibition, for instance, saw well over half a million visitors shuffle through the galleries in the autumn of 1990. Yet Alfred Sisley has been bypassed. With Monet, Renoir and Pissarro, he founded the Impressionist movement, and of them all he clung most unwaveringly to its original principles in his landscapes, but has been overshadowed by the others. This month the Royal Academy is mounting the first major retrospective of his work since his death in 1899, and two books on the artist have been published to coincide with it. But why has Sisley been relatively overlooked for so long? Vivienne Couldrey, in her book Alfred Sisley: the English Impressionist, offers the provocative suggestion that his dual nationality worked against him. He was born in France and spent his life there, yet his parents were English; maybe he was looked upon as an English landscapist by the French, but never became a familiar name in England during his lifetime because he was so rarely there. Well, maybe. Although Sisley was described as 'essentially French in his manners, tastes and ideas' by his contemporary, the art critic Theodore Duret, overtones of the English landscape tradition - particularly that of Constable - percolate through his work. Like Constable, Sisley was interested in exploring and mapping out a location through his paintings, producing whole series of local views in his search to capture the spirit of a place. But no direct reference to Constable has been found, and the curtator of the exhibition Mary Anne Stevens stresses that 'we have to be tentative in drawing such inferences.' Delacroix, Millet, Rousseau, Courbet, and - in Couldrey's view most importantly - Jean-Baptiste Corot were the influences Sisley himself cited at the end of his life. However, his relative obscurity probably hinged more on other, less oblique factors than a crisis of nationality. The whole group suffered years of implacable hostility from the Paris art establishment; but Monet and Renoir had come into their own by the 1890s, vigorously cultivating a network of dealers prepared to show their work. By then, though, Sisley was not there on the frontline. He became increasingly reclusive through the 1880s and 1890s, settling away from Paris in Moret-sur-Loing and apparently resigning himself, in Pissarro's sad words of his own similar prospects, to 'remain at the end of the Impressionist line.' But it was not simply a case of not being in the right place at the right time. Unlike the others, he did not stray from the path of pure Impressionism which they had all trodden together in the 1870s. Sisley, though, did not deviate. Until the end of his life he continued to produce landscapes, working directly and almost exclusively from the motif (unlike Monet, for example, whose paintings show evidence of much subsequent tinkering in the studio). His finest paintings are sensitive, tranquil, understated records of local landscape, in which figures take a back seat to the elements of nature he loved to paint - skies, water, snow scenes. Attractive, easy on the eye, without doubt; but in Stevens' words, 'not as aggressive, tough, or visually irresistible' as the work of the other Impressionists. And Sisley's character, like his art, was not that of a trail-blazer. 'Sisley's gift was gentleness . . . he was a delightful human being,' reported Renoir. But his modest and charming nature in itself probably worked against the recognition he sought, especially as he grew older and more withdrawn in the face of continued lack of response to his work. Self-promotion did not come naturally. Indeed, perhaps the principle reason for Sisley's low profile to date has been the lack of information on his career or personal life. He left only a paltry collection of uninformative notes, most being requests for money to the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who supported him financially for much of his impoverished existence. He did not keep a diary; nor are there many illuminating eyewitness accounts of his public life. He always seemed rather a grey figure in comparison with the others of his time,' says Mary Anne Stevens, 'so putting the exhibition together has been a revelationary learning process', involving a great deal of original research. The exhibition may well catch the imagination of the public If so, it should go some way towards putting right the injustice that Monet recognised in his old age after many years of public and establishment scorn: 'Three of us - Degas, Renoir and I, have had our revenge. We can say we have had a happy life. The others died too young. Sisley (was) misunderstood.' The Royal Academy's exhibition, which will be reviewed by William Packer on Tuesday, runs July 3-October 16; the accompanying catalogue, published by Yale University Press, costs Pounds 35 (hardback) or Pounds 18.95 (paper). Vivienne Couldrey, Alfred Sisley, The English Impressionist, is published by David &amp; Charles at Pounds 40.</p>

			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / International Company News: Citic Pacific trading halted SHARES in Citic Pacific, the large trading and investment company controlled by China, were suspended in Hong Kong yesterday amid speculation that it would make a large capital issue to fund acquisitions. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange said that the company had requested suspension pending an announcement. Analysts expect Citic to announce the acquisition from its parent, Citic Hong Kong, of about 10 per cent of Hongkong Telecom, the colony's telecommunications monopoly. Citic Hong Kong, a wholly-owned subsidiary of China International Trust and Investment Corporation of Beijing, owns 20 per cent of Hongkong Telecom. Analysts said that Citic Pacific may also acquire an interest in one of Citic Hong Kong's power stations in China. As with past transactions of this type, Citic Pacific is expected to fund the two acquisitions through the issue of new shares, although this would require shareholder approval.</p>

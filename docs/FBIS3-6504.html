			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Ku Tu-hun from Yonggwang] </F>   [Text] About 300 people, including members of the farmers'  society of Yonggwang County, South Cholla Province, members of  the National Catholic Priests' Environment Protection Committee,  and members of Wonbul Buddhist Association, staged a  demonstration for about 30 minutes on 15 March in front of  Yonggwang Atomic Power Station in Kyemari, Hungnong-up,  Yonggwang County. They opposed the loading of nuclear fuel in  and operation of the No. 3 atomic power reactor in Yonggwang.    In the demonstration staged under the leadership of the  Council for Expulsion of the Yonggwang Nuclear Power Station  (Chairman: Father Pak Chae-wan), they held that "there are  safety problems in the operation of the No. 3 reactor--a  Korean-type model without any operational experience"--and  demanded the suspension of "the operation of the No. 3 reactor,  which places the lives of Yonggwang County residents under  liability." They also demanded that details of the accident  that occurred at the nuclear power station and truth of injuries  of workers on the spot be disclosed.    Prior to this, on the afternoon of 14 March, they held an  antinuclear seminar in the Wonbul Buddhist temple in Yongsan,  Paeksu-up, Yonggwang County, and resolved to rise in a  pan-national antinuclear movement. At about 1030 [0100 GMT]  that morning, they held an event to "declare a pan-national  antinuclear movement to check the loading of nuclear fuel at the  No.3 reactor of the atomic power station" at the Wonbul Buddhist  temple in Yonggwang. Following the event, they staged a street  demonstration.  <H5>  No. 3 Yonggwang Reactor </H5>   The No. 3 reactor at the Yonggwang nuclear power station is  the first in domestic production, responsible for 95 percent of  the domestic manufacturing rate. Construction of this reactor,  which has 1 million kilowatt power generation capacity, began in  July 1989, and it is now undergoing a trial operation with the  goal of beginning operation in March 1995. Unlike other  reactors, the No. 3 Yonggwang reactor is being built by domestic  enterprises. The main design was by Korea Electric  Technological Corporation; manufacturing was by Korea Heavy  Industry Complex; engineering by Hyundai Construction Company,  and the reactor type was designed by the Korea Atomic Energy  Research Institute. CE Company [as published] of the United  States and other firms are participating as subcontractors.    Ordinary-temperature water-pressure tests for the No. 3  Yonggwang reactor were completed in December last year, and a  high-temperature function test is to be conducted soon. After  completing this test, nuclear fuel will actually be loaded in  this reactor in August, and a final test will be conducted after  this.    Although the No. 3 Yonggwang reactor is called a domestic  product, the regulations of the International Atomic Energy  Agency [IAEA], and provisions applied to other atomic power  stations at home have been applied to this reactor, and a safety  evaluation work has also been carried out by a team of IAEA  experts.</p>

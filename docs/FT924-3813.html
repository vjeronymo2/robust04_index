			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / November new car sales up 6.3% on year UK NEW car sales rose 6.3 per cent to 106,902 in November compared with the same month a year ago, while new commercial vehicle sales increased 15.3 per cent to 15,920. Registrations of new cars and commercial vehicles have been higher than a year ago in three of the past four months. Although stronger demand for new cars comes mainly from the fleet sector, where sales in November were 8.6 per cent higher, retail demand also rose 4.3 per cent. Sir Hal Miller, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: 'These figures reflect a continuing modest but welcome increase in UK sales, with the full benefit of the abolition of special car tax still to work through.' Special car tax was abolished three weeks ago, cutting car prices by about 4 per cent. Several carmakers have, however, been forced to raise prices because of the devaluation of the pound. Sir Hal said there was an 'encouraging increase' in sales of light commercial vehicles, with a 'modest upswing' in registrations of trucks and buses. 'It is clear . . . that the green shoots of domestic growth are beginning to show through.' New car sales in the first 11 months of the year, at 1,513,698, were still 1.3 per cent lower than a year ago, while new commercial vehicle sales in the first 11 months fell by 4.4 per cent to 189,031. Car sales have dropped by nearly a third from the peak of 2.3m in 1989, while commercial vehicle sales have almost halved during the recession. Ford, the leader of the UK new car market, suffered a 19.2 per cent drop in its sales volume in November in spite of the 6.3 per cent increase in the overall market. Its market share in November tumbled to 19 per cent from 24.9 per cent in the same month a year ago, while its share in the first 11 months of the year fell to 22.5 per cent from 24.2 per cent. Weakening sales and excess stock levels in the UK and in continental European markets have forced Ford to cut output severely at its Eu-ropean assembly plants. Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, increased its sales volume by 16.4 per cent in November, mainly because of heavy sales to large fleet operators. Rover accounted for 24.5 per cent of the fleet car market in November, compared with an average share for the first 11 months of 17 per cent. In spite of higher sales in November, Rover's registrations for the first 11 months fell by 10.2 per cent, depressing its market share to 12.9 per cent from 14.2 per cent a year earlier. Meanwhile, Japanese carmakers were capturing a growing share of UK new car sales. They were led by Nissan, which more than doubled its sales in November from the same month a year before. Jaguar and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the luxury carmakers among those worst affected by the recession, also increased sales year-on-year.</p>

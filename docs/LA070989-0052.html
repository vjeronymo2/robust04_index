			<p><P> July 9, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CULTURE SHOCK  </P> <P> Concerning your article about the tumultuous shareholder meeting in Tokyo  involving T. Boone Pickens Jr. and the Koito Manufacturing board ("Pickens,  Rejected by Koito Directors, Blasts 'Japan Inc.'," June 30):  </P> <P> It appears that Pickens has failed to do his homework about Japanese business  practices. In his efforts to gain a seat on Koito's board, Pickens should have  known that boards of directors in Japan are employees of the company who have  come up through the ranks due to their ability, seniority and age. In Japan,  directors' seats are not "bought" from outside entities as they often are here.  Also, Pickens' high profile and demanding demeanor destroyed the harmony that  must prevail in any Japanese relationship.  </P> <P> His remarks of not being able to become a director because he "was not  Japanese" and his speech full of "political overtones" is reminiscent of Archie  Bunker. Further, Pickens' comment about the Koito shareholders meeting being  "the most unusual shareholder meeting I have ever attended in my life" again  shows his lack of understanding of Japanese business practices. He has only to  look out the windows of his hotel to see those American firms that have taken  the time to learn the Japanese way of doing business and have been successful.  </P> <P> It appears Pickens has received incorrect information from his advisers. He is  also acting like a spoiled child who didn't get his own way. If Pickens doesn't  learn soon how to do business in Japan, his opportunities there may soon be  known as "Slim Pickins."  </P> <P> GREGORY MARSHALL  </P> <P> Moreno Valley  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Pustogarov, </F> leading scientific associate of the Russian Academy of Sciences  Institute of State and Law, carried under the "Authority of the  Regions" rubric: "Without Guidelines: No One Regulates the  Components of the Federation's International Ties"]    [Text] The republics, krays, and oblasts of the Russian  Federation are exhibiting ever-increasing autonomy today.  Yaroslavl Oblast, for example, has concluded treaties (mainly  economic in nature) with Belarus, Kazakhstan, Moldova,  Uzbekistan, Ukraine, individual regions of Turkey and Germany,  and certain other foreign partners. Yaroslavl Oblast has signed  a total of more than 20 such treaties.    Tatarstan and Bashkiria have equally extensive international  ties. Yakutia's trade and economic agreement with Ukraine,  signed at the end of 1993, extends over five years and embraces  a broad range of items. Yakutia reportedly plans to conclude an  agreement with Japan and open a trade mission there.    What is the significance of such large-scale treaty activity  on the part of Federation members? Primarily it meets the needs  of regions "neglected" by the federal authorities in their  relations with other states.    Some rules have gradually been elaborated governing the  international activity of Federation components. For all their  disparateness, they have quite a lot in common. First and  foremost, Federation components should be guided by the  principles and standards of international law and the  international commitments of the Federation, they should operate  within their constitutional authority and in agreement with  federal executive authority, and they should refrain from  encroaching on the sphere of diplomatic and consular rights.    For us, however, international ties are a new venture both  for republics and oblasts -- indeed for all 89 components of the  Russian Federation. We are only just beginning to get familiar  with this new kind of activity. The Russian Federation's  components still have to learn the rules accepted throughout the  world and make them tally with their own interests. The task is  clearly no easy one: The overwhelming majority of components  have neither the experience nor the trained cadres. Moreover,  they do not have the legal guidelines to follow when embarking  on a largely unknown path.    But the problem is that the Russian Federation's components  are unable to rely sufficiently on the existing Constitution  when structuring their foreign activity, as the Constitution  fails to mention the components' actual right to pursue  international ties. This right is obliquely referred to in  Article 72, where "the coordination of the international and  foreign economic ties of Russian Federation components " falls  within areas of joint jurisdiction. If we are talking about  coordinating international ties, then the right to establish and  develop them also exists. However, this sole provision cannot,  naturally, regulate the entire large and complex system of  international ties involving Russia's components.    Consulting the Federation Treaty is of little avail in this  regard either. The only additional information to be gleaned  from it is that the components of the Russian Fedeartion are  "autonomous parties in international and foreign economic ties."    "Autonomous party in international ties".... The wording  looks very impressive, but on closer scrutiny its content is  completely unclear. What specifically can a Federation  component to develop its international ties? How does its  autonomy square with the extensive powers enjoyed by the  Federation in the sphere of international relations? Are these  powers retained by Federation components?    Since all this is vaguely worded, it is not at all easy to  identify the specific areas where Russian Federation components  can operate as "autonomous participants in international ties."  It is, of course, possible to cite the existing practice of  certain republics and oblasts, but the question is whether this  practice is congruous with the Constitution and existing  legislation.    In other words, there is a large legal vacuum today which  offers scope for the most arbitrary interpretations and thereby  generates conflicts, as it were, both inside and outside the  Federation. The fact that the development of Russian Federation  components' international ties seems to be allowed to go its own  sweet way could have the most adverse consequences for both the  durability of the Federation and the integrity of its external  relations.</p>

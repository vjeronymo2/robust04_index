			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Russian pilots warn of chaos in aviation industry A Russian-leased Airbus crashed last month because the pilot handed the controls over to his teenage son, the head of the Russian pilots' union has confirmed. Mr Alfred Malinovski, the union chief, said the A310 crash, in which all 75 people on board were killed, was not only a 'crime' but the tragic result of the chaos in civil aviation in the country since the state airline Aeroflot was broken up into 160 carriers. Mr Malinovski said the youth appeared to have inadvertently switched off the autopilot. The mistake was not rectified quickly because the co-pilot was away from his seat. He added: 'The general reason (for the crash) is the system's loss of manageability. Civil aviation cannot be run like a kebab-shop.' Russian International Airlines operates most international traffic with the west. Based at Russia's main Sheremetievo-2 international airport, it had leased five Airbuses and was thinking of leasing five more to make up for a shortage of Russian-produced aircraft to renew its fleet. Its airliner crashed en route from Moscow to Hong Kong. Mr Malinovski said that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the once monolithic Aeroflot had been deregulated without any rules, and the civil aviation authorities' lack of staff and finance meant officials could no longer ensure proper maintenance and supervision of the airline industry. He said the information obtained from the flight recorder would be published when the Russian authorities completed their investigation. Mr Malinovski revealed that human error and poor maintenance caused the death of 120 people on a flight to Moscow from the Siberian city of Irkutsk in January. The aircraft had been operated by Baikal Air, one of the Aeroflot offshoots. He said the Tupolev-154 burst into flames after a pilot ignored a warning light which came on when he switched on the engines. Poor maintenance meant such lamps often came on when they were not supposed to. Mr Malinovski said the investigation - the results of which have not yet been published - had shown that a scrap of metal had come loose in the engine and twisted up the turbines, causing engine failure and an explosion shortly after takeoff. He said the latest disaster would force the authorities to look for ways of reimposing more effective controls over the industry. Surge in investment boosts industrial shake-up, Page 16</p>

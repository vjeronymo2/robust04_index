			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by reporter Cheng Weimin (4453 3634 3046): "Check </F> the Actual Situation, Promote Leadership, Improve Understanding,  and Pass on Experiences"]    [Text] Yesterday, the Zhejiang Provincial People's  Government convened a meeting of responsible persons from  relevant provincial departments in our newspaper office  specially to hear reports from a team on a news assignment  entitled "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting." It also reviewed  and made plans for the next phase of agricultural production and  reform. Wan Xueyuan, deputy secretary of the provincial party  committee and governor, and Liu Xirong, standing committee  member of the provincial party committee and vice governor,  addressed the meeting.    The first phase of the news-gathering activities, which were  launched upon the suggestion of provincial government leaders,  lasted from 5 to 15 May. Reporters interviewed over 100  peasants from more than 10 counties, cities, and districts and  scores of villages around the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou areas, and  published 65 manuscripts.    Wan Xueyuan thanked reporters who participated in the  news-related activities on behalf of the provincial party  committee and the provincial government. He said: The  activities serve to "check the actual situation, promote  leadership, improve understanding, and pass on experiences."  Through the activities, reporters gained an in-depth  understanding of the progress in implementing measures adopted  by the central authorities, the provincial party committee, and  the provincial government to support agriculture, and of the  progress in tilling the acreage planned for early season rice.  The reporters described fresh experiences gained by some  localities and drew our attention to some issues concerning our  work. They also reported on experiences gained by localities  which fared well in grain production, and encouraged local  leaders to make further improvements. The reporters'  on-the-spot learning experiences helped promote work and  leadership, and issues raised in relevant reports greatly  inspired comrades undertaking agricultural work. Such reports  further promoted ties between cities and rural areas and between  industrial and agricultural sectors, and helped the entire  society understand more about grain production. Governments at  all levels should seriously sum up, popularize, study, and  examine fresh experiences -- disclosed through news-related  activities -- which could help strengthen and improve leadership  over agricultural production, and the numerous suggestions made  by grass-roots cadres and peasants.    Wan Xueyuan said: The news-related activities enabled us to  hear the peasants' true wishes. All trades and professions  should earnestly acquire the thought of serving the peasants  wholeheartedly, and do solid work to really solve the peasants'  worries and difficulties by bearing in mind what the peasants  want. Grain departments should earnestly improve and step up  their services by taking grain procurement from major  grain-producing households as their focal point. The method  used to grant agricultural credits should be improved, and major  grain-producing households should be accorded preferential  treatment. Enterprises producing farm machinery should satisfy  the peasants' needs by developing and producing top-quality farm  machinery in line with the realities of our province.    Wan Xueyuan said emphatically: Operations conducted on a  moderate scale would help promote the province's agricultural  production and development, particularly grain production and  development. Work to promote such operations should be regarded  as an important element in our province's rural reform. We  should study and popularize such operations rapidly and more  vigorously. We should respect the masses' creative initiative,  and continuously sum up, improve, and popularize things in  practice.    Wan Xueyuan said: The activities further expanded the scope  of news-related work and brought such work closer to the central  task of the party and government. They also provided very good  training for young reporters. He said: All news units and  relevant departments should help augment the team to be assigned  to the second phase of the "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting,"  which will begin soon. This team should file more in-depth  reports which will provide tighter supervision over public  opinion and more intense policy-oriented propaganda.    Liu Xirong said: Through the hard work of leaders at all  levels in our province and the vast numbers of peasants, the big  decreases in grain production have now been reversed. However,  we should know better than to be optimistic about the situation  concerning agricultural and grain production. We should further  increase propaganda conducted through the media by carrying out  the "1,000-Li March on Grain Planting" activities, so that we  could urge all localities to implement party and government  policies which focus on agriculture. We should use propaganda  to accelerate reform and opening up. The aim of the reform of  grain and other agricultural production is to rationalize prices  of agricultural products and to enable peasants to do their  farming according to the laws of market. We should promote  fairly large-scale operations as they provide the best way for  improving the low efficiency of agricultural production.  However, help from relevant departments is required to solve  many practical difficulties facing major grain-producing  households. We should decontrol land management rights in line  with the principle of "voluntarism, compensation, and accordance  with the law," while making sure that the system of household  contract responsibility with remuneration linked to output  remains unchanged. We should expand scientific farming, and  scientific agricultural research units should actively exploit  quality rice strains. All trades and professions should lend  stronger support to the agricultural sector, and party and  government leaders at all levels should also do solid work for  that sector.    At the meeting, Wan Xueyuan and Liu Xirong warmly  congratulated ZHEJIANG RIBAO on its 45th founding anniversary.  After the meeting, they inspected the construction site of the  ZHEJIANG RIBAO news building, and encouraged units in charge of  construction and constructors to provide quality work and  complete the key spiritual civilization construction project on  time.</p>

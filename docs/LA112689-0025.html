			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BLACKLIST  </P> <P> I'm not saying the blacklist didn't have an emotional effect on us; it did.  Hugo was a fine writer and a devoted craftsman, and struggling to survive as a  writer in a country where the language was not his own -- at a time in history  when he couldn't even write under his own name -- added a terrible frustration  to the problems of supporting six children. And yes, he was a pretty awesome  paterfamilias; after all, he worked largely at home, and our house in Mexico  was small. But he was also a wonderful paterfamilias: He instituted weekly  baseball games, and picnics, and trips to Acapulco, and stories at bedtime  every Saturday night, and a hundred other kinds of adventures. So it seems  unfair to paint the family portrait in such heavy colors, when we had glorious  times, too.  </P> <P> The tragedy was that he died young -- at 53 -- and before that had undergone a  serious personality change (from a then-undiagnosed arteriosclerotic brain  disease), so the older children never got a chance to know him as adults and  equals, and the memories of the younger ones are affected by his last illness.  </P> <P> Flawed? Of course. We all are. But he gave us a fascinating life in Mexico and  still managed, against terrible odds, to do some of his best writing there. And  after all the injustices he suffered because of his politics, I don't want the  only written record of him as a human being to be such a negative one. He  deserved better.  </P> <P> JEAN ROUVEROL BUTLER  </P> <P> (Mrs. Hugo Butler)  </P> <P> Santa Monica  </P></p>

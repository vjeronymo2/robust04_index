			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission further notes that the Exchange has represented that from January 1, 1993 until present, AUTOM has not suffered any operational failures and the Phlx has not received any formal complaints with respect to the system's operation. <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Finally, since the pilot program is being extended without expansion of the scope of the pilot, the Commission does not believe that the capacity of the Exchange's automated systems will be adversely effected by this extension. <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See letter dated December 17, 1993, supra note 3.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission recognizes that additional options classes added onto the system can have an effect on the systems operations. In this context, the Commission expects that the Phlx will notify the Commission if the expansion of options multiple trading, pursuant to Rule 19c&hyph;5 under the Act, has any material effect on the capacity of the Phlx's automated systems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change, including Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change, prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  in order to permit the Phlx to continue the AUTOM pilot program on an uninterrupted basis. Specifically, the Commission believes that the Phlx's proposal to extend the AUTOM pilot program does not raise any new issues since it merely extends the pilot program as it is currently operating. Further, the Commission believes that the pilot is beneficial in maintaining the quality and efficiency of the Phlx's market.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission also notes that there have been no adverse comments concerning the pilot program since its implementation. Accordingly, the Commission believes that granting accelerated approval of the proposed rule change is appropriate and consistent with Sections 6 and 11A of the Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

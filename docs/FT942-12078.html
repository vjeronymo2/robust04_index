			<p>940503 FT  03 MAY 94 / South African Elections: Mixed-race voters ensure Nats triumph in the Cape South Africa's mixed-race (coloured) citizens, who straddled the apartheid divide for almost 45 years, have voted to retain white domination at the Cape, where their black and white ancestors met in 1652, writes Brendan Boyle of Reuter in Cape Town. Early results in South Africa's first all-race elections gave President FW de Klerk's white-led National party a commanding 30 per cent lead over Mr Nelson Mandela's largely black African National Congress in the Western Cape region. Political analysts said the lead was due to support from coloureds, who fared better under apartheid than blacks but not as well as whites. Mr Hernus Kriel, the white law and order minister, told reporters he expected an outright win in the race for premier of the region, which has Cape Town as its capital. Mr Allan Boesak, coloured ANC premiership candidate, conceded that defeat was imminent: 'The ANC will accept the outcome of the democratic process. As a people and as an ANC organisation in the Western Cape, we are ready to do whatever the situation demands of us.' Earlier, radical ANC activist Tony Yengeni, a member of the party's regional executive, broke ranks to talk of his sense of betrayal at the apparent NP lead. 'Already the man in the street in the (black) township is feeling betrayed,' he said. 'We have been tortured and oppressed by the white man in this country for so long. . . and now a section of the population votes for the party that oppressed us to return to power.' The region's coloured community descends from early unions the Dutch settlers and the later British arrivals had with the indigenous black population they found at the Cape. Mr Yengeni said ANC leaders would have to act decisively to prevent a black backlash against the mainly Afrikaans-speaking coloureds, who comprise almost 60 per cent of the 2.3m Western Cape electorate. Emotional ANC and NP supporters gathered and traded insults late on Sunday on Cape Town's Grand Parade, where Mr Mandela made his first public appearance after his release from 27 years in jail in February 1990. Ms Miriam Ebrahim wept as she watched NP members celebrating their likely victory with shouts of 'Viva FW de Klerk.' She said: 'It was our own people that stabbed us in the back.' But Mr Andre Hofmeister, a coloured whose name underlines his half-European ancestry, pointed to a crowd of ANC supporters dancing with posters of Mandela and said: 'These people are too stupid to realise that, if a black man rules this country, it will be run into the ground.' In a squalid shantytown there was no echo of the animosity evident on the Grand Parade. Standing next to a wooden fruit and vegetable stand, an ANC supporter, Mr Emanuel Makunga, said that most blacks would accept the results peacefully as part of the democratic process. 'This was a liberation election,' he said. 'People are more happy that they could vote for the first time than they will be upset that the ANC didn't win here. People respect the election process. But they won't be happy to be ruled by the same NP again.'</p>

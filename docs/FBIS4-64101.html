			<p>BFN     [Text] Stepanakert ("AZG", "YERKIR" dailies), 05/26/94 --  The situation at the Karabakh fronts aggravated again after a  few days of relative calmness.    According to the RMK [Republic of Mountainous Karabakh]  defense army headquarters, two Azeri infantry units with about  250 soldiers supported by an armored personnel carrier,  commenced an offensive from the Beylagan district in the  direction of the Karabakh defense positions at the village of  Karakhanbeyli in the Fizulinskiy district at 3 a.m. in the night  of May 25. The attack was accompanied by fierce artillery  shelling of the Armenian positions.    As a result of fierce battles, the Karabakh forces stopped  the offensive, causing significant manpower losses to the enemy.  13 Azeri soldiers have been killed during the battle, which  lasted two hours. The Armenian side suffered no casualties.    The enemy shelled the Karabakh positions at the other  sections of the front but refrained from active military  operations. Particularly, the Azeris shelled the Armenian  positions at the villages of Gyullija and Shourabad in the  Agdamskiy district, Seisulan, Gasangaya and Talysh in the  Mardakertskiy district. No casualties are reported.    According to a representative of the RMK defense army Serzh  Arushanyan, this actions of the enemy proved once again that  Azerbaijan is using short cease-fires for completing its army  and preparing new offensives.    According to the RMK military reconnaissance, some 400 new  recruits have been recently delivered to the Agdamskiy district  from Baku. Arushanyan said, Azerbaijan faces difficulties in  completing its army, as 80 percent of the new recruits are 17-18  year old youngsters.</p>

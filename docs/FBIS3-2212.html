He believes  that the central authorities will accept this proposal.    Yesterday, when interviewed by this reporter by  long-distance  telephone call, Yuan Zheng said that the Guangdong Provincial  Land Administration recently submitted a proposal to the State  Council, asking that when the central departments concerned  formulate concrete rules for the imposition of value-added land  taxes, consideration should be given to the following five  factors: First, interest rates of credit funds, including those  for investment, will continue to change; second, inflation will  increase construction costs; third, there should be compensation  for the risks that exist in long-term real estate investment;  fourth, the state should encourage and support real estate  development projects in some localities; and fifth, the recovery  of taxes. Therefore, Guangdong is firmly opposed to the  imposition of value-added land taxes on contracts being signed  before 1 January 1994 if developments and investments specified  by such contracts have not been started yet. Guangdong also  hoped that taxes imposed on real estate contracts signed before  the enforcement of the tax would be levied according to the  provisions specified in the contracts.    He added: The imposition of value-added land taxes is aimed  at restraining real estate speculation rather than harming the  interests of real property developers. However, after the  central authorities announced the imposition of value-added land  taxes on 1 January, some overseas investors who had planned to  start real estate investment projects in Guangdong gave up their  investment plans. In order to protect the interests of the real  developers, the relevant departments in Guangdong proposed to  the central authorities that first-time development projects  should be exempt from value-added land tax and that it should  only be imposed on second-hand transactions. At present,  Shenzhen City exempts first-time development projects from  value-added taxes; on the other hand, it imposes a 40 to 100  percent tax on profits earned on real estate transactions.  Although Shenzhen's tax rates may be a bit too high, the  practice is close to the taxation arrangements made by the  central authorities.    Yuan Zheng said: At present, land administrative departments  in many provinces are submitting proposals on the imposition of  value-added land taxes to the State Council, and the contents of  the proposals are basically similar to Guangdong's. The  relevant department of the State Council is now studying various  proposals from the provinces and foreign investors. It is  believed that the central authorities will accept these  proposals and will soon promulgate concrete rules on the  implementation of the new tax regulations, because the  imposition of value-added land taxes is not aimed at checking  normal real estate development. However, Guangdong still hopes  that greater decision-making powers will be given to the local  government.    When talking about Guangdong's land development measures  this  year, Yuan Zheng said: This year, Guangdong Province will  control the gross quantity of land development. The area of  land approved for development will be reduced by 10 percent from  last year's level, because too many development projects were  approved in the last few years and it will take time for the  market to digest the supply. In addition, the province will  successively launch a lot of large-scale construction projects,  which will need large areas of land in the future. Therefore,  all cities in Guangdong will reduce the quantity of land  approved for development this year.    This year, Guangdong will also exercise taxation management  over real estate transactions and conduct property rights  registration more effectively. The province is now revising its  regulations on land transfers. At the same time, collective  land management in rural areas will also be strengthened.  Relevant measures in this regard are also being drafted, and  the contents include the scope of management and compensation  standards for land requisitions. It is expected that the  regulations will be submitted to this year's provincial people's  congress session for deliberation and adoption.    In addition, this year, Guangdong Province will also further  strengthen land management in all localities. The provincial  land administration will announce the invalidity of some  land-use approvals made by local governments without  authorization or in violation of established rules and will  investigate and affix responsibility for such events. If it is  found that any local government approved too much development of  too much land, the provincial land administration will deduct  their land-use quotas next year.    Yuan Zheng said that in the aspect of land development,  Guangdong will stress the development of Zhuhai's western  district, Yangjiang's Hailin Island, Huizhou's Daya Bay, and  other new cities. In order to encourage foreign companies to  invest, Guangdong will continue to provide favorable taxation  terms and will not impose restrictions on property sales outside  the mainland.</p>

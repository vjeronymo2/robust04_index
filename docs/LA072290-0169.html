			<p><P> July 22, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL OFFICIAL'S STATEMENTS OFFENDED  </P> <P> As a teacher, I was offended by the statements made by Norman Guith, the new  superintendent of the Orange Unified School District ("Orange Schools Chief  Hopes to Heal District's Ills," July 15). I wish my colleagues in Orange  success, but I don't hold out a lot of hope for wonderful changes from an  administrator who obviously considers teachers a minor part of the educational  process.  </P> <P> Quoting Mr. Guith, "We didn't build these schools to give teachers a place to  have a job in, we built them for children to learn in." (I hope the teachers in  "these" classrooms know how to avoid ending a sentence with a preposition  whenever possible.)  </P> <P> Exactly what is Mr. Guith suggesting? Is he suggesting that if we placed  children in "these" classrooms without teachers they would learn what Orange  Unified has adopted as prescribed curriculum?  </P> <P> The Riverside County superintendent stated that Mr. Guith is not afraid of  surrounding himself with excellent administrators. Is he equally as willing to  surround himself with excellent teachers?  </P> <P> "This district has entered into a contract with its retirees, and we have to  honor that contract -- it's the honorable thing to do; it's the gentlemanly  thing to do." I believe, Mr. Guith, it's also the legal thing to do.  </P> <P> "I didn't come into this district to let it go bankrupt." That's very  interesting, Mr. Guith. As a veteran teacher of 33 years, your salary is 2.61  times mine. Explained another way, my wife and I have a total of 60 years of  teaching between us, and your salary package is about $27,000 more than our  combined salary. If Orange Unified does go bankrupt, the blame, I'm sure, can  be shared by all employees. Unlike in a big corporation, Mr. Guith is not  working to increase profits at Orange Unified; his source comes from the same  public funds as the salary of my wife and me.  </P> <P> BEN BOELMAN  </P> <P> Placentia  </P></p>

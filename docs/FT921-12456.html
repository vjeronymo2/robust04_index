			<p>920127 FT  27 JAN 92 / Arts: St Matthew Passion - Royal Festival Hall The programme-book for the London Philharmonic concert on Saturday had an informative interview with their conductor, young Franz Welser-Most, about his approach to Bach's St Matthew Passion. 'Basically the big pulse in the entire piece comes from the recitatives, and the other numbers just have to fit in,' he said, and that was exactly how it turned out. Yet one mightn't have foreseen just how swift that would be: the result was quite possibly the speediest performance of the Passion ever heard. Twenty minutes before the announced ending-time, it was over. The evangelist-narrator was the young tenor Kurt Azesberger, admirably clear and communicative, who allowed himself more dramatic involvement as the story proceeded. As promised, the work swept along without a pause or hesitation. In that sense at least, there was all the narrative urgency one could want. The pious gravity long favoured by British choral tradition went out of the window; the young Mozart Choir of Linz had been imported for the occasion, and (with choirboys from St Alban's Abbey) they sang lightly and trippingly. If there is pathos or tragedy in the work, it had to be deduced from the text. The voice of Jesus was Jeffrey Black's light, romantic bass. The soloists Welser-Most chose were a young quartet as distinguished as could be found today ' Lynne Dawson, Anne Sofie von Otter, John Mark Ainsley and Olaf Baer ' but they were kept on a very tight leash. The notion that the solo arias are the windows on to personal feeling got short shrift: in their first arias soprano, alto and baritone all sounded hustled, though they coped bravely. Even Miss von Otter's 'Erbarme dich', with a lovely obbligato by the leading violin, emerged as gracious and pretty, not grief-stricken. In the circumstances the more energetic arias made the strongest impressions, as well as the vivid duet for women with chorus, 'So ist mein Jesus nun gefangen'. The great final chorus became a charming pastoral. The double orchestra was rather fully manned by the London Philharmonic players on modern instruments, without pretending to a Baroque sound but carefully avoiding Romantic manners. The one period touch was a good viola da gamba, invaluable for Baer's 'Geduld'. As a whole reading, Welser-Most's treatment of the Passion was impeccably consistent ' and no doubt his tempi, or many of them, could claim greater authenticity than any grave Victorian trudge. Yet it seemed not merely light, but lightweight. Perhaps, after all, such tempi need period instruments to lend them enough expressive bite.</p>

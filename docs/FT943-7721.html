			<p>940822 FT  22 AUG 94 / Great reformer near to his meeting with Karl Marx: Tony Walker looks back over the 15 years since Deng Xiaoping's assumption of supreme power in China The Chinese capital, in the bleak winter of 1979, was one of the more forbidding places on earth. Icy winds from Siberia gusted down through the city and a brief 'Peking spring', in which faint dissenting voices were heard, had chilled with the arrest of the more adventurous spirits. Reporters would gather in the cold near a grimy bus station to observe progress of a flickering pro-democracy movement whose members pasted their dazibao or 'big character' posters on a wall facing the city's main boulevard. Those were uncertain times in China. Observers of the Chinese political scene might complain now about an opaque system that reveals little of its inner workings, but in the days when Mr Deng was re-asserting control, the picture was much murkier. Journalists were reduced to driving late at night around the Great Hall to check whether an important meeting was in progress. In those strange early days of the post-Mao era we would monitor, as best we could in a twilight political world, the fortunes of one man, Mr Deng Xiaoping, then a spritely 75-year-old, who was beginning his rise and rise; although no-one in that era could (or did) forecast just how far Mr Deng would ascend to claim the 'mandate of heaven'. Today, the frail and reclusive Mr Deng turns 90. He is hailed as the architect of China's remarkable transformation from a closed, inward-looking society traumatised by the mass political campaigns of the Mao-era to a country apparently on the way to becoming a powerful economic force. All this economic promise was hardly the subject of even the most fanciful speculation in China of the late 1970s as Mr Deng began to take control at the fateful third plenary session of the 11th Communist Party Congress in December, 1978. Then, the talk was about whether the reformists could break the shackles of Maoist dogma and dare even to begin dismantling the peasant communes and establish a system of free markets. It was not at all clear in those days whether Mr Deng and his reformist faction would triumph over the 'whateverists' (those who vouchsafed that 'whatever' Mao said and did was right). It is perhaps hard to believe now that we might have doubted Mr Deng would prevail, but in late 1979 and early 1980 a great deal of uncertainty permeated the political atmosphere. Indeed, it was one of those unheralded and un-reported occasions in early 1980 that Mr Deng signalled in a speech to several thousand cadres in the Great Hall that he had more or less wrested control from his opponents, among them die-hard Maoists, party conservatives, and those who were nervous about a new broom. It was in that speech that the redoubtable Mr Deng laid down what were described as the 'great tasks' for the 1980's and 1990's, including his call for a quadrupling of China's GNP by the year 2000. When the 'secret' speech was finally published several months later after being circulated and debated among the tens of millions of communist party members, his GNP target was ridiculed. At the time we wondered if Mr Deng may not have been dreaming. With debate in China consumed by the nitty gritty of economic reform, it is worth recalling that Mr Deng's early battles after he re-emerged in 1977 - he was purged twice during the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976 - had much less to do with economics than they did with laying to rest the ghosts of the past. Thus, he recognised that before China could get on with the business of joining the modern world, it was necessary to address the legacy of Mao Zedong. He supervised personally the 1981 Resolution on the Party History which concluded that while Mao had made mistakes, he had also made a great contribution to China. Ever the pragmatist, Mr Deng argued at the time 'that to build up Mao's errors too much would only damage the image of our party and our country, and harm the prestige of the party and socialist system'. Preservation of party control at almost any cost has been one of Mr Deng's cardinal principles. A fear of chaos, should that control unravel, has never been far from his concerns. These worries have fed an authoritarian streak consistent with his behaviour throughout a long career. Mr Deng may go down in history as one of the century's great reformers, but he has not tolerated dissent. On two occasions in the post-Mao era he suppressed ruthlessly political movements that did not square with his vision of an orderly society under party control. The first occasion was the arrest and detention for 15 years of Wei Jingsheng, the 'democracy wall' activist who had criticised Deng directly in his political testament, titled the 'Fifth Modernisation'. On the second, Mr Deng was ultimately responsible for the suppression of Tiananmen protests of 1989 with unnecessary loss of life. China's senior leader has evinced no remorse publicly for either of these actions, and nor is he likely to in these fading moments. Inevitably, accounts of Mr Deng's achievements on his 90th birthday have the ring of an obituary about them. The end for China's senior leader must be fairly near judging by his appearance when he was shown on television in Shanghai early this year, but it is also true that Mr Deng has shown an extraordinary tenacity throughout a turbulent life. He has said that he hopes to visit Hong Kong after it returns to China's rule in 1997, and while few would give him much chance of realising his dream, he has confounded the sceptics before and achieved other goals that seemed out of his reach. Not least of these achievements is surviving well beyond the date when Mr Deng, with his maudlin wit, had expected to keep his appointment with Karl Marx.</p>

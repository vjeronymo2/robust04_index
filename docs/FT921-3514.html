			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / Observer: Inside knowledge The home secretary's decision to make the prison service in England and Wales an executive agency creates a really exciting management opportunity. An open competition is to be held to find a chief executive to shake up the service which Sir Raymond Lygo, former chief executive of British Aerospace, described in a recent report as dogged by 'ineffective management'. Although Joe Pilling, the present director of the prison service, has only been in the driving seat since August, and will presumably be a strong candidate, a top businessmen with appropriate experience of detention at Her Majesty's pleasure might be a much better bet. Attracting a good candidate should be easier now that the home secretary has rejected one of Lygo's screwier recommendations. Ex-Admiral Lygo wanted the wearing of uniform to be extended throughout the prison service in the interests of discipline. But Kenneth Baker, despite being a former gunnery instructor to the Libyan army, has been reading Lord Justice Woolf's report on the 1990 prison disturbances and is keen to 'demilitarise' the service.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Foreign Minister Faris Buwayz returned from Cairo  this afternoon after taking part in the 101st session of the  Arab League Ministerial Council. At the airport, Minister  Buwayz made a statement in which he said:    [Begin recording] [Unidentified correspondent] You returned  from Cairo today, after taking part in the 101st session of the  Arab League Council. How do you assess the work of that  session, particularly in relation to Lebanon?    [Buwayz] This conference was certainly held amid critical  regional conditions. It involved sensitive topics, which we  noted before leaving Beirut, primarily lifting the boycott and  amending the League Charter. The most important thing during  that session was the postponement of these sensitive issues,  because we feel that conditions are not favorable for a change.  The causes that led to and justified them at a certain stage  still exist.    I believe that this session was very wise in overcoming some  challenges and certain differences in views. Hence, it studied  the agenda in depth and postponed discussion of a number of  points that the League thought it was premature to review.    [Correspondent] You certainly carried the problem of the  south with you to that conference. How was Arab solidarity  regarding the ongoing Israeli aggression against the south?    [Buwayz] I believe that Arab solidarity concerning the issue  of the south, Palestine, and all other Arab issues under  consideration is very serious. It is not the idea of solidarity  that counts; it is how we apply this solidarity that counts. I  can say that the Arab League's work mechanism had earlier been  submitted for discussion. I hope Arab accord will be further  enhanced to help the League express this solidarity and unity.    [Correspondent] You held a number of meetings on the  sidelines of the conference. Can you give us an idea about  their outcome?    [Buwayz] Just like any other conference, this meeting gave  the opportunity to hold side meetings. I held a number of  intensive meetings with Arab foreign ministers, including Their  Excellencies 'Amr Musa, Faruq al-Shar', the Qatari foreign  minister, and others. I also held several meetings with the Arab  League secretary general.    [Correspondent] Will the secretary general pay a visit to  Lebanon soon?    [Buwayz] I believe that his excellency the Arab League  secretary general will visit Lebanon in mid April to open the  Arab League's legal center, which has selected Lebanon as a  base.

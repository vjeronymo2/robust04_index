			<p>931011 FT  11 OCT 93 / Arts: Today's Television With the first story now complete and a three-parter about to begin, Cracker (ITV, 9.00) has turned out to be one of the brightest spots of the autumn. Fitz, the super-intuitive criminal psychologist (Robbie Coltrane) now has his mother, splendidly played by Beryl Reid, come to the assistance of his private life. Panorama; Pensioned Off (BBC1, 9.30) examines the fate of the universal state pension. The pension probably ought to be axed, but after a life of toil there are plenty of people who fail to see why they should not be entitled to use their pension for a golf club subscription. Prostitute (C4, 9.00), the grim French series, recounts a strangely old-fashioned story about Monique, mother of seven. To keep her lover solvent she worked as a prostitute and then turned Magdalene, swearing a vow of chastity and going to live with other pious souls in a Catholic community. Night-owl jazz fans each year read glowing reviews in the FT of the jazz festival at Brecon in Wales. This week on Midnight Jazz (BBC2, 12.05) five programmes feature the high spots of the summer.</p>

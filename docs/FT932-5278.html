			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / Stock exchange rules out US trading system: Cost cutting fends off Nasdaq bid to replace Seaq THE board of the London Stock Exchange yesterday endorsed plans for a new trading system to be developed by the exchange and Andersen Consulting after the proposed cost was cut to fend off a late bid by Nasdaq, the US over-the-counter stock exchange. Nasdaq had offered to build a replacement for London's ageing dealing system, known as Seaq, for Pounds 37m, undercutting the Andersen-stock exchange system by more than Pounds 20m. But the Andersen-exchange bid was cut to Pounds 40m, including the Pounds 15m already invested in the development of the system by the stock exchange, so that the net new investment required was Pounds 25m. Some members of the stock exchange board had forced a fresh hearing for the Nasdaq proposal, as confidence in the exchange's ability to manage in-house development projects sagged following the collapse of its Taurus paperless settlement system project. The failed project cost the exchange an estimated Pounds 75m. But dissent over the choice of a new trading system waned after the pricing differential was eroded. 'Andersen had a year's headstart, and once the price came down, there was not really a good enough reason to get rid of them,' said one stock exchange board member. An independent review by IBM Consulting Group also backed the Andersen-exchange proposal. Mr Giles Vardey, markets development director at the exchange, said the pitfalls of Taurus would be avoided. 'First, the exchange is not building the software this time. Second, one of the lessons of Taurus was the importance of getting the requirements right, agreeing with major users, freezing the specification and then going ahead and getting it built.' The project is expected to take 2 1/2 years, and will be implemented in four phases. A new markets committee, made up of senior market practitioners to be appointed by the board, will resolve remaining issues on the structure of the new market. The system will follow the quote-driven model of Seaq and Seaq International, which is widely backed by market practitioners. Plans to add a trade agreement function which had formed part of the original proposal, have been abandoned. The Seaq system was put into place after Big Bang in 1986 and was built up in a piecemeal manner, resulting in an expensive and outmoded system. 'We need to have systems that are robust and flexible, able to last beyond 2000,' said Mr Vardey. 'The existing system is expensive to operate, and though it has proved reliable there is a high risk over time as you try to make changes.'</p>

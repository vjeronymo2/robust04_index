			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / Mubarak reappoints premier EGYPT's President Hosni Mubarak began his third term of office yesterday by retaining Mr Atef Sidki, his 63-year-old prime minister, who in turn announced the first moves in a long-awaited cabinet reshuffle. Mr Mubarak promised during his inauguration speech on Tuesday that 'new blood' would follow his endorsement in last week's referendum for a further six years as Egypt's head of state. He has been hinting at cabinet changes since April and last month spoke of possible 'unlimited changes' in the government. However, his first move was to reappoint Mr Sidki, a man who embodies Mr Mubarak's preference for stability and cautious reform. Mr Sidki, who formally appoints Egypt's cabinet, then announced that Mr Mohammed Salheddin Hamid was to be replaced as governor of the central bank by Mr Ismail Hassan, chairman of the Bank of Alexandria.</p>

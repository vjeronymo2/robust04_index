However, all of a sudden, China's rulers found Liu  Gang, the 38-year-old former activist of the 1989 students'  protests, useful to a certain extent again. Relations between  Beijing and Washington are slightly strained because President  Clinton is taking aim at human rights violations in China. A  conciliatory gesture vis-a-vis the United States was needed.  Thus, Beijing's propaganda experts remembered Liu Gang.    On Thursday of last week [3 March], Beijing selected five  U.S. correspondents, picked them up from their homes in a  minibus, and put them on the train from Beijing to Lingyuan. On  Friday morning, they were allowed to visit the work camp  Lingyuan Number Two -- one of six retraining camps in the  godforsaken village 300 km northeast of Beijing.    "Through a tinted window on the second floor, we were  allowed  to see Liu Gang, who crossed the courtyard once with a guard,"  one of the reporters stated. "It is impossible to say anything  about the state of his health." In a letter smuggled out of the  camp about one year ago, Liu Gang mentioned torture and a  festering rash on his face.    When the U.S. journalists wanted to speak to Liu, his guard,  Xin Tingquan, stated: "We are not afraid of your seeing him.  Yet Liu Gang tells lies. For this reason, he is not allowed to  meet with anybody." Thus, it was only possible to see Liu from  a distance, like a panda in the zoo. The propaganda show  culminated in the presentation of a prisoner dance group that  hopped to Michael Jackson's pop song "Bad."    Liu Gang's presentation was the most tasteless example of  what the human rights organization Asiawatch describes as  China's new "hostage policy" -- the release or the presentation  of well-known political prisoners at important political moments  that promise the greatest possible journalistic effect. The  largely anonymous majority of prisoners of conscience is being  forgotten, Asiawatch complains.    U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will certainly  expect some gesture, no matter how dubious it may be from a  moral viewpoint, when he arrives in Beijing this Friday. "Human  rights are a priority on the agenda of my visit to China,"  Christopher announced a few days ago.    U.S. President Clinton has linked the extension of the  most-favored-nation status, which is renewed every year, with  "significant progress" in Beijing in the sphere of human rights.  Christopher's report on his visit to China will be Clinton's  major basis for a decision. The status grants China normal  customs tariffs. If it should not be extended, China's textile  exports to the United States would become much more expensive.  Billions of dollars in bilateral trade would be in peril and  tens of thousands of jobs would be lost in the United States and  in China. Thus, this step would be tantamount to trade  sanctions.    The debate about the most-favored-nation clause has been  part  of the summer show in the U.S. Congress since 1989. So far, the  Sword of Damocles always hung over the Chinese for a few weeks  without descending completely. The losses for U.S. and Hong  Kong enterprises would have been too big. Year in year out they  are paying the fees of a group of professional lobbyists who  fight for a renewal of the clause and against sanctions against  China.    This year, the variable is the new President. How serious is  Clinton about human rights, which he advocated strongly during  his election campaign against George Bush? He is now the  President and "jobs, jobs, jobs" is all his compatriots are  interested in. China might take revenge by discriminating  against U.S. companies when placing orders for large economic  projects. Beijing followed this principle recently when France  concluded a weapons deal with Taiwan.    Neither of the two sides shows any flexibility. Clinton  declared three weeks ago that China has made "some limited  progress," which, however, is not yet sufficient. U.S. Human  Rights Commissioner John Shattuck recently visited Beijing to  remind the Chinese once again of all the individual points in  Clinton's "executive order" on the most-favored-nation clause  for China. The presidential decree of May 1993 calls for  "significant progress" in the following areas: Release or  information on the fate of political prisoners, guarantees for  the humane treatment of prisoners -- by allowing inspections by  international organizations, for example -- and the protection  of the cultural and religious heritage of the Tibetans. It also  demands an end to the jamming of international television and  radio programs, freedom of emigration, and a ban on the export  of goods to the United States that have been produced in Chinese  prisons.    So far, China has hardly made any concessions, apart from  propaganda videos and propaganda trips. Initial cautious  negotiations with the International Red Cross on visits to  prisons have not yielded any results. Officially, China rejects  U.S. pressure on every occasion as "interference in the internal  affairs of a sovereign state." Referring to human rights, Prime  Minister Li Peng told the National People's Congress on Thursday  that "China is against any kind of hegemonism." His statement  was welcomed with strong applause by the approximately 3,000  puppet delegates.    In a seeming effort to express its defiance vis-a-vis the  United States, China's police arrested over a dozen dissidents  in the runup to the visit and the session of "parliament" that  began on Thursday. Some were released after the hour-long  interrogations designed to intimidate them, but at least three  are facing several-year prison terms. China's most well-known  dissident, Wei Jingsheng, with whom Christopher would like to  meet, has "departed" from Beijing under mysterious circumstances.    A clear change of course of the Chinese leadership in the  sphere of human rights is unlikely in the near future,  irrespective of the outcome of the visit by U.S. Secretary of  State Christopher. After all, the power of the CPC depends on  the intimidating effect of the Chinese gulag, as the 89-year-old  patriarch Deng Xiaoping knows very well. To achieve this goal,  the security organs frequently have to carry out raids during  the night, and the fearless few like Liu Gang are arrested,  sentenced, and forgotten.</p>

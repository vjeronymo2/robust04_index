			<p><P> March 27, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ITALY SEEKS TO DELAY STEEL PLANT CLOSINGS  </P> <P> Italy has asked the European Commission to postpone the controversial closure  of three steel plants, saying there has been an upturn in the steel market.  </P> <P> A government spokesman said Italy wanted the closure of a blast furnace at  Bagnoli near Naples to be delayed by a year until the end of June, 1990. It  wanted similar delays at plants in Turin and Sesto San Giovanni near Milan,  both due to shut at the end of March.  </P> <P> The Bagnoli plan, which would involve cutting 2,000 jobs, sparked rioting in  January.  </P> <P> Other governments that have cut production say cuts in Italy are needed to help  make the European steel industry competitive.  </P></p>

			<p><P> June 28, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEPUTIES BUCKLE DOWN ON BELT USE  </P> <P> Sheriff's deputies stopped about 1,400 motorists at a checkpoint Saturday, but  they wrote no tickets, issued no citations and made no arrests. Officers just  wanted to remind people to buckle up.  </P> <P> "It was really a lot of fun," said Sgt. Bob Wilson of the Sheriff's Department.  "We thought for sure somebody would complain . . . you know, like, 'Why are you  stopping me?' . . . But we got nothing but positive comments."  </P> <P> Deputies, who said the seat-belt operation was the first of its kind in  California, modeled the operation after the controversial sobriety checkpoints  recently upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.  </P> <P> But to avoid potential legal challenges, officers decided to focus on  education, not enforcement. Those who were unbuckled were given a gentle  admonition and handed a packet of brochures on highway safety.  </P> <P> Those with fastened seat belts were commended and invited to pick up a free  gift at a traffic safety fair that officers had set up at nearby Puente Hills  Mall.  </P> <P> Although the Los Angeles chapter of the National Safety Council estimates that  about half of all motorists wear seat belts, deputies said they recorded about  a 70% compliance rate.  </P> <P> Of course, that might have had something to do with the large sign about 1,000  yards down Castleton Street, advising drivers that they were about to come to a  seat-belt checkpoint. There was even time to make a turn and seek an alternate  route.  </P> <P> But for every motorist on the lam, officers said, there was somebody so  thrilled with the idea that they decided to pass through again.  </P> <P> "Some people got there and went home to bring their kids back down," Wilson  said. "One guy with three children drove through the checkpoint, then drove  through again and was going to go through a third time."  </P> <P> Eleven deputies from the Industry substation organized the checkpoint and  safety fair, with the help of two California Highway Patrol officers and about  two dozen Explorer Scouts, reserve officers and civilian volunteers.  </P> <P> The four-hour event was paid for by corporate sponsors and donations from  Industry business people.  </P></p>

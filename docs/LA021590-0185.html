			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PITCHING THEIR OIL-SLICK SOLUTIONS -- TO NO AVAIL;  </P> <P> SALES: BUSINESSES PUSHING NEW PRODUCTS TO DISPERSE OR SOAK UP THE GOO FIND THAT  CLEANUP CREWS ARE STICKING WITH TRIED-AND-TRUE METHODS.  </P> <P> Want to tame an oil slick?  </P> <P> Just spray on Oil Spill Eater, an enzyme solution with such common ingredients  as yeast, molasses, malt and sugar. Faster than you can say "American Trading  Transportation Co." -- well, in about three days, its makers say -- naturally  created bacteria will eat right through the goo.  </P> <P> Is that slick headed for the beach?  </P> <P> It's time for Wollastic Fiber, something its manufacturer calls a "a simple  solution to the complicated problem of oil spill cleanup." Just lay out the  latex-backed coconut-fiber mats at the surf line like so many beach blankets.  The mats will sop up the oil before it reaches the sand, a company executive  said.  </P> <P> For some companies, Orange County's oil disaster would seem to hold the promise  of a big business opportunity. But this small army of entrepreneurs, sales  representatives and inventors has had a tough time pitching products to stop  the slick and clean the beaches.  </P> <P> "It's the worst time to try to present something when you have a serious  situation like this," said John Kearns, sales manager of Nickey Petroleum Co.  in Santa Ana, who has been trying in vain to persuade officials to try his  company's BioSolve oil solvent. "They are so busy trying to resolve this  situation they don't have time to look as closely at things that need to be  looked at."  </P> <P> Both British Petroleum, whose oil is involved and which is directing the  cleanup, and the California Department of Fish and Game, which is involved in  wildlife rescue efforts, report they have been flooded with ideas and sales  pitches since the tanker American Trader leaked nearly 400,000 gallons of oil  into the waters off Huntington Beach last week.  </P> <P> "We've been receiving a fair number of calls," said BP spokesman Peter  Necarsulmer in Long Beach. "They are all evaluated fully and not dismissed; but  as you can imagine, we've had some out-of-this-world suggestions."  </P> <P> One man proposed using a fleet of outdoor vacuum cleaners that could be rolled  along the beach. "There's a lot more beach (sand) and oil than can fill those  bags," Necarsulmer lamented.  </P> <P> Another caller suggested spreading sawdust along the surf line to absorb the  oil.  </P> <P> Fish and Game spokesman Patrick Moore said his office, too, has received its  share of novel ideas. One balloon company representative called to inquire  whether tankers could be required to carry large balloons that could be filled  with oil in the event of a spill.  </P> <P> Cleanup crews, however, have been sticking to the tried-and-true -- skimmers at  sea and beach workers armed with absorbent pads and booms.  </P> <P> Further, officials have specifically decided against using any kind of  dispersant, which could break up the oil on the water's surface but pose a  threat to wildlife.  </P> <P> The adherence to traditional methods comes as a tough break for the legitimate  entrepreneurs who see the oily waters off Orange County as an ideal proving  ground for their products.  </P> <P> A Phoenix-based salesman armed with swatches of Wollastic Fiber walked up and  down Huntington Beach in vain last weekend trying to demonstrate the product's  oil-absorbing qualities for any official who would watch.  </P> <P> "I could do a better job than those little diapers they're using down there,"  said Jeff Nickum, who represents Envirocology Inc.  </P> <P> F.P. Woll &amp; Co. of Philadelphia developed the coconut-fiber material as  padding for seat cushions. Company officials say the material has tremendous  potential for cleaning up oil spills -- if only officials would be willing to  give it a try.  </P> <P> "We have done everything we can think of," said Fred Woll II, the company's  president, about trying to get his product considered. "We have been to  everyone we can think of."  </P> <P> The makers of Oil Spill Eater have not had much luck either. Executives of Sky  Blue Chems of Dallas said they believe that had their product had been sprayed  onto the oily seas soon after the spill, the petroleum would have been  neutralized within 72 hours.  </P> <P> "We've got 100 drums (of the solution) in Las Vegas that could mitigate 275,000  gallons of crude," Sky Blue Chairman Steve Pedigo said. "We could have it there  in four hours. We had enough to do the entire job when it first happened. That  oil would have never come ashore."  </P> <P> Nickey Petroleum executives didn't lose any time in letting officials know they  were ready with their BioSolve oil neutralizer. Kearns said he called British  Petroleum the night of spill but that "they indicated they had everything well  under control."  </P> <P> Kearns said, however, that the skimmers were able to collect only a small  percentage of the oil before it came ashore. BioChem, a dispersant that  encapsulates the broken oil molecules before they sink, could have safely  stopped the slick, he said.  </P></p>

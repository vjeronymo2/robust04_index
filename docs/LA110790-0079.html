			<p><P> November 7, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> INQUIRY URGED IN BUILDER'S FAILURE TO KEEP PROMISES;  </P> <P> STUDIO CITY: A COUNCILMAN CHARGES THAT A DEVELOPER FAILED TO PUT IN REQUIRED  TRAFFIC IMPROVEMENTS IN TWO PROJECTS.  </P> <P> Councilman Michael Woo on Tuesday called for a city investigation into why the  developer of a problem-ridden Studio City shopping center failed to widen an  intersection as promised and was then allowed to open another, nearby mini-mall  with its own set of incomplete traffic improvements.  </P> <P> Woo also called on the city's traffic, engineering and legal staffs to explain  why they allowed the Ventura Boulevard developer to settle a bond-default suit  out of court for $205,000 when the cost of the traffic project would have been  closer to $250,000 -- roughly the amount of the bond.  </P> <P> The case was settled in June, 2 1/2 years after developer Mitch Francis was  supposed to have paid for installation of a double left-turn lane at the corner  of Laurel Canyon and Ventura boulevards in return for permits to build the  "Times Square" shopping center at 12215 Ventura Blvd.  </P> <P> In August, another Francis project, the "California Pavilion" shopping center,  opened at Ventura Boulevard and Laurel Grove Avenue although a street-widening  project there also remains incomplete. The shopping center has a temporary  occupancy permit and a permanent permit is dependent on finishing the traffic  project.  </P> <P> Francis blamed the city bureaucracy for delays in both traffic projects. He  also had harsh words for Woo, saying "this is just typical of the way Woo  operates, where he makes these grandstands to point to bad-guy developers, and  it's just completely unfair and wrong."  </P> <P> In the case of Times Square, Francis, the shopping center's new managing  partner Stephen Getzoff, and their attorney Fred Gaines all said the city  engineer's office could not decide what it wanted and repeatedly required  time-consuming and expensive changes in the plans.  </P> <P> As for the California Pavilion's incomplete street-widening project, Francis  said his construction crew encountered unexpected telephone lines where a  traffic signal is supposed to be installed. Again, he blamed the city, saying  that its maps failed to show the phone lines and its staff was slow to work out  an agreement with the utility.  </P> <P> Times Square attorney Fred Gaines questioned why Woo was calling for an  investigation five months after the matter was settled. The $205,000 settlement  fee was derived by subtracting the money spent on engineering fees from the  original $247,695 bond, Francis and Getzoff said.  </P> <P> Woo said he was calling for the investigation now because "we still need to  understand, 'How did this happen in the first place?' " He said he mainly  wanted to know why the Times Square project received a permanent occupancy  permit in 1988 when the traffic work wasn't done, and "why the city didn't get  a larger amount of money" when it settled the foreclosure case out of court.  </P> <P> Woo said it "could've been great" if he and his staff initiated the  investigation earlier "but we were busy." In his motion before the City Council  on Tuesday, Woo asked that the city attorney's office, the Bureau of  Engineering and the Traffic Department submit reports on the matter within 30  days to the Governmental Efficiency Committee, which he chairs.  </P> <P> The traffic improvements Francis was supposed to have made will cost between  $214,000 and $244,000, Woo's deputy Diana Brueggemann said Tuesday. The city is  negotiating with another developer, Ira Smedra, to include the project when he  makes additional improvements to the intersection for his "Laurel Promenade"  shopping center at the southeast corner of Ventura and Laurel Canyon  boulevards.  </P></p>

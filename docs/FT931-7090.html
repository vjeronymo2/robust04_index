			<p>930226 FT  26 FEB 93 / Computer hacker 'cost FT Pounds 24,871' A SCHOOLBOY who allegedly hacked into a Financial Times computer which stored data on share price indices caused considerable disruption at the newspaper, Southwark Crown Court was told yesterday. Mr Paul Bedworth, now a student at Edinburgh University, hacked into the FT's computer to use its account with BT to reach other computing systems, the jury was told. Mr Anthony Johnson, former head of computing services for the FT, said the hacking was noticed in May 1991. Systems engineers discovered a dialling program had been inserted. It made one telephone call a second and increased the FT's telephone bill by Pounds 705. Part of the system had to be removed for investigations which took weeks. Fresh equipment had to be rented while this work was carried out. The total cost of the hacking was Pounds 24,871. The security system had been designed so that only users with a password could deliver information to the computer. The hacker was able to use a 'back door' in the system to gain entry to the computer without such a password, he said. The back doors had been put into the system for the convenience of engineers, but were not removed before the computer was issued. Mr Johnson denied a suggestion from Mr Ian MacDonald QC, defending, that the FT's computer was a 'hacker's dream'. Such back doors would not usually be known to users of the system, he said. Mr Bedworth, from Ilkley, West Yorkshire, denies three conspiracy charges under the Computer Misuse Act 1990 alleging unauthorised modification of computer information, securing unauthorised access to computer information and obtaining telegraphic services unlawfully. The trial continues today.</p>

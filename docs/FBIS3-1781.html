			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By staff reporter Wu Yunhe: "Central Bank To Cool Fixed </F> Assets"]    [Text] The central bank plans to exercise stringent  control over the money supply this year by reigning in  fixed-asset loans and barring the Finance Ministry from dipping  into its coffers.    The new policies aim to protect `sound' economic investment  but still curb inflation, said Zhou Zhengqing, vice-governor of  the People's Bank of China (PBC).    PBC views this as its primary role this year.    Meanwhile, China will also consider allowing foreign banks  to  do business in renminbi, Zhou said. But that will not come  until domestic and foreign banks have equal tax systems.    The State Council has targeted fixed-asset investment,  urging  government departments to impose strict control over the  ballooning sector.    "Without the government's approval, any specialized bank and  financial institution will not be allowed to exceed their quota  of fixed assets investment this year," Zhou noted.    And starting this year, the Finance Ministry is prohibited  from overdrawing its PBC accounts or borrowing money from the  bank to finance debt.    Deficits should now be met through issuing treasury bonds to  the public, he added.    PBC will also strictly control loans to specialty banks and  financial institutions.    China will try to diversify its loan system by broadening  banks to include mortgage and discount loans.    Zhou said these measures will further serve the bank's  effective control of the money market.    PBC will increase efforts to write rules governing  commercial  banks as part of the major task of converting the specialty  banks, Zhou said.    But it still has a long way to go towards achieving this  end,  he added.    However, as the first step, three policy-lending banks will  be created this year. They include the State Long-Term Credit  Development Bank, the Import and Export Bank and the  Agricultural Development Bank.    These banks will supply low-interest loans to support key  industrial and agricultural projects, infrastructure  construction programmes, and the purchase of grain, cotton and  edible oil from farmers.    Zhou said that while implementing the State's demand of  low-interest financing, these banks must be careful not to run  in the red.    After the three banks are established, the Industrial and  Commercial Bank, the Bank of China, the Construction Bank and  the Agricultural Bank of China will further commercialize their  business.    Once these four specialized banks go commercial, they will  compete directly with foreign banks in renminbi business.    Since the unification of the foreign exchange rate on  January  1, the renminbi's exchange rate against U.S. dollar has been  stable at around 8.69 to 8.71.</p>

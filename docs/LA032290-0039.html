			<p><P> March 22, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUNDING FOR LIBRARIES  </P> <P> Your staff really missed the boat when writing about the trials and  tribulations of California libraries. In the accompanying article about the  national library scene, a table showing per capita expenditures for public  libraries appeared.  </P> <P> Pasadena, with $4.04 per capita was sixth in the nation and No. 1 in California  (in this probably abbreviated table). Not one mention of Pasadena appears in  the article!  </P> <P> Why not write about what an enlightened community can do when guided by an  exceptional library director, a thoughtful city manager and an intelligent  board of directors (city council). Attempts have been made in the distant past  to "economize" at the expense of the library system but the citizens of  Pasadena have beaten them back.  </P> <P> The Pasadena Public Library Foundation will, this year, complete a $2.6-million  fund-raising effort (no tax funds involved) which has been used to refurbish  the central library and (more important) create an endowment to ensure the  future maintenance of the "refurbishments."  </P> <P> I would suggest that maintenance of this relatively high per capita tax support  and the fund-raising effort exemplify a unique approach to library financing.  </P> <P> ROBERT J. BANNING  </P> <P> Pasadena  </P></p>

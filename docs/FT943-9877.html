			<p>940809 FT  09 AUG 94 / 400 jobs to go in bakery closure A bakery that makes Mr Kipling cakes is to close with the loss of 400 jobs. Manor Bakeries is to shut its bakery in Wythenshawe, Manchester in 19 months in a move the company blames on increased competition in the packaged cake market. The job cuts will start early next year in a phased shut-down at the plant, the smallest of the company's four UK factories.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=69 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=41 g=1 f=1 -->  <RINDOCK>[Docket No. 94&hyph;79; Notice 1]</RINDOCK> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=55 g=1 f=1 -->  <DOCTITLE>General Motors Corporation; Receipt of Application for Decision of Inconsequential Noncompliance</DOCTITLE> <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> General Motors Corporation (GM) of Warren, Michigan, has determined that some of its vehicles fail to comply with 49 CFR 571.209, Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) No. 209, ``Seat Belt Assemblies,'' and has filed an appropriate report pursuant to 49 CFR Part 573, ``Defect and Noncompliance Reports.'' GM has also applied to be exempted from the notification and remedy requirements of 49 U.S.C. Chapter 301_``Motor Vehicle Safety'' on the basis that the noncompliance is inconsequential to motor vehicle safety. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice of receipt of an application is published under 49 U.S.C. 30118 and 30120 (formerly Section 157 of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 1417)) and does not represent any agency decision or other exercise of judgment concerning the merits of the application. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Paragraph S4.6(b) of FMVSS No. 209 states that a seat belt assembly shall be labeled with the following statement: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> This seat belt assembly is for use only in [insert specific seating position(s), e.g., `front right'] in [insert specific vehicles make(s) and model(s)]. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> GM produced two different populations of vehicles which do not meet the labeling requirements stated in the standard. The first population of vehicles, 68,405 1994 model year Chevrolet and GMC G-vans, were built with left-side seat belt assemblies that were labeled as right-side assemblies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second population of vehicles, 31,978 1992&hyph;94 model year Chevrolet and GMC K20753 extended cap pickups, were built with front outboard seat belt assemblies with the appropriate model designation omitted. The model designation is K20753. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> GM supports its application for inconsequential noncompliance with the following. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For both these issues, the GM part numbers and manufacturer's model numbers correctly identify the affected seat belt assemblies. In addition, the service parts manuals correctly specify the proper part numbers if replacement parts were needed. In the case of the G-van seat belt assemblies, it is not possible to install the left front seat belt assembly at the right front position. For the K 20753 model, the issue is the omission of an appropriate model. Usage of the seat belt assembly in any of the models identified on the label is appropriate, as would be usage in the K 20753. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is GM's understanding that the purposed of the subject requirement was to provide the person  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=3 --> replacing <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 -->  a seat belt assembly in a vehicle with appropriate seat position and vehicle model information. However, original equipment seat belt assemblies have already been installed in the appropriate models and positions at the assembly plant. The Agency stated in a recent rulemaking proposal (Docket 74&hyph;14; Notice 81, dated May 10, 1993), ``*&blank;*&blank;* that seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment in new motor vehicles need not be required to be labeled with position model information. This information is only useful if the assembly is removed with the intention of using the assembly as a replacement in another vehicle. NHTSA does not believe this is a common practice.'' GM agrees and believes that the removal of original equipment seat belt assemblies for the purpose of replacement installation in another vehicle is rare. The Agency finalized that rulemaking action on April 15, 1994, eliminating the required label verbiage on seat belt assemblies installed as original equipment by vehicle manufacturers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments on the application of GM, described above.

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Winners and losers from Berlusconi partnership: MSI/National Alliance The electoral impact of Forza Italia has tended to overshadow the dramatic gains made by the neo-fascist MSI/National Alliance of Mr Gianfranco Fini, writes Robert Graham in Rome. The MSI/National Alliance is the third largest party in the new parliament and now accounts for almost 14 per cent of the vote. Linked in with Forza Italia, it has become the biggest political grouping from Rome south. For the previous two decades, the MSI had never risen above 6 per cent of the vote. In less than 12 months Mr Fini has transformed the party from a marginal political role to become a key player. The general election result in good measure reflects Mr Fini's popularity as a vigorous young leader, untainted by corruption scandals. The MSI has traditionally done well at a local level in isolated areas of the south, thanks to monarchist traditions, a strong connection with the masonic movement and a visceral identification with the achievements of Mussolini. But the party has become a big beneficiary of the collapse of the two main governing parties, Christian Democrats and Socialists, which dispensed patronage in the south. By changing the party's name from the National Social Movement - modelled on Mussolini's political movement - to the National Alliance, Mr Fini has managed to modernise its image and confer a new respectability. The party also managed to retain its own identity separate from that of Forza Italia, standing separately in Trieste and parts of the Marche. In the south, MSI was Mr Berlusconi's equal partner and sometimes the dominant one. Mr Fini is an enthusiastic proponent of Mr Berlusconi as prime minister. To enter government, he will also need to remove some of the more overtly fascist elements that hover in the party wings.</p>

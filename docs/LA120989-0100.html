			<p><P> December 9, 1989, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> HIGH-SCORING HART ROLLS OVER SAUGUS  </P> <P> In only the second game of the season, Hart High basketball Coach Greg Herrick  didn't expect to be pulling for his team to score 100 points. But that was  about his biggest concern Friday night, as the Indians cruised to a 99-72  nonleague win over Saugus at Hart.  </P> <P> The subdued crowd came to life in the final minute as Hart neared the century  scoring mark. Chad Hourigan missed the back end of a one-and-one with 13  seconds remaining, giving Hart 99 points. Saugus turned over the ball on the  ensuing inbounds pass, but the Indians returned the favor and had to settle for  one shy of 100.  </P> <P> "We started watching the scoreboard a little too much in the second half," said  Herrick, whose team is coming off a 13-11 season. "But I thought our  conditioning really kicked in in the fourth period, and we were able to wear  them down."  </P> <P> The Indians spread the scoring around while jumping out to an early lead.  Forward Micah Ohlman sank three three-point shots in the first half on his way  to a game-high 25 points. Hart (2-0) led, 25-20, after one period and held a  50-33 advantage at halftime.  </P> <P> Herrick substituted freely in the second half and was impressed with the  performance of his bench. Forward Chad Fotheringham also hit three three-point  shots and finished with 17 points. Guard Andrew Lorraine added 13. Starters  Renato Rivas, Marty Downen and Keith Halcovich each scored 11 points.  </P> <P> "This is the best depth I've had since I've been here," said Herrick, in his  third year. "We expect to do well. It's nice to have so many guys to call on."  </P> <P> Jeff Dains, who led Saugus (1-3) in scoring with 17, sank a three-point shot to  cut the deficit to 59-51. But that's as close as the Centurions would get.  </P></p>

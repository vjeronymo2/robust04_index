			<p>920820 FT  20 AUG 92 / International Company News: Pioneer slides 50% on weak economy PIONEER Electronic, the audio and video equipment specialist, yesterday reported a 50 per cent decline in consolidated operating profits to Y3.48bn (Dollars 27.56m) in the three months to June. Sales climbed by 2.3 per cent to Y144.55bn. Net after-tax profits were down by 30 per cent to Y4.98bn. The company blamed the poor performance on the weak economy in Japan, and on the rise in the value of the yen against the dollar. Sales of audio products fell by 14.7 per cent to Y37.4bn, while video product sales rose 3.1 per cent to Y44.2bn. Sales of electronic products for cars were relatively successful, rising by 15.4 per cent to Y52.9bn in spite of sluggishness in car markets. Weak demand in Japan took its toll on sales of audio products, commercial sing-along karaoke systems, and car stereos for car manufacturers. However, consumer-use laser disc player sales rose in Japan and the US, while car compact disc player sales advanced in both countries. Domestic sales were down by 7.3 per cent to Y54.35bn, while overseas sales rose by 9.1 per cent to Y90.2bn.</p>

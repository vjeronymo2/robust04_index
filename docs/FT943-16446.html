			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / Economic Watch: Inflation declines in Italy Italy's inflation rate dropped last month to its lowest for 25 years. Consumer prices rose by only 0.2 per cent in June, giving an annual rise of 3.7 per cent. June's figure will help ease worries that the decline in inflation is slowing. The industrialists' organisation Confindustria expressed concern last month, with consumer price increases moving only slightly from 4.2 per cent in the first quarter to 4.1 per cent in April and May. However, the Bank of Italy's governor, Mr Antonio Fazio, said in May that the implementation of government programmes and the new agreement on labour costs reinforced expectations of price stability. Consumer price inflation in Italy was 4.5 per cent last year, against 5.3 per cent in 1992 and 6.3 per cent in 1991. Turkish inflation fell to 0.9 per cent in June compared with 10 per cent in May. The government envisages that the annual rate, which is now running at 115 per cent, will fall to 20 per cent by mid-1995. German wholesale sales rose 4 per cent to DM84bn (Pounds 34.3bn) in May from April and were up a real 5 per cent year-on-year. Sales in the first five months rose 1 per cent to DM401bn. Spain's trade deficit rose for the second consecutive month in May, compared with last year, to Pta233.7bn (Pounds 1.16bn), up almost 7 per cent. The deficit for the first five months was Pta896.2bn, down 4 per cent. The deficit to May with the rest of the EU narrowed by 40 per cent, thanks to a 38 rise in exports. Norway's current account surplus to April rose to NKr8.086bn (Pounds 755m), down from NKr9.965bn in the same four months last year.</p>

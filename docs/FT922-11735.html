			<p>920424 FT  24 APR 92 / UN peace force may be sent to Somalia THE United Nations Security Council may despatch more than 500 troops to strife-torn Somalia under a plan outlined last night, writes Michael Littlejohns, UN Correspondent in New York. Military costs for a six-to-nine months peacekeeping operation are estimated at a relatively modest Dollars 23m. For the first time in a UN operation, the main body of infantry would be sea-based - using a ship off the capital, Mogadishu, as base camp. Fifty unarmed military observers in Mogadishu would monitor the ceasefire that went into effect on March 3 between the two main factions in the Somali civil war. They would also provide escorts for relief supplies.</p>

			<p>940510 FT  10 MAY 94 / International Capital Markets: Czech paper to support trade EGAP (Czech Export Guarantee and Development Corp) is planning international bond issues to provide long-term funds which Czech companies can draw upon to support international trade operations, Reuter reports from Prague. 'We will definitely issue bonds on the international capital markets,' Mr Arnost Bohm, EGAP vice-general-director said. EGAP is to launch an export credit bank this week. The bank, Ceska Exportni Banka, was expected to begin with Kcs1.5bn (Dollars 51m) in basic capital, two thirds provided by the National Property Fund and one-third by the Czech National Bank. A change in Czech banking laws, to allow for the operation of an export bank, has yet to be passed. Mr Bohm said government ministers would probably send the law to parliament by the end of this month.</p>

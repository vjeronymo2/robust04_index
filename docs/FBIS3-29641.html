The ministry said the rise in state and local government  investment stemmed mainly from a jump in local government  projects which came to 14.67 trillion yen, up 1.7 trillion yen  or 12.9 percent from the previous year.    Ministry officials said local governments are steadily  improving infrastructure such as roads, parks and housing.    By category, roads accounted for 26.4 percent of the total  investment, followed by educational facilities with 9.1 percent,  agriculture, forestry and fisheries projects with 8.3 percent,  land preservation programs with 8.2 percent and sewage projects  with 7.8 percent.    The ministry said cities and towns accounted for 46.0  percent  of total investment, prefectures 32.8 percent and the central  government 21.2 percent.    The Tokyo Metropolitan Government headed a list of  prefectures in terms of investment, accounting for 4.87 trillion  yen or 12.1 percent of the total, followed by Hokkaido with 2.39  trillion yen, Osaka with 2.36 trillion yen and Kanagawa with  2.31 trillion yen.    But in terms of per capita investment, Shimane Prefecture in  southwestern Japan topped the list for four years in a row with  497,082 yen, followed by Kochi, Tottori, Hokkaido and Tokyo, the  ministry said.    Former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita, a native of Shimane  Prefecture, has been widely credited with a lot of pork barrel  projects in his home prefecture.</p>

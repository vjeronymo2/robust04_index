			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> Consumer advocates and insurers who have clashed in the past joined forces to  push for legislation such as mandated auto safety features and a return to the  55-m.p.h. speed limit on all interstate highways. The Advocates for Highway and  Auto Safety will pursue "a balanced and aggressive approach" to reduce highway  deaths and injuries and the high cost of automobile accidents, said executive  director Judith Lee Stone. Insurers hope improved auto safety will help stem  rising auto insurance costs.  </P></p>

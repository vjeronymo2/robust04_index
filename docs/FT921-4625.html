			<p>920309 FT  09 MAR 92 / Turkey switches tactics in attempt to join Community TURKEY has switched tactics in its bid to join the European Community, away from insistently demanding early admission and towards a long-haul campaign portraying Turkey as the new regional power in central Asia and therefore as Europe's invaluable partner. Interviews with leaders of the new government this weekend confirmed that its sights are still set on joining the EC, but that they have more immediate regional hopes and fears to preoccupy them. Paradoxically, banging less loudly on Brussels' door and devoting itself more to cultivating its regional concerns may in the end improve Turkey's still-long-shot chances of gaining admission to the EC club. Over time, the EC may become less inclined to look down on a Turkey that is increasingly being looked up to by the Caucasian and central Asian republics as their model for achieving democratic capitalism. For all Turkish politicians, except those of the fundamentalist Welfare party, Community membership appears to remain the main goal. Even the most distant prospect of membership has been a spur to improving the country's human rights and economic performance, the issues on which prime minister Suleiman Demirel won power last year. But though Turkey led, in 1987, the latest wave of EC applications, it keeps being sent to the back of the applicants' queue. Some Turkish politicians take this very badly, notably President Turgut Ozal who masterminded the 1987 application. He regards the EC's criticism of Turkey's human rights records as 'a made-up reason why Turkey should not join the EC'. He says 'the real reason is that we are Moslem'. Mr Demirel professes to be more relaxed, both on the motives and duration of EC stand-offishness. He dismisses Mr Ozal's anti-Moslem theory. 'We want to live and breathe in Europe,' he says. 'This is modern Turkey's choice and we don't care how long it takes'. By contrast, Mr Ozal wants to plunge into the only possible arrangement on offer from Brussels for the foreseeable future: a customs union in 1996. Only Turkish textile makers, the EC's largest supplier and frequent target of its dumping inquiries, would welcome such free trade. Most Turkish industrialists and ministers quiver at the thought of the cold blast free EC competition would send through their protected sectors. They want some off-setting aid from Brussels, like the EC's Ecu600m (Pounds 426.6m) protocol long blocked by Greece. But speaking to Brussels-based journalists last Friday, Mr Ozal said: 'Let's have the customs union even without the financial aid'. However, the following day Mr Demirel gave another indication that he intends to use the operational powers he has as prime minister to play a cooler game towards the EC. 'At the moment, I think it (the customs union) would be beneficial for Turkey, but there are four more years to go'. Few leading Turks think that the ex-Soviet republics in the Caucasus and central Asia offer any economic, let alone political, alternative to the EC. In unusual harmony, Mr Ozal and Mr Demirel acknowledge the regional leadership role thrust on their country, but caution that Turkey, especially without western aid, can only make a modest impact. But Ankara ministries and Istanbul boardrooms are abuzz with plans for government aid, private ventures, and university scholarships for their Turkic cousins in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). It is this wider, eastern strategy of Turkey's which is put at risk by the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh, and the likelihood of Turkey siding with fellow-Moslem Azeris in the conflict. For this reason, Mr Demirel was at pains over the weekend to dismiss sabre-rattling talk from President Ozal. There are signs, too, that Brussels is picking up Ankara's idea of a triangular operation, whereby the EC would lend central Asian CIS republics money to buy goods from Turkey. The Commission now wants to establish diplomatic and economic ties with Asian, as well as European, members of the CIS. If this happens, and if Greece continues to prevent Ecus going to Turkey, the latter will be, as one EC Commission official noted, 'the only country between the Straits of Gibraltar and the Sea of Japan not to get EC aid'. But while Turkey may now have more geo-political worth to the EC, it still gets little EC esteem for its human rights record. The Demirel government may now be treating its Kurds better than the previous Motherland Party government did, and certainly better than Iraq and Iran treat their Kurds. The question of any formal autonomy, of the kind that might separate most Kurds from the militants of the separatist Kurdish Workers Party (PKK), is still taboo. Mr Demirel still defends other methods, such as the March 1 bombing of alleged PKK camps in northern Iraq, though his Social Democrat vice-prime minister, Mr Erdan Inonu, concedes one day a referendum on Kurdish autonomy might be possible. Turkey's problem with the EC is that it is chasing a moving target, a Community which keeps setting itself higher sights in terms of political and monetary union and which, as it enlarges to take in Scandinavians, will become more, not less, sensitive about human rights. But, says Mr Demirel, 'we do not assume we will never reach the standards of Europe'.</p>

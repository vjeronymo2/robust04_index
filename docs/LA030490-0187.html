			<p><P> March 4, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> IT'S NOT OVER UNTIL IT'S OVER, BUT IT'S ALSO PRETTY SAD  </P> <P> Professional athletes die twice.  </P> <P> "It's so," says Lee Lacy. "When you are told the only life you know and love is  over, it's the same as telling you you are dead and gone."  </P> <P> For 16 years Lee Lacy ran and threw and slid with joyful abandon on three major  league baseball teams. Today, at 41, he retains his athlete's physique but has  gained, or so he says, a middle-age maturity. Even so, he refuses to accept a  death sentence.  </P> <P> Few athletes ever do. Especially, perhaps, prizefighters, whose overdue  decisions to hang 'em up often is only slightly less painful to faithful fans  who avert their eyes in sorrow at the ultimate ignominy.  </P> <P> But denial extends to less brutal pursuits as well. Arthur Ashe, the former  tennis champion offers an explanation and insists that "a little like dying" is  more than metaphor.  </P> <P> "We have defined our masculinity in terms of our athletic prowess," he once  wrote, "and retirement can only mean we are thereafter lesser men."  </P> <P> Lesser men. At an age that most adults consider the prime of life.  </P> <P> Laying aside the artifacts of their prowess, their spikes and gloves and  rackets, is not all they leave behind. Athletes have taken over from cowboys  and movie stars and even astronauts as America's most glamorous heroes,  certainly the highest paid. What they leave is more than a game, and the  leaving thus more painful than for mere mortals.  </P> <P> "It's the nature of the adulation," football star Jim Brown recently told an  interviewer. "It's so overwhelming, the thrill you get, the cheers you hear,  the lifestyle you can afford. Your head gets bigger without your even realizing  it."  </P> <P> The years seem to pass without their realizing it as well. Many athletes,  notably those who play team sports, argue that their ability to go just one  more inning should determine their longevity, not the presence of some younger  hotshot on the bench.  </P> <P> "Why should there be a cutoff date?" asks Toby Harrah, whose 17-year baseball  career included four all-star games.  </P> <P> Harrah, lithe and leather tough at 42, recalls the words of Satchel Paige,  whose playing days, some guessed, stretched into his 60s: "How can you tell how  old you are if you don't know?"  </P> <P> "You have to remember," said Harrah, "that our careers began not when we got  out of college or even high school but back when we were 6 or 7 years old. So  when you're told you're through while you still feel fit and confident, it's  like being hit by a train."  </P> <P> Toby Harrah and Lee Lacy are two among 200 other former major league baseball  players who also had once been pronounced dead on arrival -- at spring training  camp, as in Lacy's case, or when they came up with a bum leg or a sore arm or a  slow bat.  </P> <P> Naturally, none of them accepted the verdict as final.  </P> <P> Instead, all of them heeded a siren's song inviting former major leaguers 35  and older to come to Florida, land of the Fountain of Youth, and play baseball  once again, this time in the Senior Professional Baseball Association.  </P> <P> The league, its first three-month winter season just ended, was the brainstorm  of an entrepreneur willing to bet, as were his aging recruits, on baseball  philosopher Yogi Berra's pronouncement that the game ain't over 'til it's over.  </P> <P> Like Harrah, Lacy insists that "that's something a ballplayer ought to be  allowed to decide for himself," acknowledging that such a notion probably was a  pipe dream. "Well why not," he said, "playing in the majors was a dream come  true in the first place."  </P> <P> One of the senior league's luminaries, ex-Yankee Graig Nettles, is also a  dreamer. Said Nettles when he joined the league, "If I can stay in baseball, I  may never have to grow up."  </P> <P> Lacy and Harrah both played for the West Palm Beach Tropics, who wound up  winning their Southern Division title but losing in a championship game to the  St. Petersburg Pelicans. Perhaps you missed it.  </P> <P> The Tropics' theme song was a Steve Winwood tune, "Back in the High Life  Again."  </P> <P> Its promising words -- "I'll be back in the high life again All the eyes that  watched me once will smile and take me in." -- had a forlorn and ironic ring,  however, blaring over the loudspeaker before every home game, echoing across  rows of empty seats in a small-town ballpark that real major leaguers used only  for spring training.  </P> <P> Lee Lacy loved the major league high life, all right, what ballplayers call the  Show.  </P> <P> He traveled first class and slept on fine linen and left wake-up calls and  dined at tables with tapered candles and, oh, how he savored the cheers, cheers  of sellout crowds in three World Series and in the Pittsburgh grandstands in  1984 when he led his league in fielding and finished second in batting.  </P> <P> "My, my, my," Lacy said, his face cradled in a smile of sweet memory.  </P> <P> Then, last year, after 1,523 major league games, 4,549 times at bat, 1,303  hits, 91 home runs, the Baltimore Orioles read the last rites over Leondaus  Lacy, outfielder.  </P> <P> "Somebody just told me, 'Sorry, Lee, goodby,' " Lacy said. "All he left out  was, 'May you rest in peace.' "  </P> <P> But Lee Lacy found no peace in the valley, a valley as dark as his prospects  for greatness had seemed back in the Oakland housing project where he was  raised.  </P> <P> At age 7, learning from older guys, he took a match to a tennis ball and burned  off the fuzz so it resembled a baseball. What he had lit was a career that  would blaze in glory and, at a time other professionals consider their prime,  end just as unexpectedly in ashes.  </P> <P> "I couldn't get over the shock of that," Lacy said. "I couldn't accept it. I  moped around. I felt lost. I was not a pleasant person. My wife and I started a  little telephone answering service, something to do, to feel worthwhile.  </P> <P> "But every night I prayed. I said, 'Lord, if there is any chance, any chance  that I can play baseball again, let it be."'  </P> <P> Lacy reflected on his fate one evening in late January just at nightfall, his  long legs stretched out in the aisle of his team's charter bus making its way  across southern Florida. Out the window he saw no bright lights, just a weary  landscape of flat brown canebrakes and dark flat swamps along arrow-straight  roads.  </P> <P> Was the answer to his prayer, then, really a minor Ephipany, a deliverance from  the Stygian twilight into one more moment in the sun? Or was it a cruel  prolonging of the inevitable agony?  </P> <P> "When they let me go," said Lacy, "I knew in my heart I could still play  baseball. Now I have proved, to my own satisfaction at least, that I was right.  When the time finally comes to toss it in I will know what to expect and will  accept it."  </P> <P> Accepting it apparently is more difficult for the superstars than for  journeymen athletes.  </P> <P> Brooks Robinson, who dazzled a nation of fans with his play at third base,  discovered, on retirement at age 40, that "the only thing worse than being down  and out is going up and down and out."  </P> <P> "The big thing," said Robinson, "is that you don't know what you're going to do  or where you're going to go. The single hardest thing about leaving is that  you're leaving a love, a passion. It was my whole life."  </P> <P> A few years later Robinson discovered another agony of a vanished hero.  </P> <P> On a visit to the Oakland A's clubhouse, wearing a suit and tie, a clubhouse  boy asked, "Who are you?"  </P> <P> "Brooks Robinson."  </P> <P> "Do you play ball?"  </P> <P> Most athletes try to hang onto the fringes of their sport, coaching, scouting,  selling equipment. Robinson and Harrah and Al Hrabosky, another big name on the  Tropics, got into broadcasting. But many of the former players, lesser lights,  put aside jobs as truck drivers or beer salesmen, or telephone answerers, to  rush headlong to the senior league.  </P> <P> Pete Broberg is a rarity. After pitching eight years in the majors, he went to  law school in 1978 at age 30 and began a new career. (He took a leave from his  practice in West Palm Beach to join the home team "so my children could see me  play the game I love so much.")  </P> <P> "Most players," Broberg said, "realize it would take them 20 years to learn to  do anything as well as they know how to play baseball.  </P> <P> "Most other professionals, lawyers, doctors, brokers, at age 35 or 40 are just  beginning to feel they are competent, at the top of their game, so to speak.  The same is true of athletes, at least mentally. Yet that's the age athletes  are told they're through. That's hard to cope with. That's the sadness."  </P> <P> Rick Wolff, the director of sports books for Macmillan, did a master's thesis  on the problems athletes face at career's end. He has developed a counseling  program which leads the athlete through the phases of denial, anger,  bargaining, depression and, finally, acceptance.  </P> <P> If the program sounds familiar it is because it is based on the model for  terminally ill people from the book "On Death and Dying."  </P> <P> At least one line from the Tropics' anthem "Back in the High Life Again" is as  true, it seems, as a called strike:  </P> <P>  "When you're born to run, it's so hard to just slow down."  </P> <P>  That's the real sadness.  </P></p>

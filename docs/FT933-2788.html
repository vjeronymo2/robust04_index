			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Commission cools debate on controls THE European Commission yesterday mounted a damage limitation exercise following the call by Mr Jacques Delors for new rules to combat speculative attacks on European currencies. Amid fears that Mr Delors was advocating the reimposition of capital controls, Brussels officials insisted that the Commission president's comments to the European Parliament had been misinterpreted. Mr Bruno Dethomas, chief spokesman, said: 'He was not calling for the reintroduction of capital controls, he was merely calling for a debate.' In his speech to MEPs in Strasbourg on Wednesday, Mr Delors likened currency movements to traffic. 'Cars are free to drive but they are subject to traffic rules. I see no reason why at international level we should not study means of limiting monetary traffic.' The European Commission usually avoids public comments on monetary matters for fear of upsetting the currency markets. But Mr Delors' call for measures to tighten controls on currency speculators has been echoed in recent weeks by the French and Belgian governments whose currencies have suffered from the upheaval in the European Monetary System. An EC official said Mr Delors wanted to strengthen the European Monetary System, possibly by 'changing the rules of the game' in foreign exchange trading. One idea would be to restrict the ability of financial institutions to take highly leveraged positions in the options and futures markets, possibly by requiring a deposit to be lodged during the transaction. 'There is a feeling that the forex markets are operating under less strict rules than, say, the commodity markets,' said one Brussels official. The matter is now to be examined in an internal Commission study. Another option raised by Mr Delors is to make use of the 'safeguard' clause under Article 3 of the EC capital movement directive. This allows a member state to impose protective measures for up to 180 days to deal with adverse currency movements affecting their exchange rate and monetary policies. However, these emergency measures, which are subject to approval of the European Commission and the opinions of the Community's monetary committee and central bank governors, have never been formally invoked. The temporary controls introduced last year by Ireland and Spain were invoked under special transitional arrangements under the capital movement directive, an EC official said. On Wednesday, Mr Delors suggested that it was preferable if the Twelve acted collectively to invoke safeguard measures rather than relying on individual member states to defend their currencies. This comment provoked much discussion within the Commission yesterday, with legal and monetary experts debating the degree to which Article 73 of the Maastricht treaty could sanction such collective action by qualified majority vote. The Delors speech suggests that the debate on how to rebuild and strengthen the EMS as a vehicle for European monetary union has just begun. Although the free-trading nations such as the UK, Germany and the Netherlands are adamantly opposed to any hint of new capital controls, there is wider support for tighter measures on the continent than might be imagined.</p>

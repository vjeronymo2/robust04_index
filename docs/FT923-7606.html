			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / International Company News: New European debit card player - The establishment of Europay International ONE of National Westminster Bank's most senior executives is to head a new inter-bank payments organisation being set up to create a new debit card for Europe and outflank debit card services offered by Visa International. Mr Ron Williams, NatWest's director for payment services, has been appointed as the first chief executive of Europay International, a card payment organisation to be formed through a merger of Eurocard International, the European affiliate of MasterCard, and Eurocheque International. Mr Williams is vice-chairman of the board of Eurocard, a consortium of European banks, led by the Big Three German banks. The main Eurocard banks are strongly opposed to the possible expansion of Visa International in Europe. In Germany and several other north European countries, Eurocard dominates the market and Visa has relatively few members and cards in circulation. This contrasts with the UK, where Visa has a larger number of cards and member-banks than the MasterCard/Eurocard network and all large banks belong to both Visa and MasterCard. Until recently, the Eurocard banks regarded paper Eurocheques, introduced in the 1960s, as the standard instrument for consumer payments. Europay is an attempt to establish a new card-based electronic point-of-sale payment instrument. The aim is to head off the challenge from Visa and give consumers a means of making payment by debit card across Europe. Europay will continue to issue Eurocheque products and Eurocards, but its main work will be to establish a standard European debit card branding which is likely to include all debit card products not linked to the Visa network. The new company comes into operation on September 1. Mr Williams says he expects around 90m European debit cards to be in the market by the end of 1993, about twice the number of Visa debit cards now in circulation. The emergence of the European debit card comes on the heels of plans by MasterCard International, the global credit card system which owns a 15 per cent stake in Eurocard, to launch a new debit card branding called Maestro in North America. Though Visa has offered debit cards, such as Barclays Connect, for several years, this is the first debit card in the MasterCard family. MasterCard has designed Maestro as a distinct card brand which can operate independently of its credit cards. A formal system of interchange fees, the commission paid by a retailer's bank to the cardholder's bank each time a card is used, has been established. The fee is a standard 1 per cent of the transaction for credit cards, but for Maestro it is expected to be around 0.5 per cent. The introduction of the fee is expected to arouse protests from retailers who claim the fees enable banks to operate a cartel on their card payment services. The European debit card will have its own branding, but it will will be linked to Maestro's global network and each European debit card will carry the Maestro logo on its reverse. Switch, the UK electronic debit card branding, is understood to be considering whether to link up with the European debit card.</p>

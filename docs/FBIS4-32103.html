			<p>BFN     [Text] At today's session in Mostar, the Chamber of  Deputies of the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna proposed Jadranko  Prlic, president of the government of the Croat republic of  Herceg-Bosna, as a vice president and minister of defense in the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federal Government. The chamber also  discussed President Kresimir Zubak's report on the latest round  of negotiations with the Serb side and government measures to  curb lawlessness in the Herceg- Bosna area. Zdenko Vranjes  reports:    [Vranjes] In addition to proposing Jadranko Prlic as a  candidate for the post of vice president and minister of  defense, the following were also put forward as candidates:  Neven Tomic as minister of finance, Mate Tadic as minister of  justice, Nikola Grabovac as minister of trade, and Stjepo Andric  as minister without portfolio. Two candidates are contesting  the post of minister for health care -- Vlado Simunovic and Ivan  Sarec. The deputies also adopted a list of deputy ministers  from the ranks of the Croat people in the federal government.    The constitutional amendments, including certain  alterations,  relating to the definition of mixed cantons were also adopted.  A draft law on ministries and some other documents that will be  placed on the agenda for a session of the federal parliament,  scheduled to take place on Wednesday in Sarajevo, were also  endorsed.    It seems that the big powers have agreed on  Bosnia-Herzegovina, and that they will not relinquish the  division of Bosnia at a 51-49 percent ratio, Kresimir Zubak,  president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, said when  presenting his report on the latest round of negotiations in  Geneva. He also spoke in detail about the contact group's  proposals; the division of Bosnia-Herzegovina, gray zones, and  blue roads. The Croatian side has been short-changed to some  degree in the areas of Teslic and Kotor Varos, while Muslim  interests have been fundamentally damaged in the area of eastern  Bosnia. The Muslim territories around Kljuc and Sanski Most may  be reduced as they will be designated as gray zones.    The Serbian side's demand for two power stations near Jajce  to be given to the Serbs has not been accepted, Zubak added.  Passages [pasaz] are now being mentioned instead of corridors,  Zubak said, and added that this Serb passage in Posavina would  run through Serb villages, so the whole of Derventa would be  included in a Croat canton. Only some Croat villages between  Brcko and Modrica would be included in the Serb passage.    The president of the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation said that  a blue road between Modrica and Bosanski Samac, via Jajce,  Kljuc, and Sanski Most had been discussed in Geneva as well as a  corridor between Livno and Bihac. Of the three draft political  solutions for Bosnia-Herzegovina the Croatian side regards the  solution that implies a confederation between the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation with Croatia as the most  acceptable, while at the same time the Serb part of  Bosnia-Herzegovina might have a similar arrangement with the  so-called Yugoslavia. If the Serb side refuses the contact  group's plan the federation will demand that the arms embargo be  lifted, Zubak added. The deputies also issued an appeal to the  Bosnia-Herzegovina Army and Fikret Abdic's forces to end their  clashes in western Bosnia and to seek a solution at the  negotiating table. The Croat side offers its services as a  mediator in their negotiations.    Tonight the Chamber of Deputies also adopted the  government's  measures to curb crime in the Herceg-Bosna area. The government  is duty-bound to submit to the deputies a report on the  implementation of these measures within one month. The deputies  demanded that in addition to measures to curb robberies along  the road over Mount Vran Planina, steps should also be taken to  either prove or dispell rumors circulating among people that the  criminal operations in Herceg-Bosna are being covered up by  elements within the top ranks of Herceg-Bosna's authorities or  that they themselves are involved in these operations. Speaking  about the onset of a fierce anticrime campaign, Kresimir Zubak  told the deputies that the Presidential Council has set up a  headquarters that will spearhead the fight against robberies and  crime.</p>

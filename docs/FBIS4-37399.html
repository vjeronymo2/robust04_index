			<p>BFN     [Text] A group of the heroes of the popular resistance in  the Abyan Governorate laid an ambush for the aggressive invaders  along the road from (Am'ayn) to al-Urqub. They succeeded in  destroying a military bus and killing all the soldiers in it.  This daring operation, carried out by our noble heroes from the  sons of the dauntless Abyan Governorate, came in the wake of the  spread of the popular resistance in all the areas of the Abyan  Governorate and in every area under the invaders' occupation.</p>

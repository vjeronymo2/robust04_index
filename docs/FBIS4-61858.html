			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Viktor Petrenko] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 10 May -- After an enforced 10-day break,  ZIL's assembly line resumed work today. The shutdown was caused  by financial difficulties arising from ZIL's inability to get  its consumers to pay off their arrears and to settle its own  debts with suppliers.    It is intended that in the next two months the car builders  will be able to maintain the pace of production -- 180 trucks  per day. Of course, the situation is not an easy one, ZIL deputy  engineer-in- chief Vladimir Nosov told the ITAR-TASS  correspondent.    Since the beginning of the year the workforce has been  working in a special mode -- a single four-day shift a week.  The works' debts to suppliers in April amounted to 60 billion  rubles, even though consumers owe the works even more.  Production has almost been halved. Last year ZIL made 108,000  trucks and, even though this year contracts were concluded for  159,000 trucks, ZIL executives believe that if business carries  on as it is now, ZIL will be able to sell only slightly over  50,000 trucks.    This is why an economic development program has been  prepared  now which, experts believe, will enable the recently formed "AMO  ZIL" joint-stock company to survive. Its' President Yevgeniy  Brakov said that it provides for legal and other measures to  return the debt owned by the consumers, primarily from Belarus,  Ukraine, and Kazakhstan. Today, 85,000 people are working at  the enterprise -- in the long-term it is planned to reduce this  to 60-65,000 and to close a number of unprofitable plants and  sections.    ZIL is also counting on its new technical policy: In  particular it is intended to considerably expand the range of  trucks both as regards horsepower and use. The first steps have  been taken: The production has been mastered of heavy-freight  truck-trailer combinations and tip-up trucks, before the end of  the year it is planned to manufacture a commercial batch of  these trucks with a load capacity of 2 - 2.5 tonnes. The  managers of the enterprise believe that this tactic will make it  possible to considerably increase the demand for ZIL products.</p>

			<p><P> March 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LACKING DIRECTION  </P> <P> Not only would Steinbeck have trouble writing about Cannery Row ("Even  Steinbeck Might Have Trouble Writing About Cannery Row Today," Feb. 18).  </P> <P> So did Phyllis J. Hanniver. She should have a better sense of the directions  and geography of the Monterey area, living as she does in Seaside. The Monterey  Aquarium is at the north, not south, end of Cannery Row. All the other  directions are also incorrect. To go east on David Avenue would put one in the  bay. I suppose, in a relative sense, one travels south along the coast from San  Francisco, but it would be a surprise to see the sun rise in the west, even in  a relative sense.  </P> <P> RICHARD BRAUN  </P> <P> Simi Valley  </P></p>

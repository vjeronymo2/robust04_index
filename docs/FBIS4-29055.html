			<p>BFN     [Text] Yangon [Rangoon], June 15 KYODO -- A large Japanese  economic delegation arrived in Yangon Wednesday [15 June] for  talks with Myanmarese [Burmese] leaders on promotion of  bilateral trade and Japanese investment.    The 50-member delegation led by Kazuo Haruna, chairman of  Marubeni Corp., represents the powerful Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren). Haruna is vice chairman of the  federation.    During a four-day visit, the mission will confer with Prime  Minister Gen. Than Shwe and other government and business  leaders on ways for Japan to help promote the country's  transition to a market economy, mission members said.

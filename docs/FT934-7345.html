			<p>931119 FT  19 NOV 93 / World Trade News: Salinas sees his big gamble vindicated PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas's huge gamble in embracing the North American Free Trade Agreement more than three years ago has been vindicated by the decision of the US House of Representatives to support the agreement, but the costs of ratification have been higher than he could have ever have imagined. The agreement - still to be ratified by the US and Mexican Senate but certain to be passed by both - is widely considered the most important economic and foreign policy initiative taken by Mr Salinas in his five-year administration, and possibly by any Mexican president in decades. The pact formally reverses generations of Mexican nationalism, and would in all likelihood lock in the pro-market economic reforms of the Salinas government for the fore seeable future. 'It is a turning point for Mexico,' says Lorenzo Zambrano, the chief executive of Cemex, the giant Mexican cement company. 'It guaran tees the change from a closed protected economy to an open, competitive one.' Other Mexicans see the treaty in almost metaphysical terms. 'Nafta buries the Mexican revolution,' says Mr Homero Aridjis, a poet and ecologist. 'It is the end of an epoch and a new economic revolution will start.' The agreement's approval would come as a personal boon to the president, who had staked much of his personal prestige on the treaty. It should also make next year's presidential election easier for Mexico's ruling party, from which Mr Salinas is prevented from standing. Rejection of the treaty would have played into the hands of the nationalist left, which has long criticised Mr Salinas' zeal in embracing the US and free trade in one fell swoop. The accord's passage is expected to have some short term economic benefits. 'This is good news for the economy,' said Mr Timothy Heyman, head of Baring Securities in Mexico City. 'It will increase investment, lower interest rates, and raise growth.' Nevertheless, despite the short-term optimism, few believe competition with the US will be easy. Mexican wages costs are about a fifth lower than the US, but productivity is much less. Many Mexican companies are already finding it tough to survive with average tariffs of more than 10 per cent. Some sectors, such as agriculture, are now largely closed to imports, but will be opened up under the agreement, and are expected to suffer. While the treaty should raise productivity and draw investment, inefficient businesses will likely fail. The process of industrial restructuring, which has been going on since Mexico joined Gatt in 1986, has already helped push unemployment up, and cut economic growth to an expected 1.1 per cent this year. The battle for Nafta's ratification has also been politically costly for Mexico's government, which has, for example, made last-minute concessions in sectors such as agriculture that it vowed not to make. The constant attacks on Mexico's authoritarian political system, abject poverty and corruption by US critics of Nafta have hurt the ruling party and Mr Salinas. In trying to persuade the US to support Nafta, Mr Salinas has given in to US pressure on one issue after another - on entry of Chinese or Cuban immigrants to Mexico, the results of local elections, and future increases in the country's minimum wage. But Nafta's passage should help Mexico in its quest to join the Organisation for Economic Development and Co-operation. By removing the cloud of uncertainty over the economy, the agreement should accelerate the process of Mexico gaining investment-grade status on its debt, a long-sought goal that would truly put travails of the debt crisis of the 1980s behind it.</p>

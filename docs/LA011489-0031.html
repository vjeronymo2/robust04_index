			<p><P> January 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HIS RECORD IS GREAT, EXCEPT FOR JANUARY  </P> <P> Before Trojan fans start placing "Bury Larry" bumper stickers on their cars,  they should look at the overall picture:  </P> <P>  -- Larry Smith is the only active Pac-10 coach to have an undefeated  conference record.  </P> <P>  -- He is the only active Pac-10 coach to have won 10 regular-season games.  </P> <P>  -- He is the only active Pac-10 coach to guide his team to consecutive Rose  Bowls in his first 2 seasons. (And before anyone moans about his Rose Bowl  record, remember that Terry Donahue was 0-2-1 in bowl games before his current  winning streak began.)  </P> <P>  -- Smith may have lost his last 2 games of the season, but wasn't there a  coach named Lou Holtz who had the same experience last season?  </P> <P> DAVID PAGE  </P> <P> Ventura  </P> <P> Editor's note: Holtz actually lost his last 3, to Penn State, Miami and Texas  A&amp;M in the Cotton Bowl.  </P></p>

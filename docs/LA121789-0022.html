			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUTRY EXHIBITION  </P> <P> In reference to John Vanderlyn's 1804 painting, "The Death of Jane McCrea,"  mentioned in William Wilson's Dec. 3 review of the Gene Autry Museum's "Native  Americans" exhibition:  </P> <P> Being born and raised very close to the site of Jane McCrea's death, I find it  appalling to read that "such images carry a subtext of the white man feeling  sexually threatened by Indian virility. . . ."  </P> <P> Anyone who knows Revolutionary War history knows that Jane McCrea wasn't raped  or sexually abused.  </P> <P> The point is that Jane McCrea's death aroused American fury and fear and  solidified those emotions. In time to come, an American army, swollen with  volunteers, who figured their own families might well meet the McCrea fate  despite British promises, defeated Gen. Burgoyne and forced his surrender in  1777.  </P> <P> PETE LIAPES  </P> <P> Running Springs, Calif.  </P></p>

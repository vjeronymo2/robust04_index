			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- A lot of people live in  worse circumstances than during the last few years of the Kadar  regime, yet the country should continue along the path that it  chose in 1990, Federation of Young Democrats [Fidesz] prime  ministerial candidate Viktor Orban told a forum of the Fidesz in  Szolnok on Tuesday [3 May].    Despite disillusionment and pessimism, the past four years  can by no way be regarded as wasted time. In this parliamentary  cycle the country made more progress than ever before in this  century, Orban said. If the politicians of the former regime  return after the elections, many people will be bitterly  disappointed again, the politician said.</p>

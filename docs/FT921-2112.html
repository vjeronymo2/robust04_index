			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / De Klerk to speed pace of reform in S Africa PRESIDENT FW de Klerk indicated yesterday that he would quicken the pace of constitutional reform in South Africa. Mr de Klerk, buoyed by the white electorate's overwhelming endorsement of negotiations with black leaders, said a sense of urgency and dynamic negotiation was needed to end any uncertainty about the country's political future. Echoing the need for rapid progress, Mr Nelson Mandela, the African National Congress president, urged Mr de Klerk to act quickly. Mr Mandela told a press conference in Cape Town: 'Our demand is that the interim government must be introduced this year, and we think that is possible.' Mr de Klerk, speaking in Cape Town after meeting Mr Pierre Trudeau, the former Canadian prime minister, declined to put a timetable on the reform process. 'The basis of negotiation is consensus so no one can say how long it will take,' said Mr de Klerk. But he made clear that Tuesday's referendum, in which 69 per cent of the white electorate voted for constitutional talks, had given impetus to the negotiations. Officials from the government and the ANC believe an interim government could be in place by the end of the year. The size of the 'yes' vote and the success of the national side in the World Cup cricket tournament in Australia, has left most of white South Africa feeling in better heart than it has for years. A sizeable exception to the rejoicing is represented by the parliamentary caucus of the right-wing Conservative party, for whom the referendum was a disaster. The caucus met yesterday to consider its strategy in the face of Tuesday's rebuff. Many observers expect a split in the party, which persuaded 31 per cent of whites to oppose reform - well below their expectations. Some Conservative MPs believe the party should now participate in constitutional talks, which so far it has boycotted. Mr Andries Treurnicht, the party leader, gave no clue yesterday of his plans, but warned that Mr de Klerk 'will be the victim of his own reform.'</p>

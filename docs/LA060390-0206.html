			<p><P> June 3, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> A CANDIDATE'S CHARACTER PLAYS A ROLE IN IRVINE MAYOR CAMPAIGN  </P> <P> Sharon Dumont (Letters, May 27) states that credentials are not as important as  moral character.  </P> <P> Who would disagree with that? However, she goes on to state that moral  character is the reason she is voting for Sally Ann Sheridan. Didn't Sheridan  testify under oath that she had a master's degree from Harvard, which she, in  fact, does not?  </P> <P> Are we becoming so cavalier toward untrue statements that we accept these  actions as not showing a lack of moral character?  </P> <P> What a sad statement on society's moral character.  </P> <P> PETE SNETSINGER  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

			<p>940824 FT  24 AUG 94 / French bank plans criminal charges Credit Lyonnais, the troubled state-owned French bank, yesterday confirmed that it was preparing criminal charges of financial impropriety against former executives of its loss-making associate company, International Bankers SA (IBSA). The bank's action is expected to take the form of a 'complaint against X', or persons unknown, a standard procedure in France to trigger an inquiry by an investigating magistrate who then decides what charges to bring. Mr Jean Peyrelevade, Credit Lyonnais' new president, said that if, in addition to the misjudgments at the bank, he uncovered serious impropriety, he would take legal action. On June 16 Mr Peyrelevade, told the French parliamentary inquiry into Credit Lyonnais that he had sacked 'two or three people' who had worked for IBSA, and warned that there may be grounds for criminal proceedings. Credit Lyonnais yesterday excluded any action against Mr Jean-Maxime Leveque, who after heading the Credit Lyonnais group in 1986-88 took over IBSA, originally a Luxembourg-based financial institution. When he switched IBSA's base to France in 1990, where most of its property lending was, Mr Leveque was required by Bank of France rules to have a French 'shareholder of reference'. He went to his successor at Credit Lyonnais, Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, who complied by taking 25 per cent in IBSA. But Credit Lyonnais' involvement in IBSA landed it with potential losses of around FFr3bn (Pounds 366m), according to Mr Peyrelevade, who called the investment 'an error of strategic character'. IBSA has largely been dismembered, with some of its assets transferred to another Credit Lyonnais subsidiary, Banque Colbert, and some FFr5bn of its doubtful property loans hived off with other bad Credit Lyonnais real estate loans into a special state-backed company. Credit Lyonnais is maintaining its pressure for repayment of loans. In addition to its theatrical legal tactics against Mr Bernard Tapie, the beleaguered entrepreneur, it has warned Mr Roger Hersant, the French publishing magnate, that it cannot renew loans falling due this autumn, including a FFr600m credit maturing in October.</p>

			<p>930120 FT  20 JAN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ecuador in a bind over EC banana quotas - Raymond Colitt reports on the looming crisis for growers and the national economy THE CRISIS provoked by the European Community's import restrictions on Latin American bananas is hitting home in Ecuador - making banana growers angry but largely helpless. In Ecuador an estimated 100,000 jobs are at stake with expected losses of up to USDollars 70m. Demonstrators dumped truck loads of bananas in front of the French embassy in Quito and burned the French flag in protest. About 2,000 banana producers, later rallying before the British and German embassies, where they met consulate personnel, also called on their government to develop an aggressive strategy of response and reprisal. Yet there is little the Ecuadorian government can do against the EC's decision, besides scouring international trade agreements for articles that might be used in support of official complaints. Even so, the minister of industry and commerce, Mr Mauricio Pinto, complained that Ecuador could do little against an economically powerful EC, whose decision was largely unilateral. 'At negotiations we were also left behind closed doors, looking through the keyhole to see what they (the EC) would decide next,' he said. In December the EC's agricultural ministers imposed a 2m tonne annual (down from 2.5m) quota on the importation of Latin American bananas, as well as a 20 per cent tariff. Sales exceeding the 2m tonne quota are subject to a 170 per cent tariff, equivalent to USDollars 1,050 per tonne. The National Assembly of Banana Growers and Mr Mariano Gonzalez, the minister of agriculture, accused the EC of preaching free trade while imposing restrictive measures. 'How are we supposed to pay foreign debt, reduce unemployment and fight drug trafficking, which is increasingly invading Europe,' they asked. Mr Ignacio Perez, under secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture, warned that what is happening today with the banana was a sign of what might happen in future with other commodities if Ecuador continued to be pushed aside by the great economic blocs. Nevertheless, Ecuador, the world's largest banana exporter, is not likely to institute any reprisal measures - these would affect other sectors of its economy more than they would hit the European Community. A joint Latin American response is expected when the president of the region's banana producing countries meet in Guayaquil, an Ecuador port, on February 10. 'More realistic than fighting the EC's decision,' says Mr Gonzalez, 'is for Ecuadorians to look for markets elsewhere and become more competitive.' Of the 2.5m tonnes of banana Ecuador exported in 1992, more than 40 per cent went to the EC. In the short term Ecuador has managed to sell 32,000 tonnes to Iran, but compared with its present 315,000 tonnes of surplus production, the country still faces a potential loss of USDollars 70m. The US, Ecuador's largest export market, is unlikely to absorb this surplus. The economy's dependence on bananas is significant. Of the 250,000 jobs that depend directly on the exportation of bananas 100,000 are in danger from the looming crisis. Another 1m Ecuadorians depend indirectly on the USDollars 600m industry, second only to petroleum as a source of hard currency. 'We've passed from a boom to a crisis in one day. While we had a bonanza until last year, this year is likely to see prices drop, the demand for higher quality increase, and the smaller banana producer marginalised,' an industry analyst said.</p>

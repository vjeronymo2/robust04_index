			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["DPRK FM Spokesman on Russia's Proposal for Multilateral </F> Negotiations"--KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the  Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea  gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA today about  the recent proposal of Russia for multilateral negotiations for  a solution to the nuclear problem on the Korean peninsula:    The Russian Foreign Ministry in a recent statement proposed  multilateral negotiations for dealing with the nuclear issue on  the Korean peninsula.    We affirmatively estimate the efforts of Russia to find a  solution through political negotiations, opposing "sanctions"  and pressure. But we fear that the Russian proposal for  multilateral negotiations might complicate the matter.    As for the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it is a  political and military problem which should be settled between  the DPRK and the United States first of all in view of its cause  and its nature.    The U.S. authorities themselves had already admitted this  and  responded to DPRK-U.S. talks. The United States published a  joint statement with the DPRK, admitted the reasonableness of  the DPRK's proposal for a package deal and agreed to immediate  steps of simultaneous action.    But the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean  peninsula  is ungergoing twists and turns, without progress yet, because  the United States, after reaching an agreement at the  negotiating table with the DPRK, arbitrarily reversed the agreed  points, setting unreasonable preconditions outside the  conference room.    It wholly depends on the attitude of the United States how  the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula would be settled in  the future.    If Russia wants to contribute to the solution of the nuclear  issue, it would be more suitable to the prevailing situation for  it to exert its influence on the United States so that the  latter may honestly implement the points of its agreement with  the DPRK and observe the principle of impartiality, we think.</p>

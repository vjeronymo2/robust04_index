			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by B.I.W. and P.W.R.: "`Solidarity' Before Talks </F> With Pawlak; Either Success or Protest"]    [Text] Members of the National Committee [KK] of  "Solidarity" ["S"] are dissatisfied with the course of the  strike action that has been carried out so far. At a session of  KK it was stressed, among other things, that the protests are  not sufficiently coordinated and that they started at the wrong  time. However, the trade union does not intend to abandon the  action, because it can see that the strikes "are softening" the  government. If the talks with Prime Minister Pawlak, scheduled  to be held on Friday [18 March], end up in failure, "S" might  stage a one-day general strike. The greater part of the KK  session was closed to the press.  <H5>  To Be There Before Spychalska </H5>   "S" Head Marian Krzaklewski said that it would be enough if  the talk with the prime minister lasted the scheduled one hour,  or even 15 minutes, if Pawlak says that he will implement the  "S" demands. If not, there is too little time.    An hour after the meeting with Krzaklewski, the prime  minister has an appointment to meet with Ewa Spychalska,  chairperson of the All-Polish Trade Union's Agreement. It can  be expected that the "S" chairman will want to avoid a  troublesome meeting.    The heads of all the regions and branches are supposed to  wait in Warsaw for the results of the meeting with the prime  minister. Should the negotiations end up in failure, "S" will  organize a mass protest, declares Krzaklewski. Asked whether  lignite mines will also participate in the action, he said that  he did not know that yet, but he was just leaving for a meeting  with the Strike Committee. The Lignite Section (its plants  supply 50 percent of the country's energy) does not exclude the  possibility of strikes if the government accepts the new popiwek  [tax on excessive wage increases] bill. The union decided to  start the sixth collective bargaining session with the  government. This time the problem is the fact that the "Pact on  Enterprise" is not being implemented.  <H5>  "S" Pickets in Front of the Sejm </H5>   At 0830 today, "S" will start picketing the Sejm building,  protesting the new popiwek bill. According to preliminary  estimates of "S," participating in the protest throughout  Thursday will be approximately 3,000 people, not counting the  inhabitants of Warsaw. "S" announces that the picket will end  only after the bill is either adopted or rejected.    Union members warned the picket participants to keep special  calm, because on Thursday afternoon they would have to meet in  front of the parliament building with the demonstration of the  Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, protesting the  metropolitan Warsaw bill.    Between 0800 and 1200, as part of the "S" action, gas  stations will not be selling gasoline in Bialystok Voivodship.  Gasoline will only be sold to ambulances, fire brigade  vehicles, and so on. On strike will also be the Rzeszow and  Radom Regions -- the 2,000-person work force of the "Radoskor"  is supposed to stop working for two hours.    Yesterday, local transportation workers in Katowice and  several dozen plants in the Bydgoszcz region were on strike.    KK adopted the budget for the first six months. The union's  receipts in that period (17.5 billion zlotys) will equal  outlays. The greatest amount of money comes from dues -- 13  billion zlotys; it spends the greatest amount on salaries for KK  members -- 5 billion. The union has also earmarked some money  for the organization of the congress -- 1 billion zlotys, and  for the work of the Constitutional Committee ("S" plus  extra-parliamentary center-rightist groupings) -- 140 million  zlotys. The budget was criticized, among other people, by  Mazowsze Region Head Maciej Jankowski, because too little money  was allocated for the organization of demonstrations and  training.    "S" is indignant at the violation of human rights in China  and will forward a letter to that government, in which it will  demand that political prisoners be released. Signatures of "S"  members will be collected on the letter. The union also  criticized the behavior of the Polish delegation to the United  Nations during voting on the resolution condemning human rights  violations in China.    The next congress of the union will be held in Mielec.</p>

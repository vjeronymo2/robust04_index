			<p>940730 FT  30 JUL 94 / Pension members win costs ruling Members of pension schemes taking legal action over alleged mishandling of fund assets were placed in a stronger position yesterday by a Court of Appeal ruling that they can be awarded costs from pension funds before cases reach court. Three judges upheld a High Court decision granting a 'pre-emptive costs order' to the beneficiaries of the pension scheme run by Melton Medes, a trading conglomerate. The members allege fund assets were improperly handled when a Pounds 5m loan was made from the fund to the company and later repaid. They are claiming Pounds 7m compensation. The members have argued they could not pursue their case without the costs order applied for after their union, the GPMU print union, had to stop funding the action. In reaching their decision the judges made clear they were responding to concerns expressed by the pension law review committee headed by Professor Roy Goode. The committee had called on the judiciary to set clear guidelines for pre-emptive costs orders for pension case litigants. Concern has centred on the inability of pension fund members to bring legal action when they are ineligible for legal aid. Lord Justice Hoffman warned that their decision might not be confined to pension cases and could have implications for all trust litigation.</p>

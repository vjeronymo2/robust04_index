			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Compromise agreed over police shake-up plan MINISTERS have agreed a compromise over proposals by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, which would have led to a radical reorganisation of the police service at the expense of local councils. Mr Clarke's original plans would have shifted all police funding to Whitehall, and elected councillors would have lost their majority on police authorities. Compromise proposals, expected to be announced next week, will ensure that there is a continuing role for councillors. They are expected to retain about half the places on police authorities. The others will be filled by Home Office appointees, taking account of ministers' desire to see the business community more involved in running the police. There are also signs that the 43 police forces in England and Wales will not immediately be halved in number. Mr Clarke is likely to underline that the proposed power to merge police forces should be exercised only after consultation. Chief constables meeting at an Association of Chief Police Officers seminar yesterday said that it would be 'madness' for Mr Clarke to change police force boundaries in advance of the forthcoming local government reorganisation. They called for any eventual reorganisation to be based on a level-headed business case rather than 'unquantified gut feelings'. Although the chief constables accepted the case for additional members of the public serving on police authorities, they said the link with elected members of local authorities must not be lost. 'Officers serve the people, not the state,' said Mr John Burrow, Acpo president, after the meeting.</p>

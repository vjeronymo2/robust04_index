			<p><P> January 19, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ART BUCHWALD: WHAT A WONDERFUL PLOT FOR A MOVIE!  </P> <P> It was just eight years ago when the head of Warner Brothers studios called me  in and said, "We're going to shoot a movie about a President of the United  States in Washington."  </P> <P> "Great," I replied. "Who will play the title role?"  </P> <P> "I wanted Mickey Rooney, but he's not available. What do you think of Ronald  Reagan?"  </P> <P> "You've got to be kidding. He only plays nice guys."  </P> <P> "That's what everyone says. But suppose we had a President of the United States  who really was a nice guy -- even nicer than his best friend Jimmy Stewart. I  want to cast Nancy Davis as Ron's wife and create a helluva wardrobe for her.  This picture is going to have glitz."  </P> <P> "The audiences are dying for glitz," I told him.  </P> <P> He stood up from behind his desk and started pacing. "At the opening of the  film I see Ronnie riding his horse right up to the front door of the White  House, and the horse knocking on it with his hoof. All the servants are lined  up and the head butler smiles and says, 'Welcome home, Mr. President. Your room  is this way.' "  </P> <P> "That's all well and good," I said. "But what's the story?"  </P> <P> The studio head slapped himself on the thigh with a riding crop.  </P> <P> "Ron has come to Washington to root out waste and corruption in government,  something the people there don't understand. But his strong leadership prevails  and before he is finished, half of his own staff has either been fired or  indicted."  </P> <P> "That is a good start."  </P> <P> "In the meantime, I'm going to have Nancy turning up at all of Ronnie's  meetings, in different outfits, yelling at everyone she meets, 'Just say no.' "  </P> <P> "But where does that lead?" I asked.  </P> <P> "As the story unfolds, the plot poses the question, 'Can a nice guy spend eight  years in the White House without becoming disenchanted with the government?' "  </P> <P> "Does Ron have a crisis of confidence?"  </P> <P> "Yes, he does. When underlings, led by a Marine lieutenant colonel try to  end-run the Oval Office and set up their own clandestine operation with the  Iranians, Ronnie deals with it as a President should."  </P> <P> "How's that?"  </P> <P> "He says he doesn't know anything about it."  </P> <P> "Is that the major plot of the film?"  </P> <P> "No. The real story is that Ron makes up with the Russians."  </P> <P> "Nobody is going to believe that. Reagan hates the Commies."  </P> <P> "That's the beauty of the plot. Ronnie, a man who detests Communists, finds  good in all of them. We have a big scene on top of the Kremlin wall when Ron  and Nancy embrace Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife, Raisa, as the Soviet troops  march by in the May Day parade."  </P> <P> "I thought Brezhnev was in charge of the U.S.S.R."  </P> <P> "In the picture we're changing his name to Gorbachev, and making the Russian  leader much younger for dramatic effect."  </P> <P> "It's a good script, but there doesn't appear to be any conflict in it. When  does Ron stand up and fight?"  </P> <P> "He doesn't -- but Nancy does. This movie portrays the struggle between two  strong-willed women trying to protect their men. I want to have a hair-pulling  fight between Nancy and Raisa in front of Lenin's Tomb."  </P> <P> "It sounds fine to me. How much will this production cost?"  </P> <P> He replied, "Would you believe a trillion dollars?"  </P></p>

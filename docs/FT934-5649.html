			<p>931129 FT  29 NOV 93 / 'I am not a conman, I am a very capable salesman' Mr Roger Levitt, former chairman of the collapsed Levitt Group, yesterday emerged after a lunch of hot salt beef and chips from his wife's house in St John's Wood, London, to express his joy about the 180 hours of community service given him last week. 'I am absolutely delighted to be free. This is the first day with my family when we feel a little bit of security. They have got their dad home for Christmas and I am very pleased to be with them,' he said. In December 1990, Mr Levitt filed for personal bankruptcy and his financial services group collapsed with debts of Pounds 34m. When asked whether the sentence was too lenient - the offence for which he pleaded guilty carries a maximum sentence of seven years' imprisonment - he said the result of the court case spoke for itself. 'If the judge and prosecution thought I should have gone to prison, I guess that is what would have happened. The judge and prosecution were marvellous. They are nice people and justice was seen to be done,' he said. 'I am not a conman, I am a very capable salesman,' Mr Levitt added. 'I was most unlucky to lose a Pounds 150m business.' Last week, eight days into his Old Bailey trial, Mr Levitt unexpectedly pleaded guilty to a charge of fraudulent trading. The Serious Fraud Office had in return agreed not to proceed with 21 other charges, including false accounting, forgery and obtaining property and services by deception. Mr Levitt said his probation officer had scheduled a meeting with community services for tomorrow. 'I will do whatever is required of me. With a strong heart, I will endeavour to do my best and show my decency to society. I shall enjoy helping the youth of the country. I shall do more than 180 hours. I have always been very charitable.' As for the future, he said he was looking at various areas of business. 'You can be assured I will be back in business.' Mr Levitt added that he had received a great deal of public support. 'Once the verdict went in my favour, it was amazing how many friends came out of the woodwork to say 'Well done Roger'.'</p>

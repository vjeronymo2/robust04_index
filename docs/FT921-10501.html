			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Krupp wins Iran plant contract KRUPP Koppers, part of the German industrial conglomerate, has won the main work on a DM450m (Pounds 156.7m) project at Bandar Imam Khomeini, the big Iranian petrochemical complex which was damaged in the Iran-Iraq war, writes Andrew Baxter. The Essen-based company has been awarded a turnkey contract for a vinyl chloride monomer plant. In a second agreement, a consortium lead by Krupp Koppers and including Klockner Industrie-Anlagen of Duisburg will build a turnkey polyvinyl chloride plant. Financing of the orders, awarded by Tehran-based Bandar Imam Petrochemical, will come from Germany and Italy. They provide more evidence of the resurgence of infrastructure spending in Iran, which has also led to recent orders for western-manufactured power equipment. Construction is expected to begin later this year, with the VC and PVC plants coming on stream 24 and 28 months, respectively, after the agreements come into effect. The complex will produce 175,000 tonnes of PVC a year from ethylene and chlorine. A modern process devised by Huls, the German chemicals company, will be used to produce a range of plastic products from the vinyl chloride. Krupp said this would lead to a further increase in demand for machinery and plants for the plastic processing industry in Iran.</p>

			<p>940326 FT  26 MAR 94 / International Company News: BHP earnings advance to ADollars 284.2m in third period Broken Hill Proprietary, Australia's largest industrial company, posted an after-tax profit of ADollars 284.2m (USDollars 203m) for its third quarter. The group was lifted by a continuing improvement in its steel division and a record result from mineral interests. The figure compares with ADollars 225.9m in the same period of 1992-93, and is scored on revenues of ADollars 4.08bn, against ADollars 4.09bn. It means that BHP has earned ADollars 924.2m after tax in the nine months ended February, compared with ADollars 727.7m at the same stage a year ago. Undiluted earnings per share, for the first three quarters, stood at 69.1 cents, up from 56.6 cents last time. In operating profit terms, after tax but before finance charges, the minerals division saw a 10.9 per cent advance, to ADollars 209.2m. BHP said the record figure was due to the consolidation of results from the Ok Tedi mine in Papau New Guinea - which performed strongly after shipments were resumed in December following the local drought - and to higher shipments of copper, manganese, Indonesian and western US coal. The exchange rate with the US dollar, after hedging, was helpful, although lower realised prices for most commodities partially offset this bene-fit. A rise in the domestic market helped profits in the steel division, as did lower unit costs resulting from higher production levels and cost-cutting programmes. The division made ADollars 103.5m, compared with ADollars 39.3m last time. The petroleum business, hit by falling oil prices but benefiting from a lower Australian tax rate, contributed ADollars 114.7m, an 8.1 per cent increase - although results for last year were affected by losses on the disposal of US gas properties. The service companies made ADollars 13.1m against ADollars 10.1m. For the group overall, interest charges fell to ADollars 60.7m, compared with ADollars 77.2m in the third quarter of 1992-93.</p>

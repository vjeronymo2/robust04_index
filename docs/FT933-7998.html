			<p>930818 FT  18 AUG 93 / SE Banken launches rights and drops request for aid SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's leading commercial bank, has withdrawn its request for state support after yesterday disclosing plans to raise SKr5.3bn (Pounds 440m) through the largest rights issue in Swedish banking history. 'The crisis for the bank is over,' said Mr Bjorn Svedberg, chief executive. Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister, welcomed the bank's decision to withdraw its application for state support as 'good for taxpayers, good for SE Banken and good for confidence in the Swedish economy.' The bank also announced a return to profit in the second quarter and the first fall in loan losses since it plunged into crisis last year. The performance was seen as a sign that the worst is behind Sweden's banking sector, which has been ravaged by huge losses. SE Banken said it was withdrawing its request for state aid because it no longer felt in danger of falling through minimum capital adequacy requirements - a turnround from February when it first applied for help. In the second quarter the group made SKr310m. This restricted the first-half loss to SKr298m, SKr2.2bn lower than in the same period of 1992 and much less than analysts had predicted. Operating profits before lending losses rose 58 per cent to SKr4.85bn, while credit losses fell 8 per cent to SKr5.15bn. Net problem loans fell to SKr22.5bn, or 7.4 per cent of overall lending, compared with SKr28.8bn, or 7.9 per cent of lending last year. The bank's capital ratio has risen to 9.1 per cent, compared with 8.4 per cent on December 31. It is now comfortably above the 8 per cent minimum. Shares are being offered on a one-for-one basis at a deeply discounted price of SKr20 per share. Many of the bank's leading shareholders, including the Wallenberg family which holds 7 per cent, have indicated support. Yesterday's disclosures sent the bank's shares up a further 11.5 per cent to SKr78.5, against SKr7 in April. Lex, Page 18</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 13 (AFP) -- Two inspectors from the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) were pursuing their  mission in North Korea normally Monday [13 June], following  early threats by Pyongyang authorities to expel them, IAEA  spokesman David Kyd said.    He said the Agency had received no word from North Korean  authorities Monday, which led IAEA officials to believe that  "for the time being" there was no reason to think the inspectors  would be expelled.    Yun Ho-chin, spokesman for Pyongyang's Vienna embassy, said  Friday North Korea would take "adequate retaliatory measures"  following an IAEA vote that day to suspend technical aid to  North Korea in an escalating row over North Korea's refusal to  meet international demands for inspection of its nuclear  facilities.    Yun said that North Korea's retaliatary measures could  include the expulsion of IAEA inspectors from North Korea, a ban  on all verification procedures, and a possible withdrawal of  North Korea from the IAEA and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation  Treaty.    But Kyd said no official message had reached the IAEA  headquarters and its two inspectors were currently observing  8,000 spent fuel rods removed from the 5-megawatt Yongbyon  experimental nuclear reactor.    The inspectors were not allowed to take samples from the  rods.    The IAEA and Washington believe that Pyongyang has  restricted  the inspection of the reactor in order to conceal alleged  diversion of nuclear material to an atomic weapons programme.    Kyd said last Friday's IAEA resolution condemning North  Korea  for refusing to abide by its safeguards had been forwarded to  the UN Security Council.    He added that he expected the analysis of samples taken in  May from a radio-chemical laboratory at Yongbyon to be available  by the end of June.</p>

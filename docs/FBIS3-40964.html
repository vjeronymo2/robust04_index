Recently, we have  learned why "Konza" protected itself from excessive public  scrutiny. After its inception, "Konza" created a territorial  innovation center called "Agrotekhnopark" in Brody, Lvov Oblast.  This center was established at a former missile base with an  area of 320 hectares. The base is located in a fenced-in patch  of forest and includes a three-story former command post, a  two-story former headquarters building, two-story hotel, seven  military barracks, privates' and officers' canteens, a medical  center, enormous depots, a sauna, garages, and other facilities  which can ensure maintenance of this huge military center.  [passage omitted]    A document was signed to hand over this former military base  to "Konza" and the site is currently protected by some 40  guards. In the opinion of People's Deputy Chobit, Ukrainian  President Kravchuk should initiate an official investigation  into this case because, at the beginning, it was presumed that  the base would be turned over to the National Guard of Ukraine.  So, why has "Konza" become the proprietor of this facility?  Why has the former military base not been sold at auction? Why  has "Konza" completed this deal so hastily?</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Foreign Ministry and official and unofficial  circles in Yemen have received with intense pain and indignation  the news of the egregious crime perpetrated this morning by a  member of the Zionist gangs in the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron  against innocent worshippers, of whom over 60 were killed and  300 wounded.    The Foreign Ministry appeals to the international community  to act to halt such terrorist acts, and condemns the Zionist  authorities for obstructing the transfer of the wounded to  hosptials. The Foreign Ministry calls on the community of  nations to press for bringing pressure to bear in the interest  of Israel's withdrawal from the occupied Arab territories.</p>

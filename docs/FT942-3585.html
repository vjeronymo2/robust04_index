			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Leading Article: Councils and the Concorde fallacy The Concorde fallacy is the name given to the belief that it is a waste of money to pull the plug on a project once you have invested a lot in it. The Anglo-French supersonic aircraft swallowed huge sums of public money long after it became clear that it would never yield a profit. Local government reorganisation in England has become the political equivalent of the fallacy, with the government unwilling to stop a process that can only increase its unpopularity. The government has contracted out the process to a quango, the Local Government Commission chaired by Sir John Banham. It hoped to see the present two-tier structure of local government outside the big cities replaced with single-tier unitary authorities. The commission would do the legwork, producing proposals for each area tailored to local needs. Unfortunately it has not been that simple. The commission has produced widely differing proposals, ranging from no change to complicated permutations of unitary and two-tier authorities. Some of the commission's recommendations have been welcomed. The restoration of tiny Rutland, swallowed by Leicestershire in 1974, has gladdened the hearts of the 33,000 residents even though it could add as much as Pounds 125 a year to their council tax bills. But proposals that involve abolishing or shrinking historic shire counties have produced intense opposition. Business fears that it will have to deal with a multiplicity of authorities that are too small to think strategically. MPs and councillors feel that the abolition of counties with records for modestly efficient administration is unlikely to improve the quality of local government. Heavyweight support Opponents of reorganisation have received heavyweight support from a recent Audit Commission report on the likely costs. The local authority watchdog warned that new authorities might inherit depleted reserves and high spending commitments. During the 1974 reorganisation of local government, the building of new municipal swimming pools ran at three times the normal annual level. Councils facing abolition find the spending of reserves on tangible memorials irresistible. The form of the reorganisation might have been designed to increase costs. Where unitary authorities are created, each must employ managers to deliver the services previously provided by a single county - instead of one education director, there will be several. And since most of the new unitary authorities will be larger than existing districts, merger costs will be substantial. There is unlikely to be much change left out of Pounds 1bn for the costs of the shake-up. Since reorganisation will happen in the run-up to the next general election, backbench MPs fear that they will pay the price. Put on ice Reorganisation also threatens attempts to improve the management of local services, according to the Audit Commission. Managers are already devoting their time to chasing top posts after reorganisation. Policies such as compulsory competitive tendering - responsible for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local services - are being put on ice during the transition. Local government needs to be able to act strategically, deliver local services responsively and be locally accountable. A two-tier structure is the best way to achieve this, with larger strategic county councils and smaller districts to provide services. The single-tier authorities emerging from the Banham commission seem too large to be truly local. Yet they will be too small to handle strategic functions which will have to be passed to joint boards and quangos. The outcome will be more bureaucracy and less accountability. It will not be easy for the government to call a halt to local government reorganisation. Opportunities to do this at an earlier stage were foolishly rejected last year. Now even more political capital has been sunk in the project. There is a case for unitary status for a few larger cities such as Leicester and Bristol and for abolishing unpopular new counties such as Avon and Cleveland. But in the rest of the country, scrapping reorganisation would produce a huge cheer and a welcome setback for the Concorde fallacy.</p>

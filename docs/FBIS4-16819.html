			<p>BFN     [Text] Preparations for the ratification of the START-2  treaty signed on January 3 will be the focus of a meeting  between a number of committees of the Russian State Duma and two  U.S. senators, Sam Nunn and Richard Lugar, coming to Moscow in  mid-May, the defense committee chairperson, Sergey Yushenkov,  told a State Duma session Tuesday.    The session was told that the ratification of START-2 should  follow the enacting of its predecessor, START-1, signed on July  31 1991.    Despite the fact that the treaty has already been ratified  by  Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan since the break-up of  the Soviet Union, it will come into force only after the  exchange of ratification letters with the USA. The session was  told that the process is hindered by Ukraine where "political  struggle for this or that status as a nuclear state is going  on," according to the head of the disarmament department of the  Russian Foreign Ministry, Oleg Sokolov.    As many as 3,800-4,250 nuclear ammo will be destroyed during  the first stage of the START-2 treaty's implementation, which  will last for seven years -- the same as the START-1 treaty.  Another 3,000- 3,500 items of nuclear ammunition will be  destroyed during the second stage which will last until 2003.</p>

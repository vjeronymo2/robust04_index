			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Observer: Best-seller in exile Forget Terry Smith, the sacked head of research at UBS Philips &amp; Drew and his book Accounting for Growth. When it comes to publishing runaway financial best-sellers, Peter Tasker can show Smith a clean pair of heels any day. The head of research at Kleinwort Benson's Tokyo office is already on to his third successful book (written in Japanese, to boot), and without a cross word from his employers - so far, anyway. Having spent the last 10 of his 36 years in Tokyo, he has won the rare distinction of getting both a novel and a serious non-fiction work in the Japanese best-seller list within 12 months of one another. Sales of his End of the Japanese Golden Era have topped 80,000 copies, and his first novel Silent Thunder has sold 35,000 and is now being published in English. As financial-thriller writers go, he places himself somewhere between new life peer Jeffrey Archer and Paul Erdman. He says he's more serious than the noble lord, but not quite so well qualified as Erdman, who penned his first work in a Swiss jail after trying to corner the world cocoa market for a Californian bank. Like most money-mystery spinners, Tasker draws heavily on real life models for his characters. For instance, Silent Thunder features a big securities firm which gets up to much hanky-panky, a Japanese prime minister who is deposed by right-wing radicals, and a Japan-bashing American senator with his eye on the US presidency. There is also plenty of sex, and no lack of MOF officials getting 'rubbed out'. The story, however, also has its serious side - the radicalisation of trade frictions between Japan and its trading partners. 'It is something that could happen,' Tasker warns. He should know. He is ranked as the number one strategist by Japanese institutions.</p>

Gonzalez thus denied that the government could accede  to the People's Party's desire to renew the RTVE board of  directors in return for the People's Party's allowing the  filling of vacancies in the judiciary body -- the General  Council of the Judiciary [CGPJ] -- and that of the ombudsman.    On the course of the above-mentioned negotiations, the prime  minister said during his joint appearance with Argentine  President Carlos Menem: "I am interested in an agreement, and  since I am interested, I wish to create no declarative obstacle  or obstructive declaration, so I will be cautious. I believe  that the filling of posts in bodies such as the CGPJ or that of  the ombudsman is not interchangeable with the discussion on how  Spanish Television should operate. I am also prepared to change  radically the RTVE charter, and for there to be a completely  different board of directors. So I am completely open to  negotiation, but it seems to me that the need to fill the  vacancies in the judiciary bodies or that of the ombudsman  cannot be lumped together with it."  <H5>  New Executive Committee </H5>   In government circles it is asserted that the government is  prepared to accept that the RTVE parliamentary oversight  committee must confirm the appointment of the public  corporation's director general, who is appointed by the  government itself. In addition, Gonzalez also gave a new clue  to his ideas on the future PSOE leadership, in asserting that  the current incompatibilities, which now limit -- and more so,  if many of the amendments put forward for debate at the party  congress succeed -- the prospects of, among others, the members  of the government and regional leaders attaining the Executive  Committee group, should be annulled. "I believe," he stated,  "that the incompatibilities should be those laid down by the law  on a general basis for all citizens, and, within the parties'  functioning, the minimum ones in order to ensure that they are  observed. Therefore, I would abolish even the incompatibility  which exists right now between holding public office and the  so-called area secretaries in the Executive Committee (or  between a regional organizational post and a national  organizational post)."    With respect to the existence or otherwise of profound  differences between Guerraists and renewalists, with a view to  the federal congress, Gonzalez denied "that there are major  ideological differences. Ideologically distant stances are  sometimes sought because there are personal disagreements, which  are wrapped up with ideas." "But I believe," he added, "that  there are no major ideological differences. There is a lively  debate on some aspects which are very specific, such as the  welfare state in a modern society or the role played by  enterprises' competitiveness. I claim," he stated, "the right  to be able to promote enterprises' competitiveness from a  progressive stance, and for that to be introduced absolutely  naturally and smoothly into social democratic language, since it  must be modernized."    With respect to the High Court of Justice of Catalonia's  ruling on the use of Catalan in education, the prime minister  said that he respects it. "I believe," he added, "that it will  pose no especially delicate problem, either of relations (with  Convergence and Union) or, of course, of implementation. It is  certainly a ruling which everybody will be prepared to  implement."</p>

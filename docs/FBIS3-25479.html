			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Freedom Alliance has indicated that the proposed  amendments to the interim constitution are inadequate and the  alliance will not participate in the election. Alliance  Chairman Rowan Cronje said in Pretoria, after a meeting of the  executive of the alliance, that the concession on the double  ballot was welcome. However, there was still no autonomy for  regions to impose taxes, and no guarantee of a volkstaat  [homeland]. Concessions on the entrenchment of provincial  powers were also insufficient.</p>

			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / UK Company News: CALA in black after two years of losses AFTER TWO years in the red, a strong recovery in the second half enabled CALA Group, the housebuilder, to report a pre-tax profit of Pounds 226,000 for the year to end-June. Mr Geoffrey Ball, chairman, said the outcome - which compared with a deficit of Pounds 980,000 last time - had been struck after write-downs totalling Pounds 1.1m to reflect the fall in the value of housebuilding land and of the group's remaining property interests. Turnover was up by Pounds 3m to Pounds 69.2m and after a tax credit of of Pounds 476,000, arising from the recovery of ACT written off last year, earnings per share worked through at 1.98p (3.44p losses). As forecast, there is a final dividend of 1.55p (1.15p) to maintain the total at 2.3p. Net borrowings were reduced by Pounds 4.8m during the period and stood at Pounds 11.1m at the year end, said Mr Ball, while significant progress had been made in reducing overheads - down from Pounds 9.9m to Pounds 7.1m over the past three years. The group's three housebuilding businesses sold a total of 676 units during the year at an average price of Pounds 122,000 - compared with 604 units at an average Pounds 114,000 last year. However, the commercial property market had deteriorated further from its already depressed state, Mr Ball said, and the group's programme of disposals had been at a much slower pace than had been hoped.</p>

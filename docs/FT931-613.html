			<p>930329 FT  29 MAR 93 / Management: It takes a lot to be a superstar - Martin Dickson considers the ambitious wish-list drawn up by IBM in its hunt for a chief executive Call it the International Business Machines superstar wish-list. When directors of the troubled computer company began looking for a new chief executive last January, they spent a great deal of time discussing the most desirable characteristics of the leader to replace Mr John Akers, who is retiring early because of the group's poor performance. They finally fixed on a list of 11 qualities, says Mr James Burke, the non-executive director in charge of what turned into the most closely watched executive hunt in American business history. Last Friday he disclosed the contents of the list, partly to help justify IBM's announcement that it had given the job to a man without a high technology background - Mr Lou Gerstner, the chairman and chief executive of food and tobacco group R J R Nabisco. In an interview with the FT, Mr Burke pointed out that only one item on the list referred to technology, and then with a qualification: 'Information and high technology industry experience highly desirable, says the note, but not averse to considering extraordinary business leaders.' Mr Burke added that in his view IBM's problem is that 'it is not run as much like a business as it needs to be'. In these circumstances, 'I think I would take a highly successful, tough-minded, strategic thinking businessman ahead of a technologist any day. 'There's all the technology . . . that they need in this company. A lot of it gets insulated and isolated from the customers' needs, and finding a way to bring those together is going to be a major challenge and opportunity.' However, in spite of his remarks, industry rumours persist that several of the other candidates on IBM's short-list, who did come from a computer industry background, may have turned the company down before it began serious negotiations with Mr Gerstner. Whatever the case, controversy seems certain to rumble on for months between those in the computer industry who think IBM's problems can be fixed by a well-qualified general manager like Mr Gerstner, and those who believe it is extremely hard for someone without a computer background to make the hard choices facing IBM on technology strategy. The computer industry is changing at phenomenal speed, with shortening product cycles. The technology issue apart, the other 10 items on the IBM wish-list are also interesting for the light they shed on the company's perception of its own weaknesses and the qualities desirable in a leader of a global business in the 1990s. Customer orientation is prominent on the list, which is hardly surprising, since focusing relentlessly on customer satisfaction lies at the heart of most modern management theories. But it is much easier to religiously intone this piece of jargon that it is to execute it. IBM itself has for years now been expressing a determination to get closer to the customer, but without much success. 'This company,' says Mr Burke, 'used to be the best there was at . . . satisfying customer needs. Its still pretty good in a lot of areas, but it's got to be a lot better.' Mr Gerstner, as a former IBM customer himself, may bring a new perspective to the problem. IBM's failure to anticipate market trends sufficiently quickly prompted Mr Akers to reorganise the business last year into more autonomous units, which might react more nimbly to customer needs. Mr Gerstner, who has a history of decentralisation, seems likely to accelerate the trend. International experience. This is clearly a vital quality for the leader of any large, multinational business such as IBM, particularly as global markets become more and more inter-connected. Mr Gerstner has not lived abroad in senior management positions, but he has had plenty of international experience. As president of American Express he ran a business which is about as omnipresent around the world as IBM. Decisive analytical ability, creative visionary, effective and strategic thinker. These three qualities may seem basic to success in any business but they seem to have been in short supply at IBM as it has watched a relentless decline in the mainframe market on which it built its computer fortunes. IBM has been unable to articulate a clear new technological vision for itself and execute a strategy built around this. Mr Gerstner comes to the company with a strong reputation for analysis and strategic thinking, but he may find it hard to articulate a creative vision in a high tech industry which is new to him. Unusual leader with immmediate credibility and record of business success as a chief executive. These two qualities suggest a need to appoint an individual with the record to reassure both the financial markets and IBM's staff that the group is now is strong management hands. Mr Gerstner is generally well regarded on Wall Street. While his record at R J R is far from perfect - good on financial engineering, mixed at market share and profits growth - American Express enjoyed good growth under his presidency. He is, however, virtually unknown in the computer industry and to most of IBM's employees, whose trust he acknowledges he will have to earn. Inspires and motivates executive teams. This is an obvious quality for a business leader, but it may have been in short supply at IBM, with its layers of encrusted bureaucracy. Mr Gerstner has a good reputation for motivating his executives - both by exhortation and financial rewards. His success at IBM will depend in no small measure on the team he selects to advise him. Mr Gerstner also talks to people at all levels of a company. IBM employees often complain about the remoteness of 'the Armonk clique' of senior management at the company's New York state headquarters. The board's wish-list seems to lay no particular emphasis on one of the more popular ideas in management thinking - that of 'empowering' the workforce, devolving responsibility to workers right down the line and tapping them for their ideas on how a business should be run. One of the most forceful exponents of the theory is General Electric, which is often held up against lumbering IBM as an example of how a huge, diverse and technologically complex global business can stay quick on its feet. Making change happen; skilled at managing change; strong preference for experience and proven effectiveness in major turnaround or restructuring situations requiring a cultural change. This group of characteristics reflects the increasingly popular idea that the best way to shake-up the entrenched culture of a business may often be to bring in a radical 'change agent' from outside. A prime example is General Motors, the US car group which has been brought low by many of the same problems as IBM - in particular, bureaucracy and complacency bred by too much past success. Probably the most powerful single agent of cultural change at GM North America over the past year has been Mr J Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, an idiosyncratic, Spanish parts purchasing manager brought to Detroit from GM's European operations. He infuriated the supply industry by demanding big price cuts and lecturing companies (including GM subsidiaries) on ways to improve their manufacturing methods. Volkswagen, the west German car company, has just hired Mr Lopez to create a similar upheaval there. The hard-driving Mr Gerstner has plenty of experience as a change agent, but his record is not without flaws. His task at flabby RJR, when he took over the helm four years ago, was to financially restructure the heavily-indebted business, slash its fat and grow the business. He achieved the first two, but R J R still has a host of problems, with its foods business growing slowly and a loss of market share in tobacco. Still, only a handful of chief executives around the world would stand a chance of qualifying for the IBM wish-list. And if the phrase 'infallibility essential' was added to the list, the number would immediately drop to zero. Eleven qualities for an IBM chief executive High tech experience Customer orientation International experience Analytical ability Creative visionary Strategic thinker Unusual leader with immediate credibility Record of success as a chief executive Inspires and motivates executive teams Makes change happen</p>

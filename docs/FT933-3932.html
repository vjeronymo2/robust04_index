			<p>930910 FT  10 SEP 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Another fall for the dollar THE DOLLAR fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday, losing more than two pfennigs, in spite of the Bundesbank's decision to ease its discount rate by 1/2 percentage point, writes James Blitz. A few months ago, it would have been extraordinary to see the US currency drop so far on the same day as a sharp easing in Bundesbank monetary policy. But the mood towards the dollar has changed radically in the last two weeks, and more than a few analysts wonder whether the currency now has a strong downside. The US unit fell to DM1.5928 before closing at DM1.5970, against a previous DM1.6190. In New York it ended trading at DM1.5990. The dollar may have depreciated because yesterday's Bundesbank move appears to have been well discounted by some dealers. Less well informed players may have been surprised that the US currency did not rise on the German move, and panicked. But in the background lie all the factors that make dollar appreciation hard to envisage in the short term. Fund managers who thought this would be the 'year of the dollar' are heavily overweight in the currency; there is a growing belief that the German recession has bottomed out; and, above all, there has been disappointment in recent US economic indicators. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Bank, believes that DM1.58 to the dollar is a done deal. 'If we do not get a quick bounce after that, all the medium term players will panic and you will see it go a lot lower,' he said. Currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism were barely helped by the German move. Against the D-Mark, the French franc ended at FFr3.525 from a previous FFr3.519, the Danish krone fell to a close of DKr4.155 from DKr4.130, and the Belgian franc finished at BFr21.75 from a previous BFr21.76. The weakest and strongest currencies were divided by 9.21 percentage points at the close, a new record since the August currency crisis. There was no sign yesterday that Europe was decoupling from German monetary policy. But the weakness in European currencies may have been due to a perception that France, Belgium and Denmark were no longer doggedly pursuing a high interest rate policy to defend their currencies. Sterling tried to break through the DM2.50 level on news of the German rate cut, as dealers took the view that lower rates in Europe gave a better looking premium to the pound. But the UK currency failed to do so and, in a fate similar to the dollar's, declined sharply to close at DM2.4775 from a previous DM2.4950. The move surprised some dealers. The Confederation of British Industry had reported another increase in retail sales in August earlier in the day, following similar improvements in June and July - and added that this was accompanied by the lowest year-on-year rise in shop prices for 10 years.</p>

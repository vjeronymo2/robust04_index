			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 15 KYODO -- A majority of Japanese  polled do not have faith in bureaucrats because they do not  place priority on the interests of people, a survey by the  country's leading daily showed Sunday.    The survey conducted by the ASAHI SHIMBUN found that 51  percent of the respondents said they do not have confidence in  bureaucrats, while 44 percent said they can rely on them.    The negative tendency was stronger among younger  respondents,  with more than 60 percent of pollees in their 20s and 30s saying  they do not trust bureaucrats.    When asked about politicians, 61 percent said they do not  have faith in them.    The ASAHI conducted the survey May 8 to 9, covering 3,000  people nationwide aged 20 or older. Eighty percent or 2,407  responded.    Sixty-three percent said bureaucrats put the interests of  firms, industries and their own ministries and agencies before  those of people, while only 14 percent said that bureaucrats are  thinking about the interests of people.    Regarding policy decisions, 56 percent said bureaucrats have  more power than the ruling political parties. When asked how  they feel about the bureaucrat-led decision-making system,  however, 45 percent said people should not have any say in the  matter, while 44 percent responded the system is unavoidable.    More than 70 percent said they have a bad image of  bureaucrats, and 28 percent of those respondents said they are  not flexible, and 22 percent said they have a strong desire for  promotion.    Those who responded favorably toward bureaucrats, saying  they  are able or are committed, stood at only 21 percent.    On why there are so many regulations in Japan, 33 percent  said industries are trying to protect their own interests, while  29 percent replied bureaucrats are sticking with their own  prerogatives. Twenty-eight percent said such regulations are  necessary to preserve the order of society.</p>

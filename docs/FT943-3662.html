			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / Leading Article: Bosnian bravado There are two ways that external powers can influence the outcome of the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, if they so choose. One is to treat it as a war of aggression and come to the aid of the victim (Bosnia) against the aggressor (Serbia). The other is to treat it as a civil war, in which the various parties are essentially on the same moral plane, and nudge them towards a compromise peace while bringing relief, and where possible protection, to the civilian victims. The first strategy was what Bosnians were led to expect when the US and the EC recognised their state and government in April 1992. Had it been followed at that time, the arms embargo applied to Yugoslavia the previous year would never have been applied to Bosnia. Weapons would have been rushed to Bosnia along with training missions to help the new state organise its armed forces and push back the Serb militias which were partly infiltrated from Serbia and almost entirely armed and trained by the former Yugoslav army. The Bosnian armed forces could have been provided with western air cover. In that event, if external ground troops had been sent they would have gone not as supposedly impartial peacekeepers but as an expeditionary force to protect Bosnians from 'ethnic cleansing' and help liberate the territory that had been occupied. But it was not followed. The Bush administration, which with some justice held the EC responsible for precipitating the war in Bosnia by its premature recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, allowed Europe to take the lead. Within Europe the Germans, feeling themselves disqualified by history from any military role in the Balkans, deferred to Britain and France, both of which took the second approach. In early 1993 Bill Clinton made a half-hearted attempt to persuade Europe to switch to the first strategy under the rubric of 'lift and strike', but backed off when Britain and France claimed a veto over any policy that might imperil their contingents on the ground. In 1994 an awkward compromise emerged which is short on logic and clarity but has had some results, mainly because the five most influential external powers have acted in unison. Broadly it is still the second approach, but with greater pressure applied to the Serbs in an attempt to compensate for the weakness of the Bosnian government and to redress at least part of the wrong done to Bosnian Moslems. The contact group peace plan is hardly a model of justice, but it would at least give Bosnian Moslems and Croats enough space to live in without fighting each other, as they are bound to do if they remain confined to less than 30 per cent of the country between them. Moreover the Contact Group has scored a significant victory in getting President Milosevic of Serbia to endorse the plan and to disavow the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of it. The Bosnian Serbs have never been so isolated. Having got so far, the Contact Group should insist that Serbia co-operate in making that isolation watertight, and wait for its effects to sink in. The threat of lifting the embargo should be kept in the background. Actually lifting it would make sense only if there were agreement by all parties to switch to the first strategy, of helping the Bosnian government in a war to 'liberate' its entire territory. The truth is that no party, not even the US, is prepared to do this. Some American legislators may imagine they can help the Bosnian Moslems as they once helped the Afghan Mujahidin. The analogy is flawed in many respects; but Afghanistan today gives all too convincing an image of what Bosnia might look like in a few years' time if the Congressional 'strategy' were applied.</p>

			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Into the deep end in the City: The latest change in Barclays' top echelon The game of musical chairs that has kept the directors of Barclays Bank busy in recent weeks has taken its most significant turn with the arrival of Sir Peter Middleton. The man from the Treasury is to be thrown headlong into running the group's nascent markets and investment banking division, being formed out of Barclays' own treasury operations and Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment subsidiary created at the time of Big Bang in 1986. Investment banking has been a graveyard for many illustrious careers in London in recent years - a point reiterated yesterday with the departure of Mr Howard Macdonald as chairman and chief executive of NatWest Investment Bank. Sir Martin Jacomb, 61, who will make way for Sir Peter at the start of November, has largely managed to avoid the graveyard. By common consent, BZW, whose creation he masterminded, has been one of the more successful integrated investment banks in London. That judgment is relative, though. It scarcely makes it an unqualified success. BZW made only Pounds 5m profit last year, after disastrous losses in its equity division. By any normal test of performance, its first four years seem a very expensive mistake for Barclays. Rather than a success, the best that can be said for it is that BZW has not been as big a failure as others. A year ago it was Nigel Lawson, the former chancellor, who was being tipped as the next boss of BZW. Mr Lawson joined the bank as a consultant, working two days a week, at about the same time that Sir Martin Jacomb's initial five-year contract with BZW expired. As it was, Sir Martin agreed a further contract with no end date specified. Colleagues now say that he was persuaded to stay to oversee the creation of Barclays' new markets and investment banking division, and that his departure should come as no surprise. Mr Lawson himself gave up his BZW consultancy work a month ago, citing the need to spend more time writing his memoirs. In the increasingly crowded boardroom at Barclays, meanwhile, Sir Peter will sit alongside Sir Martin and Mr Lawson, both of whom will remain directors of the parent. He will become the third deputy chairman on the board - alongside Sir Martin and Mr Andrew Buxton. Mr Buxton was made a deputy chairman only two days ago. These changes come at a time when Barclays is still trying to fill the gap on its board left by Mr Brian Pearse, its finance director, who departed to become chief executive at rival Midland Bank in a surprise move last month. Mr Pearse's shoes are being filled temporarily by Mr Humphrey Norrington, who was himself elevated to the position of vice-chairman this week. A full-time replacement is expected. Sir Peter's arrival has already prompted suggestions that, in the longer term, he is seen as a successor to the bank's chairman, Sir John Quinton, who is 61. But Barclays is keen to stop the game of musical chairs at this point. 'The issue of succession does not arise,' the bank said. 'Sir John will continue for several years yet.'</p>

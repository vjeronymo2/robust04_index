			<p><P> June 15, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONSENSUS-ORIENTED;  </P> <P> GEPHARDT AIM: CHANGE FROM INSIDE SYSTEM  </P> <P> When Richard A. Gephardt was student body president at Northwestern University  in 1962, student leaders spent weeks debating whether to boycott a local  barbershop that charged blacks higher prices than whites. It finally came down  to a vote, with Gephardt breaking an 11-11 tie to endorse the boycott.  </P> <P> But as soon as students began picketing, Gephardt organized behind-the-scenes  negotiations that led within a month to an agreement with the barber to end the  discrimination. It was a move that was to prove prophetic for his future  political career.  </P> <P> "I have always believed," Gephardt said in an interview last year, "that what I  try to do is to change the status quo where I think it needs changing -- but  from inside the system."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Golden Opportunity  </P> <P> Now Gephardt, who made a strong bid for the Democratic presidential nomination  in 1988 on a populist, anti-Establishment platform, will have a golden  opportunity to demonstrate his conciliatory abilities as the new House majority  leader.  </P> <P> "Dick Gephardt is the ultimate consensus-oriented guy," says Rep. Robert T.  Matsui (D-Sacramento). "He has strong beliefs, but he will work within the  Democratic Party to build an agenda for all of us."  </P> <P> After only 12 years in Congress, Gephardt, 48, is suddenly the No. 2 Democrat  in the House under new Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). And with his Eagle  Scout background and squeaky clean image, the Missouri Democrat was an  overwhelmingly popular choice to help lead his party out of the firestorm of  ethical controversy that brought down former Speaker Jim Wright and Rep. Tony  Coehlo of Modesto.  </P> <P> "He has weathered the scrutiny and investigation of the presidential campaign,  and comes to this with very excellent credentials in terms of honesty and  integrity," said Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.).  </P> <P> </P> <P> Makes Career Choice  </P> <P> To become majority leader, Gephardt is setting aside his presidential ambitions  at least until 1996 and perhaps forever. Richard Moe, a Gephardt adviser during  his campaign, believes that Gephardt is now destined to become the top Democrat  in the House some day rather than a future Democratic standard bearer for  President. "In making this decision," Moe said, "I think it's apparent that  he's made a basic career choice."  </P> <P> Gephardt, who was 35 years old when he was first elected to the House, is the  very model of today's television-age politician.  </P> <P> Sometimes derided for his perfectly blow-dried strawberry blond hair and for  backing away from his original positions on abortion and tax reform when it  seemed politically expedient, he reminded some observers during last year's  presidential primary campaign of Robert Redford in "The Candidate," a movie  that attacked modern political campaigning as a con game.  </P> <P> But Gephardt, his friends say, is no shallow front man for behind-the-scenes  manipulators. He has not backed away, for instance, from his controversial  support for tough -- sometimes protectionist -- trade measures against foreign  countries. "It was his willingness to fly in the face of conventional, elite  opinions that made him a major contender," said William Carrick, Gephardt's  former campaign manager. "When things looked bleakest in Iowa, he simply  decided to campaign on the gut issues he really believed in."  </P> <P> Gephardt is generally considered a middle-of-the-road Democrat in the House,  but he plans to urge the party to define its positions more bluntly.  </P> <P> "It's easy to cook pablum. It's harder to cook Cajun stew," he told his  Democratic colleagues Wednesday after being elected to the leadership post. "We  have to have a consensus with an edge. . . . We must be willing to say where we  stand in clear, unequivocal language."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Worked on Budget Law  </P> <P> But Gephardt's forte is expected to be as an institutional insider working to  forge legislative compromises, as he did in particular during the 1985 battles  to pass the Gramm-Rudman budget law.  </P> <P> "He can disagree and not be disagreeable," said Rep. Ike Skelton, a fellow  Democrat from Missouri.  </P> <P> Republicans are worried that he may prove to be a particularly formidable  opponent. "Gephardt is pretty well liked on the Republican side of the aisle,  but he is certainly more of a hardball player than Tom Foley is," said Rep.  Mickey Edwards (R-Okla.). "He tends to be a polarizer rather than a conciliator  between the parties."  </P> <P> For Democrats, Gephardt's elevation marks an important changing of the guard in  Washington. "He's the first of the post-Vietnam, post-Watergate representatives  to rise to such a high leadership post," said Rep. Leon E. Panetta  (D-Monterey). "It's a new generation that is much more independent and much  more issue-oriented."  </P> <P> For all his up-to-date image, however, Gephardt was remarkably unaffected by  the social upheavals of the 1960s. When some other Democratic candidates and  several younger GOP lawmakers acknowledged using marijuana during the  controversy over Supreme Court nominee Douglas H. Ginsburg, for example,  Gephardt confessed to never having touched the stuff.  </P> <P> Married to the former Jane Byrnes, with three children, Gephardt himself even  joked sometimes that his "Dick and Jane" life seemed to be something out of an  old-fashioned elementary school reader.  </P> <P> But given the mood on Capitol Hill, Gephardt is likely to prove well-suited to  an era when every step a politician takes will be examined closely. "A lot of  politicians don't wear well," said Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.). "He wears better  with every meeting."  </P> <P> Staff writers Robert Shogan and Larry Green contributed to this story.  </P></p>

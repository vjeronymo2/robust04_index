			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpts] Bonn/Tehran (DPA)--German Foreign Ministry  spokesman Martin Erdmann said today that the German Government,  which formally appealed for a pardon immediately after the  Iranian death sentence against the German engineer Helmut  Szimkus was confirmed, is still hoping for his release. [passage  omitted]    Intensive and close contacts are apparently being used  between Bonn and Tehran to stop the death sentence from being  carried out. This does not appear impossible, according to  informed sources. The German Foreign Ministry merely confirmed  that the formal petition for pardon had only been possible once  the long legal procedure ended with the Supreme Court rejecting  the appeal.</p>

			<p><P> September 10, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PLIGHT OF YOUNG BLACK MALES IN AMERICA  </P> <P> Raspberry shows just how confused one can become when one's own cultural  perspective has been lost.  </P> <P> Raspberry's comments, like those of many elitist conservatives, totally ignore  the real reasons for the chronic academic underachievement of young black  males.  </P> <P> Raspberry says, "I doubt that substituting Chinua Achebe, James Baldwin or Mary  Frances Berry for William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne or the white authors  of high-school history texts would significantly raise the relative academic  performance of black boys."  </P> <P> He later says the problem is caused by a lack of role models. The fact that  Raspberry does not see the connection between strong cultural self-knowledge  through reading the works of people like oneself, and how well one feels about  oneself is painful. The fact that he seems to not view Achebe, Baldwin and  Berry as role models is frightening.  </P> <P> Raspberry says black males ". . . confuse manliness with machismo . . ," that  being able to "take care of themselves" equates with manhood.  </P> <P> In many areas of the inner city, being able to fight well (or giving that  appearance) is simply a survival skill. Often, the brash manner of behavior  Raspberry refers to is only a type of body language designed to ward off  attack.  </P> <P> GEORGE BLAINE JR.  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Brussels plays the duopoly card: Nestle's takeover of Perrier is reshaping EC competition policy Tomorrow's negotiations between Mr Helmut Maucher, chairman of Nestle and Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, signal the start of a tense poker game, in which much more is stake than the terms of the Swiss food company's FF13bn (Pounds 1.32bn) takeover of Perrier, France's largest mineral water supplier. The case is also shaping up as a test of Brussels' efforts to broaden the scope of its fledgling merger policy in a way which would greatly extend its control over future deals in a wide range of European industries. At the heart of the dispute is the contention by the commission's merger task force that it has 'serious doubts' about the Perrier deal on the grounds that it could give Nestle and BSN, France's largest food company, a duopoly of the French mineral water market. This is the first time Brussels has challenged a takeover on duopoly grounds since the EC merger regulation came into force 21 months ago. Nestle, which had believed the deal would be cleared, accuses Brussels of moving the goalposts in the middle of the game. Mr Reto Domeniconi, Nestle finance director, said the merger task force had already said it would not object to the deal if the company agreed to find another buyer for Volvic, one of Perrier's biggest brands, instead of selling it to BSN, as planned. But Nestle has rejected the proposal on the grounds that the sale to BSN is integral to the whole Perrier deal. 'We have made a clear agreement with Mr Antoine Riboud (BSN's chairman), and we will stick to this as long as we are not forbidden to do so by a ruling,' Mr Maucher said. Nestle has also challenged the duopoly allegation but says it is ready to discuss a compromise. 'We are not ruling out any negotiation,' Mr Domeniconi said last week.' The outcome of tomorrow's talks is expected to hinge on whether Nestle or BSN is prepared to dispose of enough mineral water brands to reduce their shares of the French market to a level which Sir Leon and his advisers consider acceptable. Though duopoly theory is part of competition policies in Britain and Germany, it does not feature in the text of the EC merger regulation. Legal experts are sharply divided over whether Brussels is - or should be - allowed to apply the theory when judging mergers. Professor Barry Hawk of the Brussels office of Skadden Arps, a leading US law firm, says that if the Perrier case established the duopoly principle in EC law, it would be 'a landmark'. He thinks the commission would then seek to expand its powers further by challenging looser oligopolies - markets with several big players. Mr Domeniconi argues that the result would be to frustrate industrial restructuring by discouraging takeover bids, particularly hostile ones. As an active acquirer, which regularly uses takeovers to increase its share of markets which it does not already dominate, Nestle could be a prime target. With so much at risk, the company is fighting the commission every inch of the way. While Nestle's lawyers battle with the merger task force, its top executives are mobilising support in an effort to influence the 17 commissioners who will eventually decide the case. 'Because this ruling will be very decisive for many future rulings, this has become very political,' says Mr Maucher. 'I would say that at least all the commissioners will be involved, if not some of the ministers.' Thanks to help from BSN and other French allies, Nestle is confident that Mr Jacques Delors, the commission president, and Mrs Christiane Scrivener, France's other commissioner, will not oppose the deal. Mr Martin Bangemann, the German industry commissioner, is also counted on for support. If these attempts to outflank Sir Leon failed, and a majority of his colleagues voted to block the Perrier deal, Nestle says it would appeal to the European Court of Justice. How far Sir Leon will be swayed by these tactics remains to be seen. A defeat at the hands of his fellow commissioners would deal a humiliating blow to his personal standing and the authority of EC merger policy. But Sir Leon also knows that Nestle risks losing a lot if it refuses to give ground. At worst, the commission could order Nestle to unstitch the entire deal and put Perrier up for sale. Although Nestle has said that if the commission ruled against the deal, it would immediately appeal to the European Court of Justice, the case could take years to reach a conclusion. Nestle's voting rights over Perrier shares have been suspended since the EC merger investigation opened, preventing the Swiss company from controlling the management of the mineral water group, who in any case opposed the takeover bid. A lengthy court battle could leave Perrier rudderless, impeding its ability to compete and eroding the value of its brands. Even if Nestle won an appeal, it could end up owning a company worth far less than it paid for it. On other other hand, Nestle fears that if it agreed to dispose of some Perrier assets to appease the commission, they might fetch a poor price because bidders would know they were dealing with a forced seller. Furthermore, to sell Perrier's Volvic brand to a buyer other than BSN would be legally complex and seriously strain relations between Mr Maucher and Mr Riboud, who has powerful political and business connections in France. Mr Maucher is playing his cards close to his chest, insisting he does not know how the affair will end. But Nestle's willing-ness to negotiate suggests it is prepared to do a deal of some kind. Whether it will be enough to satisfy Brussels may become clear after tomorrow's meeting. But whatever the outcome of the Perrier case, Brussels lawyers do not expect Sir Leon and his advisers to be deflected easily from their campaign to establish duopoly as principle of EC competition policy.</p>

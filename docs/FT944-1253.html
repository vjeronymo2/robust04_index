			<p>941221 FT  21 DEC 94 / The Lex Column: US dollar Investors may be forgiven for experiencing a sense of deja vu: another year is coming to an end and once again economists are expressing optimism about prospects for the US dollar. The prognoses made this time last year proved spectacularly wrong. Is history about to repeat itself? The new optimism is triggered by the Federal Reserve's aggression on the interest rate front: since short-term rates were raised by a higher than expected 75 basis points on November 25, the dollar has risen sharply against both the yen and the D-Mark. Notwithstanding the Fed's decision to leave short-term rates unchanged yesterday, the expectation now is that rates will rise again by February. Thereafter, dollar supporters contend, the currency will be supported by a further tightening throughout the year. This argument looks flawed on a number of counts. US rates have been rising since February, but this did nothing to support the dollar. The currency was undermined by an outflow of cash from bond markets, a pattern which could repeat itself next year, the difference being that equities, rather than Treasuries, look vulnerable this time round. The US still labours under a large current account deficit, a deep-seated structural problem which militates against strengthening of the dollar. A third reason for caution is the likelihood that German interest rates will start to rise again from the middle of next year. This will add to the attractions of the D-Mark at the dollar's expense.</p>

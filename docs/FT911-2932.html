			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: TWA's London route sales cleared AVIATION authorities in the US yesterday gave Trans World Airlines, the heavily-indebted US carrier, permission to sell three of its London Heathrow route authorities to American Airlines, the larger and stronger US carrier. But it said TWA would be required to retain routes between three other US cities - Baltimore, Philadelphia, and St Louis - and London. The ailing airline, owned by Mr Carl Icahn, the US corporate raider, originally planned to sell the six routes, plus other assets to American, for Dollars 445m in mid-December. Since then, the sale has proved controversial. Some observers - including TWA's unions - have claimed that, shorn of these routes, TWA would not be a viable operating entity in the long-term. The picture was muddied further when Mr Kirk Kerkorian, the wealthy West Coast investor, said he was interested in buying TWA, but only if it kept the London routes. Mr Samuel Skinner said it had been 'amongst the most difficult decisions' since becoming US Transportation Secretary two years ago. He claimed that allowing the three routes between New York, Boston and Los Angeles to pass to American would make the carrier 'a major player in the US-UK aviation market'. United, American's biggest domestic rival, has already won access to Heathrow by acquiring Pan Am's London routes. Mr Skinner added that he was 'sympathetic' to the effort by unions and government officials to protect the future of TWA'. But he ruled that Mr Kerkorian's proposal did not 'compel disapproval of the entire transaction'. He also claimed Mr Kerkorian was still free to negotiate with TWA, while American and TWA drew up a new sale contract. Last night, Mr Kerkorian's Tracinda Corporation said it 'remained committed to a possible acquisition of TWA', although there were still 'substantial unanswered questions regarding the status of the American/TWA contract'. Mr Icahn suggested that that covered the sale of 'six routes or fewer than six routes. . . for a total purchase price of Dollars 445m', while American said the contract barred discussions between TWA and Mr Kerkorian. American declined to clarify whether, by retaining the existing contract, it might have to pay Dollars 445m for three routes.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, May 9 KYODO -- Sumitomo Heavy Industries  Ltd. allegedly paid 140 million yen to the president of an  Osaka-based rightist organization as a fee for settling the  company's trouble with another rightist group over the  construction of an incinerator, industry sources said Monday [9  May].    The sources said the major shipbuilder in the Sumitomo  conglomerate made a consultant contract with a company run by  the head of the rightist group in Osaka Prefecture, after the  shipbuilder won a contract last August to build the incinerator  in Tsukuba, Ibaraki Prefecture. The company paid 140 million  yen into the account of the company run by the rightist under  the name of a consultation fee, the sources said.    Rumors of bid-rigging surrounded the incinerator project and  another rightist group had criticized the bid from a truck  equipped with loudspeakers near Tsukuba's City Hall and at the  mayor's house in late November last year, just before the  ceremony to begin building the incinerator.    The president of the rightist group which made the  consultant  contract with Sumitomo Heavy Industries requested the other  rightist group to stop its criticisms at that time, according to  the sources.    A public relations official of Sumitomo Heavy Industries  refused to comment on the allegations.</p>

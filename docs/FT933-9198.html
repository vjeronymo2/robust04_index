			<p>930811 FT  11 AUG 93 / Warning on radio advert revenue COMMERCIAL RADIO needs to increase total advertising revenue by at least 50 per cent to meet the planned increase in the number of new stations, according to a report from consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand. In order to fund the growing number of commercial radio services, the report says, the sector will need to achieve a 3 per cent share of total advertising revenue. In 1992, it brought in Pounds 140m in advertising revenue - an overall share of 2 per cent. It says there will be 180 commercial local and regional services as well as three national stations by 1996. The report adds: 'It is essential to the future profitability of independent radio that the increase in listening share is accompanied by an increase in revenue share. Unless this is accomplished the industry will be in trouble by 1996.' The radio industry needs to overturn indifference from advertising agencies towards the medium. Coopers believes this will be helped by the growth in audiences, by the launch of national stations, by advertising sales packages such as National Network Radio and by the Radio Advertising Bureau which is promoting commercial radio. Mr George Eccles of Coopers &amp; Lybrand said yesterday he believed the 3 per cent share was possible, and was 'essential to the future profitability of independent radio'.

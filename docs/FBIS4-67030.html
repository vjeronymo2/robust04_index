			<p>CSO     [Text] George Town, Grand Cayman, CANA--Nearly 700 pounds  of marijuana in plastic and burlap bags was found in the bush on  a remote Cayman Islands beach last weekend.    A police spokesperson said the actual weight of the  marijuana  came to 697.5 pounds. The marijuana was contained in 23 separate  bags that were marked "Jamaica" on the outside, he said.    The marijuana appeared to be professionally packaged and  intended for trans-shipment to another destination, most likely  the United States, the spokesperson said.    The drug had a street value of approximately US$850,000.    Drugs Squad Superintendent Trevor Cutts said the large  amounts of marijuana and cocaine found on Cayman beaches  recently "indicate the islands are still being used to ship  drugs from Jamaica and Honduras to the United States."    Travellers from the Caymans, particularly U.S. citizens who  have been on vacation here, are seldom searched or detained when  clearing customs at Miami International or other U.S. airports,  officials here say.    Three U.S. nationals have been arrested here in the past six  months and charged with transporting drugs back to the United  States.    All have admitted they were recruited to be "mules" by local  residents who offered them a week's vacation in the Cayman  Islands in return for ferrying marijuana and cocaine back to the  States.</p>

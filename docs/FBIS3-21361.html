			<p>Language: <F P=105> Hebrew </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by 'Orli 'Azoli-Katz: "I Am for a Return to the </F> Intifadah"]    [Text] Jibril Rajub was the first to hear about the  slaughter. Five minutes to six, Jerusalem time, the phone rang  at his home in a Tunis suburb. The report was choppy: Blood in  the mosque, bodies in the courtyard. The Jewish army is shooting.    It was one of his commands that phoned right from the field.  Rajub jumped out of bed and ran to wake up Chairman 'Arafat.    He was born 42 years ago in Hebron. His father and  grandfather were also born there. He knows the area like the  palm of his hand. That may be why, after he was expelled from  there by the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] more than seven years  ago, Yasir 'Arafat made him commander for the West Bank at PLO  headquarters. 'Arafat listens to him, and in Tunis they say that  what Jibril says reflects what 'Arafat is thinking. He is  absolutely loyal to his boss.    You have to understand the nature of Jibril's job: The  person  responsible for the West Bank in the PLO is also the operations  officer of the intifadah. At its height, he was the one who  would relay instructions to the field by satellite telephone. He  would also dictate the manifestos and plan the operations. "Yes,  I am a terrorist," he confessed, and there are legal grounds for  saying so: He spent 17 years in Israeli prisons for planning and  being involved in attacks. When he was released, he was  suspected of plotting to assassinate Yitzhaq Shamir and 'Ariq  Sharon. Defense Minister Moshe 'Arens decided to expel him.    When the Oslo talks began, Rajub was the most ardent  supporter in PLO headquarters of the agreement reached with  Israel. Since then he has been careful to stay behind the  curtains and not take a direct part in the negotiations.  Israelis involved in the agreement remember long night-time  conversations with him by telephone, especially when the  negotiations hit a snag, and they were looking for a channel to  'Arafat.    "I felt that the terror and the intifadah had justified  themselves. We had fought, and now we were going to make peace,"  he said in those days. This week he was singing a different  tune: "I am stuck here in Tunis while crazy Jews from Brooklyn  are entering my house in Hebron. Everything is lost, how can we  continue now?"    On the morning of the slaughter he went quickly to Arafat's  house. Suha opened the door for him. For four hours Suha, Yasir  'Arafat, and Rajub sat by the telephone trying to gather details  from Hebron: How many were killed, how many wounded, what was  the situation in the field? Alongside a list of the dead, they  began to put together lists of the wounded.    The shock was great, and only later did they begin to firm  up  their reactions. The opponents of the agreement signed with  Israel began coming out from where they had dug themselves in.  And even as his image was burned in effigy by his own countrymen  calling him "traitor," 'Arafat began releasing radical  declarations: He swore not to return to the negotiating table  until Israel did away with the settlements, brought UN troops  into the field and immediately began negotiating on the final  agreement--conditions that were unacceptable.    Still, 'Arafat was not yet closing the door all the way. At  the end of the week he hinted to Clinton: "Give me a week or two  for passions to calm and we will see what will be." He gave  those Israelis who were in contact with him to understand that  he did not intend to "break all the dishes."    Either way, 'Arafat is trapped. He is now caught between  American-Egyptian-Israeli pressure from above and the pressure  of the residents of the territories from below. A difficult and  fragile moment. So fragile that many Western analysts believe  that if he does not return to the negotiating table, 'Arafat  will lose his leadership.    Jibril Rajub, 'Arafat's close adviser and confidant, has an  altogether different interpretation. "I know 'Arafat well," he  said this week in a special interview with YEDIO'T AHARONOT.  "'Arafat would prefer to die now and lose his leadership rather  than be portrayed as a traitor in the eyes of his people. I also  see the pressures from the field. In the West Bank they do not  want to hear any more about the agreement with Israel, and  'Arafat cannot follow through on the agreement without the  support of the majority of the Palestinian people."    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] A terrible thing happened in the mosque,  but would you miss the opportunity for peace because of one  madman?    [Rajub] First of all, it is now clear that the slaughter was  carried out in two stages. In the first stage the settlers  entered the mosque and opened fire, and I also have testimony  that it was not just the madman Goldstein. Our people who  escaped from the mosque were killed by IDF soldiers outside. A  settler kills people at prayer, they flee to save  themselves--and your soldiers kill them.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] The facts that the IDF and the Israeli  Government have are different. They claim that Baruch Goldstein  was alone in the mosque.    [Rajub] In any case, with whom, precisely, can we now make  peace? With those from Qiryat Arba' who kill and afterward dance  and party? Killing people at prayer and afterward celebrating?    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Some of your people killed more than a  few  Jews over the last few years. Nevertheless Israel opted for  peace with you.    [Rajub] If we were to kill people at prayer on the Sabbath  in  a synagogue, a world war would break out.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] The slaughter pains all of us, but try to  be logical now. What must happen in order for the process to  continue?    [Rajub] Rabin must remove all the settlers from the West  Bank  and the Gaza Strip. "Transfer" them to hell. That is what must  be done. Those settlements are illegal. Move them to Petah Tiqva  or Tel Aviv, wherever. As long as they are on the West Bank  there will not be peace. What happened made it very clear to us  that we cannot coexist together.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You certainly must know that Rabin will  not dismantle the settlements.    [Rajub] If not, we will distribute weapons to the  Palestinian  inhabitants and go back to armed struggle.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You mean back to the days of the  intifadah?    [Rajub] Much worse, and I am not prepared to go into detail.  You are always boasting that you have the tanks and the planes,  but still there are plans.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You supported the peace agreement and  said  it was dear to you. Maybe you can think of a reasonable solution  that would allow a return to the negotiating table.    [Rajub] For six months you have been claiming that you would  not come to an agreement if there was no protection for the  Jewish settlers. In order for the Palestinians to have security,  the Jewish settlers have to be removed from there and you have  to withdraw the army forces from Jericho and let us come in  immediately. Look, it is absurd: One of your soldiers was killed  and you expelled 417 of our people. We also want security.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You are encouraging your people to take  revenge.    [Rajub] The people in the field are pressuring me to go back  to armed struggle. They want revenge but also to protect  themselves. I am not encouraging them but I understand them. A  boy spoke to me whose brother was killed in the mosque. His  father ran to the hospital to give blood and within the hospital  confines a soldier shot him and killed him, too. How can I tell  this boy that he cannot take revenge?    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] It is hard to believe a soldier shot  someone in the hospital.    [Rajub] Check with the military administration. The family  name is Abu-Sanin. The incident occurred in the Al-Ahala  hospital. A shocking incident. In another family a father of six  girls and seven boys was killed at prayer. What do I tell the  orphans? That there is a peace agreement?    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] If that is your line, the only thing we  can look forward to in the area is a bloodbath. Your people will  kill and so will ours.    [Rajub] What I am saying is: Tear down the settlements, give  us our territory. We do not want to live alongside people who  kill us. You say they will not tear down the settlements. Then  there is nothing to talk about.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You sound desperate.    [Rajub] I am not desperate. I was born an optimist. You know  how much effort I put into getting this peace agreement. But  today I feel they tricked us. I am in the position of field  commander. I hear what people are saying, how they are  pressuring.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Are you sorry about the agreement?    [Rajub] I was for it, but today I see things differently. It  cannot be that the army did not cooperate with the madman  Goldstein. I will explain to you again: The people fled from the  mosque and the soldiers killed them. Nothing like that happened  with the Nazis.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] You are exaggerating.    [Rajub] I am not exaggerating. And I am not even talking  about the fact that the murderer was in uniform, entered a  mosque during prayers, and no one stopped him.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] A commission of inquiry has now been  appointed.    [Rajub] It is an Israeli matter to establish a commission of  inquiry. Why, for example, were steps not taken against those  who danced from happiness after the slaughter? Hanan Porat was  there to encourage them. Can I make peace with someone like  that? I have a feeling that you have people both in the  political and diplomatic echelons who have regretted the  agreement and are doing everything they can to sabotage it.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] If 'Arafat retreats from the agreement,  politically he is lost.    [Rajub] 'Arafat cannot and does not want to keep the  agreement now. He must first of all provide security to the  Palestinian people. The situation is critical.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Do you think it is preferable to skip the  Oslo agreement and get right to work on negotiations for the  final agreement?    [Rajub] I know we have people who want that. I hope that the  Americans will exert pressure where they have to and that Israel  removes the settlements.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Rabin also has public opinion and a  government that he has to watch out for. How can he remove the  settlements now?    [Rajub] If he cannot remove the settlements, he can take the  Oslo agreement, put it in a picture frame and hang it on the  wall.    [YEDIO'T AHARONOT] Jibril, you are a terrorist, you served  time in prison, you were expelled from your home. You fought and  were fought against. Peace was so close and you wanted it. Are  you prepared to give it all up tomorrow?    [Rajub] We have done everything. Now the ball is in Israel's  court.</p>

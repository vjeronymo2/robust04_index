			<p>940826 FT  26 AUG 94 / Philippines court lifts freeze on VAT plan The Philippines Supreme Court yesterday ruled that a government-initiated law expanding the scope of the value-added tax system was constitutional, lifting a freeze it had ordered on its implementation nearly two months ago. It was a significant victory for the government of President Fidel Ramos, which considers the law the 'linchpin in the major tax reform programme' it has been pursuing. The ruling also removed the remaining obstacle to the government's medium-term economic programme that recently gained International Monetary Fund support with a three-year credit worth Dollars 684m (Pounds 456m). The issue has been the most divisive in the Philippines in recent years, fuelled mainly by suspicions that the new tax scheme would lead to huge increases in consumer prices. VAT was originally introduced in 1988, but only a few sectors were covered. The system replaced 61 varying taxes with a 10 per cent charge on the sale of certain goods and services. In the expanded VAT, 73 taxes are to be replaced by the single 10 per cent rate on services including telecommunications, road freight and other transport, lease and sale of real estate, hotels and motels, books, newspapers and broadcasting. The law also allows VAT to be extended to banks and professional services within the next two years. Mr Roberto de Ocampo, finance secretary, had explained that the expanded VAT system was aimed at 'injecting honesty' into the local tax system, often characterised by evasion. The Philippines' tax collection effort, about 15-16 per cent of gross national product, remains the lowest in south-east Asia. The go-ahead for the VAT expansion should give the government better chances of collecting target revenues this year of 325.6bn pesos (Pounds 8bn), on which it pins its hopes for a 4.5 per cent overall economic growth. The contested law was originally scheduled to be implemented last July, but several groups, including opposition legislators, challenged its legality before the Supreme Court. They claimed that much of the expanded VAT law in its final form originated, not in the House of Representatives which, under the Philippines constitution should initiate revenue regulations, but in a bicameral conference committee. In handing down its verdict, the Supreme Court said a revenue measure was 'not the exclusive prerogative' of the House to draft, but that the Senate could draft its own bill amending or even substituting for the House version. The ruling was based on a 9-6 vote among the Supreme Court justices, indicating the intense debates that went into it. Since July 1, the justices have been meeting twice a week to deliberate on the case.</p>

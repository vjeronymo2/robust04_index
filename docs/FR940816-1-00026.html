			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> To avoid this absurd result and only grant a waiver of the serious area requirements consistent with the legal standard set out in the Act, EPA has construed section 188(f) in the following manner. A moderate area may only qualify for an attainment date waiver if it also qualifies for a waiver of the serious area requirements. Therefore, EPA must determine that anthropogenic sources in the area do not contribute significantly to the violation of the PM&hyph;10 NAAQS, and the serious area requirements should be waived before EPA can grant an attainment date waiver for a moderate area. If such a determination is made, then the attainment date may be waived and the area would not be reclassified. These special considerations would not be relevant where EPA is determining whether to waive the attainment date for a serious area since waiving the date in such circumstances would not as a matter of course have the effect of relieving the area of the serious area requirements. An area already reclassified as serious could qualify for an attainment date waiver solely by showing that nonanthropogenic emissions contribute significantly to the nonattainment problem.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As part of its policy, EPA will require that areas receiving waivers be revisited periodically to reevaluate source contributions, to ensure that source emissions growth is reasonably controlled, and to determine whether additional controls to reduce the public's exposure to high concentrations of PM&hyph;10 are available (see also the discussion under question 5).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. What happens if an area cannot meet the general criteria described above?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If evidence in a given nonattainment area suggests that nonanthropogenic emissions may contribute significantly to violations but are not greater than 150 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and/or anthropogenic source contributions are relatively small but not less than 5 &mu;g/m <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 3 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , then EPA will review the situation on a case-by-case basis taking into account relevant information such as the relative contribution of nonanthropogenic emissions/anthropogenic emissions and the effects of applying additional controls to both types of sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For moderate areas, if preliminary data (emission inventory, filter analysis, etc.) persuasively indicate that anthropogenic emissions may be insignificant and that nonanthropogenic emissions may be significant in an area, but such data are not decisive, then EPA will consider granting a temporary or conditional waiver of the moderate area attainment date for no more than 3 years to allow further evaluation of the situation. Prior to granting a temporary waiver, EPA and the State must agree on a protocol for evaluating the impacts of anthropogenic and nonanthropogenic emissions. The protocol must include a schedule with interim milestones by which the State will complete its analyses. The schedule should consider the need for the area to adopt and implement BACM so as to meet the applicable serious area attainment date (as expeditiously as practicable and, for those areas designated nonattainment under section 107(d)(4)(B), no later than December 31, 2001) in the event the evaluation demonstrates that nonanthropogenic emissions do not contribute significantly to violations in the area. If the evaluation conclusively demonstrates that nonanthropogenic emissions are significant, then a waiver of the serious area attainment date may be granted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If it is shown for any moderate nonattainment area that, although nonanthropogenic emissions may be significant, the application of controls on anthropogenic sources would appreciably reduce PM&hyph;10 concentrations in the area, then the area would not be granted a waiver of the moderate area attainment date, but would be reclassified as serious. The area would then be required to implement BACM on non-de minimis anthropogenic source categories (see discussion in section VI). However, subsequent to such reclassification, the area may later apply for a waiver of the serious area attainment date if it can demonstrate that even after implementing BACM (and after considering the extended attainment and post-attainment provisions of sections 188 and 189 of the Act), nonanthropogenic emissions will prevent the area from attaining the NAAQS.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

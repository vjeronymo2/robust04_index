			<p>930709 FT  09 JUL 93 / Hunger strike Serb in danger A TEAM of doctors appointed by the Serbian government yesterday appealed to the authorities for the 'urgent release' of jailed opposition leader Vuk Draskovic 'in order to avoid a fatal outcome'. The condition of Mr Draskovic, on hunger strike for the past week, was 'rapidly deterioriating' and there were fears for his life, the doctors warned in a letter to a Belgrade court. They said they could not be held responsible for his health if he and his wife Danica, jailed on June 1 after street protests left one policeman dead, were not released. Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has rebuffed international appeals for the release of Mr Draskovic, who was beaten badly by police during his arrest. But the Serb leader may now choose to release Serbia's most popular opposition politician rather than risk unrest in the event of his death. The deterioration in Mr Draskovic's health came as Mr Thorvald Stoltenberg and Lord Owen, the international peace mediators, arrived in Belgrade to urge leaders of warring Serbs, Croats and Moslems to end bloodshed in Bosnia. They met Mr Milosevic and his federal Yugoslav counterpart after talks on Wednesday with Mr Franjo Tudjman, the Croatian president. Asked what would happen if all three sides failed to reach agreement by July 20, a deadline set by Bosnian Serb leaders for Moslems to back the republic's partition on ethnic lines, Mr Stoltenberg said: 'If we don't find a compromise by that date, I fear an intensification of the war.' Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, has warned that his forces would push for total defeat of the mainly-Moslem Bosnian army if partition is rejected. But Bosnia's Moslem President Alija Izetbegovic indicated yesterday his people might have to accept a three-way partition of the country if this was imposed on them and if the alternative was war without end. In a radio interview, Mr Izetbegovic said: 'Bosnia is not going to commit suicide,' apparently ruling out a fight to the finish. Bosnia's Moslems are confined to isolated pockets at the mercy of their Serb and Croat enemies. Serb commanders have all but stopped the flow of overland aid to Sarajevo, without water and electricity for the past month. The World Health Organisation said hospital services in Sarajevo were on the brink of collapse and warned of an impending catastrophe on a scale unseen in Europe 'since the dark days of the second world war'. Five independent international aid agencies said Sarajevo's 380,000 residents were 'reverting to the most desperate measures to stay alive'.</p>

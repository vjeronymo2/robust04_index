			<p>920617 FT  17 JUN 92 / Letter (1): Price to be paid for bus deregulation Sir, I would like to add to your excellent editorial, 'A better way for buses' (June 5). Passenger miles have indeed declined as people use their own transport in preference to deregulated buses, but not everyone has that choice. As the bus network decays so more and more of those least able to fend for themselves - the poor, the old, the disabled - become isolated and imprisoned in the homes. Some measure of mobility is achieved in shire counties by providing low-cost bus routes on the back of home-to-school or social service runs, but this life line for the disadvantaged is not mentioned by the government in its advice to the Commission on Local Government reorganisation; it must be regarded as under threat.

			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Honda cuts full-year forecast after 60% fall DESPITE a buoyant market for motorcycles in Asia, Honda Motor suffered a decline of about 60 per cent in pre-tax profits for the first half of 1993. Honda said that depressed demand in Japan and Europe, a slower than expected recovery in its US business and the adverse impact of a high yen had all contributed to the deterioration in performance. Parent company pre-tax profits fell 62 per cent to Y11.1bn (Pounds 70m), from Y29.2bn, on sales down 6 per cent to Y1,256bn. On a consolidated basis, pre-tax profits dropped 60 per cent to Y22.5bn, while sales were 12.6 per cent down at Y1,874bn. The outlook remains grim and Honda has revised down its forecasts for the full year. Consolidated sales are now expected to total Y3,744bn rather than the Y4,000bn forecast in May. Net profits are expected to be Y17.3bn compared with an earlier estimate of Y23bn. While the weakness of the economy was an important factor behind the downturn in sales of motorcycles and cars, Honda also suffered from a poor product mix. Earlier in the year its high-selling Accord met consumer resistance before an autumn model change. Honda was also late to introduce a line-up of recreational vehicles in Japan and was so unable to capitalise fully on the boom in this market. In the US, Honda's largest car market, the group was hit by the sharp rise of the yen. Unit sales fell 6 per cent because of greater competition from the Big Three US carmakers and the slow pace of recovery. The half-year performance was helped by strong demand for motorcycles in Asia, including China, where Honda expects to increase local production of motorcycles from 380,000 units in 1992 to 580,000 this year. Production of motorcycles in Asia (excluding Japan) is expected to total 2.73m units this year, or 64 per cent of Honda's worldwide motorcycle production. In the Asean countries, exports of cars rose 35 per cent between January and October. Honda is limiting capital expenditure to Y145bn, compared with a projected Y180bn, cutting development costs and keeping a tight lid on recruitment.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (1): All change in the race for efficiency - Geoffrey Owen on the myriad fashions that help change the face of mass production COUNTRY COMPETITIVENESS: TECHNOLOGY AND THE ORGANISING OF WORK by Bruce Kogut (editor) Oxford University Press Pounds 30 270 pages THE BRITISH RENAISSANCE By Jeffrey Ferry Heinemann Pounds 17.50 318 pages Towards the end of the last century US companies such as Singer, the sewing machine manufacturer, were perfecting the techniques of standardisation and mass production which were the basis for their success in world markets. American bicycles, among other products, were exported in large numbers to Europe. In this case, British entrepreneurs were quick learners. By importing American machine tools, lowering costs and improving quality, they overtook the US and established an export lead which lasted for much of this century, until they, in turn, were overtaken by Taiwan and other Far East producers. Bicycles were an exception. In other industries American methods were slow to take root in Britain. In cars, the craft traditions of British skilled workers limited the ability of employers to organise the shop floor on the principles laid down by Frederick Taylor and later refined by Henry Ford. Despite the presence before the first world war of American-owned factories like Singer's in Glasgow and Ford's in Manchester, their example was not widely followed. In the inter-war period, only a few British enterprises imitated the multi-divisional structure pioneered by Du Pont and General Motors as a means of administering large, diversified corporations. After 1945 the productivity lag was clearly recognised. Britain, like the rest of Europe, attempted to close the gap by encouraging American inward investment, learning from American management consultants and creating American-type business schools. US management methods in such fields as budgetary control spread more widely. But in the 1970s a new way of organising production, originating in Japan, began to displace the US model: mass production was superseded by quality production. Japanese 'transplants', like the Nissan factory at Sunderland, were the new role models. Managers in Europe and North America became avid students of Japanese practices. US manufacturers found adjustment difficult. In the car industry the rigid definition of tasks in American plants, the elimination of worker discretion, the role of unions in maintaining tight job specifications - all this was ill-suited to the new era of flexible specialisation. Between the 1950s and the 1980s the famous Toyota Production System, involving relationships of trust and reciprocal learning between vehicle assembler and component supplier, was gradually developed. A new 'organisation culture' emerged in response to the particular circumstances which the Japanese motor industry faced during those years. Transferring such a culture to the very different market and institutional environment of the US could only take place after a long period of experimentation. The institutional obstacles to the diffusion of 'best practice' from one country to another form the central theme in Country Competitiveness, a collection of academic papers edited by Bruce Kogut. The book makes a valuable contribution to the debate about shifting competitive advantage between nations and about what governments and companies can do about it. Most of the papers have the great merit of being based on detailed research at company level in Europe, the US and Japan. The book shows how history has influenced each country's industrial strengths and weaknesses. For example, education and technology policy in Japan has long given priority to engineering; Japan has provided a less favourable environment than the US for scientific research and this is one of the reasons for the relative weakness of its science-based industries such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals. In their chapter on machine tools Arndt Sorge and Marc Maurice show how institutional differences between France and Germany affected their response to the external shocks of the 1970s and 1980s - the introduction of computer numerical control (CNC) and the rise of the Japanese. They stress that two industries are embedded in their respective economic and social settings. The German industry has close relationships with technical universities, especially at Aachen, Berlin and Stuttgart, where the production, engineering and machine tool departments enjoy a high standing. The French industry is not backed by an academic establishment as large or as highly regarded as in Germany, and cross-fertilisation between the two is much less in evidence. No less important is the issue of skills. The Germans were able to graft CNC expertise into existing education and training profiles, starting from craft worker apprenticeships. Whereas the French work force was segmented between shop floor operators and more highly skilled specialists, there was a greater 'professional continuity' in Germany between worker, technician and engineering graduate. This institutional background is also highlighted in Gary Herrigel's study of small and medium-sized enterprises in Baden Wurttemberg. These companies have been extraordinarily successful in traditional areas of manufacturing such as machinery, vehicle components and textiles. 'They produce an almost infinite array of special industrial products in virtually infinite variety'. Their ability to combine specialisation with flexibility, Herrigel argues, is 'based on a system that socialises risks across a broad array of public and private organisations', including educational institutions, trade associations and chambers of commerce, banks and the regional government. Institutional advantages are not, of course, valid for all time. It is possible that the world machine tool industry, increasingly driven by the Japanese, is evolving in a way which makes the decentralized Baden Wurttmberg model less appropriate. The economies of scale which the leading Japanese companies enjoy seem to be forcing the German producers to give up their tradition of independence and band together in larger groups. Whether the German model can be adapted to the industry's changed circumstances is not yet clear. A much more obvious case of institutional inertia is Britain. In a paper on the car industry Ulrich Jurgens describes how different countries and companies have handled the shift from Fordism to specialisation. To meet Japanese competition, new approaches to work organisation were needed, with the emphasis on more flexible and more highly skilled workers and on delegation of tasks to autonomous teams. Despite the weakening of British trade unions through legislation and high unemployment, multinational companies with plants in the UK, Germany and the US found their British plants the most resistant to the new concepts. It proved impossible to initiate a process of institutional change that would be jointly supported by unions and management. Britain, says Jurgens, was 'not particularly fertile soil for developing independent non-Taylorist forms for regulating labour in the l980s'. This reminder of the malign legacy of Britain's industrial relations history is a useful offset to the euphoric picture presented in Jeffrey Ferry's The British Renaissance. This is a story of how international competition 'blasted away the old world' in Britain, removing the dead wood and allowing new companies to surge forward. 'Thrilled at their liberation, they seized on the newest, freshest, youngest, most exciting new ideas in strategy and management and went to work'. The book consists of racy descriptions, based on interviews at several levels of the workforce, of six British companies. Four are 'turnarounds' - Oxford Automotive Components (OAC), which is owned by Unipart, Guinness, TI Group (formerly Tube Investments) and ICL - which 'have literally changed from companies with their great days behind them to companies with their greatest days yet to come'. The other two - Virgin Group and Control Techniques - were entrepreneurial start-ups which have become 'world-leading innovators' in their businesses, airlines and electronic drives. The blurb makes extravagant claims for the book - 'destined to become for British managers what In Search of Excellence was to Americans.' It is neither an instructional book from which clear management lessons can be drawn, nor a serious analysis of how competitive problems were overcome. It does, however, have other strengths. Although Ferry devotes some attention to the leaders of the companies like Peter Bonfield at ICL, John Neill at Unipart and Trevor Wheatley at Control Techniques, pride of place is given to managers and workers closer to the 'sharp end' of industrial change. Thus the transformation of OAC, once a notoriously inefficient part of British Leyland, is seen through the eyes of the plant manager, Roger Ball, whose first experience of Japanese methods came when he ran the BSA-Triumph motor cycle factory in the 1970s. Determined to learn from the collapse of the motor cycle industry, he studied Japanese methods and became a specialist in applying just-in-time techniques to old factories. Part of his programme at OAC was to send a group of shop floor workers to Japan to see how quality and volume production could be combined. Do such examples support the claim that a British renaissance is taking place? There is not much doubt that there have been important industrial changes in the past 15 years and that some of the institutional obstacles which impeded competitiveness in the early post-war period and before have been removed. But if, as the contributors to Kogut's book argue, competitiveness increasingly depends on how work is organised and on the education and skills of the workers, further institutional reform is certainly needed. Hugh Whittaker's chapter on British and Japanese factories reaches the conclusion that 'British managers have some way to go in tapping and building the innovative potential of those nearest the work process. To this end, more fundamental reforms in employment relations are probably necessary'. Historical patterns of organisation, based on long-established social and institutional arrangements, are slow to change. But if a convergence on best practice is taking place, Britain is much better equipped to participate in it than was the case 20 years ago.</p>

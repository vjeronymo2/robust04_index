[Spokesman] Yes. Our party's foreign-related contacts have  always remained a major part of our party's work, as well as an  important element of China's diplomatic work as a whole.  General Secretary Jiang stressed in his report to the 14th  party congress: "The Communist Party of China attaches great  importance to its ties with political parties in all countries."  Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central  Committee, our party has made major readjustments to the  principle of foreign-related work in light of the development of  the international situation. As a result, our party is focusing  its foreign-related work on achieving an international  environment which is favorable to China's modernization drive  and making greater contributions to peace and development  throughout the world. The party also advocates making friends  far and wide and seeks common ground on major issues while  reserving differences on minor ones when dealing with other  parties. Moreover, the substance and pattern of cooperation have  also gone beyond purely political contacts to multi-level  cooperation which aims at pushing forward economic and  technological exchanges. In this way, the party's  foreign-related work can be carried out much more extensively,  and the party has gradually expanded its contacts and exchanges  with all kinds of political parties and organizations in the  world. Our party has formally drawn up and written into its  Constitution four principles guiding the establishment of  party-to-party relations with political parties of all kinds:  independence and self-reliance, total equality, mutual respect,  and non-interference in one another's internal affairs.  Alongside China's development, which has attracted attention  throughout the world, the trend of foreign political parties  seeking normal ties and expanding exchanges and cooperation with  our party out of their own considerations is also gathering  momentum, and our party's contacts with all kinds of political  parties are becoming more extensive and active. Our party has  maintained relations, in different forms, with over 200  political parties in more than 100 countries, among which there  are not only communist parties but also socialist parties,  social democratic parties, labor parties, and other parties in  developed countries, as well as political parties in developing  countries. On the basis of such extensive exchanges, we attach  special importance to our ties with major political parties all  over the world.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What are your comments on the international  situation in 1993, especially the situation of political parties  in different countries?    [Spokesman] The year 1993 witnessed profound and  comprehensive changes in the world. China's ties with other  countries underwent further development, and the international  situation proved to be more favorable to our country.    Amid the profound international changes of the past year,  changes within political parties were especially prominent and  have had a certain impact on the political situation of their  countries. Major parties in some Western countries which had  been in a ruling position for a long time, lost their ruling  status in elections and gave way to a number of new and smaller  parties, and ultra-rightist and local splittist forces gained  favor in some countries. Different political forces in a number  of eastern European and central Asian countries continue to go  through the process of disintegration and reorganization, and an  intricate and complex situation has been registered in the  strengths of different political parties. Under this new  situation, our party made new breakthroughs in its ties with  political parties in other countries.    [RENMIN RIBAO] What breakthroughs did the CPC make in its  relations with political parties from its neighboring countries  in 1993?    [Spokesman] The CPC has always attached importance to  strengthening its relations with political parties in other  countries, especially those of our neighboring countries. In  1993, General Secretary Jiang Zemin and several Standing  Committee members of the CPC Central Committee met on separate  occasions with a number of delegations of major foreign parties.  Comrade Hu Jintao, Standing Committee member of the CPC  Political Bureau, headed a party and government delegation to  North Korea to attend celebrations of "the 40th Anniversary of  the Victory of the Motherland's Liberation War;" and Comrade  Ding Guangeng, member of the CPC Political Bureau and the  Secretariat, led a CPC delegation to visit Vietnam and Laos. At  the beginning of 1994, a CPC delegation headed by Comrade Wen  Jiabao, alternate member of the CPC Political Bureau and member  of the Secretariat, paid a visit to Singapore on its way to  India and Bangladesh. All these important overseas visits have  further augmented the mutual understanding and friendship  between the CPC and the ruling parties of these countries and  have served to give a major impetus to the development of  China's friendly cooperative ties with these neighboring  countries and their peoples.    While maintaining our existing relations with Japan's  Liberal Democratic Party and the Japanese Socialist Party, we  have also had extensive contacts with other political parties  which participate in Japan's government and political affairs,  including the New Party, Shinseito, and other political parties  with which we have not yet established formal relations. We  have also set up ties with South Korea's Democratic Liberal  Party. Our party's friendly relations with the ruling party of  Mongolia have also made further progress. Our exchanges with  political parties in south and central Asian countries, such as  India, have also been strengthened. The senior leaders of both  the ruling and opposition parties of Bangladesh visited China  separately in 1993. Our party has established ties with all  ruling parties and major opposition parties in the south Asian  countries.    [RENMIN RIBAO] In addition to our neighboring Asian  countries, can you also brief us on our party's ties with  political parties in Latin American and African countries?    [Spokesman] Political parties in the developing countries  generally follow China's reform and opening up with close  interest as well as its practice of building socialism with  Chinese characteristics. They have cherished the good will of  promoting positive ties with the CPC. Major political parties  and the leading figures of many Latin American countries have  visited China one after another. Rafael Caldera, the newly  elected president of Venezuela, had cordial meetings with party  leaders and began making his election speech during his friendly  visit to Tibet. During their visit to China, the leaders of  Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party exchanged extensive  views and experience on how to rule the party and administer the  country as well as on issues of common concern. Important  political parties and public figures from some Latin American  countries which have not yet established diplomatic relations  with China, such as Honduras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua, also  paid visits to our country one after another in 1993. The  Chinese NPC delegation was given a warm reception during its  visit to Paraguay by friends from the country's political  parties who had visited China before. Our persistence in  establishing relations with ruling parties and major opposition  parties in countries which have not yet established diplomatic  relations with China has undoubtedly had a positive impact on  promoting our ties with these countries.    It has been a long time since our party began to set up ties  with parties in African countries. In 1993, we established new  relations with some more political parties. The CPC has always  enjoyed friendly relations with political parties and  organizations which oppose racial segregation and fight for  racial liberation. Such friendly exchanges have been further  boosted alongside the progress South Africa has made in the  peace process. In 1993, the principal leaders of the African  National Congress of South Africa, the South African Communist  Party, and the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania visited China  on invitation, while our party also sent delegations to visit  South Africa on two occasions. Meanwhile, our party also  carried out friendly exchanges with the ruling parties, parties  participating in government and political affairs, and major  opposition parties of other African countries in 1993.    [RENMIN RIBAO] It has been learned that the CPC has added  the serving economic construction to its foreign-related work in  recent years. What progress did the party achieve in this area  in 1993?    [Spokesman] It has indeed been a special feature of our  party's foreign-related work in recent years to, through the  channels of exchanges with political parties and mass groups,  act as go-between for relevant economic departments and  localities inside the country, to introduce foreign capital,  technology, and able personnel from abroad, and to provide  direct services for our country's socialist modernization drive.  We have already done a great deal and have attained positive  results in promoting economic, trade, and technological  cooperation. Our efforts to carry out economic and trade  activities with economic organizations recommended by foreign  political parties have been welcomed by political parties in all  countries. Initial results have also been achieved in  introducing foreign investment through the political party  channel. During their overseas visits, the leading comrades  from the party organizations of the relevant provinces and  cities have also paid attention to establishing positive  economic and trade ties or cooperation with relevant countries.  Upon the invitation of political parties and organizations in a  number of countries, we have sent several delegations and groups  to these countries to conduct special-topic studies on issues  concerning relations between the central authorities and  localities, relations between the market economy and  macroeconomic control, as well as the social insurance system.  This is also one of our attempts to provide direct services for  the building of the four modernizations.    [RENMIN RIBAO] How are the party's relations with political  parties in Western countries?    [Spokesman] It is another major feature of the CPC's  foreign-related work under the new situation not to base our  party-to-party contacts on ideological differences and common  grounds. In 1993, our party-to-party exchanges with Germany,  France, and Britain underwent new progress during the process in  which we strived to promote and improve our ties with political  parties of Western countries through various means. Contacts  with the Socialist Party International and other international  political organizations, including their member parties, also  tend to be more active. In joint sponsorship with the  subordinate research institutions of Nordrhein-Westfalen,  Germany, we held a symposium on "Europe's unified general market  and China" and invited more than 10 people from the European  Communities and Nordrhein-Westfalen to carry out extensive and  frank discussions with the relevant Chinese counterparts on a  number of issues, including the opportunities and challenges  presented to China by the unified general market of the European  Communities, opposition to trade protectionism, standardization  of product quality and technology, and intellectual property  rights. This symposium proved to play a positive role in  augmenting mutual understanding and establishing mutually  beneficial economic and trade cooperation ties between the two  sides.    [RENMIN RIBAO] New progress was indeed made in the party's  exchanges with other political parties in 1993. We would like  to ask you to say a few more words to our readers on a general  appraisal of the party's contacts with other political parties  in the past year and on the party's work in the new year.    [Spokesman] In 1993, under the guidance of the spirit of the  14th party congress, our party always took the overall  diplomatic situation into consideration when carrying out its  foreign-related work, concentrated its energy and attention on  key issues, and attained fairly satisfactory results. Based on  our already established ties with political parties of all  types, our party set up new relations with another 18 political  parties in 11 countries in the past year. Facts have clearly  shown that the CPC is enjoying a greater role in international  affairs by building bridges for party-to-party contacts, making  more friends, enhancing understanding, and promoting friendly  cooperation.    The reason why our party's foreign-related work can undergo  continued development and expansion under the new situation is  that, first, the world-famous tremendous achievements attained  by China in its reform, opening up, and economic construction  have been attached with great importance by political parties of  all countries in the world and have aroused their interest in  establishing or expanding ties with our party; second, as  China's ruling and leading party, the CPC is playing a decisive  role in political life within the country. Political parties  from foreign countries all want to initiate contacts and  cooperate with our party. Our party has always attached great  importance to its foreign-related work, regarding the work as  one important component of China's diplomatic work as a whole.  Contacts among political parties have always been an important  aspect of international exchanges. This is especially true  during major changes in the international structure, for  political parties from many countries will feel a greater need  to exchange views and experiences with each other on various  issues and seek possibilities for cooperation through  party-to-party contacts.    It can be predicted that various political powers will  continue to divide and reorganize during 1994. This colorful  world can provide the CPC with a vaster area in which to carry  out its foreign-related work. As always, we will adhere to the  four principles of independence and self-reliance, total  equality, mutual respect, and noninterference in one another's  internal affairs; will strengthen our ties with political  parties of all types in a more extensive and comprehensive way;  will carry out sincere cooperation with them; and will make  greater common contributions to the peace and prosperity of the  world and to the progress and development of mankind. (This  newspaper's year-end reports conclude here. We wish to take  this opportunity to extend our thanks to the yearenders' authors  and the vast numbers of our readers.)</p>

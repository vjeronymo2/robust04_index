			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / International Company News: Hasbro expects record quarter but closes plant Hasbro, the biggest US toy maker, expects to report record fourth-quarter revenues and earnings next month. It also announced that it planned to close its manufacturing plant in Ter Apel, in the Netherlands, this year with the loss of 162 jobs. The Netherlands plant, which specialises in making games and puzzles, is one of three Hasbro plants in Europe. The others - in Waterford, Ireland, and Valencia, Spain - are larger, and make toys as well as games and puzzles. Hasbro said it had decided, after an analysis of its European manufacturing capacity, that its needs could be more efficiently met by closing the Netherlands plant and transferring production to the larger factories. The plant closure will result in a Dollars 15m charge to pre-tax profits in the fourth quarter. Hasbro said that after-tax earnings before non-recurring charges would have been more than 15 per cent higher in the quarter than a year earlier.</p>

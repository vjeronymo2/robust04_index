			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Technology (Worth Watching): People-mover on a low-cost journey A unique tram system powered by a rechargeable flywheel has this week been awarded its UK patent, writes Tim Burt. JM Parry Associates, the company which developed the system, claims it offers a low-cost alternative to light rail systems relying on overhead wires or electrified rails. Local authorities in a number of UK cities have already conducted tests on the Parry People Movers, which operate on narrow gauge tracks which fit on to existing roadways or sidewalks. The tram cars are powered by electricity supplied through short conductor rails along the track. At each halt, the flywheel recharges for the next stage of the journey.

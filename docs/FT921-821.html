			<p>920327 FT  27 MAR 92 / Shrink-wrapped words Slowly, day by day, the Conservatives' confidence is slipping away. They still speak of victory, but with faltering voice. The second week of the election campaign has been no kinder to them than the first. The reckoning is the same. The contest was timed to coincide with the depths of a prolonged recession. The Budget misfired. The manifesto made little impact. The prime minister's quiet charm is an asset, but his apparent lack of forcefulness as a public speaker is not. Thus for the Tories the balance sheet of the first fortnight makes grim reading. Their strategy is flawed; their tactics inept; their leader disappointing. What they need to lift their spirits is a convincing turnaround in this weekend's crop of opinion polls. It is a slim chance, but it could happen. That is why the Conservatives have not yet cracked. They do not feel that they are certain to lose. The scores registered in the polling that took place yesterday and continues today and perhaps tomorrow will be important. The results, when we see them, just might indicate that Tuesday night's celebrated Labour political broadcast on the National Health Service, featuring a little girl in pain, has done the opposition more harm than good. That, at any rate, is the Tories' hope. On Wednesday, the row about the degree to which the film accurately represented the true facts of an individual case was belatedly recognised by Conservative central office as an opportunity. Led by Mr John Major, the senior figures in the administration drew adjectives out of a hat and pelted them across the airwaves at Mr Neil Kinnock. The hunt was on. The expectation was that the Conservative tabloids would come to the aid of the party. They did. Their hounds were set the task of catching Mr Kinnock and tearing him to pieces. Until this week Labour's rose pimpernel had led them a merry dance. Now the Tories dreamed, he would be caught, exposed as unfit to govern. Their initial strategy was based on the anticipation of a big event, a grievous error by their opponents, an electrifying issue - something that could enable them to impugn the character and judgment of Mr Kinnock. Perhaps this was it. Perhaps it was. Nobody can yet tell for sure. We are all slaves to Mori, Gallup, NOP, ICM and the other witchdoctors of the modern electoral process. This weekend they will test the conventional wisdom, which is that bickering over details of who said what merely bemuses the average voter. What is more to the point is that when prominence is given to allegations that the health service is 'underfunded', or 'two-tier' or otherwise imperfect, Labour benefits. It always has. I expect the same to happen this time. Meanwhile, I see no reason to anticipate any significant change of voting intention in either direction. For most of this year, the two larger parties have been running neck-and-neck. That suggests a hung parliament. During the past fortnight, Labour has edged ahead by one or two percentage points. That suggests that it might be the largest party in such a parliament. There are other possibilities. Individual polls stimulate widely different conclusions. Some award an overall majority to the Conservatives one day and, on the following day, a result near to that for Labour. But the moving averages tell a duller, more credible tale. In sum, it is: Tories 39 per cent, Labour 40-41 per cent; both holding. If that pattern sticks for the next fortnight it should put Mr Kinnock into Number 10 Downing Street. I say 'should' rather than 'will' because this is a funny old election. A movement of a fraction of a percentage point in the overall share of votes cast could result in the Conservatives being the largest party. A differential swing in the regions, or the key marginals, could achieve the same result. The Tories, who only a couple of years ago were serenely confident of their invincibility, are thus reduced to clawing for fractions, fighting for a draw. They have to move fast to erode Labour's distinct lead, and a whole lot further to recapture the extra three or four percentage points that would give them an overall majority. They have been expecting signs that some of the necessary succour will come from Liberal Democrats who would rather vote Tory than endure a Labour government. Even that hope begins to fade. Meanwhile, there are plenty of real questions facing the electorate. Just how is growth to be resumed? What chance is there for either public spending or tax cuts while the public sector borrowing requirement heads for the stratosphere? These are not being debated with any sense of rationality. Britain's membership of the exchange rate mechanism is not an election issue. The environment has been sidetracked. Our politicians are offering us nothing but shrink-wrapped words. On today's figures, no party is set for an overall majority. They all deserve to lose.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] AL-WAFD published on its first page Sunday [as  published--the picture was in the Saturday 22 January edition] a  disgraceful picture of German model Claudia Schiffer. Eight  full days passed and only in Indonesia were the Muslims'  feelings aroused. They forwarded a strongly worded protest to  the German Government, while the Islamic institutions in Egypt  maintained complete silence.    Finally, the Religious Affairs Committee of the People's  Assembly made a move and released a statement urging the boycott  of the House of Chanel. The statement was issued after the  house apologized to the Muslims and pledged to destroy the dress  that was embroidered with Koranic verses and the dress's  pictures and films.    The Religious Affairs Committee discovered the tragedy after  AL-WAFD published the story and the picture twice with sharp  comment, appealing to those responsible for Islamic affairs in  Egypt to move and confront the West's badness and depravity.    The unconsciousness of the officials in Egypt could be  tolerated in every other respect, but not in what causes harm to  Islam and the holy Koran. We cannot but ask the People's  Assembly: Where have you been all these past days? We also say  to all religious bodies and organizations, at the top of which  are al-Azhar's ulema: Wake up.</p>

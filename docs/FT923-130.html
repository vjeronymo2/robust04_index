			<p>920930 FT  30 SEP 92 / Big users' gas bills condemned VERY large gas users face considerably higher prices than users in some European countries and have not seen any price benefits from measures to introduce competition into the UK gas market, Mr Ian Powe, director of the Gas Consumers Council, said yesterday. His comments will strengthen demands for lower energy prices from UK industry, where many customers are already complaining about electricity prices. The Gas Consumers Council, which represents 18m British customers, said yesterday one reason for the price rise for large users was the requirement  -imposed by the Office of Fair Trading - that British Gas must halve its share of the industrial supply market by the mid 1990s. The release gas programme, whereby British Gas sells off tranches of its contracted gas supplies to competitors, was inadequate, and the only way BG could cut its market share was by putting up prices. That in turn did not give an incentive to independent marketers to cut prices as much as they might. The GCC will shortly report to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, which is engaged in a comprehensive inquiry into the UK gas market. British Gas said that in real terms UK industrial contract prices had dropped by 30 per cent since the company was privatised in 1986. BG accepted, though, that prices for large users were higher than in some European countries. In contrast, domestic gas customers paid less than in Italy, the Benelux countries, France and Germany. Mr Powe told a conference in Brussels there was 'a stark difference, to the disadvantage of UK Limited, in prices paid in the big gas-consuming countries of Europe and the UK at higher consumption levels'. While household users have benefited from a tough price formula that has produced two recent price cuts, unregulated industrial prices were creeping up, he added.</p>

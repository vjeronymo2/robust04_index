			<p><P> November 6, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;  </P> <P> POLICE STILL LOOKING FOR RAPE SUSPECT  </P> <P> The man who raped a 13-year-old girl Saturday night in the Broadmoor Homes  development may be the same one who kidnaped and sexually molested a  29-year-old mentally retarded woman in early October, police said Monday.  </P> <P> "We're pretty sure it's one and the same man, considering the method of tying  up the girl and all that," Sgt. Richard Downing said.  </P> <P> Investigators spent Monday canvassing the Avenida Presidio neighborhood above  San Clemente High School in search of clues from the Saturday night attack. No  one has been arrested.  </P> <P> According to police, the victim was home alone when the doorbell rang. As she  approached the unlocked door, the suspect barged inside and forced her into  another room where she was tied up, blindfolded, gagged and raped.  </P> <P> The attack was interrupted when the victim's mother returned home about 8:30  p.m., but the suspect managed to escape without being seen.  </P> <P> "We really have nothing new on the case yet," Police Chief Albert C. Ehlow  said. "We had a female officer question the victim late this afternoon after  giving her some time to come down emotionally from the incident."  </P> <P> Police said that in the October incident the suspect apparently picked up the  victim near Avenida Pico. She was blindfolded and tied up before she was  assaulted in an apartment. She was released later in the Dana Point area.  </P> <P> The only description police have to work with is that the suspect is an  unshaven Caucasian male, about 20 years old.  </P> <P> Although police declined to say whether the victim of Saturday's attack was a  student at Shorecliffs Junior High School, Principal Chris Cairns said he will  ask San Clemente police to give students some crime prevention advice. The  victim lived in the Shorecliffs attendance area.  </P> <P> "I think an officer could probably educate students regarding locking doors  when they're home alone, and home safety, things like that," Cairns said.  </P> <P> Janet Dunford, a police community service officer, said the most important  thing for children to do while home alone is to make sure doors and windows are  locked.  </P> <P> "Children should also find out who is at the door before letting anyone in,"  Dunford said. "It's always good to have a plan of defense ahead of time so if  an attack did occur it might be easier to respond." LEN HALL  </P></p>

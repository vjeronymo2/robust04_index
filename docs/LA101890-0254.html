			<p><P> October 18, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> DE KLERK LIFTS NATAL EMERGENCY  </P> <P> President Frederik W. de Klerk today lifted the state of emergency in  violence-torn Natal province, meeting a key demand that had slowed peace talks  with the African National Congress.  </P> <P> "The state of emergency has now been completely lifted," De Klerk told a news  conference.  </P> <P> "There is only one route to peace and reconciliation -- that is through  peaceful negotiation." He said the door to negotiations "is now fully open and  I am appealing to all leaders and all South Africans to accept the challenge."  </P> <P> The ANC welcomed the move. It has long demanded the emergency be lifted as a  condition for full-scale negotiations on black-white power sharing and ending  apartheid. A power struggle there between the ANC and the conservative Inkatha  movement has claimed 5,000 lives since 1986.  </P></p>

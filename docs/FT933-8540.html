			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Cookery: It's time to pass the pork, please TO AVOID eating pork in summer is a safety precaution that no longer applies in this age of refrigeration. Old prejudices are not easily dispelled, however, and many butchers still find it hard to sell pork when there is no 'R' in the month. To encourage more shoppers, summer pork is often sold cut-price - good news for bargain hunters. Pork tonnato makes a fine summer party dish at half the cost of veal tonnato. Another splendid choice is loin of pork boned and rolled round a stuffing of mushrooms or prunes and pistacchio. This is braised in a glass or two of white wine with the pork bones and rind alongside the joint so that the amber liquid sets to a jelly that can be chopped and served with the succulent cold meat. August is, however, a holiday month, the time when most cooks hang up their aprons so far as entertaining is concerned. Homely dishes suitable for family picnics and speedy suppers to serve at the end of a long day's outing are what is needed. Kitchens in rented holiday cottages tend to be basic, so the simpler the cooking the better. Making sausagemeat and pate mixtures from lean belly of pork is fun and not very hard work. This month at any rate, rather than make my own sausagemeat from scratch, I favour buying the best sausages the butcher offers (or buying a reliable, high meat content supermarket offering, such as Waitrose's Traditional Pork Sausages). Take the meat out of the skins, work in a few extra seasonings and use it to make such things as sausage rolls, scotch eggs and meatballs. To put such dishes on the menu will win no marks for originality, but if they are freshly cooked and prepared with care, they may earn the cook a standing ovation from senior as well as junior Billy Bunters. SCOTCH QUAILS' EGGS (makes two dozen) No larger than plums, the ratio of meat to egg makes these especially good. Eat them on the day of making, preferably hot from the pan, with a salad, or, more traditionally, eat them cold. 2 dozen quails' eggs (or 1 dozen hen's eggs), hard-boiled, cooled and shelled; 1 1/2 lb meaty, coarse cut sausages; 1 garlic clove, crushed; fresh torn tarragon leaves; 1-2 tablespoons freshly grated Parmesan cheese; Dijon mustard; 2 beaten eggs;  1/4 lb fine, dried breadcrumbs; oil for frying. Strip the skins from the sausages and mash the meat with a fork in a soup plate, gradually working in the garlic, tarragon and Parmesan. Divide the mixture into 24 pieces. Flatten them, one at a time, on a damp work surface into a circle large enough to wrap round a quail's egg. Spread each circle with a little mustard, place a shelled egg on top and mould the sausagemeat round it firmly and evenly, making sure there are no cracks. Roll the meat-enrobed eggs in highly seasoned flour, dip in beaten egg and coat with breadcrumbs. Chill to set the coating, for at least 15 minutes, before frying in batches in oil heated to 350-360 F (180-185 C). They will need about four minutes. Drain well. SAUSAGE ROLLS (makes 20) Delicious hot and almost as good cold. Ideally the added seasonings should be mixed into the sausagemeat an hour or more before baking to allow flavours to blend. 1 lb meaty, coarse cut sausages; 1 garlic clove, crushed or finely chopped; the leaves stripped from a few sprigs of thyme and oregano (or chopped rosemary needles or shredded sage leaves); 11-12oz ready-made puff pastry; beaten egg to glaze. Strip the skins from the sausages and mash the meat with a fork in a soup plate, gradually working in the garlic, herbs, and a little salt. Cut the pastry into six pieces. Roll each one to an oblong 4 x 12 inches and let them rest for 10 minutes. Divide the sausagemeat into six pieces and roll each piece, with floured hands on a floured work surface, into a 12in rope. Lay the 'ropes' down the length of the pastry strips, slightly to one side. Paint the pastry edges with beaten egg. Fold the pastry over the meat and seal the edges firmly, pressing with the prongs of a fork. Cut the sausage rolls into 3in lengths and transfer them to damp baking sheets. Glaze with beaten egg, slash the tops to allow steam to escape and bake for 25-30 minutes at 425 F (220 C) gas mark 7 until golden, puffed up and crisp. MEATBALLS WITH APPLE &amp; FENNEL (serves 4-5) 1lb meaty, coarse cut sausages; 1 garlic clove crushed with salt and mixed with  1/2 teaspoon bruised fennel seed; 1 dessert apple (Braeburn from New Zealand are probably the best bet just now); 2-3 fennel bulbs; 1-2 tablespoons chopped parsley;  1/4 pt Bulmer's No. 7 (or unsweetened apple juice plus 1 teaspoon vinegar); butter and olive oil for frying. Strip the skins from the sausages and mash the meat with the garlic and fennel seed. Break off small pieces of the mixture and roll into 16-20 small balls. Trim the fennel, cut the bulbs into wedges and fry them in a little butter and oil. Remove and keep warm. Then fry the apple, peeled and cut into crescent moon slices. Add a drop more oil to the pan if necessary and, when it is hot, add the meatballs. Saute them, shaking the pan to roll and turn them, until slightly crusted outside and cooked right through. Lift them out. Deglaze the pan with the cider, letting it bubble up while you scrape the meaty sediment from the pan base. Pour the gravy over the meatballs and serve them with the fennel and apple, sprinkled with parsley, on a generous bed of mashed potatoes.</p>

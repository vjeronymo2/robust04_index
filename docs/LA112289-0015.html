			<p><P> November 22, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: LOSES GROW FOR SDSU AFTER MIAMI DEFEAT  </P> <P> The San Diego State football team might have lost more than a game to Miami  last Saturday. The Aztecs might have lost several key players for their Western  Athletic Conference season-finale Saturday night against Brigham Young.  </P> <P> Reserve offensive tackle Chuck Hardaway (ankle) is out, and three starters and  the Aztecs' two long snappers are listed as questionable for the 7:05 game at  San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Listed as questionable are offensive tackle Tony Nichols (ankle), snappers  Jason Bill (ankle) and Jim Jennings (ankle), and both starting defensive ends  -- Todd Coomes (knee) and Steve Matuszewicz (knee). All except Matuszewicz, who  injured his left knee in practice Tuesday, were hurt in the 42-6 loss at Miami.  </P> <P> Coach Al Luginbill said he is concerned about the possibility of missing so  many key players, but he might be most worried about the snappers because he  has no experienced backups. He said his third choice at snapper likely would be  either freshman reserve quarterback David Lowery or freshman linebacker Bob  Shults.  </P> <P> FOOTBALL  </P> <P> Palomar College, which won its first football championship in the 45-year  history of the program, will play Ventura College in the Fifth Annual Hall of  Fame Bowl Dec. 2 at 1:30 p.m. at Balboa Stadium.  </P> <P> Palomar, the Mission Conference Southern Division champion, won its final five  games to finish 6-4. Ventura (7-3) finished second to Moorpark in the Western  State Conference Northern Division.  </P> <P> WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL  </P> <P> San Diego State outside hitter Amy Erben has been named to the All Big West  second team and middle blocker Jennifer Miller was named to the all freshman  team.  </P> <P> MEN'S BASKETBALL  </P> <P> Tim Rapp scored 36 points and Gordon McNeill added 18 as UC San Diego opened  the season with a 94-80 victory over Whittier (1-2) at home. Rick Batt had 16  points and 11 rebounds for UCSD.  </P> <P> Mike Flores, who played at Mt. Miguel High, had 28 points and 19 rebounds for  Point Loma Nazarene, but Cal State San Bernardino defeated the Crusaders,  87-80, in San Bernardino.  </P> <P> Christian Heritage defeated Alma College of Alma, Mich., 82-74, for its second  victory in as many starts.

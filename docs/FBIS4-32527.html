			<p>BFN     [Text] Belgrade, June 26 (TANJUG) -- Moslems have been  attacking Serb positions south of Doboj (northern Bosnia) for  weeks, violating the June 10 truce, a U.N. spokesman said in  Sarajevo on Sunday [26 June]. Major Rob Annink, spokesman for  the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), is quoted by REUTERS as  saying that the `(Moslem) army seems to have gained some  territory around Zavidovici, about three to four kilometres  worth.' Annink said that the Moslems had captured some  territory also around Ribnica, Serb town near Tuzla in the  north, on the road to Sarajevo.    U.N. observers registered 1,700 explosions between Ribnica  and Doboj, a stretch of 45 kilometres, on Saturday. Observers  believe that the fighting is a prelude to a full-scale battle  for control of the northern corridor through the Posavina (Sava  river valley) region which links the east and west of the  Bosnian Serb republic. Flouting the one-month Bosnia-wide  truce, Moslem Army Commander Rasim Delic on Thursday urged that  the Moslems and their new allies -- the Croats -- join forces  and mount an all-out war against the Serbs.</p>

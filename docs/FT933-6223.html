			<p>930828 FT  28 AUG 93 / Books: Hogarth, high art, low life - Anthony Curtis on the the man who invented the political cartoon HOGARTH: ART AND POLITICS, 1750-1764 by Ronald Paulson Lutterworth Press Pounds 35, 568 pages RONALD Paulson's biography of Hogarth appeared originally in two volumes in 1971. In the intervening 22 years much further research on Hogarth and his period has been accomplished. Not least by Paulson himself, who is Professor of Humanities at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Constantly widening his already encyclopaedic knowledge of this artist, Paulson arrived some time ago at a point where he has was moved to cover the whole ground again. He was especially enlightened by spending a week at the Tate scrutinising the Hogarths in the exhibition of 1971 before it opened. In 1991 Paulson published the first volume of a greatly revised biography, Hogarth: The Modern Moral Subject, 1697-1732 (Lutterworth Press Pounds 35) and in 1992 the second, Hogarth: High Art and Low, 1732-1750 (Lutterworth Press Pounds 35). With the appearance of this final volume, Paulson sets the seal on a major work of scholarship that includes both interpretation of all the works and biographical narrative. Hogarth's paintings and engravings were executed over a time-span that begins in the period of Addison's Spectator, which he regarded as a kind of Bible, and continues through the high Augustan era of Pope and Swift into the world of Dr Johnson, Garrick, Goldsmith. Although not as phenomenally successful as his younger rival Reynolds, Hogarth represents a much more significant response to the political and cultural development of the period. Queen Anne died when he was three; George III was on the throne when Hogarth himself died, aged 67, in 1764. There are many points at which his work touches on contemporary literature. Fielding was a friend and colleague; both as a novelist and as a magistrate he shared Hogarth's concern about public order and his dread of anarchy. Smollett was an enemy who satirised Hogarth as Mr Pallett in Peregrine Pickle. Sterne's way of writing fiction was positively Hogarthian. Defoe and Richardson both come into the Hogarth story. John Cleland's Fanny Hill derives from Hogarth. Paulson raises his eyebrows at the absence of any tribute to Hogarth in Ian Watt's standard The Rise of the Novel and similar studies. Hogarth was likewise deeply into poetry. One of Hogarth's earliest works was a set of illustrations for the verse satire that preceded those of Pope - Samuel Butler's Hudibras. Hogarth's genius for ridicule was already riotously in evidence here. Busy crowded woodcuts foreshadow his main painterly innovation - a pictorial work in consecutive parts, delineating the progress of an anti-hero, or an anti-heroine, containing coded references to historical and contemporary people. The tradition of the 'political cartoon' later developed by Rowlandson and Gillray stems from Hogarth. The Hudibras illustrations were followed by The Harlot's Progress - a close kinship here with The Beggar's Opera, which Paulson sees as the transitional work of the whole period and which Hogarth also illustrated. Then came The Rake's Progress - a set of paintings aimed at a single purchaser, accompanied by a parallel edition of prints for popular consumption that were sold to the public by Hogarth from his workshop on subscription. This doubling of painting and print was his usual practice: the prints were not mere copies but often differed in points of detail from their originals. In London, where Hogarth lived for his entire life, we are fortunate that much of his best work is easily accessible, not only in galleries like the Tate but also in those institutions with which Hogarth was associated: Captain Thomas Coram's hospital for Foundlings of which Hogarth was a governor - he designed the children's uniform - and St. Bartholomew's hospital. Above all, there are the 12 fine Hogarths purchased by that great 18th century collector, Sir John Soane, architect to the Bank of England. They are on view in the Sir John Soane's Museum, 12 Lincoln's Inn Fields. They consist of the eight original paintings of The Rake's Progress series and four large canvases done in the last decade of Hogarth's life when he was exercised by the corruption evident in party politics - An Election. Paulson deals with this sequence in fascinating depth, showing the contempt that Hogarth had both for the candidates and the mob. It was not only party politics that preoccupied Hogarth at this time but also the politics of art. As a youth he served his apprenticeship as a silver-plate engraver; he left his master before completing his seven-year indenture; then he became an assistant to Sir James Thornhill with whose daughter Jane he eloped. Setting up on his own as an artist-dealer in 1720, he was much concerned about the protection of engravers' copyrights in their own prints against pirates and succeeded in getting legislation through Parliament in favour of the artists. He was active as an instructor at the re-formed St Martin's Lane Academy and he joined the newly founded Society of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce (now the RSA) where the first annual exhibitions of paintings in London were held. Led by Reynolds, many leading artists left the Society and lobbied for an English Academy on the lines of those in France and Italy. When this resulted in the formation of the Royal Academy in 1768, Hogarth parted company from them. He opposed the emphasis the Academy put on the copying of canonical Renaissance models (prescribed by Reynolds in his annual Discourses to the students). By contrast Hogarth believed that they way forward for art in England was by direct, honest, often scurrilously subversive observation. Much of Paulson's final volume is taken up with Hogarth's theory of art. Hogarth expounded it himself in The Analysis of Beauty in 1750 both in a text and in two engravings. His gesture against the formal symmetry of the continental ideal was to point to the wavy line, the sinuous shape made by the letter S, as the basis of the Beautiful. His first print shows a painter's yard full of statues in S-shaped poses and surrounded on its border by stays, furniture and other examples of the S-bend. The second print shows the S-shape as formed in their movements by a group of dancers at a ball who are doing a minuet. The shape is wayward and variable - elements of variety and surprise were crucial to his theory of art. Looking at a painting also implied search. The spectator is encouraged to observe the picture closely and decode it. Here Paulson is invaluable. His glosses on the proliferation of emblems and allusions in Hogarth's work amount to a social history of the period. In his concluding chapter Paulson deals with Hogarth's last drawing, Tail Piece or The Bathos made in 1764. At this time Hogarth was under attack from the poet Churchill and in contention with both Burke and Wilkes. He inscribed on it in capitals the word FINIS, a sentiment that will now be echoed by his biographer, with a justifiable sense of triumph.</p>

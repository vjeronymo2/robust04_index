			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By RENMIN RIBAO reporter He Jiazheng (0149 0502 2973) and </F> XINHUA reporters Zhu Youdi (2612 1635 2769) and Yu Changhong  (0060 7022 3163)]    [Text] Beijing, 23 Apr (XINHUA) -- The Red Cross Society  of China [RCSC] opened its sixth national congress in Beijing  today. The congress adopted a namelist of new leaders with Jiang  Zemin as the RCSC honorary chairman; discussed outlines of the  work programs between 1995 and 1999; and formulated working  directives that "China should earnestly implement the Red Cross  Society Law and strive to develop Red Cross undertakings with  Chinese characteristics."    The RCSC marks its 90th founding anniversary in 1994. After  holding consultations and restructuring in 1950, the RCSC has  done a lot of work as a humanitarian organization providing  social aid and relief. The RCSC was New China's first organ to  regain its legitimate seat in international organizations. It  has extensively launched nongovernmental diplomatic activities  in its special capacity and has played an important role in  publicizing New China in the international arena.    Under the care of the party and government in recent years,  China's Red Cross undertakings have vigorously developed. They  have achieved remarkable results in making preparations against  disasters, providing relief during and after disasters,  supplying social services and first aid for the masses,  promoting blood donation among citizens, establishing Chinese  bone marrow banks, and cultivating young Red Cross members.  While launching various campaigns, the RCSC has advocated the  spirit of caring for others, feeling good about helping people  and self-sacrifice, and has thereby enhanced the socialist  spiritual civilization drive. The RCSC has played a special  role in linking cross-strait relations. It has actively promoted  bilateral and multilateral exchanges with Red Cross societies  from various countries and the International Red Cross  Organization, and has boosted friendly international exchanges  and cooperation. In May 1993, the RCSC successfully hosted the  fourth Asia-Pacific regional meeting of the International Red  Cross Society and Red Crescent Society in Beijing, which adopted  the historically significant "Beijing Declaration." It fully  demonstrated the RCSC's important role in the International Red  Cross movement.    On 31 October 1993, the Eighth National People's Congress  Standing Committee formally adopted the "Red Cross Society Law  of the People's Republic of China," thereby indicating that  China attaches great importance to and supports Red Cross  humanitarian undertakings. The law has provided a legal  guarantee for the development of Red Cross undertakings in China  and for links with the International Red Cross movement. It was  a landmark that China's Red Cross undertakings have entered a  new historic phase.    State Councilor Peng Peiyun spoke at the opening of the  national congress. She said: Red Cross undertakings are lofty  and great endeavors that benefit mankind. They have bright  prospects for development and need active participation and  selfless sacrifices from more people. She urged governments at  various levels and various social circles should continually  support Red Cross undertakings. She expressed the hope that Red  Cross societies at various levels and the broad masses of their  members would take into account China's reality; learn from  useful foreign experiences; do a better job while executing  their responsibilities and obligations as stipulated in the Red  Cross Society; uphold professional ethics of "humanity and  honesty"; and promote a workstyle "stressing unity, performance  of concrete tasks, and attainment of development and high  efficiency" in an effort to make more contributions to  "improving conditions of the most vulnerable groups" and to  enhancing social progress.    The namelist of the Sixth RCSC leaders adopted at today's  meeting follows: Zhao Puchu, Wang Guangying, Li Peiyao, Qian  Xinzhong, Cui Yueli, and Chen Minzhang are honorary vice  chairmen. Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference  Vice Chairman Qian Zhengying is chairman. Gu Yingqi is  executive vice chairman. Fan Baojun, Yang Chongchun, Lin  Yanzhi, Sun Boqiu, and Qu Zhe are vice chairmen. Li Changming  is secretary general.    George (?Wilberson) [wei bo xiang 7279 0130 0686], the  International Federation of Red Cross Society and Red Crescent  Society secretary general, sent a congratulatory letter to  today's meeting.</p>

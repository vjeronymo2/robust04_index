			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The downing of four aircraft in Bosnia has sparked  strong concern and feverish consultations in Athens. Naturally,  the issue arose during UK Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd's  contacts and talks with Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias, the  prime minister, and the official opposition leader Miltiadhis  Evert.    Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou is being constantly  briefed  on the developments and the Greek Government maintains an open  line with Moscow, Belgrade, and Zagreb with the aim of averting  suspension of the peace talks. Both Mr. Papoulias and his  British counterpart Douglas Hurd expressed hope that today's  incident will not hinder the peace process. The following  report by our correspondent Foivos Kardhis gives the details on  the British foreign secretary's visit:    [Begin recording] [Kardhis] The dogfight in Bosnia raised  strong concerns in Athens and with Foreign Minister Karolos  Papoulias and his British counterpart Douglas Hurd, who met  shortly afterward and expressed hope that it would not become an  unexpected obstacle to the peace process. Mr. Papoulias and Mr.  Hurd immediately had telephone conversations with Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Vitaliy Churkin and at noon with Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev. This open line with Moscow stresses  the West's conviction that this time as well Russia will have a  decisive role in averting a new crisis.    Mr. Papoulias contacted the prime minister twice to convey  to  him the latest reports from Bosnia and NATO Headquarters in  Brussels.    Mr. Hurd asserted in a harsh tone that the Atlantic alliance  is implementing a policy that was already decided upon and will  do the same in the future, whereas at his news conference he  noted that the aircraft were shot down because unlike former  violations of the no-fly zones, which were isolated, this time  the operation involved a whole formation.    However, nobody aims at a new escalation of tensions in  Bosnia a few days after the decision of [words indistinct]  military involvement by the West with the expiration of the  ultimatum on Sarajevo.    [Papoulias] It is our joint conviction that, no matter how  unpleasant and difficult what happened is, it cannot revoke the  [words indistinct] peace process. [end recording]</p>

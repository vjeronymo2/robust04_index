			<p>930113 FT  13 JAN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp Dow fall amid Gulf fears is recouped Wall Street LATE BUYING helped US share prices recover from large losses yesterday at the end of a volatile session, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.89 on balance at 3,264.64. Having spent all morning no more than 5 points above or below Monday's close, the Dow plunged more than 20 points in mid-afternoon before retrieving all of its loss in the final 30 minutes of trading. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, ending a net 0.09 firmer at 431.04, while the American SE composite finished 0.83 off at 396.41 and the Nasdaq composite down 2.95 at 679.45. Volume on the New York SE amounted to a heavy 239.4m shares. News that Iraqis had entered Kuwait for the third time increased tension in the Middle East. It also made investors even more cautious about buying stocks ahead of what might turn out to be a resumption of hostilities in the Gulf. Uncertainty about the direction of domestic economic policy also contributed to the market's lack of direction. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary designate, appeared before Congressional hearings yesterday but provided few specific details on the likely policies of the Clinton administration. Among individual stocks, Chrysler dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 34 5/8 in volume of 2.8m shares as investors reacted to the news released late on Monday that the financially stretched car manufacturer plans to bolster its balance sheet by raising nearly Dollars 1.5bn through an international offering of shares. Elsewhere in the auto sector, Ford eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 45 and General Motors held firm at Dollars 34 1/4 , largely untroubled by a report from brokerage house SG Warburg which said Ford has been gaining market share at GM's expense. IBM continued to regain some of the ground lost over recent weeks. After hitting a low last week of Dollars 45 7/8 , the stock has since risen steadily. Yesterday it added Dollars 1 at Dollars 48 3/4 in busy trading. The first batch of 1992 fourth-quarter earnings reports trickled in yesterday, with Paramount softening Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 42 3/4 in spite of news of a 22 per cent jump in the entertainment group's final quarter net income to Dollars 110.2m. Investors appeared equally unimpressed with record earnings from the Federal National Mortgage Association, which reported an 18 per cent rise in October-to-December profits to Dollars 426.4m, but saw its share price edge Dollars  3/8 lower to Dollars 77 1/8 . On the Nasdaq market, Rexon weakened Dollars 1 to Dollars 8 and Marcam plunged Dollars 5 3/4 to Dollars 21 1/4 after the two companies issued profits warnings. Canada TORONTO ended marginally firmer, lifted by a recovery in Canada's heavily weighted gold shares and strength in the utilities sector due to a jump in the shares of BCE Inc. Some of the smaller oil and gas issues also found favour. The TSE 300 index gained 4.4 at 3,314.5 but declines held an edge over advances by 312 to 298 after volume of 49.2m shares valued at CDollars 357m. BCE jumped after Bear Stearns initiated coverage on the company with a buy recommendation. Strength in BCE, up CDollars 1 3/8 at CDollars 42 1/4 on 749,058 shares, boosted Northern Telecom, which is 52.6 per cent owned by BCE. Nortel gained CDollars 1 1/4 at CDollars 53 1/4 .</p>

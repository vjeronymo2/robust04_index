			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Russian enterprises have suspended fuel supplies to  Ukraine's nuclear power stations due to persistent indebtedness.  A report by Ukraine's State Committee for the Use of Nuclear  Power circulated today says that unless the situation improves,  Ukraine will have to decommission 3.8 million kilowatts-worth of  power-generating facilities, or one-third of its nuclear  capacity, in 1994, and all of its nuclear power stations in  1995. In order to find a way out of this contingency, it is  necessary to immediately pay Russia's enterprises over 48  billion rubles for new fuel.</p>

			<p>921008 FT  08 OCT 92 / El Al jet crash probe suffers a new setback ACCIDENT investigators yesterday recovered the 'black box' flight data recorder from the El Al Boeing 747 cargo jet which crashed into two Amsterdam housing blocks on Sunday, killing at least 250 people. But Dutch officials warned that the flight recorder, which has been flown to the Farnborough Accident Investigation Centre in the UK for decoding, was badly damaged. Investigators are hoping the device will provide some key data to pinpoint the cause of the El Al disaster, although a Dutch transport ministry official said they were 'rather pessimistic' on how much information it would yield. Piecing together the cause of the crash is proving extremely difficult. Search teams have so far not found the separate cockpit voice recorder, which could reveal the last conversations between the pilots before the crash. Adding to the investigators' difficulties, only one of the engines has been found in a lake nine miles away from the crash site. This has raised the possibility that earlier reports that both starboard engines had broken loose from the aircraft were incorrect. The Dutch transport ministry spokeswoman said the two large pieces of engine found so far now appear to be two halves of the same outer starboard Pratt &amp; Whitney engine. There was also no trace of fire. A spokeswoman for Amsterdam's Schipol airport confirmed yesterday that three months ago the El Al Boeing had reported an engine fire in mid-air during an incoming flight to Amsterdam. The Dutch government official said it was still too early to conclude that only one engine had broken free. Investigators are using sonar equipment in the lake where the engine pieces were found in case the second starboard engine is there. Original reports that both starboard engines had been torn away from the aircraft suggested similarities with an accident in Taiwan last December when a China Airlines 747 cargo aircraft, also powered by Pratt &amp; Whitney engines, crashed after losing its two starboard engines. The US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) said yesterday it planned to issue soon an airworthiness directive to airlines to inspect possible defects in the engine mounts on older versions of the Boeing 747 jets. But the FAA said the order would have gone out regardless of the Amsterdam crash, adding there was no direct evidence in the Amsterdam or the Taiwan disasters pointing to the cause of either crash being the fuse pins connecting the engine struts to the wings. Boeing issued a formal notification to 747 operators to check fuse pins on Monday but had already discussed the issue at a meeting with airline customers last month.</p>

			<p>CSO     [Text] The import of ethylene, a basic petrochemical raw  material, is rapidly increasing. The ethylene plants of various  petrochemical companies have a surplus over about 20 percent,  but it is due to manufacturers one after the other suspending  plant operations with the objective of production adjustment and  there conversely becoming a sense of product shortage.  Previously, other companies in the industry accommodated each  other on shortages, but a big deficit on synthetic resins has  affected various companies and recently they have begun to be  reluctant to accommodate at cheap prices, spurring an increase  in imports.    Imports began to increase in April this year. According to  trade statistics, the amount of imports for April was 11,500  tons (no record of imports for the same month of the previous  year). It was double that of March, and nearly half of the  amount of 1993 imports (24,834 tons) was achieved within the one  month of April.    The importer for the most part has been South Korea. All  ethylene manufacturers such as Showa Denko, Mitsui  Petrochemical, Maruzen Petrochemical, and Tonen Chemical, are  buying. The price of South Korean ethylene is about 40 to 45 yen  per kilo.    While some say that the reason for imports is that "There is  a temporary shortage of ethylene due to suspending operations  for regularly scheduled plant repairs" (Maruzen Petrochemical),  there also are manufacturers who point out that, "Imports can be  bought cheaper than buying domestic" (Showa Denko).</p>

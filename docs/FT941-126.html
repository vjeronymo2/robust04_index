			<p>940331 FT  31 MAR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Charities need voice Sir, Mr A W Behrens (Letters, March 28) quite rightly points out the way in which charities have been disadvantaged by the payment of the BAT Industries 1993 final dividend as a foreign income dividend. Charities' interests have likewise been ignored in the proposed exchange of BICC's 10 3/4 per cent convertible capital bonds for convertible preference shares. It is surely time that a body was formed to speak with authority on investment matters on behalf of all charities, perhaps along the lines of the Investment Protection Committee of the National Association of Pension Funds. Without a unified voice, charity trustees will continue to suffer the penalties of being inadequately represented.

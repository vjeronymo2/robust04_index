			<p><P> February 5, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEVADA PLAN MAY NEGATE ALL GUN CONTROLS  </P> <P> While California considers tighter gun control laws as a result of recent  schoolyard slayings, neighboring Nevada lawmakers are deciding whether to  remove firearm restrictions statewide.  </P> <P> A person already can buy a handgun in 16 of Nevada's mostly rural counties with  no questions asked except "Do you want bullets with that?" police say. But  officials in holdout Clark County are fighting a proposal by Assemblyman Danny  Thompson (D-Henderson) to invalidate the local government's handgun control  ordinances and give the state sole authority to regulate firearm sales,  transfers, ownership and registration.  </P> <P> Thompson said Friday he is seeking "uniformity in the law. Clark County is the  only place in the state . . . with gun restrictions. I'm in favor of the idea  that I have a right to bear arms no matter where I'm at in the state."  </P> <P> But Clark County Sheriff's Capt. Paul Conner said if Thompson's proposal is  approved, the result would be no gun control at all.  </P> <P> The 23-year-old ordinance in Nevada's largest county requires that guns be  registered and imposes a 72-hour waiting period on first-time handgun buyers.  The ordinance also prevents convicted felons, fugitives, narcotics sellers,  "habitual drunkards," the insane and organized crime members, among others,  from buying a handgun.  </P></p>

			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Jamaica and Russia in talks on bauxite bill THE JAMAICAN and Russian governments are in negotiations about a dispute over payment for bauxite ore shipped last year by the island to the former Soviet Union. Jamaican government officials say the ore was shipped under an agreement with Raznoimport, a Soviet importing house based in Moscow. The contract, for 1m tonnes of ore a year to be used in the Nicolayev refinery in the Ukraine, is 'de facto dead although there has been no formal agreement to terminate it,' according to Mr Carlton Davis, executive chairman of the Jamaica Bauxite Institute. Mr Davis said the Jamaican government was seeking Dollars 4.5m from Raznoimport, which is still in business, for ore which was actually delivered. 'This does not take into account ore which was committed under the agreement,' he said.</p>

			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / Foreign Exchange: Dollar plunges on jobs data DISAPPOINTING US employment figures quashed hopes that the US economy might be back on track yesterday and sent the dollar down sharply against a wide range of currencies writes Peter John. Initially, the rise in the non-farm payroll data was as expected. A poll of 30 economists pointed to a rise of 155,000 in September employment compared with an August contraction of 39,000 jobs. The final figure came in at 156,000 and the August figure was revised down by only 2,000 to a fall of 41,000. However, when the figures were released at 1.30pm European time, the dollar sank more than two pfennigs against the D-Mark and lost around a cent against the Japanese yen and sterling. Economists said a break-down of the data showed that more than half of September's rise represented teachers returning to work after the school break. Also, there had been widespread hope that the August figure might have been revised upwards as it clashed with household employment data showing a rise of 409,000. Mr George Magnus, chief economist with SG Warburg said: 'It is a very sluggish employment picture which means weak income growth and weak consumer sales.' The figures benefited the Treasury market, which quakes at prospects of increasing inflation, but failed to help the dollar, which SG Warburg sees falling below DM1.60 soon. The US currency was further hit by some heavy expiry of D-Mark/dollar options. The expiry was estimated at more than Dollars 1bn and prompted dealers to sell dollars to hedge their positions. The dollar plunged to a low of DM. 6010. By the end of official dealing in London it had recovered some lost territory to close at DM1.6040, down from DM1.6230. It fell below Y105 against the Yen at one stage but closed at Y105.50, up from Y105.10 previously and sterling was stronger at Dollars 1.5360, up from Dollars 1.5225. The D-Mark was generally strong, particularly against the French franc whose weakness reflected the rate cut dilemma of the Bank of France. The central bank desperately needs to ease monetary policy to invigorate the economy but has been thwarted by pressure on the currency. Yesterday, the D-Mark rose to FFr3.5070 from FFr3.5010 previously. The Italian Lira also suffered, slipping to L995 against the German currency before a a tighter repo helped stabilise it for a close at L990, down from L987.4 Sterling straddled the Dollar/D-Mark divide, falling half a pfennig against the D-Mark to DM2.4650 but gaining nearly one and a half cents against the dollar.</p>

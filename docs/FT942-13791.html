			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Survey of Egypt (13): Safety net does its best - The Social Fund was set up after the IMF agreement Egypt's Dollars 613m Social Fund for Development, backed by the World Bank and 16 other donors, was designed as a safety net to counter hardship caused by a structural adjustment programme imposed after an agreement with the International Monetary Fund. Twenty per cent of the country's population is unemployed. Many are graduates with serious expectations and a high susceptibility to the Islamic fundamentalists whose recruiting ground they have become. At least another 20 per cent is under-employed and a further 20-25 per cent eke out some sort of existence beneath the poverty line. If Egypt is to keep pace with a population growth of 2.3 per cent a year (as reported in the 1992 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey), it needs to create 600,000 jobs a year for things to stay as they are. The IMF programme, removing Dollars 10bn worth of subsidies on most goods (with the exception of the potentially explosive baladi bread price) and services, began to bite in 1991. The programme followed successful fiscal adjustment and foresaw large scale privatisation and a wider shakeout in the arthritic government bureaucracy. Very little privatisation has taken place and there has been almost nothing in the way of public sector redundancies leading to 'employment retraining and adjustment' - the fund's priority. Established three years ago, it was first seen as independent from the government. Targeted at Gulf War returnees, laid-off workers, women and children, it came in for some early criticism because of alleged political pressures on its allocation process. Eight of the 17 board members were cabinet ministers who, critics claimed, behaved like lobbyists for their own ministries. Apart from the difficulties of recruiting suitably trained people, establishing reporting systems, identifying projects, and satisfying the specifications of 17 different donors, every decision had to be cleared by the board. Disbursement was extremely slow. Administrative infighting led to the resignation in early 1992 of Mr Hamid Mubarak, the then managing director and the president's cousin. Mr Hussein el-Gamal, who succeeded him, has tried to improve the fund's image and streamline its decision making. An executive committee of seven - four ministers and three businessmen - was established. The spending of sums over Pounds 10m requires the imprimatur of the World Bank, which retains a resident officer to monitor the fund. But sums up to Dollars 1.5m can be authorised by Mr el-Gamal on his own, and the committee. Of the EPounds 382m invested, most of it over the last 18 months, by far the largest amount - EPounds 228m - has gone into the enterprise development element of the nominally six-pronged scheme. No-one denies that the main beneficiaries have been unemployed, politically dangerous graduates, who suffer up to 85 per cent unemployment in sensitive parts of the country such as Assiut, traditionally the stronghold of the Moslem Brotherhood. 'The poor will always find some sort of employment, even begging,' says Ms Thea Christiansen, an official at the United Nations Development Fund which has established the Fund's basic channels. 'Unemployed graduates are not in their situation because of structural adjustment. The government job guarantee system disappeared long ago, and because they are a political threat, the government wants to provide some alternative to the fundamentalists.' Islamic militants have already found a political voice through the professional unions which, in the past, ensured jobs for life. Part of the fund's function is to change the attitudes of graduates whose employment in the public sector once gained them not just security of work and a pension at the end of it, but enormous status. In place of what was once the safe option, graduates - mostly graduates of technical colleges - are being persuaded to join credit schemes to establish small businesses in their home areas. Cheap loans supplied through local banks by the Arab Fund, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are the most popular. Local support groups - the 8,000 effective non-government organisations - are responsible for the loans if the beneficiaries fail, but so far the maximum business failure rate has been 7 per cent. 'There are risks to credit schemes everywhere,' says Ms Amani Abou Zeid, senior officer at the Fund's projects and planning unit. 'A 10 to 15 per cent failure rate would still be considered successful.' The credit scheme is estimated to have benefited 385,000 people and created 77,771 permanent jobs. Cattle raising enterprises seem the most popular. Otherwise small sewing businesses are the most talked about, but they have been part of the government's productive family programme for a number of years. That is not to say that the truly poor have been entirely neglected. Almost EPounds 73m has been spent on public works such as irrigation, River Nile protection schemes, provision of potable water and rural road improvements. The community development element of the fund, aimed at eradicating illiteracy (perhaps Egypt's most fundamental difficulty, along with population growth), providing village pumps and a modicum of health care, has accounted for EPounds 67m. Only EPounds 10m has been devoted to employment retraining, for which there has been little demand as yet. Technical assistance accounts for another EPounds 10m, largely devoted to strengthening the non government organisations which perform a crucial role at the sharp end of most schemes. The social fund, based on a much less ambitious project in Bolivia in the 1980s, has had some serious and sometimes unfair criticism. It employs only 120 staff, including those in 12 regional offices. They present their accounts once every 15 days. Everything is strictly accounted for. They feel that the local press and some politicians have raised unreasonable expectations. 'We are here to alleviate, not to eradicate problems,' says Ms Abu Zeid. If a safety net is not in place, as Egypt goes through the pain of adjustment, it will not be for want of the social fund's best - if belated - efforts.</p>

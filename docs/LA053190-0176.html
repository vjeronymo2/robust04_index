			<p><P> May 31, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> GIANTS' BURKETT BOWLS OVER CUBS  </P> <P> John Burkett is used to throwing strikes in the bowling alley.  </P> <P> And this season, the right-hander is also doing it on the mound for the San  Francisco Giants.  </P> <P> Burkett, a rookie who spent seven years in the minor leagues, gave up five hits  in eight innings and singled in a run with his first major league hit to lead  the Giants to a 4-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs Wednesday at Chicago.  </P> <P> "During the lockout I bowled in tournaments and picked up about $1,500," said  Burkett, who has a 225 average and three 300 games. "I once thought of being a  professional bowler, but I'm glad I decided on baseball."  </P> <P> Burkett (4-1) took a shutout into the eighth before Ryne Sandberg hit his 10th  home run.  </P> <P> "He's a good pitcher," Giant Manager Roger Craig said. "Every pitch is a  purpose pitch. He works fast and throws strikes and keeps the ball in play."  </P> <P> Burkett singled in a run with two out in the second inning. The Giants added  three more in the third on a run-scoring single by Kevin Mitchell and Matt  Williams' ninth homer, which was hit into the left-field bleachers against a  21-m.p.h wind.  </P> <P> Rookie Shawn Boskie (1-2) took the loss.  </P> <P> Montreal 9, Atlanta 6 -- The victory at Atlanta was a costly one because three  Expo pitchers were injured.  </P> <P> Dennis Martinez, Montreal's scheduled starter, reported a stiff neck while  warming up and was replaced by Bill Sampen. Reliever Dave Schmidt (1-0) allowed  three hits in 2 2/3 innings in relief of Sampen, but left in the seventh after  one of Ron Gant's three hits caromed off his leg.  </P> <P> Tim Burke left the game after injuring his right ankle covering first base in  the ninth. Drew Hall, the fifth Montreal pitcher, got the last out for his  second save.  </P> <P> Tim Wallach paced the Expos, driving in four runs with his 11th home run and  two doubles.  </P> <P> The homer was Wallach's 19th against the Braves, 14 of them coming in Atlanta.  </P> <P> Dave Martinez also hit a home run for the Expos, his first.  </P> <P> Dave Justice and Gant hit their second and seventh homers, respectively, for  the Braves, who suffered their fifth defeat in seven games.  </P> <P> Tom Glavine (2-3) took the loss.  </P> <P> San Diego 8, Philadelphia 3 -- Bip Roberts, Tony Gwynn, Mike Pagliarulo and Joe  Carter each drove in two runs at Philadelphia as the Padres won for the third  consecutive time.  </P> <P> Rookie first baseman Jerald Clark had the first four-hit game of his career and  the Padres had 13 against Bruce Ruffin (3-5) and three relievers.  </P> <P> The Padres put the game away in the fourth when they sent 11 batters to the  plate and scored five runs.  </P> <P> Andy Benes (5-4), who spent most of last season in double A, improved to 4-0  against the Phillies, giving up seven hits in 6 1/3 innings. Greg Harris earned  his second save.  </P> <P> Carter hit his eighth homer for the Padres.  </P> <P> Ricky Jordan hit his third homer and Von Hayes his eighth for the Phillies, who  have lost four consecutive games.  </P> <P> Houston 2, St. Louis 1 -- Glenn Wilson drove in the game-winning run in the  eighth inning at Houston as the Astros won for the sixth time in nine games.  </P> <P> Ken Caminiti, who doubled off Joe Magrane (2-8) with one out in the eighth,  scored the go-ahead run after second baseman Jose Oquendo slapped down Wilson's  hit and made a late throw to the plate.  </P> <P> Reliever Juan Agosto (4-1) pitched one inning for the victory after replacing  Mike Scott, who gave up seven hits and struck out three in seven innings.  </P> <P> Dave Smith worked the ninth for his 10th save.  </P> <P> The Cardinals, last in the National League East, lost for the fifth time in six  games.  </P></p>

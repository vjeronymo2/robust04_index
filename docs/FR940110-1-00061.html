			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (7) A disclosure of whether or not the applicant has a direct  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or indirect interest in the property or project. If the applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> has an interest in the property and the application is approved,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> then prior to the transfer of AHP funds to the project, an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> independent current appraisal of the fair market value of such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property must be provided, unless the applicant demonstrates that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the property is being sold or otherwise transferred to the sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at a price substantially below the fair market value;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) A statement of the project's costs; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) A certification from the applicant's, the sponsor's and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan fund's or loan consortium's board of directors, or president  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> or senior officer if so delegated by the board of directors, that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or loan consortium  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will comply with all requirements of this part and all obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(c) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generally requires an applicant to include in its AHP application  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the information identified in paragraphs (3) through (6) above, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> well as any other information the Bank may require. See 12 CFR  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.4(c).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(c)(6) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires an applicant to disclose in its AHP application any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> direct or indirect interest of the applicant in the property or project. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(6). Under &sect;960.7(a)(7) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule, if such an interest exists and the application is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approved, then prior to the transfer of AHP funds to the project,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant generally is required to provide an appraisal of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> property or project. This is to ensure that the sales price of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> such property or project owned by the applicant has not been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inflated and that the applicant is not receiving the benefit of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the AHP subsidy.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(c)(7) of the Board's existing AHP regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the applicant to include in its AHP application an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> explanation of how the applicant intends to monitor the use of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds received under the AHP, including an explanation of how the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> structure of the project ensures that a preponderance of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subsidy is ultimately received by the targeted beneficiaries. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(9)(D); 12 CFR 960.4(c)(7). As discussed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> greater detail in the monitoring section below, as long as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adequate monitoring is otherwise provided for, the proposed rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> does not require the applicant in all instances to monitor the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP-assisted project for compliance with the long-term requirement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed rule. Accordingly, this provision of the existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation is deleted in the proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(c)(8) of the Board's existing AHP regulation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the applicant to certify that the maximum subsidy  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> limitation requirements of the AHP rule will not be violated. See  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 12 CFR 960.4(c)(8). However, since the maximum subsidy limitation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements are threshold requirements that all AHP applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> must satisfy (see discussion below of the 20 percent requirement),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this requirement is incorporated into proposed &sect;960.7(a)(9),  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which provides generally that the applicant and sponsor must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certify that all requirements of the AHP regulation will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfied.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.4(c)(8) of the Board's existing AHP regulation also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requires the applicant to explain in its AHP application how any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AHP subsidy that exceeds the maximum subsidy requirements will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recaptured. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(8). Since AHP applications must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the threshold maximum subsidy limitation requirements at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the outset in order to be scored and approved for AHP funding,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this issue does not arise and therefore has been deleted in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, the requirement in &sect;960.4(c)(9) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Board's existing AHP regulation that the applicant's managing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officer must certify that the AHP subsidy shall be only for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> authorized uses is expanded in proposed &sect;960.7(a)(9) to require a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certification by the applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> loan consortium not only that funds received under the AHP will be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> used for authorized uses, but also a certification of compliance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with all requirements of the AHP regulation and all obligations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committed to in the AHP application. See 12 CFR 960.4(c)(9). In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, the proposed rule requires the applicant, the sponsor  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the loan fund or loan consortium, not just the applicant, as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the Board's existing AHP regulation, to make the certification  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the AHP application. This change is proposed because the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicant, the sponsor and the loan fund or loan consortium are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> all subject to specific requirements under the AHP and therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should be required to certify that they will comply with such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. Action on Applications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed above, the proposed rule makes a major change in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Board's existing AHP regulation by taking the Board out of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval process for AHP applications. Section 960.7(b)(1) of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule provides that each Bank shall review, score and take  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> action on an AHP application pursuant to the requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> contained in proposed &sect;&sect;960.8, 960.9 and 960.10, and shall notify  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the applicant of such action no later than 60 calendar days after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the application due date for the AHP funding cycle. Section  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 960.5(f)(1) of the existing regulation requires the Banks to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> forward to the Board their recommended applications no later than  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 30 days after each offering deadline. See 12 CFR 960.5(f)(1).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Since the Banks would have greater responsibilities in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> approval process under the proposed rule, the 30-day period is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to be extended to 60 calendar days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 960.7(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides specifically  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that the board of directors of each Bank shall have the authority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to approve or disapprove AHP applications received, and may  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> delegate such authority to the president or other senior officers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the Bank.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

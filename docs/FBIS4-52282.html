			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, May 9 (YONHAP) -- The Samsung business group  is reportedly tense about potential government disapproval of  the group's advancement into the car industry.    The country's biggest business group is poised to submit its  contract on technology cooperation with Nissan of Japan to the  government. If Samsung wins state approval, it can jump into  the automaking industry.    Samsung group chairman Yi Kon-hui suddenly postponed his  Southeast Asian tour on Sunday and Samsung heavy industries  officials held an emergency meeting during the weekend to study  the government's possible moves.    "The government had hinted that it wanted us to give up our  automaking project several times and Chairman Yi's postponement  of his overseas tour must have something to do with that," a  Samsung executive said.    Senior government officials, offering their own opinions,  have often told company managers in private that Samsung's entry  into the auto industry was inappropriate, he said.    But Samsung officials say they cannot understand why the  government is making a series of remarks against its car project  when the group has not even submitted the technology import  application yet.    Samsung is trying its best to read the government's mind and  to find out whether the recent remarks reflect its true feelings.    If the government's disapproval turns out to be true, the  group may nevertheless submit its technology import application  to show it has not given up and will try again.    But group moderates say they should get the government's  message considering it is the country's biggest business group  and therefore must maintain good relations with the government.    Another dilemma for Samsung is whether to announce it is  giving up the car project before the government officially  registers its disapproval.    Both are painful steps for the group.    If it challenges the government by pressing ahead with its  plans, there is room for the group to fight back if the  government says no.    If it gives up voluntarily, the pride of the business giant  will be hurt but in the long run, it can expect better relations  with the government.    Samsung is said to be most worried about its status at home  and abroad.    The group has so far put up the invincible image that  Samsung  can do anything if it only puts its mind to it.    Surrendering its automaking ambitions could also dampen  Chairman Yi's reform project as well as hurt the company's  pride, which is exactly why Samsung executives are strongly  protesting the government's implicit disapproval.    One executive questions the government's stress on raising  the country's competitiveness when at the same time it  interferes with company activities.    He says the government has no legal grounds to disapprove of  Samsung's automaking project.</p>

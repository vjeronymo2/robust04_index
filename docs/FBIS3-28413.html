			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [YONHAP report from Washington] </F>   [Text] It has been learned on 6 February that the U.S.  Government has excluded research funds for promoting the  capacity of the airborne self protection jammer [ASPJ] from the  budget for fiscal year 1995. Accordingly, this step may  frustrate the ROK Government's plan to introduce U.S. F-16  fighter planes for which an enormous part of the national  treasury has been earmarked.    Such a measure virtually violating the ROK-U.S. contract on  the airborne project was confirmed from the budget bill for  fiscal year 1995 which was presented by the U.S. Defense  department that day.    The issue regarding contract implementation has already  caused friction between the ROK and U.S. Governments. However,  it is likely that this issue will create more stirs in ROK-U.S.  relations regarding mutual security cooperation as newly  appointed U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry has been  learned to have been deeply involved in drawing up the budget.    Secretary of Defense Perry, hinting that the U.S. Defense  Department cannot guarantee the quality of products manufactured  by ITT, has recently put de facto pressure on the ROK to  purchase the planes on a civilian level.    The budget bill presented by the U.S. Defense Department  does  not mention a word on financial support for promoting the ASPJ's  capabilites. In other words, the U.S. Defense Department has  withdrawn its previous position of supporting the project to  promote its capabilities which was conducted under the U.S.  Navy's supervision, as the project ended in failure.  Accordingly, the delivery of F-16 fighter planes which was  slated for this October is expected to be delayed.    In connection with the report, the ROK Defense Ministry on 6  February clarified that "the plan to bring in F-16 fighter  planes in October will go according to schedule as the ASPJ is  not an essential part of F-16 fighter planes but auxiliary  equipment."</p>

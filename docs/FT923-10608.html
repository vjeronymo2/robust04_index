			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries rise on consumer report LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices rose sharply yesterday on news of a July consumer confidence report that was much weaker than expected. In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up 1 1/32 at 106 23/32 , to yield 7.427 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer, up 1/16 at 101 7/16 , yielding 4.194 per cent. The news that sparked the buying was the Conference Board's consumer confidence index for July, which fell to 61.0 from 72.6 in June. Most analysts had been expecting a slight decline in the index. Most of the activity was concentrated at the long end of the market, which in recent weeks has lagged behind shorter-dated maturities. However, in the past few days, the long bond has bounced back and is favoured by investors. The short end of the market was held back by the auction of Dollars 15bn in two-year notes. The sale was completed successfully at an average yield of 4.29 per cent, the lowest recorded at a two-year auction. JAPANESE government bonds rallied, driven by good domestic demand as investors continued to pin their hopes on lower interest rates. In spite of the half percentage point cut in the Official Discount Rate to 3.25 per cent on Monday, dealers said that market participants expected the weak state of the Japanese economy to prompt a further cut in interest rates within the next few months. The benchmark No 129, which opened with a yield of 4.965 per cent, climbed steadily to yield 4.90 per cent by the close of trading in Tokyo. The September futures ended at 104.87, against its close of 104.49 on Monday. Money market rates continued to edge lower with the call rate slipping from 4 1/8 per cent to 4 3/32 per cent, while three-month certificates of deposit traded at 4.03 per cent, against 4.04 per cent on Monday. SPANISH government bonds rallied on foreign and domestic buying, partly due to concern that there may be little interest in this week's auction of debt. Dealers warned that the recent large decline in Spanish government bond prices could deter investors from bidding at the regular auction of three, five and 10-year paper. 'People are expecting a deserted auction - if investors don't participate in the auction, there may not be the usual amount of supply and this fear of a shortage of new supply has helped to push up bond prices temporarily,' said one dealer. The yield on 10-year bonds fell from 12.18 per cent to 12.05 per cent, while five-year bonds saw a fall in yield from 13.01 per cent to 12.87 per cent. GERMANY'S government bond market drifted lower in light trading as dealers warned that the market was waiting for news from the Bundesbank council meeting in early August. The favourable inflation figures released yesterday fell within the market's expectations and had little impact on bund prices. Western German consumer prices were increased by 3.3 per cent year-on-year, according to preliminary figures. The Liffe bund futures contract slipped from its opening of 87.47 to trade at 87.33 by late afternoon. UK government bonds closed slightly weaker as dealers warned that funding concerns were troubling the gilt market again. The Bank of England was expected to announce preliminary details of its next gilt auction shortly. The 9 per cent Treasury loan due 2008 traded at 100 3/4 , down  1/16 from Monday to yield 8.90 per cent. Among shorter-dated gilts, the 10 per cent gilt due 1996 ended at 102 1/8 , down  3/32 .</p>

			<p><P> September 5, 1990, Wednesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFCASE  </P> <P> Rockwell Reshuffling: Rockwell International's Defense Electronics unit in  Anaheim has reorganized its communications, avionics and command-and-control  businesses to gain market and technical efficiencies.  </P> <P> Company spokesman Tony Longo said the company will combine the headquarters of  its command-and-control business in San Bernardino with another unit in  Richardson, Tex.  </P> <P> The combined headquarters will move to Richardson. The relocation will have a  minimal effect on employees, Longo said.  </P> <P> The company also is combining its Collins Government Avionics Division and the  communications and intelligence business segment of Collins Defense  Communications in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  </P> <P> The moves complete a reorganization that began in March when the company formed  its Defense Electronics unit by combining its Autonetics unit in Anaheim with  its Collins defense units, said John A. McLuckey, Rockwell Defense Electronics  president.  </P></p>

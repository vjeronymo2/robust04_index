Onsite Management <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> The LFA will oversee the onsite response; monitor and support owner or operator activities (when there is an owner or operator); provide technical support to the owner or operator, if requested; and serve as the principal Federal source of information about onsite conditions. The LFA will provide a hazard assessment of onsite conditions that might have significant offsite impact and ensure onsite measures are taken to mitigate offsite consequences. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3. Radiological Monitoring and Assessment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> DOE has the initial responsibility for coordinating the offsite Federal radiological monitoring and assessment assistance during the response to a radiological emergency. In a prolonged response, EPA will assume the responsibility for coordinating the assistance at some mutually agreeable time, usually after the emergency phase. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Some of the participating Federal agencies may have radiological planning and emergency responsibilities as part of their statutory authority, as well as established working relationships with State counterpart agencies. The monitoring and assessment activity, coordinated by DOE, does not alter those responsibilities but complements them by providing for coordination of the initial Federal radiological monitoring and assessment response activity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Activities will: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Support the monitoring and assessment programs of the States, <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Respond to the assessment needs of the LFA, and <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Meet statutory responsibilities of participating Federal agencies. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal offsite monitoring and assessment activities will be coordinated with those of the State. Federal agency plans and procedures for implementing this monitoring and assessment activity are designed to be compatible with the radiological emergency planning requirements for State, local governments, specific facilities, and existing memoranda of understanding and interagency agreements. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE may respond to a State or LFA request for assistance by dispatching a Radiological Assistance Program (RAP) team. If the situation requires more assistance than a RAP team can provide, DOE will alert or activate additional resources. These resources may include the establishment of a Federal Radiological Monitoring and Assessment Center (FRMAC) to be used as an onscene coordination center for Federal radiological assessment activities. States are encouraged to collocate their radiological assessment activities at this center. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal radiological monitoring and assessment activities will be activated as a component of an FRERP response or pursuant to a direct request from State or local governments, other Federal agencies, licensees for radiological materials, industries, or the general public after evaluating the magnitude of the problem and coordinating with the State(s) involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> DOE and other participating Federal agencies may learn of an emergency when they are alerted to a possible problem or receive a request for radiological assistance. DOE will maintain national and regional coordination offices as points of access to Federal radiological emergency assistance. Requests for Federal radiological monitoring and assessment assistance will generally be directed to the appropriate DOE radiological assistance Regional Coordinating Office. Requests also can go directly to DOE's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Washington, DC. When other agencies receive requests for Federal radiological monitoring and assessment assistance, they will promptly notify the DOE EOC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> a. Role of Department of Energy (DOE).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) Initial Response Coordination Responsibility. DOE, as coordinator, has the following responsibilities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) Coordinate Federal offsite radiological monitoring and assessment activities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) Maintain technical liaison with State and local agencies with monitoring and assessment responsibilities; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) Maintain a common set of all offsite radiological monitoring data, in an accountable, secure, and retrievable form, and ensure the technical integrity of the data; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Provide monitoring data and interpretations, including exposure rate contours, dose projections, and any other requested radiological assessments, to the LFA, and to the States; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

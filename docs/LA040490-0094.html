			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MEXICO OPENS ITS BORDERS TO WORLD COMPUTER IMPORTS;  </P> <P> TRADE: ELIMINATING PERMITS AND ADDING DOMESTIC TAX INCENTIVES SHOULD TRIPLE THE  COUNTRY'S COMPUTER MARKET.  </P> <P> Mexico has opened its computer market -- one of its few remaining protected  industries -- to imports in a move that could further stimulate that  fast-growing industry.  </P> <P> Commerce Secretary Jaime Serra Puche said this week in a brief announcement  that Mexico will no longer require permits for computer imports. A tariff will  be charged, but he did not specify the amount. The maximum Mexican import  tariff now is 20%.  </P> <P> The market opening, combined with simultaneously announced unspecified tax  incentives for domestic producers, could help the Mexican computer market reach  $3 billion by 1993, said Federico Ruiz Sacristan, president of Mexico's  National Electronics Industry Chamber. That would be triple the current market.  </P> <P> The immediate effect of trade liberalization will be a flood of low-priced  imports into Mexico, predicted Nora Mosqueda, sales manager for CIGE, a  distributor of Mexican-made Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines  computers.  </P> <P> However, Mosqueda said she expects no negative effects from the new  competition.  </P> <P> Companies already established in the Mexican market had anticipated the import  policy change and have been dropping their prices over the past year to  international levels as they introduced new products.  </P> <P> For example, Mosqueda said, the old Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II printer sold  for $3,450. The improved LaserJet III has a $3,020 price tag.  </P> <P> Most major U.S. companies, including Apple Computer and Unisys, have Mexican  operations concentrated in the Guadalajara region. The new policy will allow  those companies to import additional products not now available in Mexico.  </P> <P> Mexico has carefully cultivated its computer industry, leaving computer  products among the 3% of imports protected by permits.  </P> <P> Foreign and domestic investment in the Mexican computer industry grew from $29  million in 1983 to $84 million in 1988, the last year for which figures are  available. Exports of Mexican computer products grew from nothing in 1978 to  $175 million a decade later.  </P> <P> The new policy is aimed at encouraging further exports, Serra Puche said.  </P> <P> "Incentives will be given to companies based on the domestic content of their  products, their net investment in domestic assets and their expenditures on  research and development," he said.  </P> <P> Trade liberalization combined with tax incentives will allow the entire country  to take advantage of the best technology from all over the world while  encouraging the domestic computer industry to find its place in the  international market, he said.  </P></p>

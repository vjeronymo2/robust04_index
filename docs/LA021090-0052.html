			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 259 SEATS IN NEW ROMANIA UNITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> The Council of National Unity, formed to run Romania until May 20 elections,  met for the first time Friday and agreed to expand to 259 members to provide a  broad base of interim government.  </P> <P> The consensus to increase the membership from 180 came after more than four  hours of debate at the former National Assembly building and was viewed as the  first instance of democratic decision-making in Romanian government in more  than 40 years.  </P> <P> Interim President Ion Iliescu, who led the outgoing National Salvation Front's  ruling council, presided over the meeting.  </P> <P> An earlier decision to expand to 241 members was superseded to give even  greater representation.  </P> <P> The assembly building is being used for the first time since the uprising  against Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who was overthrown Dec. 22 and  executed on Christmas Day. It also is the first time since the revolution that  opposition groups have had a role in leadership.  </P> <P> In the original 180-seat council agreed on last week, party and non-party blocs  were to get three seats each. The 90 seats were to be divided among 29  political parties and the National Salvation Front, which considers itself a  movement.  </P> <P> In the expanded council agreed on Friday, 114 seats went to 38 parties; 27  seats to nine organizations representing ethnic minorities; 3 seats will be  filled by former political prisoners, and 114 seats go to promient Romanians  from all walks of life who were part of the National Salvation Front.  </P></p>

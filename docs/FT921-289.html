			<p>920330 FT  30 MAR 92 / Pay pledge by Kinnock brings Tory tax assault: Conservatives switch from 'negative campaign' but hit at Labour public sector plans A PLEDGE from Mr Neil Kinnock that a Labour government would not allow public sector pay to fall further behind the private sector yesterday provoked a Conservative charge that the 'open-ended' commitment would bring new tax rises. The accusation came in spite of assurances from Conservative strategists that they have switched their tactics to stress the positive vision behind their election message. Party officials said that today's news conference on tax would meet criticism of 'negative campaigning' from Conservative supporters by promoting the advantages of a low-tax economy. They will combine this with a detailed analysis of the impact of Labour's plans on the incomes of skilled and semi-skilled workers. Yesterday Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, revived Labour's own tax warnings by repeating charges that the Conservatives' are planning to raise or extend the range of value added tax. But his efforts to pre-empt the Conservative tax assault was, in part, deflected by close questioning over Labour's plans for public sector pay. Earlier, Mr Kinnock had remarked in an interview on London Weekend Television's Walden programme that Labour would halt the deterioration in public sector pay rates in relation to private sector increases. Under pressure from the interviewer, he insisted that Labour was 'too prudent' to try to bridge the gap between private and public sector pay. But he added: 'We are going to stop the gap widening.' His comments, however, provoked further questions at a Labour news conference as to how the party would achieve this without raising public expenditure at a time when private sector pay is outstripping inflation. In an effort to clarify the position, Mr Smith added the rider, included in the Labour's manifesto, that public sector pay rates would be linked to 'clearly defined budget limits.' Calling on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to fulfil his pledge to meet him in a television debate, he said there was no danger of any repeat of the wages spiral that ended with the 'winter of discontent' of public sector strikes in 1978-79. However, Mr Kinnock's remarks provoked Mr Chris Patten, the Conservative chairman, to warn that Labour's public sector pay promise would add to a manifesto 'bulging with spending pledges that can only be met by higher taxation'. The election campaign's return to economic issues came as figures on business failures in the first quarter of this year showed weekly rates at 1,240 against 800 in the same period last year. Weekend opinion polls showing Labour holding a lead of between 1 and 4 points in four surveys and a Harris/Observer poll showing the Tories 2 points ahead have calmed some Conservative fears of a sharp surge to their opponents. But while party officials insist that there has been no weekend outbreak of 'jitters', Mr John Major is understood to have ordered his team to target the crucial C2 voters and the 'Don't Knows' with a more upbeat message. The prime minister is said to have told party workers that people 'don't want to vote Labour, but want to know why they should vote for us.' Meanwhile the Liberal Democrats saw their poll ratings climb by 3 to 4 points in all but one poll. This gain was widely attributed to voters' distaste at the squabbling between the two main parties over Labour's controversial health broadcast last week. The new 'positive' phase of the Tory campaign began in earnest yesterday with ministerial speeches from Mr Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke, the environment and education secretaries, focused on the Tory record and and Mr Major's plan to devolve power to local people.

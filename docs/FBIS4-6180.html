			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 19 Apr (AKP) -- The first meeting of the  Kingdom of Cambodia's Red Cross Federation was organized last  Monday at the Chaktomuk hall under the chairmanship of Samdech  Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly.    The meeting decided to appoint Princess Norodom Marie  Ranariddh, chairman of the Central Committee and Her Majesty  Norodom Monineat Sihanouk, honorary chairman of the Cambodian  Red Cross Federation.    On behalf of His Majesty Norodom Sihanouk, Samdech Chea Sim  stressed that this meeting's objective is to set up the Red  Cross Federation by grouping the country's three Red Cross  organizations: the Red Cross of the State of Cambodia, that of  the National United Front for an Independent, Neutral, Peaceful,  and Cooperative Cambodia (FUNCINPEC), and that of the Khmer  People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF).    The Cambodian Red Cross Federation was recognized on 24  March  1994 among member countries of the Red Cross and of the Red  Crescent.    The federation has seven basic principles, taken from the  ICRC (International Committee of the Red Cross), including  humanitarian action, justice, neutrality, and independence.    The National Assembly Chairman expects that the executive  committee of the federation would forge good relations with  international circles in order to respond to the Cambodian  people's needs.</p>

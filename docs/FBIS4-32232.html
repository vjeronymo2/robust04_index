			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Belgrade, 17 Jun (TANJUG) -- The dinar exchange  rate and prices are stable, and hard currency black marketeering  is an ephemeral phenomenon, Federal Prime Minister Radoje Kontic  stressed at a news conference today.    There is no danger of the dinar falling in relation to the  German mark, Kontic said, adding that prices did not rise last  week.    A total price rise of 0.8 percent was recorded between 24  January and 11 June, but that period saw an unacceptable rise in  the price of agricultural produce and services, Kontic said, and  pointed to the need for a further reduction in prices,  especially for certain products. [passage omitted]    Despite statistical indicators that there was a fall in  production in May, Kontic said that industrial production has  seen a 3 percent rise in relation to April, of course, excluding  the production of energy, which accounts for one-fifth of  production, and which fell in that period.

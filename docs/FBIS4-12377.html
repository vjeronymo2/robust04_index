			<p>BFN       [Editorial Report] Sanaa Republic of Yemen Radio Network in  Arabic, in a linkup with the Arabic Service of the BBC, at 1505  GMT on 7 April carries a 55-minute live phone-in program from  Sanaa with Lieutenant General 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih, chairman of  the Yemeni Presidential Council. President Salih responds to  telephoned questions and comments from an international  audience. The program is moderated by the BBC's Madihah  al-Madfa'i.    Responding to a caller from Tunisia, Salih says that since  the signing of the accord document in Amman on 20 February he  has been striving with his coalition partners in the Yemeni  Socialist Party (YSP) to implement the document. He says he  regrets his efforts have "met with a lukewarm response from  certain YSP leaders."    Commenting on explosions in Dhamar Governorate "at 2000  yesterday", Salih calls it a "transparent game," calculated to  create problems to justify opening indiscriminate fire on  bystanders and nearby camps, including those of the Republican  Guard and Public Security forces. The aim, President Salih  contends, was to "create tension" and bring about the relocation  of military forces from north to south and vice versa, as  "envisaged by certain YSP leaders." Salih adds that he "had  given instructions for military units not to respond with a  single bullet." He notes with satisfaction that there were no  casualties, apart from two members of the security forces  injured trying to subdue a YSP member who attempted to break the  law. Both he and 'Ali Salim al-Bid, Salih notes, followed  developments personally and calmed the situation. The military  committee then moved to the Dhamar Governorate to investigate  the situation.    Responding to a listener from Syria, who voices fears of the  Yemeni issue being internationalized in a manner similar to the  Gulf crisis, Salih says every effort is being made to contain  the crisis, but regrets that some members of the YSP want to see  the Yemeni crisis turned into a pan-Arab concern. Salih  stresses, however, that he has no objection to "our brothers in  the Arab world lending a hand" to the solution of the crisis.  We are striving, he says, to contain the crisis and keep it  from internationalization, a prospect he calls "very dangerous."    Asked by a listener calling from Yemen to spell out the  underlying causes of the Yemeni crisis, the president says the  causes are well known and that they began to emerge after the 27  April parliamentary elections. He maintains that some YSP  members, who initially went along with the election returns,  "began to act so as to bring considerable harm to the Yemeni  people and national unity."    Taking a question from another Tunisian caller, Salih says  the first days of Yemeni unity may have provided an admirable  example for the Arab world to follow. But "we feared that our  unity was bound to be targeted for conspiracies." The question  was, Salih adds: "Who would implement such a plan?" "We  believe a conspiracy is being implemented by the very authors of  the unity." Those who brought harm and caused cracks in  national Yemeni unity, he regrets, belong in the camp of the  "makers of this great event."    Salih exhorts "our brothers and partners" in the coalition  government to avert military conflict that will cause  considerable damage to the national economy and national unity.  He recalls that Yemenis had a taste of infighting in 1972 and  again in 1979, in both cases the "winner was the loser." Only  the enemies of the homeland and Arab unity stand to gain from  infighting, Salih asserts.    Answering another caller from Yemen, President Salih  describes his meeting with Yemeni leader 'Ali Salim al-Bid in  Salalah as "positive on a personal plane" but not so in terms of  the Yemeni crisis, especially since "new conditions running  counter to the pledge and accord document were put forward."  The president suggests that the YSP is trying to circumvent the  Constitution and the accord document, which neither he nor the  Yemeni people find acceptable.    'Abbas Bin-Hamid-al-Din, who identifies himself as a Yemeni  national living in Cairo, proposes the expansion of the  Political Forces Dialogue Committee to include men belonging to  the Hamid-al-Din family, which previously ruled Yemen, to defuse  the ongoing crisis, Yemeni President Salih says: "I believe  that the Hamid-al-Din family contributed to the Yemeni crisis,  because it has left us a burdensome legacy. It is part of this  crisis. We have continued to pay a price, thanks to the  policies pursued by the Hamid-al-Din family, and the British  colonial rule."    Responding to a question from a caller in Saudi Arabia  regarding the need for President Salih and Vice President al-Bid  to demonstrate flexibility to "avert endless civil wars," Yemeni  President Salih says: "We, along with all well-intentioned  people in the homeland, will do our best to resolve and contain  this crisis so as to safeguard unity. This crisis is the price  we are paying for this national accomplishment. We, along with  all patriots and well-intentioned people throughout the Yemeni  homeland, are determined to safeguard unity."    Muhammad al-Bid, a Yemeni national in Riyadh, poses the  following question to Yemeni President Salih: "Let us say that  the country is divided, God forbid. Will Yemen relive the  situation currently experienced by Somalia, which is going  through immense fighting, chaos, and anarchy?"    President Salih answers this question, saying: "We are  optimistic that no civil wars will erupt. All patriots and  honorable people inside and outside the homeland are careful to  prevent the eruption of a civil war. We are doing our utmost to  avert this eventuality. We will certainly contain this crisis.  In the first months of the crisis, many provocations took  place. Those who planned this crisis believed that a war would  erupt in the initial stages of the crisis. Nonetheless, we have  endured a lot to thwart these schemes, which seek to bring about  a civil war, or return the situation to pre-May 20, 1990."    Responding to a question by Ahmad Nasir al-Juraydi, a Yemeni  national from the Central Republic of Africa, Yemeni President  Salih says: "Security violations have been exaggerated by the  media. There are some security violations everywhere. Most of  these are criminal security-related violations. Some of these  violations are committed by culprits to distort Yemeni unity,  and tarnish the image of the Yemeni people. However, the Yemeni  people are keen to safeguard their security and stability. The  security organs are conducting their duties and pursuing those  who are committing security violations."    Caller 'Abdallah Salih al-Yafi'i from Mecca, Saudi Arabia,  holds President Salih, Vice President al-Bid, and the entire  Yemeni command structure responsible for the crisis. President  Salih responds: "Since the inception of the crisis, we have  made many concessions to safeguard Yemeni unity. For example,  we did not show a determination to obtain a share in authority  commensurate with the results we achieved in the parliamentary  elections to the House of Representatives. We have abandoned  some seats, and some pivotal authority positions in favor of our  brothers within the coalition government, including the prime  minister's post and a seat on the Presidential Council. These  are concessions. It is no mistake if we makes concessions to  one another, and to brothers, to resolve this crisis. We have  even offered our brothers within the YSP to quit if we are  deemed one of the causes of the crisis, so that a new leadership  may be elected, and so that the Yemeni unity may remain intact."  He mentions a proposal contained in a bill to be submitted to  the House of Representatives stipulating that the president of  the Republic may serve only two terms in office. He deems all  these as concessions benefiting the Yemeni people.    Responding to a question posed by 'Abd-al- 'Aziz Salih  al-Mafqari from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, President Salih says the  failure to send to court suspects charged in connection with a  series of explosions and assassinations can be traced to the  fact that some of them remain at large, while others are being  interrogated by the Public Prosecution department. He adds:  "We would like to address our YSP command brothers, saying that  security agencies and all state bodies must be reactivated so  that the state, including its defense, security, legislative,  and executive bodies, may all function as a single team."    President Salih adds: "God willing, the pre-May 22 situation  will not relived. Nor shall we condone infighting. This is a  political decision that I have made in my capacity as chairman  of the Yemeni Presidential Council. I have decided that I will  not allow infighting among the sons of the close-knit Yemeni  people, regardless of the provocations, and regardless of what  has happened. Had we been people without any sense of  responsibility, we would have been dragged to infighting, and to  a repartitioning of the country, which has been planned.  However, all these schemes have been thwarted."    Answering a question from Farid Ahmad Mubarak Juhayman in  Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who urges Yemeni President Salih and Vice  President 'Ali Salim al-Bid to tender their resignations so  others may address Yemeni affairs, President Salih says: "I  informed brother 'Ali Salim, in Amman, that if the dispute is  personal, that is, one between the president and his deputy,  then I was ready to tender my resignation so a replacement might  be elected by the House of Representatives."    President Salih maintains that the root causes of the crisis  cannot be addressed by the mere resignation of leaders. He  adds: "If the resignation of the president and his deputy would  save the Yemeni people, then we would be ready to tender our  resignations. But, I am afraid that such resignations might  aggravate and exacerbate the crisis, and lead to a civil war."    When asked by a caller from Riyadh about the frustration  plaguing the Yemeni people because of their sufferings, thanks  to the ongoing crisis, Yemeni President Salih denies that the  coalition government is surviving by fabricating and managing  crises.    Answering a question on an alleged British role in the  Yemeni  crisis, and whether Britain has given the YSP the green light to  effect a repartitioning of the country so Britain may benefit  from oil revenues, given the fact that it has oil prospecting  firms operating in Yemen, President Salih says: "We do not want  to make accusations against anybody. We urge all our brothers,  all our beloved ones in the Arab homeland, in the Islamic world,  and in friendly states to aid the Yemeni people during the  ordeal fabricated by some people, the ordeal that has immensely  harmed our national unity. We will not make any accusations  unless we have documents to corroborate such accusations. There  are numerous rumors around, and so are propaganda campaigns  targeting this or that country. However, we must be in full  charge of our own affairs. This is better than having our own  affairs decided by other officials, be they British, Americans,  other foreigners, or other Arabs. We, Yemenis, are the people  who must be in full charge of our own affairs."    President Salih goes on to say: "This crisis is part of the  schemes planned by some YSP leaders within the context of the  so- called cultural plan. The Yemeni crisis is the very  cultural plan they have spoken of. We have never wished to air  such words over the media. But, regrettably, this is the  cultural plan they are promoting to move the emotions of laymen,  simpletons, and those who do not read between the lines with  regard to this issue."    Responding to a caller from Morocco, President Salih hopes  that "unity-oriented Arabs" will not turn Yemen into a  battleground for settling differences that surfaced before and  during the Gulf crisis. He hopes they will help Yemenis contain  this crisis.    The program concludes at 1600 GMT.</p>

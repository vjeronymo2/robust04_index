			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Lima and Caracas head for asylum row PERUVIAN President Alberto Fujimori's decision to grant political asylum to 93 Venezuelan rebel soldiers who participated in last week's coup attempt set the stage yesterday for a diplomatic row between the two countries. Mr Fujimori said late on Sunday he was accepting the men's request for refuge because 'we have to preserve . . . the security, the life and integrity of these 93 military (men).' The men, led by Air Force General Francisco Visconti, fled by air to the Peruvian town of Iquitos shortly after the failed putsch, which left more than 170 people dead and scores more injured. Venezuelan television broadcast the news from Peru shortly after midnight on Sunday but there was no immediate official reaction. Venezuela's Foreign Ministry, which broke off diplomatic relations with Lima earlier this year after Mr Fujimori suspended Peru's Congress, had already asked the Organisation of American States (OAS) to ensure Peru returned the rebels. Meanwhile, shops, businesses and banks yesterday reopened in Venezuela, as life returned to normal after Friday's failed coup. However, share prices fell on the Caracas stock exchange, as the dissatisfaction at the government's strict austerity measures, which had fuelled the country's second coup attempt in a year, continued to hit investor confidence. The Central Bank of Venezuela sought to calm the markets by announcing that it would ensure the demand for US dollars was met. At the same time the government of President Carlos Andres Perez reiterated that nationwide elections for state and local office would be held as scheduled on December 6. Roughly half of Venezuela's population of about 20m are registered to vote for 22 state governors, 282 mayors, 2,116 members of city councils and 2,376 members of the newly established parish councils. The government, fearing high abstention, is using the media to encourage people to vote, and officials are stressing that voters should use ballots instead of bullets to change their elected representatives. In the last state and regional elections, held three years ago, national voter abstention was 54 per cent, reaching a high of 73 per cent in Caracas. The elections will be important in indicating if many Venezuelans continue to feel alienated from the political system following two military rebellions this year, or whether they will demonstrate some faith in Venezuela's highly criticised democracy. They should also show whether voters retain their preference for the two establishment parties, Accion Democratica (the government party) and the Christian Democrat Copei party, or for more militant leftist organisations such as MAS (socialists) and Causa R (an offshoot of the Venezuelan Communist party). Meanwhile, the government is continuing its search for military and civilians involved in Friday's uprising. The state security police detained a retired army general, Alberto Muller Rojas, for questioning, and authorities in different parts of the country arrested officers and soldiers trying to leave the country or go into hiding. Government raids on two state universities uncovered caches of automatic weapons, ammunition and other arms. One hoard of arms was found stashed in a hot dog vendor's wagon.</p>

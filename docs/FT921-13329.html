			<p>920122 FT  22 JAN 92 / International Company News: Alcan plunges to Dollars 41m loss while metal prices weaken ALCAN ALUMINIUM, under pressure from weak metal prices, posted a net loss of USDollars 41m, or 18 cents a share, after preferred dividends for the final quarter of 1991, against a profit of Dollars 184m, or 83 cents, a year earlier. Sales declined to Dollars 1.8bn from Dollars 2.24bn in the same period of 1990. For all 1991, the loss was Dollars 56m, or 25 cents a share, against profit of Dollars 521m, or Dollars 2.33, in 1990. Revenues amounted to Dollars 7.7bn, compared with Dollars 8.7bn for 1990. The figures were struck after restructuring charges and other special items in both periods. Alcan said average prices realised for primary aluminium in 1991 were 25 per cent lower than in 1990. Total shipments of ingot and fabricated products were lower, while year-end inventory was 463,000 tonnes against 447,000 tonnes. Mr David Morton, chairman, said that Alcan's results reflected lower prices due primarily to big increases in exports from the former Soviet Union on top of existing over-supply in the West. 'We responded by reducing our annual operating costs by well over the target Dollars 200m in 1991, with a further improvement of Dollars 275m targeted for 1992.' He said the near-term outlook for aluminium prices is not encouraging, 'given continuing over-supply and few signs of an early recovery in demand. We need an appreciable pick-up in demand or a further curtailment of supply'.</p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo to lift veil on currency risks - Unrealised losses will have to be revealed Corporate Japan will over the next month or so be obliged to lift the veil on a poorly kept yet tantalising secret. A change in finance ministry rules will for the first time oblige companies listed on the stock exchange or over-the-counter market to divulge unrealised losses or profits from forward contracts to buy or sell foreign currency for yen. The new rules will start to have an impact from the end of this month, when listed companies publish interim financial statements, their first since the rule took effect on April 1. It is another small step towards making Japanese financial markets easier to understand and brings reporting standards more in line with the US and the UK, reckons Kleinwort Benson, the UK merchant bank. Previously, companies which had misjudged forward currency contracts could bury unrealised foreign exchange losses as depreciation charges or other operating costs in their profit and loss accounts. It was only once the loss had become uncomfortably large, or had to be realised in cash, that such companies were forced to publish the bad news. The new disclosure rule makes no difference to reported profits; it just tells investors about Japanese companies' foreign exchange risks. A taste of what might be to come emerged on Monday, when Japan Airlines' share price dipped on reports, unconfirmed by the company, that it was sitting on an unrealised currency loss of Y45bn (Dollars 451m). JAL officials did, however, confirm that the company signed a contract 10 years ago to buy Dollars 3.6bn with yen, in chunks at a series of pre-agreed exchange rates. This means JAL has, on this contract, missed the bargain presented by the US currency's subsequent fall in value against the yen. It will now have to pay more yen, at expensive old exchange rates, to buy dollars than if it bought the US currency at today's rates. Investors were quick to realise that this made little difference to the airline's financial health, since JAL has been swallowing large undisclosed foreign exchange losses for years, and the shares made up the lost ground yesterday, rising Y11 to Y746. Details of the unrealised loss will be explained in JAL's interim report on October 28. All this invites the question of how many other corporate treasurers have embarrassing news to relate. The indications are not many. Government officials estimate that total unrealised losses could amount to Y1,000bn, equivalent to about one-tenth of listed manufacturing companies' Y10,200bn combined pre-tax profits last year. The sectors most likely to have to divulge exchange rate slip-ups are those that need dollars, or other foreign currency, to buy assets or materials: oil refiners, petrochemical groups, general trading companies and airlines, for example. Previous foreign exchange shockers are the best guide. They include Showa Shell, a conservatively run oil refiner which announced a Y165bn unrealised foreign exchange loss in February last year. Then there is Nippon Steel Chemical, a petrochemicals group, whose head of accounting threw himself under a train last autumn after losing nearly Y14bn in forward currency contracts, and Kashima Oil, another refiner, with a Y152.2bn forward loss last April. 'Many will be losses deriving from a perfectly legitimate use of foreign exchange, even if it went spectacularly wrong,' says Mr Tom Hill, equity strategist at SG Warburg Securities in Tokyo. JAL, for example, needs to calculate in advance the rough cost of funding its Dollars 800m annual aircraft purchasing requirement. Most of its revenues are in yen, so it needs to buy dollars. A forward contract allows JAL to choose a fixed currency rate over a multi-year aircraft buying programme. If it misjudges and pays too much for dollars, JAL can smooth out the loss by writing it down over the 15-year depreciation period used for international aircraft. For that reason, JAL's potential currency loss is no surprise to those who follow the company closely. However, there are likely to be red faces in other Japanese corporate treasuries when the mid-term results season gets under way.</p>

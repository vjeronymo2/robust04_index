			<p>BFN     [Text] Jordan rejected Israeli accusations that the country  was assisting the Islamic Hamas Movement, and said such  accusations were rash and baseless.    A senior Jordanian official said Israel's accusations are  not  helping the peace process. He said Hamas attacks were planned  inside the occupied Arab land.    Hamas claimed responsibility for two suicide attacks which  killed 14 Israelis inside Israel over the past 10 days.    Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin called a news  conference  late last night and warned against what he called continued  activities of Hamas in Jordan. Rabin and his Foreign Minister  Shim'on Peres said Israel will not tolerate the activities of  Hamas.</p>

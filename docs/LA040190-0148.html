			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> FLORIDA;  </P> <P> ENGINEER ON JET FLEW DESPITE COCAINE TEST  </P> <P> Eastern Airlines took no action against a flight engineer who tested positive  for cocaine use until managers in Miami learned seven months later he had been  charged with buying crack, the airline said.  </P> <P> The test results apparently went unnoticed because of a clerical error, said  Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak. Dain Schneemilch, 36, of Key Largo, Fla.,  was fired March 20, but the Air Line Pilots Assn. has filed a grievance to  appeal the dismissal, she said. Schneemilch was attending ground school to  become a co-pilot when he was arrested after allegedly buying cocaine from an  undercover sheriff's officer, Ceremsak said. He flew no airline flights as a  co-pilot, she said. Schneemilch has pleaded innocent to the drug charges.  </P></p>

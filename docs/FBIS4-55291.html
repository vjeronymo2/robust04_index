			<p>BFN     [Text] After five days of negotiating at the U.S. Embassy  in Vienna, the Croat-Muslim talks on the implementation of the  Washington agreement have come to a successful end. The  federation's external borders have been fixed, insomuch as the  Croat and Muslim demands to the Serbs and to the international  community are concerned. The internal cantonal organization, as  well as the organization of the federation's and the  government's leadership, have also been agreed upon.    The reports we have received say that the federation will  have eight cantons, but it has not yet been agreed which ones  will be purely Croat and which ones purely Muslim. All that is  known is that four will go to the Muslims and two to the Croats.  Some reports say that the Croatian cantons will include western  Herzegovina and upper Posavina. Two cantons will be mixed.  Tihomir Vinkovic has this report:    [Vinkovic] The agreement will formally be signed in Geneva  on  Saturday, 14 May. Kresimir Zubak, head of the Bosnian Croat  delegation, said after the talks that the first president of the  Bosniak-Muslim federation for the period of six months will be a  Croat, while the first prime minister will be a Bosniak. Six of  the 17 government ministries will go to Croats. The federation  will encompass 58 percent of the territory of Bosnia-Herzegovina  over eight cantons. Croat people will constitute a majority in  two cantons, Muslim people in four, while two will be mixed.  The mixed cantons--one in central Bosnia with a seat in  Travnik, and the other in the Neretva River basin with a seat in  Mostar--will be administered on a parity basis in accordance  with the 1991 census.    Zubak thanked the U.S. Embassy for its good services during  the talks. He also thanked U.S. mediator Charles Redman and  U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia-Herzegovina Viktor Jakovich.    Bosniak leader Haris Silajdzic said that this is a major  step  toward a peaceful solution to the crisis in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It is also a major step toward the preservation of the  territorial integrity and sovereignty of Bosnia-Herzegovina,  Silajdzic added. He expressed hope that not just Croats and  Bosniaks, but also all those who consider Bosnia-Herzegovina as  their homeland, will work toward the implementation of this  agreement. He assessed the internal borders to be very  democratic. Silajdzic also said it was a provisional agreement  that will be submitted for adoption to the Bosnia-Herzegovina  Assembly.    Asked by a journalist whether the Serbs would agree to  return  part of the territory they had conquered so that the  Croat-Bosniak federation could encompass 58 percent, Silajdzic  said he hoped for help from the international community, which  will not tolerate genocide.    As a confederal partner, I wish to congratulate Bosniaks and  Croats on the serious talks and the agreement that I witnessed,  Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic said. It is in Croatia's  interest that this agreement is implemented, Minister Granic  said in conclusion.</p>

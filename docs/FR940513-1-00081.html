			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The environmental, costs, energy and economic impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the proposed MACT standards are summarized in Tables 4  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> through 6, and are represented by Regulatory Alternative A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for facilities emitting less than or equal to 1 Mg of HAP  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Regulatory Alternative A for facilities emitting more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> than 1 Mg of HAP. There are no projected impacts to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling emissions from ballasting.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed in section IV.C.5, the EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the potential safety impacts of the standards have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The estimated impacts of the standards are a VOC  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction of 12,400 Mg/yr of which 1,300 Mg are HAP. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capital and annualized costs are estimated to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> $570 million and $130 million, respectively.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The EPA performed an economic impact analysis of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT determination for this regulation. Potential price,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> output, and employment impacts for affected producers and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the marine transport industry were examined for each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> alternative. Potential small business impacts were also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> isolated. Additional information on these economic impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is available in the docket for this proposed regulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Estimated maximum price increases for the affected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> products varied but were not large (less than 1 percent) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any of the products under Regulatory Alternative A of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> These price increase estimates reflect both the control cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase for transporting crude oil and the control cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increase for transporting petroleum products. Because these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> price increases are small and because the elasticity of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demand coefficients for petroleum products are small,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated percent output (i.e., throughput) reductions were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimal. Correspondingly, estimated employment reductions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were also small (less than 200).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under Regulatory Alternative A of the MACT  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determination for terminals emitting more than 1 Mg/yr,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> potentially significant economic impacts on the smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminal operations that would have to install controls were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> identified. These significant impacts may have resulted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the high costs overall acting in combination with high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> per-barrel control cost differentials between the smaller  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and larger terminal operations that would have to control.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is expected that many of the smaller terminal operations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be able to pass all of their control costs forward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to consumers since they would be under increased competitive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pressure from the larger terminal operations. It was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> estimated that up to 200 of the 264 affected terminal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> operations will have difficulty either absorbing control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> costs or passing along these costs to consumers under the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The potential economic impact on marine vessel owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is relatively small. Average control cost per barrel for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tankers shipping crude oil or refined products was estimated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be $0.002 per barrel while owners or barges shipping  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> refined products would face control costs of $0.08 per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> barrel. Because 77 percent of U.S. marine-transported  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> petroleum product volume would be affected by these proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards, a significant percentage of U.S. marine vessels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will need to be retrofitted. The vessels least costly to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> modify (most likely the larger, newer, double-skin vessels)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will be retrofitted first, leading to a significant degree  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of dedicated service. It is expected that vessel owners  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that do retrofit will be able to pass retrofit costs forward  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to consumers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed above, a primary concern in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> implementation of these proposed regulations is safety.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Though section 112 of the Act does not specifically address  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Coast Guard regulations on safety, the EPA has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> endeavored to make sure that safety factors are adequately  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addressed and that nothing in the proposed regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whether proposed under section 183(f) or 112, is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> inconsistent with current U.S. Coast Guard regulations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, section 183(f)(2) of the Act requires that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any regulations promulgated by any State or political  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unloading of tank vessels must be consistent with U.S. Coast  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Guard regulations regarding safety. This consistency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement is equally applicable to any State or local  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation promulgated under the authority of the Clean Air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Act section 112. Moreover, section 112(l) requires that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Administrator disapprove any program submitted by a State if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator determines that the program is not likely  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to satisfy the objectives of the Act. The EPA believes that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> any State or local program that is inconsistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> U.S. Coast Guard safety regulations is ``not likely to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> satisfy the objectives of the Act'' and would therefore be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> disapproved by the Administrator.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> F. Selection of Format for the Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The chosen format for the standards is a percent of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> mass emissions reduction. The percent of mass reduction  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> format allows a focus on the final control device after good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> capture has been ensured. This approach is consistent with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the benzene NESHAP (40 CFR part 61 subpart BB). Sufficient  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data to develop a mass per unit loaded standard were not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> available. Additionally, emission rates can vary between  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities and between vessels based on loading temperature  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and the arrival condition of the vessel, making it difficult  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to set an acceptable mass per unit loaded standard while  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ensuring good capture and control. Developing a mass per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit loaded standard would have required extensive testing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and would need to be more stringent than the percent of mass  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reduction format in order to accommodate the varying  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> terminal and vessel conditions. For this reason, a mass per  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit loaded alternative is not being proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The primary format, mass emissions reduction, for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> MACT standards is the same as the RACT standards. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> because the MACT standards allow the source the flexibility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to control only the portion of total facility emissions  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needed to meet the 93 percent reduction requirement,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facilities may choose to calculate both potential  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> uncontrolled and actual controlled emissions as part of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance demonstration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

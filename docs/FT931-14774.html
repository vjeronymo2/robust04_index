			<p>930116 FT  16 JAN 93 / Somali warlords sign pact Somalia's feuding factions signed a pact yesterday to disarm their unruly militias and end the fighting which led to the deaths by starvation of more than 300,000 people, Reuter reports from Addis Ababa. The country's rival warlords, Ali Mahdi Mohamed (pictured right) and Mohamed Farah Aideed, signed the agreement after more than a week of talks. Under the pact, heavy weapons will be turned over to the UN. But few western diplomats, UN officials or Somalis believe that Somali militias or freelance gunmen will easily surrender the weapons which give them power. The UN is hoping all factions will attend talks in March aimed at setting up a transitional government.</p>

			<p><P> August 31, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> VIDEO GAME MAKERS READY AD BLITZES;  </P> <P> MARKETING: USING VASTLY DIFFERENT STRATEGIES, SEGA AND NINTENDO ARE TRYING TO  ENTICE CHRISTMAS SHOPPERS EARLY IN AN UNCERTAIN ECONOMIC MARKET.  </P> <P> Michael Jackson has thrown his hat into the video game ring. In fact, his hat  becomes a weapon that Mr. Moonwalker tosses at the bad guys -- in a new video  game.  </P> <P> Jackson is just one of a handful of big-name celebrities in Sega of America's  new video game marketing arsenal. Others include heavyweight boxing champion  James (Buster) Douglas, San Francisco 49er quarterback Joe Montana and Los  Angeles Dodgers Manager Tommy Lasorda. All will appear in Sega's new video  games as well as in a $10-million ad campaign being launched next week for  Sega's ballyhooed "Genesis" video game system.  </P> <P> At the same time, giant Nintendo also plans to launch its new $35-million ad  campaign next week.  </P> <P> The two rivals are trying to attract early Christmas buyers in an uncertain  economic market. Sega would like nothing better than to muscle into Nintendo's  dominance of the $3-billion video game industry. Analysts say Nintendo commands  80% of the market, compared to Sega's 15%.  </P> <P> The two campaigns appear to have far different strategies. Nintendo won't be  using celebrities. Meanwhile, in a Nintendo-bashing ad campaign that vows,  "Genesis does what Nintendon't," Sega mirrors the tactics of such  celebrity-laden advertisers as Nike, L.A. Gear, Coke and Pepsi.  </P> <P> "Celebrities can work incredibly well, if they're relevant to the product,"  said Mike Agate of the Los Angeles consulting firm Mike Agate Associates. "But  generally these people are horribly expensive. You've got to justify them by  incremental increases in sales."  </P> <P> Sega will pay about $10 million over the next two years to the celebrities it  has signed, estimates Michael Katz, president of the consumer products division  at Sega. He says Sega will get its money's worth if the company can double  annual sales of its popular Genesis system hardware to 1 million units. The  hardware retails for about $189.  </P> <P> "Our celebrities deliver a very targeted message to a very jaded audience,"  said Patrick Henry, management supervisor of the Los Angeles office of Bozell,  the agency that created the campaign for Sega. Besides TV commercials, the  campaign features a 69-second ad featuring Jackson that will be shown in movie  theaters. The ad intermixes scenes from Jackson's "Moonwalker" music video with  animated action from the video games.  </P> <P> Jackson did more than Moonwalk for Sega. He made several trips to Japan to help  design the video. In fact, the idea of featuring Jackson tossing his hat at  pursuing villains in the video game came from Jackson himself, said Al Nilsen,  Sega's marketing director. "Every time someone came up with something he liked,  he'd say, 'The kids will love this.' "  </P> <P> "There's always a high risk with celebrities," said Katz. For example, boxer  Douglas has yet to fight since he defeated Mike Tyson in February. Although  Sega has a two-year contract with Douglas, some boxing experts believe that  Douglas could lose his next fight. "If he loses, we will no longer be able to  refer to him as world champion," said Katz. "But hopefully the game would still  sell."  </P> <P> Shortly after former heavyweight champion Tyson lost to Douglas, Tyson's name  was taken off Nintendo's boxing video game. "Our deal with him ran out about  the time he got clobbered," said Don Coyner, manager of advertising at the  Redmond, Wash.-based domestic distributor, Nintendo of America Inc.  </P> <P> Tyson was replaced by a fictional character named "Mr. Dream."  </P> <P> Maybe Nintendo learned some sort of lesson from that experience. "We believe  the product can sell itself," said Coyner. The campaign will mostly support  GameBoy, a hand-held video game that Nintendo introduced last year.  </P> <P> Why all of this maneuvering in early September?  </P> <P> Video game makers are worried about the economy. Sega is even offering an extra  game cartridge free to those who buy Genesis hardware before Oct. 31. "The  economy now is not the strongest it's ever been," said Katz. "We want to get  the product moving."  </P></p>

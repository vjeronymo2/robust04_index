			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / More companies follow Cadbury guidance COMPANIES are responding to calls for improved corporate governance, according to a survey released today by ProNed, the organisation to promote non-executive directors. Only 13 of the biggest 100 companies surveyed were without a remuneration committee and 12 without an audit committee. For companies below this level, six times as many referred in their annual reports to the formation of board committees in 1992 as in 1991. The survey was based on an analysis of 1991 and 1992 annual reports and accounts from the top 350 listed companies up to the end of May 1993. Of the companies below the top 100, the number with a remuneration committee more than doubled to 73 per cent and those with an audit committee rose from 31 per cent to 66 per cent. Twenty of the top 100 companies and 16 per cent of the next largest 250 have a combined chairman and chief executive, while the number of non-executives on boards has been growing. The figures seem to indicate growing compliance with some of the key recommendations of the Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance, published last December. Just 28 of the top 100 companies and 11 per cent of the next 250 had a nomination committee. This runs contrary to calls by ProNed for more impartial selection of non-executive directors. However, Mr Colin St Johnston, ProNed's managing director, stressed that the proportion was rising.</p>

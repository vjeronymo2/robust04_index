			<p>930814 FT  14 AUG 93 / Currency surge 'could prolong slowdown' THE YEN yesterday climbed towards the Y100 level against the dollar, with persistent intervention by the Bank of Japan in the Tokyo foreign exchange market only partially curbing its advance. Tourist rates in the capital broke through Y100 to the dollar for the first time. In a flurry of press conferences, Japanese government agencies and ministers from the new seven-party ruling coalition voiced renewed concern that the appreciation of the yen, in hampering exports, was in danger of prolonging the country's economic slowdown. The yen closed in Tokyo at a record Y102.40 to the dollar compared with Y103.37 on Thursday and Y104.35 a week ago. It touched Y101.80 during the day. Dealers said the central bank entered the market to sell yen for dollars and may also have bought D-Marks. Mr Tsutomu Tanaka, deputy director general of the Economic Planning Agency, blamed the appreciation of the yen on the upheavals in the European Monetary System. He called on European Community monetary authorities to act swiftly in stabilising their currencies. Mr Hirohisa Fujii, who took over as finance minister on Monday, said after a morning cabinet meeting that Japan would liaise with other leading industrialised countries and was 'ready to take appropriate and timely steps against undesirable market developments'. Mr Jiro Saito, his deputy, added later that Japan was urging the other Group of Seven economic powers to help stem a rise against the dollar which he described as 'too fast.' He noted that a G7 agreement in April to co-operate in stabilising the main traded currencies remained in force. Their comments were taken in the market to indicate that the Bank of Japan will continue its efforts to rein back the yen. Analysts also thought a further cut in the official discount rate, perhaps of as much as half a percentage point from the current 2.5 per cent, may be in prospect by next month. Indications in the spring that the domestic slowdown might have bottomed out have given way in recent weeks to fears that the economy has entered a double-dip, although Mr Saito rejected this yesterday. Indicating its conservative budgetary approach, the cabinet yesterday decided to hold the overall increase in government spending next year to 3.8 per cent, the lowest in four years, while leaving room for a 5 per cent growth in public fixed investment. Economic indicators released yesterday gave little cause for optimism. The Bank of Japan said domestic wholesale prices for last month were unchanged from June and down 1.6 per cent from a year earlier, assisted by cheaper oil imports because of the stronger yen - ministries are in dispute about to what extent these should be passed on to consumers. Bankruptcies in July, according to Teikoku Data Bank, exceeded 1,000 for the sixth successive month but the liabilities involved were down 23.3 per cent year-on-year. This was in spite of the fact that they included the collapse of Nikkatsu, a film producer, with debts of nearly Y50bn. Cosmo Securities rescued by Daiwa Bank, Page 10</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Prague May 4 (CTK) -- National Property Fund (FNM)  Chairman Tomas Jezek said on television this evening that far  from covering up or even initiating swindles in the  privatisation process, as has been alleged, he and his FNM  colleagues had actually exposed two big swindles in recent weeks.    One concerned the brewery group Prazske pivovary, he said in  a Nova television interview. The second involved a former FNM  employee, Milan Krcmar, who Jezek said had manipulated the sale  of shares in three companies in favour of the Prvni investicni  investment fund.    In a spirited defence against lately mounting criticism,  Jezek said: "There are politicians who fulfill their role as  larks -- that means they flit off to international conferences  and to Davoses and twitter about the successes of our  transformation; and then someone here who has to do hard work  everyday, project after project with all the problems, all the  rascals who want to pinch a bit of state property for  themselves, who are in far away places I can't get to, can't  see... and then in the end it all falls on me".    Davos, Switzerland, is the venue of a yearly International  Economic Forum. This year the Czech Republic was represented by  Premier Vaclav Klaus, Economics Minister Karel Dyba and Trade  and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy.    Jezek said he believed a section of the communist left which  never wanted transformation and privatisation was responsible  for the attacks on himself and the FNM's work and were "eagerly  slinging mud". "That can be exploited by various ambitious  youngsters, unfortunately from within the coalition, who would  like to see themselves in my position, at least at the end of  the successful transformation. They are employed by various  ministers, some from my party," Jezek said, referring to the  Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA).</p>

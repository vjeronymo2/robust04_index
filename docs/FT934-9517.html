			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / UK Company News: Bermuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance The Department of Trade and Industry is examining the circumstances surrounding the collapse of a leading Bermuda-based insurance company, Bermuda Fire &amp; Marine Insurance. Bermuda Fire &amp; Marine filed for a winding up petition on the island last week. DTI concern is understood to focus on the company's London branch which operated until the mid-1980s. Mr Gareth Hughes, a partner of Ernst &amp; Young, London, and Mr Tony Joaquin, a partner in Ernst &amp; Young, Bermuda, were appointed provisional liquidators of the Bermuda company last week.</p>

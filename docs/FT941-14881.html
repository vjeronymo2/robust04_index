			<p>940118 FT  18 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Dalepak hit by frozen food side As forewarned in October, Dalepak Foods broke even for its opening six months with profits for the period to end-October working through at just Pounds 29,000 at the pre-tax level. The profits setback, down from Pounds 1.6m previously, was struck from turnover some 10 per cent lower at Pounds 19.19m. Interest payable rose by Pounds 21,000 to Pounds 151,000 due to the high level of capital expenditure in the previous year. Earnings per share declined to 0.16p (9.3p) and the interim dividend is cut by 1p to 0.5p. The shares slipped 6p to 139p. Mr Michael Abrahams, chairman of the North Yorkshire-based frozen foods and ready made meals manufacturer, blamed the profits downturn on the main frozen foods business which suffered a 13 per cent fall in turnover. Lower selling prices, due to retailer price pressure, accounted for 4 per cent of the fall, while curtailment of promotional activity at unprofitable prices accounted for 9 per cent. He pointed out that sterling's devaluation in 1992 had added 11 per cent to raw material costs which could not be recovered because of a highly competitive retail food market and weak consumer demand. The frozen foods division ended the half year with a trading loss. Price increases have been implemented on some products in the division to recover margins, the pace of product development has been accelerated and costs reduced throughout the business. Mr Abrahams said these initiatives were starting to show through, and he anticipated improved results in the second half. At the period-end gearing stood at 31.7 per cent, compared with 39.8 per cent in April. It was expected to rise 'modestly' towards the end of the year.</p>

			<p>940719 FT  19 JUL 94 / Review builds hopes for a constructive relationship: A look at the broad support for plans to overhaul costly building practices The almost universal praise with which the construction industry and its customers yesterday greeted the Latham Review indicates broad support for proposals to overhaul costly contract and management practices which have soured commercial relationships and increased the cost of buildings. The cost of building an office block was estimated in a recent study to be 30 per cent higher in the UK than in parts of the US. Repeated arguments between different parts of the UK industry over whose fault this is emphasises the atmosphere of conflict. It was in a bid to encourage a less adversarial climate that the independent review of construction management and practices, the first for 30 years, was sponsored by the Departments for Trade and Industry and the Environment last year. Its biggest success has been to weld an unlikely alliance between customers, construction professionals, contractors and tradespeople who have welcomed measures proposed by Sir Michael Latham, who led the review. Sir Michael, a former Conservative MP and ex-director of the Housebuilders Federation, recognises that little will be achieved if this broad support is allowed to disintegrate into renewed factional fighting. It is essential, therefore, that there is strong backing from the environment department when it responds to the proposals next Monday. The department is expected to play a central role in developing new contract forms and codes of practice intended for adoption by public and private-sector purchasers. A construction contracts bill would make it mandatory for all contracts to include common features to improve the flow of payments to contractors and sub-contractors, with interim payments based on pre-determined milestones. Trust funds would be required to hold contract cash to protect companies should customers or contractors fail. Contracts would require pre-determined adjudicators to be appointed to rule on disputes, reducing the need for costly court cases. Variations to design or contract terms, a common cause for claims for additional payments, would have to be priced in advance with provision for independent adjudication if agreement could not be reached. The 'new engineering contract' developed by the Institution of Civil Engineers already contained many of these features, Sir Michael said. He hoped the new contract would be used on a third of all government construction work over the next four years. Legislation would be supported by a new code of practice, backed by construction employers and customers and sponsored by the environment department. Its aim would be to promote closer co-operation between various construction disciplines and to provide a checklist of management responsibilities which could be incorporated into contracts. The code would be circulated to all public-sector purchasing bodies including hospital trusts and self-governing schools and colleges. Public bodies would be encouraged to introduce more efficient tendering procedures. Companies and consultants would be required to complete a single form to qualify for public-sector contracts. If accepted they would be placed on a national register of approved companies. A star system based on performance might be incorporated for jobs above a certain size, Sir Michael said. The move would bring Britain into line with continental European countries which require companies to be registered with a European Union-approved body before they can tender for work. Companies appearing on registers would pay a small levy to pay for the cost. Public-sector contracts would continue to be subject to price competition in open tender but purchasers would be encouraged to consider quality as well as price. Guidelines restricting the number of companies shortlisted for contracts would be applied more vigorously. The review also calls for legislation to determine who should be responsible for building defects after construction is completed. It proposes to make it mandatory for buildings to be insured for up to 10 years against defects. A small levy charged on insurance premiums would help to fund construction industry research. 'The measures, however,' said Sir Michael, 'must be accepted as a package. It will fail if organisations seek to pick out the bits they like. Just like the Dodo in Alice in Wonderland, we want everybody to win, with prizes for all.' Constructing the Team. HMSO, PO Box 276, London SW8 5DT. Pounds 19.95. LATHAM'S PROPOSALS Contracts: Common features for contracts. Improved payment procedures. Trust funds to ensure companies get paid. Adjudicators to resolve conflicts. Variations to design and contract terms should be priced in advance. Tendering: Single qualification document for all public sector work. Government departments only to use approved companies and consultants on a central register. Registers to have a star system based on performance. Legislation: A construction contracts bill by 1995/96. Insurance against building defects for up to 10 years. Levy to be charged on insurance premiums to fund industry research. Responsibilities for building liabilities to be more clearly defined. Implementation: An industry steering committee led by the environment secretary to develop new contract forms and management practices. A Construction Strategy Code of Practice to be circulated to public sector purchasers and agencies. A clients forum to represent private sector purchasers.</p>

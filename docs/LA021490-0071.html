			<p><P> February 14, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MARTIN OUT, SO MARINI PICKS UP AGOURA  </P> <P> Agoura High might have been stunned by an unexpected twist, but, ultimately, it  was Crespi that was left twisting in the wind.  </P> <P> Posting a convincing rebuttal to the loss of its best player, Agoura downed  Crespi, 75-66, Tuesday night in the first round of the Southern Section 4-A  Division basketball playoffs.  </P> <P> Charger guard Sean Martin, who averages a team-high 22.5 points a game, took a  spill just 2 1/2 minutes into the contest. He twisted his ankle and watched the  remainder of the game from the sideline.  </P> <P> Crespi (11-12), too, played without its leading scorer, Rasaan Hall (17.7  points), ruled academically ineligible two weeks ago.  </P> <P> The Chargers (14-8), who had not played without Martin since summer league,  used his departure as a rallying point.  </P> <P> "He's our best player without a doubt," Coach Kevin Pasky said. "But our kids  know that we're not a one-man team."  </P> <P> It was one man, however, who clinched the game in the stretch. Joe Marini hit  six consecutive free throws during a two-minute span to expand the Agoura  advantage from two to eight points. The Celts never recovered.  </P> <P> Interestingly, Marini transferred from Crespi two years ago because of limited  playing time.  </P> <P> "I'm totally stoked," he said. "This is sweeter because it's against Crespi. I  could very easily be playing here."  </P> <P> Crespi could have used Marini's sharpshooting in the second half. Although the  Celts made 64% of their shots from the field in the first half, they made just  seven of 29 shots (24%) after intermission.  </P> <P> "We didn't bury them in the first half and then we just went flat," Crespi  Coach Ed Marek said.  </P> <P> The turning point was a pivotal five-point play late in the third quarter.  Agoura's Eddie Corridori buried a three-point shot and his brother, Gino, was  immediately fouled in the paint. Gino converted the one-and-one situation and  gave the Chargers a 56-49 lead.  </P> <P> Said Pasky: "I thought, now they gotta start thinking threes, and that's not  their strength."  </P> <P> Crespi was paced by center Christian Fauria, who scored 18 points and grabbed  15 rebounds, and guard John Curtin, who came off the bench to score 17. Point  guard Matt Luderer and Scott Barton each added 10 points.  </P> <P> Center Tony Marko scored 19 for the Chargers. Marini (15 points) and Bryce  Arledge (14) scored in double figures. Eddie Corridori contributed nine points  and six assists.  </P> <P> Martin said he expects to be back for Agoura's second-round game Friday.  </P> <P> Crespi led, 44-37, at intermission. The Celts staged a 10-4 rally midway  through the second quarter that was sparked by two three-point baskets and a  layup by Curtin.  </P></p>

			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries lower ahead of economic news US Treasury prices fell from last week's highs in quiet trading yesterday as investors awaited economic figures on producer and consumer prices due out today and tomorrow. Late in the session, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down 9/16 at 95 5/16 yielding 7.905 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was  7/32 lower at 99 9/32 , yielding 7.631 per cent. Last week, the market benefited somewhat as investors sought safe investments in the wake of uncertainty surrounding Orange County, California's declaration of bankruptcy. Yesterday, however investors turned their attention to the spate of economic data due out this week. Most economists expect both the producer price index, due today, and the consumer price index, due tomorrow, to show increases for November. So far this year the CPI has held relatively steady, increasing by about 0.2 per cent a month despite inflationary pressures elsewhere in the economy. Economists believe the CPI for November will show an increase of 0.3 per cent. Also important will be tomorrow's release of capacity utilisation figures, which show the percentage of capital being used for the creation of goods. Analysts expect November's figure to increase to 84.8 per cent from 84.6 per cent in October. The figures should give traders an indication of what the Federal Reserve might do at the December 20 meeting of its open market committee. With no important economic data released yesterday, the market reacted to comments from President Bill Clinton that he was not averse to a tax cut. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Mr Clinton said he felt the country could afford a middle-class tax cut. This sparked concern among Treasury bond traders of a growing deficit that could add to inflationary pressure. The fall in US Treasuries yesterday gave a weaker tone to the European government bond markets, but they also had their own problems. French bond prices were hit by the announcement from Mr Jacques Delors that he would not run for election as French president. Meanwhile, Italian bonds were affected by government uncertainties and fell by more than a point. French prices fell on increased political uncertainty after the withdrawal of Mr Delors from the presidential campaign. The December Notionnel future on Liffe fell 0.90 to 112.28. Mr Dominique Barbet, at Paribas Capital Markets in Paris said French bonds had fallen 10 basis points as a result of the move by Mr Delors. He said: 'They may fall another 10 or 20 basis points, because we have a lot of uncertainty in the French market. Among socialists, Mr Delors was the one the market liked the most.' Italian government bonds were affected yesterday by international and domestic politics. Prices were affected by the announcement by Mr Delors because it suggested that European monetary union was further away. Meanwhile, Mr Roberto Maroni, Italy's interior minister, said the coalition forming the government could be different next year. Mr Simon Maggs at IBJ said volatility in Italian bonds had lessened since the budget looked like getting through parliament, but had now increased. The yield on 10-year government bonds rose 24 basis points to 12.37 per cent. UK gilts were largely unmoved by the November producer price data, although they took their tone from US Treasuries and the December long gilt future moved down  13/32 to trade around 102 1/16 . The spread over bunds was around 123 basis points. Mr Kevin Adams at BZW said the PPI numbers were pretty much in line with expectations, and investors would now be waiting for the data on unit labour costs, which is due out tomorrow. Recent political troubles for the ruling Conservative party were not seen to move the market yesterday, although Mr Robert Thomas at NatWest Markets said: 'If it were not for the government staggering from one political crisis to another, it would be realistic to forecast that the gilt/bund spread for 10-year maturities could narrow down to 100 basis points or less.' Mr Harry Thapar at Technical Data said: 'Gilts have not yet priced in the political risk, because they remain surrounded by post-budget bliss'. German government bonds slipped in thin trading. The March bund futures contract on Liffe fell 0.13 to 89.84. An analyst in Frankfurt said bunds were trading in a range of 89.73 to 89.90, and were likely to continue to do so until after the Christmas break.</p>

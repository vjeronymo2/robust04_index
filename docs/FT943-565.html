			<p>940928 FT  28 SEP 94 / Izetbegovic backs down on arms embargo Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic retreated last night from demands for a lifting of the UN arms embargo against his country, saying he would agree to six months' delay in lifting the ban, writes Michael Littlejohns in New York. He conceded that even this delay would still be unacceptable to some members of the five-nation contact group on Bosnia who were worried about lifting the ban. In an address to the UN General Assembly, Mr Izetbegovic insisted on his country's right to self-defence. He warned that if his agreement to a delay in lifting the arms embargo was rejected, he would see 'from our friends that this embargo be lifted unilaterally'.</p>

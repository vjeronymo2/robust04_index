			<p>BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- Federal Interior Minister Manfred  Kanther and his Croatian counterpart, Ivan Jarnjak, signed an  agreement in Bonn today which makes provisions for, among other  things, the repatriation of former civil war refugees from  Croatia. The Interior Ministry announced in Bonn today that the  federal states can now begin repatriation on 1 May. This  applies to refugees who came to Germany before 22 May 1992.    To handle the devastation caused by the war, repatriation  will take place in stages. Moreover, refugees from the areas of  Croatia occupied, disputed, or devastated by the Serbs will not  be returned until a second phase in the first half year of 1995.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Hulun Buir, April 23 (XINHUA) -- The forest fire  that has raged for days in the Hulun Buir League (prefecture) in  northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region was put out by  six o'clock this morning.    A joint message of greetings was sent today to all the fire-  fighters by the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist  Party, the State Council and the Central Military Commission.    The message praised the good job done by fire fighters  despite unfavorable weather conditions.    There were no deaths or houses burnt, and damage to the  forest was kept to the minimum, sources said.    Some of the fire-fighters have begun to leave the area, and  it began to snow this morning in the forest. However, forest  police stayed on to watch the final dying out of the fire.    A concentrated effort was made from about five o'clock  yesterday afternoon when the wind weakened and the fire finally  was completely extinguished by six o'clock this morning.    Sources at the fire-fighting command headquarters said that  more than 7,000 policemen, People's Liberation Army soldiers and  local workers joined in the efforts to extinguish the fire,  which broke out seven days ago.    Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Chinese Communist  Party, and acting premier Zhu Rongji and other Chinese leaders  had earlier sent messages to encourage the fire fighters.</p>

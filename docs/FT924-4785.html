			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / Business shrugs off Hong Kong tussle: Financial Times reporters gauge the reactions of US and British companies MOST of the biggest US and British companies doing business in Hong Kong yesterday shrugged off the diplomatic scuffle between London and Beijing as unlikely to affect their investment plans. According to the Hong Kong economic and trade office in New York, US direct foreign investment in the colony totals about Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.2bn). The territory is the third most important US investment destination in Asia, after Japan and Australia. At Amoco, the fifth largest US energy group that has its regional Asian headquarters for chemical operations in Hong Kong, Mr Martin Pranga, manager of foreign affairs, said he was confident matters would be sorted out, and dismissed the row as 'much ado about nothing'. Mr Pranga, who had just returned to Chicago from a visit to Hong Kong, said the row 'seems more to do with domestic politics in the UK, namely Mr Patten's future in British politics, than with Hong Kong. The British foreign office is at the last minute trying to be remembered by history as having done the right thing, having previously abdicated responsibility. The business community in Hong Kong wishes it would die down because it anticipates doing business with the mainland. 'This is one of the ups and downs to be expected and will be settled eventually with a compromise.' Citibank, the leading US bank with 27 branches in Hong Kong, has 2,200 employees there and is active in investment banking, commercial, consumer and private banking. Although the bank declined an official comment, insiders at the bank said they were unconcerned at the London-Beijing row and saw 'tremendous opportunities' in their future business in Hong Kong. Mr Ronald Harber, vice president for Asia at Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing (3m), said he was not worried. 'I think basically it's business as usual. We don't foresee problems. We're entering into contracts that extend beyond 1997 with full confidence that they will be honoured beyond that date. From a practical standpoint, I don't seen any reason for concern.' Mr Paul Sacks, president of Multinational Strategies, a New York-based political risk analysis consultancy, doubted the latest turn of events would make US companies change their Hong Kong investment plans. 'I think most people have already discounted the effects of the transition. I do not anticipate any dramatic reaction on the part of US investors.' Mr Sacks said. Seen from the US point of view, the row between London and Beijing 'is merely the beginning of the face-off between an existing colonial power and the new landlord,' said Mr Sacks, who advises a number of US banks and companies. Most American businessmen understood that 'the realities are that the Chinese want this process of democratisation not to proceed and will use any number of bargaining chips.' Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, one of the largest investors in Hong Kong, also took a relaxed view. It said it would not change investment decisions as a result of China's statement because it saw it as part of a continuing war of words. It said banks were more influenced by China's Dollars 12bn (Pounds 7.8bn) investment in airlines, power generation and hotels in Hong Kong through the Chinese International Trust and Investment Corporation, and Bank of China. Among US companies active in Hong Kong is Exxon, which holds a 60 per cent interest in an electric power generating facility from which it supplies its partner, China Light and Power. Exxon, which earned USDollars 193m (Pounds 127m) from this activity after tax last year, said it did not expect the events to change its investment plans. Mr Alex Fong, director of the Hong Kong economic and trade office in New York, said the economic fundamentals were 'so strong' that the political row would be seen mainly as 'noises and rhetoric'. At Jardine Matheson, the Hong Kong trading company with strong UK ties, Sir Charles Powell, a director and former foreign policy adviser to Mr John Major and Mrs Thatcher, said: 'We have been operating in China and Hong Kong for 160 years, so tend to take the long view in these kinds of matters. 'We believe these short-term difficulties will be resolved and remain extremely optimistic about economic prospects for China and Hong Kong.' Sir Charles said Jardine supported the efforts of Mr Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, to promote greater democracy. The group, however, believed this could only be pursued in agreement with China. Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation (P&amp;O), of the UK, has operated for 125 years in Hong Kong in shipping and construction. The group said: 'We view the western rim of Pacific, with Hong Kong as a hub, as an area of great economic growth. 'Lord Sterling, our chairman, has recently returned from a very positive visit to Beijing which has reaffirmed our commitment to the region.' Costain, the UK construction group, is part of a consortium of Japanese, US and European companies which yesterday formally were awarded a HKDollars 9bn (Pounds 768.5m) contract to carry out reclamation and site preparation for Hong Kong's Chek Lap Kok airport. Mr Wob Gerretsen, Costain director responsible for UK and international contracting operations said: 'There is little concern on our part as all of our work will have been completed and paid for by 1997.' Logica, the largest UK-owned software house, developed the Hong Kong Stock Exchange's computerised trading system and maintains an office of some 50 people there. Mr Colin Rowland, director of international operations, said the political row was not good for confidence either for prospective customers or the company itself.</p>

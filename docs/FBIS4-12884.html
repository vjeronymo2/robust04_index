			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Phalangist Party leader Dr. George Sa'adah has  affirmed the need to speed up investigations and reveal the  perpetrators of the two crimes at the Sayyidat al-Najat Church  and the Phalangist Party headquarters. He pointed out that the  battle over freedoms has started and will not end until positive  results are achieved, which can only take place through the  restoration of newscasts and political programs to the audio and  visual media.    During the expanded Phalangist Party meeting that was held  yesterday at party headquarters, Sa'adah said: During the  al-Ta'if meetings, the issue of these varied and numerous media  was presented. But the decision was made then to cancel all the  militias, while there was no mention of canceling the media, but  of reorganizing it. [passage omitted]</p>

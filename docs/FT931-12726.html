			<p>930127 FT  27 JAN 93 / Croats advance in defiance of UN reprimand CROATIAN forces yesterday pressed forward in their drive to secure control of strategic Serb-held territory in the republic despite a reprimand from the United Nations Security Council. President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia offered to withdraw his army if Serb militia handed over heavy artillery seized from United Nations-supervised arms depots in Croatia's four UN-monitored zones. He said: 'We must install civilian power and normalise life in the region. Our military forces will withdraw from the regions they have liberated in so far as the Serb paramilitary forces are disarmed and give up the heavy weapons they seized,' said Croatian radio. Mr Tudjman also said Croatian police would replace all military forces in the region, a move likely to be fiercely opposed by Serb militias who have refused to disband under the year-old UN peace plan. After two French peacekeepers were killed on Monday, near the Adriatic port of Zadar, France announced it was sending a naval task force led by the aircraft carrier Clemenceau into the Adriatic Sea. Clashes between Serb and Croatian fighters yesterday appeared confined to the area around the vital Maslenica bridge, which joins Croatia's heartland with the southern Dalmatian coast. But a UN spokesperson cited 'disturbing reports of unusual Croatian troop movements' south of Knin, the centre of Krajina, outside the area of conflict. With the Croatian army in control of the damaged and vital Maslenica bridge since Monday, Serbs in Belgrade continued to sign up to fight to defend Krajina, the self-proclaimed Serb state which stretches from the Dalmatian hinterland to Croatia's border with Serbia. Western diplomats fear the fighting could spread. At least 10,000 people were killed in 1991 when Serb fighters, backed by the Yugoslav Army, took up arms against Croatian independence. A UN ceasefire last January froze the Serbo-Croat conflict although the Croatian government was increasingly frustrated by Krajina's Serbs who have virtually severed the republic. The Security Council on Monday condemned Croatian attacks on Serb-held territory in the UN zone and demanded that Serbs return heavy weapons to UN supervision. Meanwhile, Mr Vitaly Churkin, a Russian deputy foreign minister, flies to Croatia today to urge the end of what the Moscow has described as 'irresponsible terrorist action' by Croatian fighters. Judy Dempsey adds from Berlin: Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, said he hoped any decision by the Security Council on whether to enforce a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina, would not break the ruling coalition. But his remarks, which imply more a warning than a hope, coincided with deepening divisions within the coalition about Germany's participation in surveillance flights by Nato AWACS aircraft if the UN decides on implementing the no-fly zone. Earlier this week, Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary general, warned that any Nato operation could be undermined if German crews did not participate. The US, acknowledging that five oil barge groups on the Danube river appear to be heading towards Serbia in violation of UN sanctions, said yesterday it was up to Romania and Bulgaria to do whatever is needed to force compliance, Reuter reports from Washington. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the US and the UN sanctions committee had told both governments they had authority under UN resolution 787 to stop suspected vessels.</p>

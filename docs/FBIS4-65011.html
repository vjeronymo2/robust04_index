			<p>BFN     [Text] Gustave Feissel, the UN secretary general's  alternate special representative in Cyprus, left this afternoon  for Vienna. Tomorrow he will meet Turkish Deputy Foreign  Minister Tugay Ulucevik and Robert Lamb, the U.S. State  Department's special coordinator on the Cyprus issue.    Feissel noted in a statement that two Turkish Cypriots,  advisers to Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas, will also be in  Vienna. He added that during tomorrow's meeting the situation  will be evaluated since the deadlock on the talks on  implementing the confidence-building measures. The Vienna talks  are expected to be the last before the UN secretary general's  report is circulated by the end of next week.    Asked about the Lamb-Feissel-Ulucevik meeting, acting  Government Spokesman Spiros Arotis referred to the statement by  President Glavkos Kliridhis that the government does not expect  anything from this meeting.</p>

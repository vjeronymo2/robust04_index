			<p>940803 FT  03 AUG 94 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: Buoyant outlook at AF Bulgin Correction (published 5th August 1994) appended to this article. Shares in AF Bulgin, the electronic components and power supplies group, rose 6p to 63p yesterday after Mr Ronald Bulgin, chairman, told shareholders at the annual meeting that the six months to the end of July seemed to have 'been the most profitable half year for a number of years'. He added he would be surprised if profits for the year to January 1995 did not exceed Pounds 875,000, and more than Pounds 1m was targeted for the following year. In the year to January 1994, pre-tax losses were Pounds 212,000. CORRECTION AF Bulgin made pre-tax profits of Pounds 507,000 in the year to January 1994 and not losses of Pounds 212,000 as reported in Wednesday's FT.</p>

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Discount cosmetics draw makers' fire SHISEIDO, Japan's leading cosmetic maker, has clamped down on a Tokyo-based discount retailer, by cancelling shipments from its distribution subsidiaries. Shiseido said Kawachiya, a successful drinks discounter which has also started to sell cosmetics, was wholesaling rather than retailing cosmetics. However, Kawachiya is planning to file a complaint to the Fair Trade Commission, the country's anti-monopoly watchdog, next week, claiming that Shiseido's actions were intended to stop the discounting of its high-grade cosmetics. Although resale price maintenance of cosmetic products was cut to 24 low-priced items last year, the industry has traditionally had a tight grip on retail pricing of its products through its retail network. Kawachiya, an unlisted company, is one of the first Tokyo-based chain stores selling alcohol at discount prices, in spite of pressure from alcohol companies. After strong drinks sales it set up a chain of cosmetics stores discounting over 5,000 items made by six makers including Shiseido, Kao and Kanebo. By selling at 25 to 30 per cent cheaper than other retailers, Kawachiya's cosmetics sales have jumped ten-fold, hitting other cosmetics retailers.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Trade and Industry Minister Vladimir Dlouhy </F> by Martin Frydl; place and date not given: "Stability During  Economic Growth Requires a New Blend of Economic Policy"]    [Text] [Frydl] Mr. Minister, in your opinion, in what did  the Trade and Industry Ministry succeed most last year and, on  the contrary, in what did it succeed least?    [Dlouhy] If we talk about individual issues, I would say  that, for instance, the successes included foreign visits. I  inherited these from the Federal Foreign Trade Ministry, without  a clearly defined concept, and I think we succeeded in getting  them under way and in implementing a program supporting Czech  exporters. On the other hand, I could talk about all sorts of  problems: Temelin and the economic agreements, the Ingolstadt  oil pipeline and state guarantees for the Bavarian Government,  and the unfortunate case of Libkovice. However, no matter how  many individual issues economic life is made up of, it is not  evaluated according to them. The fundamental question is whether  the Czech Republic's economic development in 1993 was correct  and whether the government contributed to this by its economic  policy. I think the answers to both questions are positive.  Economic policy was oriented, first and foremost, toward  maintaining macroeconomic stability and releasing certain growth  incentives. If we compare the third quarter of 1993 and the  third quarter of 1992, the figures do not indicate much growth.  If we look at the absolute figures, however, it is possible to  anticipate economic growth as early as the first quarter of this  year.    [Frydl] The Czech Republic is doing relatively well in the  macro sphere but is somewhat behind in the micro sphere. It is  enough, for example, to look at insolvency or at the, so far,  imperfect legislation. What can be done? We will not get by for  long with a good macro situation alone.    [Dlouhy] This is true. If we do not succeed in getting  growth  under way, we will not maintain the stability of the  macroeconomic parameters for long. If Czech enterprises do not  improve their efficiency and productivity, our economy's  development will begin to decline and get into difficulty. The  macro parameters will not last if they are not generated from  the micro level. From the Industry Ministry's point of view, I  see a major problem in the implementation of ownership rights.  We often hear criticism from the National Property Fund that  there are banks here that, through the privatization funds, own  a large part of the Czech economy, and the question is just how  capable of implementing their rights are these owners, of  restructuring, of closing inefficient production lines, and of  obtaining new quality management. I consider this to be one of  the most important microeconomic issues.    [Frydl] Do you think the current relatively good  macroeconomic situation is proceeding from the good  microeconomic situation or, rather, from the initial impetus  caused by the change in our economy's orientation and the  opening up of new opportunities?    [Dlouhy] The good macroeconomic situation is, first and  foremost, a result of the fact that economic policy since 1990  has been conceived as a "package" of mutually linked steps: a  balanced budget, relatively strong financial restrictions from  the beginning, convertibility, and others. Compare the countries  of the former CEMA, where the reform steps are not linked, and  you will see far worse problems than in our country. The Czech  Republic has also succeeded in reorienting its exports from the  former CEMA to West European and other markets, and a private  sector has evolved that has absorbed a considerable segment of  unemployment. All of this has contributed to macro stability. It  will not continue to be maintained by this alone, however. The  time has come to show why we conducted privatization, and the  private owners have to guarantee stability in the enterprises.  Apart from this, until now we had macro stability during  economic decline or stagnation. Now we want stability during  economic growth. This requires a quite different blend of  economic policy.    [Frydl] The government has specific prerequisites for future  economic growth from which it proceeds in formulating its  policy. It is banking on an average GDP increase of some 3.5  percent per annum up to the year 2000. With such growth,  however, we will catch up with advanced states very, very  slowly. In your opinion, would it not be bette, if not this year  then at least in the future, to restore the Czech economy a  little--for example, through the state budget? Are the several  billions for so-called development projects in this year's  budget enough to stimulate the economy?    [Dlouhy] The economy cannot be stimulated in one go. The  aforementioned prodevelopment elements will certainly have some  effect. This is simply the first step, and, in 1995, the  situation could be far different in this regard. However, we are  still at the transformation stage, and our economy is just  establishing within itself all of the traits of the market. The  question is whether increasing budget expenditure or, as the  case may be, the budget deficit would lead to economic growth or  to higher inflation. In reality, these two factors are combined.  However, one of them always prevails over the other.    [Frydl] Some people are comparing us with the "Asian tigers"  whose economic growth has reached, and in some cases is  reaching, the order of 10 percent.    [Dlouhy] Their conditions are completely different from  ours.  Such an ideal health and social security system, time off, and  so on does not exist in many Asian countries. In other words,  the people there are far less demanding. Our country is  unwilling and indeed cannot tighten its belt so much in order to  attain such growth. Instead, we should follow the paths of  Portugal and Greece, but, of course, with the advantage of a far  better quality work force. Despite this, we are not burdened  with the Western welfare state syndrome; we have great  commercial potential. However, it is necessary to state that our  economic path toward Europe will be a path on a scale of several  decades. The real rapprochement of living standards will take a  long time.    [Frydl] You compare us with the countries of southern  Europe.  They have received considerable assistance by joining the EC,  however, and it is hard to say where their economies would be  today without this membership. Moreover, at the moment, we  cannot rely too much on the whim of the European Union [EU].  What do you think of the opinion that, in view of our membership  being a distant prospect, we should not set such great store by  it?    [Dlouhy] I would not say that we will be relying on the EU's  whim. Many other countries are waiting to join, and the  Community has made it clear to us that we will not become a  member in a year or two. It will be a long process. For example,  Austria, Sweden, and Finland are ahead of us. Due to our  advantages, however, we may be in a better position than, for  instance, Greece and Portugal, although we will not receive  subsidies from the EU's budget. However, I am afraid that we  will not get ahead at the pace of the Asian tigers. We are a  European country with a European environment, traditions, and  habits. I have already demonstrated on several occasions a  certain restraint with regard to the EU. This is associated with  the aforementioned foreign visits, in which I try to visit other  countries and thus expand our economic contacts. On the other  hand, I would not want the Czech Republic to choose, as an  explicit policy, to orient itself other than toward the EU.  European integration is a train from which we cannot jump.    [Frydl] The issue of the Czech economy's specific  orientation  in the world economy is associated with this. Some rapidly  developing countries have found a "market gap" on which to base  their prosperity. This could be a specific branch of industry, a  general technological orientation, unequivocal support for  exports, and so on. It seems that, at the moment, the Czech  Republic does not have such a strategy.    [Dlouhy] Today it is very difficult to find any gap in the  market and hold on to it for any length of time. A gap in the  market arises as a consequence of insufficient information about  supply and demand. In essence, this phenomenon no longer exists.  Trade is globalizing. Today, when a country begins to  manufacture socks from its own raw materials, it is highly  probable that an enterprise in another country (for example, an  Asian one) will soon begin to import these raw materials and  also start to manufacture socks and export them to the original  country at a profit. Moreover, it is mainly certain Asian states  that have chosen the path of "concentrating their efforts"  mentioned by you. Thus, we come back to European conditions.    [Frydl] So far, the trend in Czech exports is satisfactory.  However, opinions are being expressed that this is a temporary  boom arising from the new opportunities for gaining access to  Western markets. Apparently, the potential competition will not  wait long, and the state will have to help our exporters more  than at the moment.    [Dlouhy] The main conceptual support for our exports  was--and, in a number of cases, still is--the koruna's exchange  rate, undervalued against purchasing power parity. When we set  its rate in 1990, we came in for a great deal of criticism.  However, we said clearly that this is, first and foremost, a  proxport measure. The aforementioned foreign visits are another  deliberate policy in support of our exports.    [Frydl] In your opinion, is our proexport policy sufficient  for the present and the future?    [Dlouhy] No. We are again turning to the issue of the growth  we want to achieve. The capacity of the small Czech economy is  greater than its domestic market. Therefore, growth cannot  proceed other than by exports. The advantage of an undervalued  exchange rate will last for some time yet, but it will gradually  be reduced. Apart from this, in a number of cases, our exporters  are unable to compete because they do not have at their disposal  the financial, insurance, and other mechanisms needed to support  exports, the kind of mechanisms their competitors have.    [Frydl] So, the money in the Export Guarantee and Insurance  Company [EGAP] is not enough?    [Dlouhy] It is very little. EGAP should gradually transfer  to  self-financing. It is impossible for the state to keep  subsidizing it from the budget because this would not be fair to  the other taxpayers. Despite this, before its commencement, it  requires a certain amount of funds, but, at the moment, this is  not enough.    [Frydl] The issue of bankruptcies and your opinion that the  state should initiate them has recently attracted a great deal  of attention. The prime minister has come out against this, and  your initiative has not aroused much response in other quarters.  What will happen now?    [Dlouhy] It is true that my stance was rather isolated  within  the debate on bankruptcies. Nevertheless, I really think that  there are few bankruptcies, that they proceed slowly, and that  this is not good for stimulating economic growth. It is easy to  say that this is a mistake and that it is necessary to do  something immediately. The law on bankruptcy and settlement has  to be examined to see if there are hitches in it that prevent  bankruptcies. We can draw a matrix for the banks and put their  privatization funds in the rows and, perhaps, all of this  economy's more important enterprises in the columns. By  declaring an enterprise to be bankrupt, a bank declares its own  property bankrupt. This is a fact that certainly does not  contribute to the commencement of bankruptcies.    [Frydl] Finally, how did you spend Christmas and the New  Year?    [Dlouhy] I was on vacation. I had promised myself that,  sometime in the evening of 23 December, I would say: Good, now I  am satisfied and will put my feet up on the table. This did not  work out exactly because I had the flu. However, I spent New  Year's Eve with my family.</p>

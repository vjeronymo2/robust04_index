			<p>BFN     [Text] Athens, May 2, IRNA -- Two recently released leaders  of the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in Algeria have expressed  hope that those who have usurped power will soon be removed and  an Islamic state established in Algeria. "The people's wish  shall bring back the power to their hands and it shall lead -  God willing - to the isolation and downfall of those whose  desire and hatred prevented an agreement with the people," said  Abdul Qadir Boukhamkhem and Ali Jiddi in an interview with Arab  weekly paper AL- MUSLIMUN. They pointed out that for the first  time after the liberation of Algeria from French colonialism the  country was on the verge of becoming an Islamic state when the  military-backed regime robbed power by force and banned FIS.    "A group inimical to Islam, holding power behind the  curtian,  prevented the Islamic solution and oppressed the will of the  people and opened the country to the French and western cultural  and economic invasion," noted the two FIS leaders. They called  for immediate release of all Islamic prisoners and the lifting  of the ban on FIS.    Last month the head of the regime, Liamine Zeroual, replaced  his prime minister Redha Malek with a technocrat, Mokdad Sifi  seen as an attempt to pursue talks with FIS.    "The downfall of Malek gives some hope... if it was a real  beginning to put an end to those calling for the destruction of  Islam and Arabism," they told the newspaper published from  Jeddah.    "The men of the Islamic Salvation Front do not lack the  preparedness and the ability to contribute, as expected from  them, for a just and legal reform in the country," they  stressed. They revealed that communists and secularists in the  ruling clique had created a "death squad" to carry out attacks  and killings in the country to terrorize the people.</p>

			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Thai Airways appoints 76 underwriters THAI Airways International, the national airline, yesterday appointed 76 underwriters to manage next month's offer of 7 per cent of its shares to the public. The deal, valued at about Dollars 237.5m, includes almost every licensed broker and sub-broker in Thailand. 'We felt it important to have broad participation by the nation's financial community,' said Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, Thai chairman and the head of the air force. He described the offer of 95m shares at Bt60 (Dollars 2.50) each as 'the largest public offering involving the largest number of underwriters in the history of the Stock Exchange of Thailand'. Managing underwriters are Bangkok First Investment and Trust, Dhana Siam Finance and Securities, Nava Finance and Securities and Thai Investment and Securities. In the first such broadly-based offering in Thailand, Thai is offering 40m shares to small investors through five commercial banks - Bangkok Bank, Krung Thai Bank, Siam Commercial Bank, Thai Farmers Bank and Thai Military Bank. Mr Kaset said the offer, to be promoted by a series of 'roadshows' throughout Thailand, would allow the public to participate in a large blue-chip enterprise, mobilise private capital to support Thai's long-term growth, help the company's image and develop Thailand's capital markets. Mr Prachitr Yossundara, chairman of Dhana Siam, said the offer would contribute significantly to share ownership in the country.</p>

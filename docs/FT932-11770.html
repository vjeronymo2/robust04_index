			<p>930501 FT  01 MAY 93 / Howard attacks EC environmental policy MR Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, yesterday attacked EC environmental policy for its lack of an 'even-handed approach' in enforcing 'green' directives. Speaking in Lucerne to the Environment for Europe Conference, he said the European Commission needed to do more 'to ensure proper enforcement.' He said the Commission should move away from its 'complaints-driven procedure' towards a 'more analytical approach to enforcing compliance'. At the moment the Commission's action against countries for breach of directives is prompted by complaints, often by pressure groups. Countries such as Britain with a high level of public environmental awareness and active pressure groups have complained that they are being disproportionately criticised. Mr Chris Smith, UK shadow environment secretary, said the speech was a 'petulant response to the Commission's welcome decision to proceed with action against the British Government over Oxleas Wood'. The UK government wants to build a highway through the ancient wood in southeast London.</p>

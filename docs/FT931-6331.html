			<p>930302 FT  02 MAR 93 / Leading Article: John Birt Inc THE AVERAGE British citizen has long been entitled to take all possible steps, provided they are legal, to minimise his or her tax bill. But the director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation is not an average citizen; and the revelation that Mr John Birt's pay has been finding its way into the family coffers via a tax-efficient private company has understandably raised eyebrows. Yesterday's belated decision to turn him into an employee of the corporation is undoubtedly the right one. But it leaves a disconcerting impression that, just as long as the public remained in the dark, the BBC and its board of governors were happy to live with an arrangement that did not stand up to public scrutiny. It was certainly a curious arrangement for any director-general of the BBC. By calling himself a consultant and paying himself through a company, Mr Birt was able to offset a wide range of expenses against his remuneration, something which no ordinary employee is able to do. This is particularly unsettling to BBC staff at a time when they are being asked to absorb the effects of a programme of radical change initiated by Mr Birt. Unlike most of those who are paid under contracts at the BBC, the director-general enjoys several years of tenure. And unlike most television producers who operate under a corporate banner, he does not derive his income from a wide range of sources. The arrangement was nonetheless agreed by the Inland Revenue and has been sanctioned over many years. There is no way of knowing how widespread such arrangements are in broadcasting or any other business. The fact that a tax avoidance mechanism is legal does not necessarily make it acceptable for individuals in important positions to exploit it. This point has force whether the individual is in the private or public sectors, although those who hold high public offices have a responsibility to accept demanding standards. But more reliable information is needed before it can be judged whether it would be appropriate to take an early opportunity to tackle the specific loophole which permitted Mr Birt's arrangements. There are good arguments for reviewing the whole structure of corporation tax to address this and other concerns, but not only on the basis of tax avoidance by a few television personalities. The main policy matter to arise from the affair is a reminder that the pursuit of a simple tax system which is widely felt to be fair requires constant vigilance and determination. The fall in personal income tax rates under the Thatcher governments did much to undermine many of the more Byzantine tax avoidance methods, but there is still work to be done. For the BBC, the main issue is the question mark raised, once again, over the judgment of the board of governors. But they seem no more likely than others in British public life to accept responsibility for an evident blunder.</p>

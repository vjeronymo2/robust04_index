			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ari"-initialed report: "More Shadow Than Light Despite </F> Progress"]    [Text] The restructuring of the east German economy has  made further progress, yet the increasingly lighter picture  still shows more shadow than light. This was emphasized by the  German Institute for Economic Research (DIW), Berlin, and the  Institute for World Economy (IfW), Kiel, in their 10th report on  adjustment progress in eastern Germany.    The recent report, which was again elaborated with the  cooperation of the Halle Economic Research Institute, focuses on  the manufacturing industry in eastern Germany, for which 5,400  industrial and trade enterprises were questioned in the winter  of 1993/94. The institutes note that in 1993 the situation of  the industry has for the first time improved again. Investments  were having an increasing effect on production. There is hardly  any industry with a decreasing production. The current order  books suggest a sustained growth in production.    Yet, the developments were still lacking in width. Few  industrial enterprises were managing to develop supraregional  markets independently. Mainly as a result of the high wage  costs, the enterprises were exposed to stiff competition,  increasingly also from contenders in Central and East Europe.  The recession in western Germany has made sales in the old  laender more difficult, outstanding debts were increasing, and  the pressure of competition from Western companies, whose offers  do in many cases not even cover the costs, has increased. Yet,  some sales problems were also the result of oversupply in the  new laender (bakeries, butcher's shops, industrial enterprises  related to the construction sector, car repair shops).    Now as then, almost 70 percent of all industrial enterprises  complain about the high pace of wage increases. The institutes  have therefore not been surprised at the results of the survey,  where wages in 35 percent of industrial enterprises and 32  percent of trade enterprises were below the agreed minimum pay.  Altogether, the unit labor costs were still some 40 percent  above the western level, and enterprises were still making  losses because the total amount of money paid to wage or salary  earners was higher than the national income. Considering the  expected wage increase of almost 10 percent in 1994 -- after  almost 15 percent in 1993, the situation will hardly change for  the time being. Thus, the pressure on enterprises to streamline  their firms remains high, and no easing of the tense labor  market can be expected.    In this situation it is not easy for enterprises to mobilize  capital for investments, particularly since, in many cases, they  still had to pay back old debts and are often unable to offer  any security. In the case of newly founded enterprises and  small businesses this was considerably slowing down expansion.    At the same time, the institutes expressed their  understanding for the careful position of the banks.  Possibilities for improvements are obviously seen regarding  public investment subsidies, which are not sufficiently tailored  to the needs of enterprises and can often be obtained only with  great difficulty or arrive too late.    Investments in the manufacturing industry in eastern Germany  were up more than 10 percent in 1993, while for 1993 the growth  rate is expected to slow down slightly. In 1993, investment per  employee in industrial enterprises was DM28,700, or almost  DM4,000 more than in 1992. In the sphere of trade it was  DM18,100, after DM20,500 in the previous year. Investment per  employee was lowest in Trust Agency enterprises (DM16,500),  while it was highest in companies belonging to west German or  foreign enterprises (DM47,000). One in 10 enterprises were not  planning any investment at all in 1994, while just under  one-third of industrial enterprises and two-fifths of trade  enterprises had not yet made a final decision.    As far as jobs are concerned, the number is expected to  increase by some 6 percent in the sphere of trade. Yet, this is  not sufficient to offset the planned job cuts in the industry of  5 percent. On the other hand, it was mainly trade enterprises  that complained most about the shortage of skilled labor.    The report takes a critical view of the issue of industrial  cores. The institutes complain that the definition was not  clear. In their view, the old industrial centers in eastern  Germany should not be considered as cores but as shells. Their  revitalization could be successful only where a new, fertile  seed was implanted. DIW and IfW are worried that the means badly  needed to develop productive areas might be directed toward  unproductive areas. They conclude their report by warning that  without belittling the success of putting enterprises on a sound  footing again, high subsidies cannot be a guarantor of success.</p>

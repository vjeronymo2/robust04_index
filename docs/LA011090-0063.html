			<p><P> January 10, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOORE TELLS OF RETURNING STING PAYMENT;  </P> <P> CORRUPTION TRIAL: SHE APPEARS AS THE FIRST DEFENSE WITNESS IN MONTOYA CASE. BUT  HER TESTIMONY SEEMS TO DO MORE TO BOLSTER THE PROSECUTION'S SIDE.  </P> <P> Assemblywoman Gwen Moore, in her first public statement about payments she  received from federal undercover agents, said Tuesday she returned one $5,000  campaign contribution in 1986 because it appeared to be a bribe.  </P> <P> But the Los Angeles Democrat said she kept a $2,000 donation two years later  from undercover operatives posing as businessmen because they attended one of  her fund-raising events. "They bought tickets, they came to my fund-raiser,  they ate my food and so I kept the money," she told reporters.  </P> <P> Moore's comments came after she testified as the first defense witness in the  federal trial of state Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who faces 12 counts  of extortion, racketeering, bribery and money laundering stemming from the  federal undercover investigation of political corruption in the state Capitol.  </P> <P> Moore, who unwittingly carried two bills for dummy companies set up by the FBI,  is one of at least five state elected officials who remain under investigation  in the probe.  </P> <P> Outside the courtroom, Moore told reporters that she now believes she was  tape-recorded in 1986 by an undercover agent using the name Jack Gordon. Gordon  -- in reality FBI Agent Jack Brennan -- was posing as an Alabama businessman  who was seeking special legislative help in opening a shrimp processing plant  near Sacramento.  </P> <P> At one point, Moore said, Gordon approached her and asked if the payment she  had received was "enough."  </P> <P> "It sounded like he thought he was giving me a bribe," she said. "I didn't like  his attitude."  </P> <P> Moore said she was unaware at that time that Gordon's "company," Gulf Shrimp  Fisheries, had given her campaign a $5,000 contribution. She recalled that she  told him, "I'm sure whatever you gave was enough."  </P> <P> Upon learning later that the "company" had made the large donation, she said  she promptly returned the money.  </P> <P> However, her 1986 experience with Gordon did not stop her from carrying a  similar bill to help the shrimp company in 1988 when a new cast of undercover  informants approached her office. This time around, Moore kept the $2,000  contribution made by a second dummy FBI company when agents purchased four $500  tickets to a fund-raiser.  </P> <P> "I've done nothing wrong," Moore told reporters. "I've tried to cooperate with  every legitimate investigation. I have nothing to hide."  </P> <P> Until Tuesday, Moore had not spoken with federal investigators or with  Montoya's lawyers. U.S. Atty. David F. Levi made a point of noting before her  testimony that she is under active investigation.  </P> <P> The assemblywoman was called to the stand by Montoya's attorneys to explain her  role as legislative author of the two bills that were planted as part of the  federal sting operation. The defense also called to the stand Senate Republican  Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno, who managed one of the bills on the Senate floor in  1988.  </P> <P> But the testimony of both legislators appeared to do more to bolster the  prosecution than to aid the defense. Both Moore and Maddy said they did not  take part in the kind of activities Montoya is accused of engaging in --  including receiving a $3,000 honorarium at a breakfast meeting shortly before  one of the bills was scheduled for a vote.  </P> <P> Under cross-examination by Levi, Moore and Maddy said they never solicited  campaign contributions or other payments from the undercover agents.  </P> <P> "You did not ask for anything?" Levi asked Maddy.  </P> <P> "That's correct," the senator replied.  </P> <P> "And you would not?" the prosecutor said.  </P> <P> "That's correct," Maddy said.  </P> <P> To some degree, Montoya's attorneys were handicapped by a ruling from U.S.  District Judge Milton Schwartz, who prohibited the defense from asking the  legislators why they pushed the measure. Schwartz ruled that the motives of the  legislators in backing the bills was irrelevant in establishing the reasons for  Montoya's actions.  </P> <P> In his testimony, Maddy said he does not know at this point how he became the  Senate floor manager for the bill in 1988 except that it was arranged by  someone on his staff.  </P> <P> The Senate GOP leader said it was a surprise to him when the bill came up for  action and he was called on by the presiding officer of the Senate to present  the bill. He looked on his desk, he said, and found a prepared statement on the  bill for him to read.  </P> <P> There was no debate on the measure and it quickly passed, the entire matter  taking only a minute, he said. He later chastised members of his staff for  agreeing that he would handle the bill, he said.  </P> <P> In her testimony, Moore said she agreed to author both versions of the bill  because the measure would have helped the "company" provide 35 to 40 new jobs,  most of them for minority and low-income people.  </P> <P> The bill was actually written by FBI agents and the U.S. attorney's office,  according to George Murray, an undercover FBI agent who testified earlier in  the trial.  </P> <P> In calling Moore to the stand, defense attorney Michael Sands had hoped to  demonstrate that Montoya also supported the measure because of the prospects  for increased minority employment.  </P> <P> However, Moore testified that she did not recall whether Montoya was in  attendance at a Senate committee meeting when she presented her arguments on  behalf of the bill. And, she said, she never had a private conversation with  Montoya about the bill. Similarly, Maddy told the jury that he never discussed  the bill with Montoya.  </P></p>

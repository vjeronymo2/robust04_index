Below is  his exclusive interview.    IF: What, do you think, is the main result of 1993?    Shushkevich: I believe it was the materialization of the  idea to create the Commonwealth of Independent States, the idea  which rules out the difficult option of secession. An example  of this is Azerbaijan and Georgia joining the CIS. Now all  republics except the Baltics are members of the Commonwealth.    Constantly improving approaches in relationships within the  CIS, we, I hope, as early as 1994, will be able to solve painful  economic problems which cause enormous difficulties, say, for  Belarus. I hope member-states will reach mutual understanding  in this respect and policy-makers will put the emphasis on  strategy, not on minor tactical comforts or elevating certain  political groups in different countries.    I believe that some aspects of economic relations run  counter  to the ideas and goals of the Commonwealth. Those aspects seem  to have been originated by political tensions in some CIS  countries. However, the situation is back to normal in most  member-states, which brings hope that things will develop for  the better.    IF: You mean the relationships between the CIS countries and  Russia, don't you? You granted an interview to INTERFAX in  which you proposed creating within the CIS a bloc of republics  which would work out a common policy towards Russia.    Shushkevich: I am sure we must demonstrate to Russia, the  country which has more weight economically and demographically  than all the rest member-states together, that we have common  difficultiess which we would not like to identify with Russian  policies. The course pursued by certain Russian politicians is  not necessarily that expected of true statesmen and thus fatal,  I believe. Sometimes they make statements towards this or that  CIS member which could be described as insulting to all the rest  member-countries.    Once we have decided to build a community and want that all  its member-countries respect the Russian speakers just as  Russians are respected here in Belarus, let's act adequately!  Because the protest against the outbursts of some Russian  politicians may grow over into an anti-Russian policy. However,  I emphasize, none of the CIS republics pursues an anti-Russian  policy.    The principles of economic relations, first of all, in terms  of Russian energy supplies, are the most important unresolved  issue within the CIS framework. OPEC is a kind of community of  oil-producing states. Inside the CIS, Russia plays the role of  such a community because the republics are virtually unable to  buy oil anywhere else. But do the OPEC countries determine  different oil prices for its partners, say, France, Germany or  Britain? No, they do not. Prices are the same for its own  "customers". If there are any differences in prices, they are  due to the unsatisfactory political conduct of individual  countries.    In view of this I would like to emphasize: I flatly reject  any concoctions about my alleged restraint or dislike of Russia.  The idea was invented by narrow-minded politicians.  Fortunately, these are not leading political figures in Russia.  Take all my statements and interviews. You will find in them  not a single negative hint towards the country. Those who  accuse me of anti-Russian sentiments are guided by petty  instincts, not by commonsense.    IF: What do you expect from the new year of 1994?    Shushkevich: The coming year must return to us the feeling  of self-dignity. If the Supreme Soviet adopted by a majority of  votes a statement, according to which instead of an all-Belarus  referendum on trust in parliament and government early elections  were promised to be held in March 1994, the pledge must be kept  and a solution to this question must be found. But so far we  have been in a deadlock, which, instead of being exploited by  our best forces is regrettably being taken advantage of by other  elements.    If something is overlooked by the constitution and  legislation, people resort to action, but God forbid it comes to  violence. So, the main thing for me in the new year is to hold  new democratic elections.    IF: A presidential election, too?    Shushkevich: I am not against holding it even before  parliamentary elections but only on a legitimate basis. For  this reason, parliament should adopt a new election law and  schedule new elections as soon as possible.    IF: As is known, signatures are being raised among  lawmakers in support of a vote of confidence in the Supreme  Soviet's Chairman at the next session of parliament? Are you  not afraid of losing the post?    Shushkevich: I have never been afraid of that. Experienced  in political struggle and invigorated by recent hospital  treatment, I'm fully determined to counter any sinister scheme  like that.    IF: Some legislators predict that the issue on your  resignation will be raised during parliamentary debates on the  ratification of the CIS Charter, one of the major sections of  which commits CIS participant-states to collective security ...    Shushkevich: Not long ago, Prime Minister Vyacheslav  Kebich quite tactfully declared in the press that CIS countries  did not regard Belarus as a member of the Commonwealth security  system. Most signatories disagree with that republic's "special  status," conditioned by a number of reservations on which  Belarus would accept collective security (for one thing,  reservations rule out Belarusian troops' involvement in fighting  outside the republic - IF). I've kept on repeating that the  collective-security system participants will never admit Belarus  on special terms. So, what could happen? If in line with the  reservations, endorsed by our parliament, there were an area of  trouble in a neighboring country, Belarus would not send a  peace-keeping force there. However, if we faced troubles, all  CIS countries would, for some reason, be obliged to help us.  But that's not collective security but an attempt to profit by  the collective security system being formed nearby.    All the hullabaloo on whether I've signed the collective  security accord or not has been contrived by "a narrow circle of  persons," alleging that I am against collective security at all.  Nonsense. I am only against obscurantism in collective in  security. I am positively against collective security attempts  at others expanse.    I am convinced that a state can be secured by totally new  approaches to be based on the principle of neutrality,  proclaimed by the Belarusian Parliament as harmless for anyone's  interests.    If we want to be part of the CIS collective security system,  and that is only for the Supreme Soviet to decide, we should  realize that our sons, in such a case, would be up for draft at  any volatile spot across the Commonwealth from the Kuril islands  to Brest, from Franz Joseph Land to Kushka.    But since Belarus has not been involved in a single conflict  in CIS, I do not realize why Belarusian men have to be involved.  That's illogical. For this reason, I have always been an  advocate of neutrality for Belarus. To fulfil the parliament's  will, I signed a collective security treaty with the  reservations determined by the national legislature.    (Stanislav Shushkevich signed the original of the CIS  Collective Security Treaty on December 31, 1993, "to avoid  dubious interpretation" of the form of signing the accord - IF).    IF: Does this mean that Belarus will stay away from peace  actions of the UN and other international organizations? Do you  plan to respond to the UN Secretary General Butrus-Ghali's  request to dispatch a battalion of Belarusian troops to back up  the international force deployed there to settle the Balkan  conflict?    Shushkevich: I've had a discussion on that with Lord Owen  and other representatives of Butrus-Ghali. Although the Supreme  Soviet realized how essential it was for Belarus to take part in  international actions on settling armed conflicts, it felt  scared even to debate the issue because of "an acute Afghan  syndrome" in the republic. Belarus suffered heavy casualties  during the USSR crusade in Afghanistan.    There is yet another reason: The never-ending painful  memories of the second world war, which claimed the life of  every fourth citizen of the republic. No other CIS country lost  so many lives during the war. I told Lord Owen: Give us a  respite.</p>

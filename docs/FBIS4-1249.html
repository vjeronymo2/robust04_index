			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the Foreign Ministry in Asmara on 23 </F> April]    [Excerpts] It is obvious that the relations between the  people of Eritrea and Sudan are historical and long standing.  On the basis of this view, and believing that the government of  the national salvation revolution of Sudan would place its  national interest and the peace and stability of the region  above all else, our relations with Sudan were very special  before the independence of Eritrea. To further strengthen and  develop these relations, we have been working jointly with the  Sudanese Government.    However, the National islamic Front of Sudan, from its  political bases in Sudan, wished to control a force in Eritrea  and formed a group called the Islamic Jihad of Eritrea in 1989.  It continued to support this group until and after the  independence of Eritrea.    As the Government of Eritrea, we have placed those  considerations regarding relations between the two nations above  everything else and we hope that we will overcome the obstacles  through communication and dialogue. We have made every effort  to further strengthen and develop cooperation between the two  peoples. It is true that we have noticed the positive role  played by the Sudanese Government in controlling and containing  the movements of this Eritrean group [Islamic Jihad], but since  the middle of 1993 up to now this group has been carrying out  its destructive activities, coming all the way from Sudan to  collaborate with other groups from other regions.    This new development compelled us to tell our people and the  international community everything about this. So the main  reason for the deterioration in relations was that the  destructive activities which had been directed against Eritrea  had been emanating from Sudan. [passage omitted] The practical  implementation of the agreement reached will guarantee positive  developments in relations between the two countries.</p>

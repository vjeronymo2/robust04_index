			<p>BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 6 Apr (EFE) -- Today, the  Colombian Prosecutor General's Office rejected charges made by  the U.S. State Department that the Cali Cartel has infiltrated  the Colombian Government.    On 4 April, the State Department published its annual report  on its global strategy to fight drugs. With regard to Colombia,  the report states among other things that the mafia "still  manipulates the judicial system through intimidation and  bribery."    Deputy Prosecutor General Francisco Jose Sintura denied this  allegation, saying that arrests, sentences, confiscations, and  seizures prove the opposite is true. "Such generalities are  unacceptable," Sintura stressed in a news release.    Noting the achievements made by the Prosecutor General's  Office, Sintura said it is not clear to whom the report refers  as a "fourth-level member of the (Colombian) Prosecutor  General's Office who is under investigation for his alleged  links to the Cali Cartel."    The news release says that in 1993, "Colombia extradited an  alleged Argentine drug trafficker to the United States, and in  1994 extradited four citizens of other nationalities. In  addition, seven others whose extradition was requested by the  United States were arrested, and those cases are currently  moving through the legal process."    Sintura adds that as a result of the fight against drug  trafficking, 40 people linked to this crime surrendered, 30 were  arrested, and 23 were killed in clashes with the authorities.  The news release stresses that all of these people were  "members of drug trafficking organizations, and not common  criminals." Sintura's report adds that "17 top leaders of these  organizations have received sentences of 10-24 years in jail."</p>

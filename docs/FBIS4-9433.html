			<p>BFN     [Text] Bucharest, ROMPRES, 23/4/1994 -- The Friday evening  [22 April] debate on peace prospects in the Balkans gave the  speaker of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, Adrian Nastase the  opportunity to say: "I think that the theme we are discussing  today at the forum is now topical not only for Bucharest, but  for all capitals of the world.    Listing the factors that keep the Balkans under pressure he  named the troubled historical past of the region, the large  number of minorities coexisting for centuries in its area, the  communist totalitarian regimes that concealed the smoldering  tensions without solving their causes, as well as factors  extraneous to the region, such as power interests. What should  be avoided in this particularly complex social and political  background is the domino effect, he suggested. "We must not  allow the Yugoslav conflict to spread to other places, so as  equally dangerous would be the involvement of the great powers  in this conflict." "The Yugoslav crisis has already put  international and world organizations to a severe test, (United  Nations, CSCE, NATO and West European Union). They have some  merit in keeping the conflict under control, but have also  displayed serious limitations of their capacity to settle the  conflict."    Speaking of the risk factors in the Balkans, yet without  ignoring those that prompt the optimistic approach, the speaker  of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies commended the political and  diplomatic efforts of the United States and Russia, which have  led to many important results.    Adrian Nastase also referred to Romania as a  Central-European  country, as a state that could become an important center of  stability in the Balkans. "We have a considerable economic and  military potential if compared to other states in this region,  and what is more important, we cherish the strong desire of  contributing to the diplomatic settlement of the conflict."    In Mr. Nastase's view, the steps to be taken towards  normality should be the fortification of democracy and market  economies in all Balkan states, the development of concrete  joint cooperation projects regarding their common future, a  close cooperation between the Black Sea riparian countries, a  similar scheme among Danubian countries provided the embargo  against Yugoslavia is ended, the association to regional or  sub-regional cooperation structures of the newly emerged  entities in the ex-Yugoslav space, and, of no less importance,  the initiation of an international conference for a scrutiny of  all these issues with the purpose of coming up with ideas for  new projects on peace prospects in the Balkans.</p>

Haider  claims to be the "secret chancellor" already at this point  because your government is only carrying out what he has always  demanded.    [Vranitzky] I am amused by his glib remarks. Is he the  secret chancellor? I do not know and I do not care what Haider  does secretly. Yet those who are secretly great people usually  collect tin soldiers or sail boats in the bath tub. The truth is  that Haider is a traditional politician. He has been telling  the same old story for many years. He has simply not broken  with the right- wing fringe. He has not even been able to give  up certain National Socialist elements, like the "employment  policy of the Third Reich." There are people who say that this  is his problem. I claim that this is not his problem but his  program!    [Wachter] Haider has accused the government of adopting  political measures on the immigration issue that he has been  proposing for a long time.    [Vranitzky] By deluding us about his goals, he has  repeatedly adopted anti-immigrant positions. If he says that we  must slowly send the guest workers home to create more work for  Austrians, his proposal is either not well thought out, or he is  not familiar with the employment situation. Let me give you an  example: If a factory exports its goods mainly to eastern  Europe, and if the systems are collapsing in Russian and Ukraine  so that we can no longer sell anything there, he will still not  sell anything even if he sends 20,000 workers home.    [Wachter] Haider has stated scornfully that he wants to take  over your job in 1998, hinting that you are no longer very  active. He described himself as the chancellor for the next  millennium.    [Vranitzky] Well, this is the third element of his story.  He is constantly talking about becoming chancellor -- always  with a certain delay, as in a poorly dubbed film. He first  wanted to become chancellor in 1990 when he nominated the  unfortunate Norbert Gugerbauer as head of the FPOe. Now he  wants to become chancellor again -- but not before 1998. Thus,  he was defeated twice on the issue of chancellor.    [Wachter] You pushed Haider out to the margin of politics in  1986.    [Vranitzky] I did not do that. I merely distanced myself  from him.    [Wachter] Okay, you distanced yourself. What went wrong as  far as the political strategy is concerned, if Joerg Haider,  from whom you distanced yourself, is now your strongest rival  and challenger?    [Vranitzky] Nothing went wrong. Quite the contrary. Day in  and day out, he proves that the distancing was necessary and  that I made the right decision in 1986.    [Wachter] Haider wants to focus on the immigration issue in  the election year.    [Vranitzky] After the letter bomb attacks, all five party  chairmen agreed to observe a 12-point list concerning language  and political culture. The goal was to prevent extreme forms of  political debate. Haider was one of the first to break the  rules. Thus, one can hardly expect him to observe a high  standard of politics. Yet only naive people will be surprised  about that.    [Wachter] The election campaign will probably be dominated  by "social liberality" versus "the cult of personality and a  society where one succeeds by elbow-jostling."    [Vranitzky] Yes, exactly. We will stress our efforts to  safeguard Austria's attractiveness as a business location,  particularly our endeavors to ensure full employment.    [Wachter] At 300,000 unemployed?    [Vranitzky] Well, particularly at a time when unemployment  is rising, we must strongly reject elbow-jostling. Social  scientists discovered a long time ago that there are people in  society who are losers or who consider themselves to be losers.  Haider's strategy is to address these people. We will tell  them clearly: We understand that you are susceptible to  arguments from this corner. Yet do you understand that you will  not be offered a solution from there, that your incomes will not  be increased, that there will be no social improvement, and that  jobs will not become safer.    [Wachter] Let us talk about the elections. Will we go to  the polls in June?    [Vranitzky] No, there are no such plans whatsoever.    [Wachter] The Austrian People's Party [OeVP] has hinted that  it wants to leave the government and go into opposition if its  gap with the Socialist Party of Austria should increase (10  percent difference in 1990). What would this mean for you?    [Vranitzky] Nothing for the time being. The OeVP will  continue to be our coalition partner until the elections. Then  talks will be held. By the way, the OeVP has never officially  announced that it plans to go into opposition. There are only  voices within the party who advocate such a step. The OeVP will  have to think about that and make a decision.    [Wachter] At what "red" intensive care unit will the "black"  patient be treated after the elections to keep it alive?    [Vranitzky] One cannot wage an election campaign for two  parties at the same time.    [Wachter] Are you worried about the position of the OeVP?    [Vranitzky] I do not want to give advice or recommend  anything to a coalition partner through the media. As the  federal government and as parties, we must do two things: We  must prove that we are able to do our job and we must be  acceptable to the voters.    [Wachter] If the OeVP should no longer be wiling to form a  coalition with you, you can only cooperate with the Liberal  Forum or the Greens, or with both. There have been reports that  you would consider such a constellation too unstable, that you  would not be willing to lead such a coalition, and that you  would withdraw from politics.    [Vranitzky] Negotiations on the future government will be  held after the elections. I will not comment on this issue now.</p>

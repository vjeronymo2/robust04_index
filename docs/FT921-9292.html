			<p>920213 FT  13 FEB 92 / Ex-German enclave in appeal over free zone THE FORMER German enclave of Kaliningrad has urged both the Russian government and foreign investors to support its free economic zone, saying this was the territory's only means of survival. Local government and business representatives from the area, once known as Konigsberg, sandwiched between the Baltic Sea and Lithuania, said the Russian government was due soon to approve concrete proposals for special benefits, including lower taxes than in the rest of Russia and an easing of restrictions on foreign capital. A joint stock company called the Regional Investment-Financial Company, set up by Russian investors with initial capital of Rbs1bn, is spearheading attempts to stimulate investment in the area. Despite a lack of investment in infrastructure by Moscow and caution among would-be foreign investors from Germany and other countries, Mr Yuri Matochkin, head of the local administration, said he expected the free economic zone to be up and running within the next year or two. Kaliningrad has a warm water port, a relatively developed transport system, defence plants in need of conversion to civilian uses, and the potential for tourism.</p>

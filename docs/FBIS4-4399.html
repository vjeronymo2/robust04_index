			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Kohei Murayama] </F>   [Text] Tokyo, March 31 KYODO -- Candidates with high  English-speaking ability may have the edge when the new central  bank governor is appointed in December, bank sources said.    Bank of Japan [BOJ] Governor Yasushi Mieno himself hinted  that such language skill is one key element to fulfilling his  post during Japan's growing role in the global financial scene,  according to sources close to Mieno. Mieno's four-year term  comes to a close on December 16.    A former senior Finance Ministry official said, "Mieno once  told me that interpreters are available during official regular  meetings of the BIS (the Bank for International Settlements) but  not at such unofficial occasions as luncheons." The  international organization based in Basel, Switzerland, acts as  a bank for central banks of major industrialized nations.    "Without confidence in English ability, Mieno said that one  becomes very tired after desperately listening and being  concerned about missing important points," said the official who  requested anonymity.    Meetings among the finance ministers and central bankers  from  the Group of Seven (G-7) major nations and financial leaders for  the Washington-based International Monetary Fund and the World  Bank are numerous. "Mieno attends meetings without interpreters  case by case because he has a sufficient command of English," a  BOJ source said. Mieno once served as the central bank director  stationed in New York.    Indeed, many instances have proven that English conversation  skill provides advantages to Japan in global monetary affairs.  An international financial source said unofficial talks --  rather, chatting -- are important now that policy coordination  has become the centerpiece at international gatherings,  especially in sounding out one another's true intentions.    He also cited frequent round-the-clock contacts through  telephone hot lines amid increasing cross-border dealings in  currency and other markets.    For the past five terms, former vice finance ministers and  career BOJ officials have taken turns filling the post of BOJ  governor. As to the candidates most likely to succeed Mieno,  recent Japanese press reports have narrowed down the list of  four former vice finance ministers to two -- Yasuo Matsushita  and Yoshihiko Yoshino.    Informed sources said Matsushita, chairman of Sakura Bank,  is  tipped as the top candidate because Yoshino, president of the  Japan Development Bank, maintains his stance on rejecting strong  recommendations from some senior BOJ and Finance Ministry  officials.    Matsushita, 68, served as vice finance minister -- the  ministry's highest post for career bureaucrats -- for two years  from June 1982. Yoshino, 63, assumed the post from 1986 to 1988.    In terms of a command in English, Matsushita is known for  his  superb ability among the four candidates.</p>

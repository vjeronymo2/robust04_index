			<p>940714 FT  14 JUL 94 / London Stock Exchange: Portfolio worries hit Glaxo Shares in Glaxo the leading UK pharmaceuticals group, were dragged lower in afternoon trading in London when US investors sold heavily on worries over suspected losses on the company's Pounds 2.2bn investment portfolio. The company is believed to have lost at least Pounds 100m. Later, it emerged that Glaxo had disbanded its in-house investment arm, which is based in Bermuda, and had already started to liquidate an unspecified portion of its investments prior to appointing a new fund manager. The company refused to say how much of its Pounds 1.7bn internal portfolio it was selling. But a spokesman commented; 'we are selling some of the investment as a pre-requisite to handing over because new fund managers tend to prefer cash.' The company added that, following an internal investigation, it had decided to hive off its investment arm because, 'Glaxo's business is pharmaceuticals and not financial investment.' It refused to name the choice of fund manager. Early indications were that the portfolio might be spread among several institutions. The shares were 11 higher at their peak but US selling outweighed continued institutional buying in the UK and took the price back to 1 1/2 up at 551p on turnover of 6.9m.</p>

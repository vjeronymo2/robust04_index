			<p>910426 FT  26 APR 91 / International Company News: UAL and Delta Air turn in heavy losses UNITED Airlines and Delta Air Lines, two of the biggest US carriers, yesterday posted heavy losses for the first three months of 1991, underlining the impact which the Gulf war and domestic recession has had on the industry. However, Chicago-based United Airlines was more cheerful about the outlook. 'We are encouraged by the recovery we currently see,' said Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman, 'particularly in our Pacific markets where we expect May traffic to approximate May 1990 level and June traffic to surpass last year's levels.' But Mr Thomas Roeck, Delta's finance director, stressed that operating expenses continued to be 'up significantly'. This, he said, reflected the growth in traffic and capacity in the current quarter, aircraft fleet and facilities expansions, and 'favourable expenses trends in the prior year'. Delta said that although the airline had been 'encouraged' by an 8 per cent growth in traffic in the first quarter, much of this had stemmed from the wave of fare-discounting in the first two months. United lost Dollars 157m after tax in the three-month period, on virtually static operating revenues of Dollars 2.22bn compared with Dollars 2.19bn in the same period a year earlier, when the carrier reported a Dollars 36.4m net loss. However, its operating deficit was significantly larger, at Dollars 269m against a loss of Dollars 47.2m last time. The net figure was then reduced due to a number of items, including a surplus on property asset disposals and a large tax credit. During the quarter, revenue passenger miles fell by 2 per cent, while capacity - measured by available seat miles - increased by almost 8 per cent. The passenger load factor fell from 64.9 per cent in the first quarter of 1990, to 58.9 per cent. Delta, which ranks number three in the US industry after American Airlines and United, saw a smaller net loss of Dollars 84.1m, compared with a profit of Dollars 31.3m in the same period a year earlier. Operating revenues were up from Dollars 2.12bn to Dollars 2.3bn, but the carrier recorded an operating loss of Dollars 115.1m compared with a profit of Dollars 48.1m last year. Delta's load factor fell to 58.46 per cent, compared with 60.97 per cent a year ago. The losses reported by United and Delta follow some equally grim figures from American Airlines last week. Overall, the US industry is reckoned to have lost some Dollars 4bn during the last four months of 1990 and the first three months of the current year. With the Gulf turbulence now past and signs that the economy may be recovering, UAL shares gained  5/8 to Dollars 160 by midday yesterday before closing down  1/8 at Dollars 159 1/4 . Delta closed Dollars 1 1/8 higher at Dollars 71 7/8 after touching Dollars 72 3/8 .</p>

He added that "specific decisions will be made in  accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine" in the near future.    Mikhalchenko pointed out that the Ukrainian Constitution  never envisioned presidential elections in the Crimea. He also  said Ukrainian Speaker Ivan Plyushch had warned the Crimean  parliament of the impossibility of holding such elections before.    The Ukrainian president's press office is expected to come  out with a statement on the issue in a day or two.    As a result of the first round of the presidential elections  in the Crimea on January 16, the leader of the Republican Party  of the Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov, led the race with 38.8 percent of  the electorate. He is widely known as a supporter of the  Crimea's unification with Russia.    Ukrainian patriotic forces will never recognize the legality  of the presidential elections in the Crimea, according to the  statement the leader of the Civic Congress of the Crimea, Sergey  Litvinov, made in an interview with INTERFAX-Ukraine.    At the same time, he admitted that the Crimean elections  were  a fiasco of nationalist movements whose popularity on the  peninsula is very low.    In his opinion, this is a result of the Ukrainian  leadership's imprudent policy which left Crimean Ukrainians with  no support.    A deputy of the Ukrainian parliament and one of the leaders  of the nationalist movement "Rukh," Les Tanyuk, commented on  the election returns by saying that their main result was the  failure of Kravchuk's team.    "People voted not against Nikolay Bahrov (Speaker of the  Ukrainian parliament -- INTERFAX) as a politician, but rather  against Bahrov as Kravchuk's representative," he told  INTERFAX-Ukraine.    He put all the blame for this on the Ukrainian president who  failed to promptly stand up against the illegal elections as a  guarantor of the Constitution.    Tanyuk said Yuriy Meshkov promised easy ways out of simple  situations and in this sense he was one of Zhirinovskiy's men to  a great extent.    The repercussions of the elections may be very dangerous and  disastrous both for Ukraine and Russia, as well as for the whole  of Europe, Tanyuk said.</p>

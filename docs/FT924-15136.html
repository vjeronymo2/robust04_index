			<p>921006 FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cotton output dips but surplus likely WORLD cotton production is expected to dip during 1992-93, but world storehouses are bulging with the largest surplus in years and global production is likely to exceed consumption for the third consecutive year. The outlook, according to the International Cotton Advisory Committee in Washington, is for continued high stocks, a 3.6 per cent rise in global consumption, but lower prices in 1993. Almost three-quarters of the world's cotton is now produced in five countries: China, the US, India, Pakistan and Uzbekistan. This year, US producers planted 600,000 hectares less than last year in response to government set-asides and because heavy rains in Texas prevented or destroyed plantings. However, in 1993, the committee expects a production rebound in the US from 3.48m tonnes to 3.74m tonnes. Output is expected to fall slightly in China and India while rising slightly in Pakistan and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Although the US agriculture department maintains an optimistic forecast for American cotton ex-ports, producers and analysts are concerned about new competitors encroaching on markets where US exporters have made gains in recent years - particularly in East Asia. In Europe, the US is losing ground to exports from central Asian republics, now freed of the necessity to send their goods to Russia and Ukraine and hungry for the hard currency which the west can provide. The largest decline in consumption in western Europe was in Germany. French mill use fell an estimated 13,000 tonnes to 100,000 in 1991-92, the fifth consecutive year of decline. Some analysts say that current fashion trends favour the use of chemical fibres, but increased competition from coarse count cotton yarn imports may be encouraging a shift in the structure of French mill use. US demand for cotton and cotton products is expected to continue to grow next year, making it the seventh season out of eight for expanded use. 'The US cotton textile industry demonstrated great strength during a season in which the US economy was in recession,' the committee said in its most recent report.</p>

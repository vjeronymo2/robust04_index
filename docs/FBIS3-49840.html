			<p>Language: <F P=105> Romanian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] Yesterday evening, on a program for television,  Adrian Nastase, executive chairman of Social Democracy Party of  Romania [PDSR], made a number of remarks about the current  political negotiations [between President Ion Iliescu and  leaders of parties that are represented in parliament] and a  possible government reshuffle.    The offer made by the Democratic Convention of Romania  [CDR],  which wishes to strike an alliance with the Democratic  Party-National Salvation Front [PD-FSN] and PDSR in view of  setting up a government, was assessed by Nastase as valuable in  principle, but problem-generating at the practical level, which  also refers to the idea of modifying the existing balance [of  forces in parliament], namely 47 percent belonging to the  opposition [CDR together with CD-FSN], as compared with 34  percent belonging to the PDSR, as such a thing would turn the  current ruling party into a minority one.    Furthermore, Nastase noted that the aforementioned offer  also  tries to make PDSR sever all relations with the parties that  have been its allies until now, and thus the offer might also  influence the electorate of the ruling party.    Under such circumstances, in Nastase's opinion, for the time  being no such coalition cabinet can be set up, and, considering  that there can be no interruptions in the government of the  country, as well as the offer of PUNR to participate in the act  of governing, they [PDSR] have engaged in negotiations with that  party. Those negotiations are to be concluded within a few  days, and they will offer a realistic short-term alternative.  Meanwhile, talks will be continued with the CDR as well.    In the PDSR's opinion, the principal goal is to achieve a  political pact that should refer to a minimum number of  essential issues for the country, regardless of the political  color of the government, such as economic issues, association  with European and Euro-Atlantic bodies, the memorandum to be  signed with the International Monetary Fund, the privatization  and economic restructuring processes, as well as a number of  social aspects, including the dialogue with the trade unions.

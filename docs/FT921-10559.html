			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity The row over electricity prices for large users has resurfaced at an awkward time for the government, and more so for Mr John Baker, the chief executive of National Power. Presumably, Mr Baker already regrets his recent attempt to deflect criticism of the two generators, in which he urged large users to look past higher prices and examine instead the subsidy they pay to Nuclear Electric. He thereby handed them a surprisingly powerful weapon. Their threat to withhold the nuclear levy, which adds 11 per cent to their bills, is a neat way to extend an argument which appeared lost. It may be that the government will turn a blind eye and hope the problem fades as the next round of electricity contracts is signed. But there is no suggestion that the generators intend to reduce prices. The prospect that small consumers would eventually pick up the tab is uncomfortably close to the hidden subsidy to industry that privatisation was designed to end. Meanwhile, Nuclear Electric has been reminded that by any normal measure it is hopelessly uncompetitive. The question is whether there is anything more than political horse-trading to be done. The answer is almost certainly not. After all, the roots of the problem lie in the industry structure chosen by the government, which will scarcely be altered now. The generating duopoly has been putting up electricity prices much as forecast before privatisation. What was not foreseen was that large industrial customers would be in deep recession. But their attempt to appeal to the government is an implicit admission that head-on confrontation with the generators is fruitless. That explains why the generators' shares have so far been unaffected. Cautious investors are doubtless not counting on the argument disappearing altogether.</p>

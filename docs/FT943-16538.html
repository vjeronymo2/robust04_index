			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / The Lex Column: Mutual disadvantage The government's proposed changes to the Building Societies Act due to be unveiled this week seem set to give societies more flexibility to raise wholesale funds in the money market. It is less likely - especially while the Lloyds bid for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester remains subject to possible appeal - to propose much by way of reform of the industry's traditional mutual structure. That is a pity because deregulation of funding will only accentuate the anomaly of present arrangements. Supporters of mutuality argue that it offers choice and works effectively. Yet it also creates many problems. Why should a small depositor gain immediate title to a share in reserves built up over many years? Since such title exists, why should members have difficulty realising its value? The mutual structure makes even friendly takeovers by outsiders exceedingly difficult, so there is no market for corporate control and limited accountability for management. Above all, the mutual structure should not be impregnable. The real problem is finding a way of achieving this without risking destabilising flows of savings. One solution might be to weight voting rights according to duration of membership. That would reflect the appropriate share of individual building society members in accumulated reserves. Predators would have to pay most to members with the longest-term interest in the society. If they have stayed around out of satisfaction with their society's service, they might also be those least inclined to take the money and run.</p>

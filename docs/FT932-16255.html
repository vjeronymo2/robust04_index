			<p>930407 FT  07 APR 93 / EC tobacco fraud suicide inquiry THE European Commission has been asked to prepare a report on last week's suicide of a senior official implicated in EC tobacco fraud. Members of the European Parliament said yesterday senior Commission officials had agreed to submit a report to a meeting of the Parliament's budgetary control committee next month. MEPs want the report to say how the Commission became aware of alleged fraud in the tobacco sector in 1990, what they did about it, and whether such problems could recur. Mr Antonio Quatraro, an Italian, who was in charge of the EC's tobacco regime until July 1990, took his own life last week just days before the final hearings in an internal disciplinary procedure on the alleged fraud. Mr John Tomlinson, a British Labour MEP and member of the budgetary control committee, said the disciplinary proceedings centred on allegations that Mr Quatraro was paid to encourage a cartel of tobacco traders. He allegedly endorsed the sale of large lots of unwanted Italian and Greek tobacco to the cartel, which then sold it to developing countries and former Soviet bloc nations, and benefited from Community export refunds. Mr Tomlinson and Mr Terry Wynn, another British Labour MEP who follows the workings of the EC's costly tobacco subsidy regime, said there was nothing to link Mr Quatraro with the Mafia, as has been alleged in some reports. Mr Tomlinson said the tobacco case was 'a fairly routine sort of problem' and the budgetary control committee really wanted to draw attention to the EC's 'inherently flawed and inherently corrupt' common agricultural policy, and ensure that the Community closed off opportunities for abuse. Mr Quatraro was moved from his job at the head of the tobacco regime in July 1990 after a French newspaper reported rumours about fraud in the sector.</p>

			<p>931130 FT  30 NOV 93 / Survey of Vietnam (10): Business guide Getting there Vietnam is served by an increasing number of international and regional airlines, including Air France, Lufthansa and KLM. Visa and entry formalities are generally straightforward, although visitors are sometimes presented with an extra 'application to enter' form at the airport which requires a passport-sized photograph. Currency Visa and Mastercard - but not American Express - can be used at major hotels; the US economic embargo excludes the use of any credit cards and travellers cheques issued by US banks. It is advisable to take a substantial amount of US dollars in cash for transport and accommodation, especially if you are travelling in the provinces. Theft and other crimes are on the increase, especially in Vung Tau and Ho Chi Minh City in the south. Information Commercial and economic information in English is widely available inside Vietnam, but the local press is not free and the best coverage of political developments is in the foreign media. The official Vietnam News, a four-page newspaper in English, is published daily. The weekly Vietnam Investment Review has comprehensive coverage of economic news. Vietnam Economic Times, a monthly English language version of the Vietnamese weekly of the same name, is expected to be available from March next year. English is the language of business, although some older people speak French and Vietnam's communist heritage has given the country many Russian and German speakers. Accommodation New hotels are under construction in large towns, but first-class hotels still tend to be full. Book well in advance and confirm the reservation. Those planning a longer stay will find housing can be extraordinarily expensive for foreigners. The south In Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), leading hotels include Century Saigon (Dollars 110 to Dollars 475 per night, tel (84 8) 231818, fax 292732); Saigon Floating Hotel (Dollars 130 to Dollars 425, tel 290783, fax 290784); and Continental (Dollars 80 to Dollars 176, tel 299201, fax 290936). A favourite for connoisseurs of kitsch is the Rex (Dollars 59 to Dollars 198, tel 292185, fax 296536), with its rooftop garden complete with rotating illuminated crown. Another hotel with a pleasant rooftop bar - if you don't mind the odd rat - is the Majestic (Dollars 45 to Dollars 140, tel 295515, fax 291470) by the river. Saigon has a growing number of restaurants and bars, including the pub on the top floor of the Dragon Inn - a mock-Elizabethan mini-skyscraper near the river - modern bars with war-nostalgia names such as Apocalypse Now, and French establishments such as La Cigale. La Bibliotheque de Madame Dai, a law library converted into a restaurant, is still going strong under Madame Dai herself. It is better known for its traditional music and dancing displays than for its cuisine. It is worth visiting the tunnels at Cu Chi used by Vietnamese guerrillas during the war and to the Great Temple of the Caodai religion (prophets include Lenin, Jesus, Mohammed, Shakespeare and Victor Hugo). North and centre The leading hotel in Hanoi is the elegant Sofitel Metropole (Dollars 139 to Dollars 294, tel (84 4) 266919, fax 266920). Others include the Saigon Hotel (Dollars 60 to Dollars 110, tel 268499, fax 266631), and the Army Hotel (Dollars 41 to Dollars 72, tel 252896, fax 259276). Hanoi is undergoing the kind of construction and motorcycle-buying boom experienced by Ho Chi Minh City three years ago, but it remains a delightful if dilapidated town of tree-lined avenues, lakes and French colonial architecture. In the centre of the country, Danang and Hue - the old imperial capital - are developing at a more sedate pace. The lifestyle of the emperors, with their concubines, eunuchs and mandarins, makes fascinating reading. Emperor Minh Mang enjoyed five concubines a night (he had 142 children), while Tu Duc's tea was made from dew collected from the leaves of lotus plants.</p>

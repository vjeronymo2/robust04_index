			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Environment Minister Klaus Toepfer by </F> Susanne Krispin; place and date not given: "In Small Steps  Toward the Five-Liter Car"]    [Text] [Krispin] What is your main goal in environment  policy for Germany's presidency of the European Union [EU],  which will begin in July?    [Toepfer] We understand the German EU presidency as a  comprehensive task. At the same time, I have taken over, on  behalf of the FRG, the chairmanship of the UN Committee for  Lasting Development. In March 1995, we will hold a conference  in Berlin of the states that have signed the convention on  climate protection. And it is a matter of course that we are  acting in the EU and in Germany toward the goal of achieving a  lasting development. This includes the energy problem, because  70 to 80 percent of the environmental problems are linked with  energy consumption. Therefore, we will adopt this as a central  goal of environmental policy.    [Krispin] Are there already specific concepts for the Berlin  climate conference?    [Toepfer] We have a climate convention, which is binding  under international law. In addition, the EU has committed  itself to achieving a stabilization of carbon dioxide emissions  at the level of 1990 by the year 2000. In particular during  Germany's EU presidency, we will have to work on that, because  some states, such as Spain, will still increase their carbon  dioxide emissions. Only if several states reduce their emissions  will we be able to stabilize the values in Europe. Germany has  to prove that we are able to clearly reduce the emission of  carbon dioxide, which we have already been doing.    [Krispin] A total of 15 percent of the reduction is due to  closing down industry in the east. In the west the absolute  value is stable, which means a negligible reduction of the per  capita value given the increase of the population in the old  laender. However, Germany wants to save 30 percent. Where is  the other 15 percent supposed to come from?    [Toepfer] We will reduce the use of brown coal for  electricity production, because brown coal is the most difficult  energy source regarding carbon dioxide. We will manage this  with new coal-fired power plants with a high efficiency, such as  in Jaenschwalde or at Schwarze Pumpe. This means a considerable  challenge regarding jobs, which we confront by means of  improvement measures in brown coal strip mining. In the west we  must act in the field of energy supply to our households and in  industry. For this purpose, we must correspondingly amend the  decree on the use of heat. This means, above all, for the old  laender that waste heat is to be used more efficiently, for  instance via power-heat coupling. In the new laender, existing  district heating plants are to be preserved, but are to be  restructured for power-heat coupling.    [Krispin] Where can we save most?    [Toepfer] The greatest potential for reduction lies in the  field of private households, followed by energy supply and  industry. Smaller but still important potential can be found in  small businesses and in the use of renewable energies.  Regarding the increase in traffic, it is necessary to stabilize  the carbon dioxide values.    [Krispin] How do you want to do that?    [Toepfer] During our EU presidency, we want to pass a  decree, according to which the average consumption of newly  registered cars must gradually approach five liters [consumption  per 100 km] by the year 2005, because the cars that are  registered nowadays will still drive for another 10 years.  Their consumption is about 7 liters. The average consumption  of the overall number of cars is considerably higher. In early  1993 the EU should have presented such a decree. Unfortunately,  it did not do that. Now we will urge a change. The other  approach is a carbon dioxide energy tax. Over the past  three-and-a-half years it has only been discussed in the EU, but  has not been adopted because there is considerably resistance  against it in the EU. We will try to make our legal and tax  concept in the EU quite clear to bring about a decision.  Furthermore, the FRG must make it clear that it has found a  realistic approach to achieving its self-imposed goal of a  30-percent reduction in carbon dioxide.    [Krispin] The German Institute of Economic Research (DIW)  has now stated in a study that the FRG could introduce an energy  tax on its own without suffering any economic disadvantages.    [Toepfer] I believe that the arguments in this study are  very one-dimensional.    [Krispin] Why?    [Toepfer] Because the structural effects are not  sufficiently taken into account. The DIW report is correct in  stating that changes in the tax burden are also linked with  dynamic technical developments, which are considered to be an  advantage for Germany as a business location. However, we  should do everything to get a general consent in the EU  regarding the tax developments.    [Krispin] According to the study, energy-intensive  industries, such as the chemical and steel industries, would pay  higher taxes and the service sector would pay lower taxes.    [Toepfer] But the question is how we can achieve the goal of  full employment simultaneously with foreign trade stability and  environmentally compatible growth. I do not believe that we can  suddenly change from a structure that is also characterized by  industry to a structure that is solely oriented toward services.  We agree with our French colleagues that in those places where  we make exports we should take fewer national measures. In  those places where we have regional markets, such as in many  services, we can act on our own more easily. However, German  chemical industry, for instance, must stand on its own in  international competition.    [Krispin] What about the structural change?    [Toepfer] Of course, we must support structural change in  the spirit of an ecological-social market economy. However,  what should be the speed of implementation and how can  ecological changes be made without entailing social imbalances?  We are in a situation of upheaval and we have to implement the  transformation of a planned economy into a market economy  system. We are making progress with that. The economic growth  rates in the new laender prove that.</p>

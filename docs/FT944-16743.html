			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Management: Career moves in Tokyo - Mitsubishi has recognised that its managers do not have to be Japanese Even the most innovative Japanese multinationals lag well behind their western competitors in inviting foreign executives to compete for top jobs. As a consequence, Japanese companies risk failing to make full use of foreign talent, at a time when their need for outside management - Asian as well as western - is growing faster than ever before. Trendsetters such as Sony, the entrepreneurial electronics group, have long ago taken this message to heart. But Sony is a special case. The use of senior foreign management is still rare among more traditional players in Japanese business. One of them, Mitsubishi Corporation, the sprawling international empire which is Japan's largest general trading company, has just seen the light and is taking steps to create a merit-based career path for foreign managers in a traditional Japanese seniority-based hierarchy. Its experience in this regard is at an early stage, but already instructive. Early this year, Mitsubishi inaugurated an international human resources development unit in its Tokyo head office. Its manager is Mohan Patel, an intelligent, gently-spoken Canadian of mixed Indian and Japanese extraction, who has spent 14 years as a trader in the machinery division. Patel, 44, is himself an example of the kind of manager he is trying to foster. Younger than Japanese colleagues at the same level, he is the only foreign manager among nearly 10,000 head office staff. His five-person unit has been fully operational for four months, long enough for Patel to identify the main tasks needed to make more efficient use of Mitsubishi's 4,000 non-Japanese employees worldwide and the 20 staff from overseas subsidiaries who have moved to head office in the past five years. Mitsubishi has a long history of hiring foreigners in the 600 overseas joint ventures in which it has equity stakes across the world, ranging from printed circuit board manufacturing to pharmaceuticals. Until a few years ago, however, nearly all of them were support staff, working under Japanese managers. That has started to change, slowly, so the group now has six foreign directors of its overseas joint ventures. 'We need to delegate increasing responsibility to local staff, so our requirements have started to rise,' says Patel. Mitsubishi realises that joint venture managers do not necessarily have to be Japanese, if only because it is hard for such a large hierarchical organisation to train 'true managers' to take charge of far-flung subsidiaries, says Patel. The supply of Japanese managers is also starting to fall in line with the country's ageing population, a trend that is easy to spot early in a seniority-based hierarchy such as Mitsubishi's. To retain and make efficient use of foreign executives, 'we have to consider how to train these individuals and provide them with more opportunities within the group', says Patel. The main problem, he says, is that Mitsubishi lacks a system for rotating foreign managers through the group, from one foreign unit to another or even through Tokyo. Denied a clear career path, a growing number of foreign staff were leaving for other companies after completing a single posting. The solution is essentially technical, he believes. Traditionally, staff are promoted only within their own division or within their foreign joint venture, where the opportunities are naturally limited. A handful of exceptions have been made for foreigners, who did not easily fit into the Japanese hierarchy because they tended to enter the group via a joint venture or subsidiary, often in mid-career. They include the transfer of a Bostonian via Tokyo to Singapore, then to France, where he has for the past two years been managing director of a circuit board factory. Another US executive moved from New York to be number two at a chemicals plant in the Netherlands. 'In the past, there was an independent discussion each time we made an appointment like this,' says Patel. His first task, therefore, will be to set up a clearly understood system for transferring foreign executives between divisions. To assist this process, Patel's unit has been given responsibilities across Mitsubishi's seven divisions, along with the elite planning committees that sit just beneath the board. Another task identified is to set up a regular system for giving foreign executives exposure to head office, for short postings of up to two years. Authority at Mitsubishi is centralised, so managers who know the ropes at head office have a clear advantage. 'Our overseas staff have very loose job descriptions because our activities are so diverse, from trading to finance and manufacturing. So it boils down to creativity . . . but you can't function in that environment unless you know what it takes to convince your bosses in Tokyo,' says Patel. Until now, foreign managers had to wait for an invitation from a talent spotter in Tokyo to achieve that kind of exposure. That was, in fact, what happened to Patel, who spent nine years selling machinery in Canada before his divisional boss asked him to move to Japan in 1989, to take up another trading job. As in most Japanese companies, there remains a limit to foreign executives' promotion prospects. There are none, for example, on Mitsubishi's board of directors. That will change 'in the not too distant future', Patel predicts. But the first foreigner to sit on Mitsubishi's board may well be Chinese, to make a contribution to developing one of its fastest growing markets, rather than European or American.</p>

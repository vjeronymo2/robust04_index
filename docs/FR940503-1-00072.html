			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Accuracy of Individual Foreign Refiner Baselines  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As described in detail above, this proposed amendment provides that parties that desire to establish an individual baseline for a foreign refinery would submit a petition to EPA's Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation to establish a reliable and verifiable individual baseline. The petitioner would also submit data adequate to establish the volume of gasoline exported to the United States during 1990.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Assistant Administrator would only approve petitions when the individual baseline had been established with sufficient certainty, to the satisfaction of the Assistant Administrator. The Assistant Administrator's decision whether to approve a petition would depend, in part, on the certainty with which the foreign refiner's 1990 fuel properties and volume data could be verified by a U.S.-based independent baseline auditor and by EPA, as discussed above. In requiring that a petitioner bear the burden of demonstrating to the Assistant Administrator that the individual baseline and the data submitted in support of an individual baseline is accurate and verifiable, and in requiring that a U.S.-based attestor corroborate that demonstration, the amendment provides for appropriate certainty in establishing accurate individual baselines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment as to whether the proposal would result in appropriate certainty as to any foreign refinery baseline that would be established.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Certainty as to Refinery-of-Origin  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the preamble to the final rule, EPA expressed concern about effectively determining the refinery-of-origin for specific batches of imported gasoline so as to determine the appropriate baseline to be applied to the product. However, EPA is proposing and seeking comment on procedures that are designed to ensure that importers effectively track gasoline from the point of gasoline production to the port-of-entry into the U.S.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Strict tracking and segregation of reformulated gasoline that is produced by foreign refiners and that would be subject to an individual baseline is necessary to assure compliance with this program. Only by matching a discrete volume of gasoline with an individual baseline would an importer be able to accurately calculate its compliance with this proposed amendment to the reformulated gasoline program. Further, such tracking and segregation is necessary for EPA to ensure that use of an individual baseline remains within the foreign refiner's volume cap.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposed amendment of the final rule seeks to provide for certainty with respect to establishing the refinery-of-origin of imported gasoline through the use of independent sampling and testing that would be required upon loading on-board ship at the refinery-of-origin and upon receipt by an importer at a U.S. port-of-entry. The sampling and testing at both ends of the shipment would help to assure that the volume and parameters of the product subject to the individual baseline are identical. Additionally, the independent laboratory would verify the foreign refinery-of-origin before the shipment leaves the foreign port.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendment proposes that batch specific information pertaining to the parameters and volume of the batch would be collected by an independent laboratory upon loading of the product and a report filed with EPA. This information would be available for comparison with batch specific information required to be collected by importers upon receipt of product.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Further, the tracking system would help to ensure that EPA could determine that the imported reformulated gasoline produced subject to an individual baseline was not commingled with gasoline produced under another baseline en route from its source to the U.S. port-of-entry.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Today's proposal also would require that an importer exercising the option to use a foreign refinery's individual baseline must demonstrate that an annual attestation engagement is conducted of the foreign refinery for each year of individual baseline use. The engagement would be undertaken by a U.S.-based CPA or firm. This requirement would be equivalent with attest engagement requirements applicable to domestic refiners and importers under the Final Rule. The engagement would verify that the gasoline loaded on-board ship was produced by the refinery for which individual baseline use is claimed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The practical effect of today's proposal would be to condition the use of individual foreign refinery baselines upon strict tracking of reformulated gasoline. An importer's use of a foreign refinery's individual baseline would depend upon the importer's ability to establish with certainty that the reformulated gasoline for which the individual baseline is claimed was, in fact, produced at the foreign refinery for which the individual baseline is applicable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment regarding whether there would be appropriate certainty as to the refinery of origin of any imported gasoline that would use an individual foreign refinery's baseline under this proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. The Limited Potential for Adverse Air Quality Effects From Gaming  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> It has been argued that the proposed constraints on the use of individual baselines by importers would limit the potential for gaming associated with establishing baselines for imported gasoline, and in consequence the potential for adverse air quality effects from such gaming.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

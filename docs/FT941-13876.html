			<p>940122 FT  22 JAN 94 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Too daily male Is she a mad-woman? Should she be drummed out of the teaching profession and flung into the Thames? Is the plague of political correctness spreading into our primary schools and warping the minds of infants? The answers to those questions will depend of which general newspaper you read, for they relate to the case of Jane Brown, head teacher of Kingsmead primary school in the east London borough of Hackney. Brown was splashed across the newspapers this week because she had rejected an opportunity for pupils to see the ballet Romeo and Juliet at the Royal Opera House. According to most reports, the sole reason for her action was that she regarded Romeo and Juliet as a 'blatantly heterosexual love story', and that until books, films and plays reflected all forms of sexuality she was disinclined to involve her pupils in 'heterosexual culture'. The first I heard of the story was on TV on Wednesday. But the reports sounded so galumphingly one-sided that on Thursday I bought a copy of every UK national newspaper, to see whether the story was more complicated than it sounded on TV. It was, and the results of my survey reinforced my belief that the lower end of the UK newspaper market is capable of such viciousness that it ought to be subjected to a penal rate of VAT - the proceeds to be given to the quality newspapers to subsidise their efforts at serious reporting. I divided my pile of newspapers into three categories: qualities (Times, Telegraph, Guardian, Independent); tabloids (Express, Mail, Today) and testosteroids (produced by inadequates for the enjoyment of inadequates: Sun, Mirror, Star). With two minor exceptions, the tabloids and testosteroids reported the story as one thing only: an example of loony-left philistinism and creeping political correctness. Said the Star: 'A loony school head rejected cut-price tickets for her pupils to see Romeo and Juliet - because it WASN'T a gay love story.' The Mirror's headline: 'Head Bans 'Hetero' Romeo and Juliet.' The Sun's: 'Romeo, Romeo, Where Art Thou Homo?' Only in the Sun and Today was an inkling provided that there may have been other reasons why the head teacher felt disinclined to send her tots to Romeo and Juliet. To discover what those were, you had to turn to the qualities. The Independent's story was stumpy and poor - almost as one-sided as the tabs' and the testos'. Only in the Telegraph and Guardian was the complexity of the story allowed to show through. Said the Telegraph: 'While Hackney leaders, who have been trying to soften the council's left-wing image, were furious, Ms Brown's colleagues defended her. One said: 'She is not trying to promote homosexuality. All she was trying to do was to prevent the children being fed a constant diet of gang fights and killing. The school is on the edge of a notorious estate and showing children yet more male stereotyping, feuding and knives is no joke.' Perhaps, at day's end, opinion will settle in favour of John McCafferty, Hackney council's leader - he is also a teacher of English  - who was quoted as calling Brown an 'irresponsible individual' guilty of an 'absurd, narrow-minded Californian concept of political correctness'. On Thursday, the head teacher said she was 'dismayed at the distress I have caused to parents, staff and pupils by the unwelcome media attention which has focused on the school.' And she told a Hackney council inquiry that her action had been 'wholly inappropriate'. But by then the affair had been clouded by the media's rush to judgment. Brown sounds to me like someone trying to perform a difficult job with sensitivity - a victim of media shafting. Does it matter? Yes, it does. Include the FT, and the UK qualities sold 2,432,993 copies last month. Combined, the tabloids and testosteroids sold 10,493,306 copies. The tabs and the testos outsell the qualities by 4.31:1. If you ask me, a lot of the blame for the intolerance and viciousness and ignorance and stupidity that we notice all around us derives from that dreadful ratio. The government must act. A simple little VAT rate - 33 per cent, perhaps a touch more - on the tabs and the testos would suffice. This is a challenge for Michael Portillo: a chance to show us he is more than a mouth.</p>

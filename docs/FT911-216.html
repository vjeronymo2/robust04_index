			<p>910514 FT  14 MAY 91 / Recession-hit US states consider tax increases: Spending cuts target education and health programmes MORE US states are being forced to consider tax increases, across-the-board spending cuts and staff redundancies and lay-offs as a result of shortfalls in tax receipts caused by the recession. The Centre for the Study of the States, a think-tank based in Albany, New York, has calculated that tax receipts in the 50 states during the first three months of this year averaged just 0.9 per cent higher than a year earlier. Had many states not imposed tax increases, revenue would have declined 1.3 per cent. In real, inflation-adjusted, terms receipts dropped 6 per cent. In California revenue dropped 5.7 per cent in the period as a result of lower personal, corporate and sales taxes. There were also declines in Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Tennessee. Only states which have enacted tax increases - such as New Jersey, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Arizona - saw revenue rise appreciably. Individual states, rather than the federal government, have to fund a wider range of social and community services than local authorities do in Britain and much of Europe. For instance, the federal government finances only 6 per cent of education spending, with the rest coming from state or local city and county taxes. States are particularly vulnerable as they rely heavily on sales taxes, which have been affected by sluggish consumer spending. Costs of programmes such as health care for the poor and elderly, prisons and law and order are rising rapidly, in some instances outstripping inflation. The cost of Medicaid, half of which is borne by the states, rose 25 per cent last year. Moreover, most states are legally required to balance their budgets and cannot run deficits on their current spending. During the 1980s, thanks to inflation and rapid growth, many states built up cash surpluses, but their balances are down to Dollars 5.9bn (Pounds 3.4bn), or 2 per cent of total expenditures, the lowest level since 1983. Consequently, according to the National Governors Association, 29 states have cut a total of more than Dollars 8bn from their budgets and 26 states are raising taxes by a record Dollars 10.3bn for the current 1991 fiscal year, with Dollars 6.7bn already planned for the next fiscal year. This presents considerable political problems, in view of voters' resistance to tax increases; their aversion was largely responsible for the defeat of several incumbent governors in last November's elections and there are fears that current problems could spark further taxpayer revolts. The main spending cuts have been in mental health programmes, higher education and, in some cases, aid to local schools. State employees have been laid off or given days off without pay as state governments shut down on selected days.</p>

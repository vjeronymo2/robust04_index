			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / Delors denies any move to devolve environment policy MR Jacques Delors, the president of the European Commission, has made clear he is not seeking a radical decentralisation of EC environmental policy in the interests of subsidiarity, writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. In a letter to Mr Ken Collins, the chairman of the European Parliament's environment committee, Mr Delors explained that he believed member states had a role to play in supervising implementation of environmental policy. Some reports have implied that Mr Delors wants to go further and devolve responsibility for other elements of environmental policy to member states. But Mr Delors said in his letter that he thought he had been 'misunderstood'. 'As far as I am concerned, it is not a matter of calling into question the Commission's right of initiative and Community competence in the environmental area,' he added.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by correspondent Jorge Brusco; from the "Union Radio </F> News" newscast]    [Text] Bus owners have directly accused Governor Guillermo  Cal of being responsible for the acts of violence that took  place in Maturin and for the resulting damages to 25 buses.  Representatives and leaders of the transportation sector and 5  July Cooperative President Eudis Febres, 5 July Cooperative  Treasurer Saul Verdones, and Jesus Aquiles Rondon, secretary  general of the Bus Drivers Union, think it is suspicious that  the protest began with the burning of tires at approximately  0730 and that the police did not arrive until after midday.    Very few students participated in the incidents. The few  that  did are activists of the Democratic Action Party [AD] and were  led by Eudis Marin. We have no idea how he is connected to these  incidents. We have learned that Marin is not a student but an AD  activist.</p>

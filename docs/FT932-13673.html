			<p>930422 FT  22 APR 93 / German budget deficit could top DM65bn, Waigel warns GERMANY'S deepening recession could take the federal budget deficit to more than DM65bn (Pounds 26.6bn) this year, up DM15bn from earlier estimates, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, warned yesterday. He said extra spending by the Federal Labour Office on unemployment benefits and retraining programmes was the main reason for the increase. Mr Waigel's forecast came as increased worries over the extent of the domestic recession were voiced by government officials and leading industrialists meeting at Germany's most important trade fair, in Hanover. Mr Gunther Rexrodt, the economy minister, said the country's recession was proving deeper than expected. The drop in gross domestic product, could be greater than the 1 per cent forecast by the government earlier this year in its annual report, he said. A gross domestic product contraction of 2 per cent could not be ruled out. 'We are in a deep recession. No one can seriously say how deep it is or how long it will last,' he said. 'But minus two is the number that cannot be ruled out.' Meanwhile, the markets were disappointed with a larger-than-expected increase in broad money supply, up a seasonally adjusted 3.2 per cent in March. The figure, traditionally the German central bank's key indicator in its fight against inflation, also damped hopes of further substantial cuts in German interest rates. Mr Rexrodt said the recession had revealed structural weaknesses which prevented German companies from competing internationally. He called for a reform of the corporate tax system and privatisation of infrastructure and public services. Mr Tyll Necker, president of the German industry federation BDI, said the country could experience its worst recession since the second world war. Government officials said yesterday the labour office would show a deficit of DM11.5bn by the end of May. The office said in February that it had already run out of money. Bonn has repeatedly revised its 1993 budget forecast. In March the government said an extra DM3bn would be added to the forecast 1993 deficit of DM51bn to help finance the solidarity pact - the package to boost recovery in east Germany. Germany's deficit in 1992 was DM38.6bn. Bundesbank damps rate cut hopes, Page 2 Editorial Comment, Page 23 Bonds, Page 34 Currencies, Page 43</p>

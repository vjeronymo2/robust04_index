			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: European markets out-perform other regions EUROPEAN government bond markets out-performed the other regions in January, with UK gilt-edged securities showing the strongest gains, according to JP Morgan's Bond Index, writes Sara Webb. UK gilt prices rose 2.62 per cent in January in local currency terms, which JP Morgan attributed to 'the increased likelihood of a Conservative (party) victory in the next general election and the perception that the UK will soon join the ERM (exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system) narrow band'. The European markets which showed the strongest gains in local currency terms after the UK were Belgium (2.12 per cent), the Netherlands (2.08 per cent) and Germany (2.01 per cent). All three markets have been boosted by hopes of a cut in German interest rates. The worst-performing government bond market was Australia, which fell 2.89 per cent in local currency terms on news that the government will increase its borrowing. For US dollar-based investors, the appreciation in the dollar wiped out gains from the European bond markets.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> &bull;Revises long unbroken columns of text to designate separate provisions and to provide headings that help the reader to get an overview and to find particular provisions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Uses the active voice and the present indicative (rather than the future tense) to describe what HCFA or its employees, agents, or contractors do, and uses the most precise terms available.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A specific goal is to complete the separation of the rules that pertain to assurances required of entities applying for Federal qualification from those that pertain to assurances given in applying for financial assistance (grants, loans, and loan guarantees) that was available under the PHS Act before October 1986. To achieve this goal, we have_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Removed the portion of &sect;417.160 applicable to financial assistance that is no longer available; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Added a new &sect;417.940 in subpart V to reference &sect;417.163(g) as applicable to entities that have outstanding loans or loan guarantees, and that fail to comply with assurances they gave in applying for the loan or loan guarantee. (Section 417.163(g) provides that HCFA may bring civil action to enforce compliance with assurances.)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, we have_ <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Removed the definitions of the three types of ``qualified'' HMOs (&sect;417.141) because definitions are not used for substantive content, and in this case simply constituted a partial duplication of the rules themselves;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Incorporated paragraph (a) of &sect;417.143 into &sect;417.140 to set forth the scope of the whole subpart D; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Removed &sect;&sect;417.168 and 417.169 from subpart F because their content is being transferred to &sect;417.142(g) and (h).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Waiver of Proposed Rulemaking  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> With one exception, the changes made by this rule are technical and editorial in nature. Their aim is to simplify, clarify, and update subparts D, E, F, and V without substantive change.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have removed from &sect;417.169 (now redesignated as &sect;417.142(h)), the words ``for purposes of receiving assistance under this subpart.'' HCFA has consistently interpreted this language (which appears in section 1307(d) of the PHS Act) as applying to continued qualification of HMOs as well as to initial applications for assistance that was available under that Act before October 1986. This interpretation avoids what would be an unintended result: Now that the assistance is no longer available, HMOs that had qualified in connection with their requests for assistance would have to disenroll their Federal Employee Health Benefit Program (FEHBP) enrollees in order to retain qualification and to be able to take advantage of the requirement that employers include qualified HMOs in their employee health benefits plans. It was a mistake to include in &sect;417.169 the limiting language, which did not appear in the predecessor rule issued in 1974. We have deleted the language to achieve consistency between paragraphs (g) and (h) of &sect;417.142 and with HCFA's long-standing interpretation of the statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Given this justification, we find that there is good cause to waive proposed rule-making procedures as unnecessary. As previously indicated, however, we will consider timely comments from anyone who questions the deletion of the reference to ``assistance'' or believes that, in making the technical and editorial changes, we have altered the substance of the rules. Although we cannot respond to comments individually, if we revise these rules as a result of comments, we will discuss all timely comments in the preamble to the revised rules.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Paperwork Reduction Act  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These regulations contain no new information collection requirements subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Impact Statement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Flexibility Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) and section 1102(b) of the Social Security Act, we prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis for each rule, unless the Secretary certifies that the particular rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, or a significant impact on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> We have not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis because we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that these rules will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities or on the operation of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

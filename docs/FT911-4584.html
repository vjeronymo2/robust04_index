			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / The Finance Bill: 'Loophole' closed - Building Societies CLAUSE 50 of yesterday's bill is couched in dry draftsman's language. Yet the wording conceals what 'could be the greatest building society robbery of all time,' says Mr Mike Blackburn, chief executive of Leeds Permanent, the UK's fifth largest building society. The clause formalises the government's position on what is becoming known as the transitional arrangements debate. The arrangements in question were those introduced in 1985-86 when composite rate tax was applied to the societies for the first time. Under these rules, a number of building societies found themselves taxed twice. According to Mark Boleat, the director general of the Building Societies Association, the amount lost to building societies stands at Pounds 250m. The Woolwich and the Leeds were particularly badly hit: between them they paid an extra Pounds 130m. The Woolwich launched a lawsuit against the Inland Revenue which was won in the House of Lords last October. As a result, the society is to be repaid Pounds 44m. The victory prompted the Treasury to close what it considered a loophole in this year's Budget. Yesterday's bill will not stop that cash going back to the Woolwich, but it will block all other societies from taking advantage of the precedent set in the House of Lords last October. Earlier this week, the Leeds said it was considering going to the European Court of Human Rights to challenge Mr Lamont's legislation. David Waller Permanent interest bearing shares (Pibs), a new form of security which can be issued by building societies, will be taxed as debt instruments rather than as equity, writes Simon London. The Building Societies Commission recently ruled that building societies may issue interest bearing shares to investors to raise capital. The shares will have no maturity date and a rate of interest fixed each year by the issuer. They will also be deeply subordinated, ranking below other creditors and savers' deposits in the event of winding up. The Budget statement said that interest payments on the Pibs will be tax deductable for the building society. The Finance Bill confirms that the tax relief - like that on interest payments on other forms of debt  - will only be allowable up to the 'commercial rate'. Interest payments over the commercial rate will be treated as dividend payments. Interest will be paid net of tax to Pibs holders. Non-taxpayers will not be able to claim gross payments. Like all other forms of sterling-denominated debt instruments, Pibs will be exempt from capital gains tax. They will also be bought into the accrued income scheme, which prevents 'bond washing' - the practice of converting interest payments into capital gain by selling shares shortly before an interest payment is due and buying them back afterwards. Building societies will be able to claim the 'incidental cost' of issuing Pibs, such as fees paid to professional advisers, against tax.</p>

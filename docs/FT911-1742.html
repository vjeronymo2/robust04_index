			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Computing the need for a byte into staffing levels - IBM UK's radical re-organisation, forced on the company by recession THE UK subsidiary of International Business Machines (IBM), the world's largest computer manufacturer, is implementing a radical re-organisation which will fundamentally affect the way the company does business in Britain and result in the likely loss of some 1,000 staff between now and 1993. The shake-up in UK operations is described by Mr Nick Temple, IBM UK's general manager, as the broadest the company has ever attempted. Indeed it goes beyond 1989's worldwide re-organisation to combat sluggish sales and declining profits. That initiative resulted in the elimination of thousands of jobs and several layers of bureaucracy. The new measures have been forced on the company by the recession in the UK which has slowed growth drastically and exposed IBM's comparative inflexibility and lack of competitiveness. Last week it announced a rationalisation in its manufacturing activities, involving the loss of 400 jobs over three years, to improve competitiveness and its chances of bringing new manufacturing commissions to the UK. IBM manufacturing units compete with each other in its three principal markets - the US, Europe and Asia - to win manufacturing 'missions'. IBM UK's financial performance last year was significantly poorer than the company as a whole. Revenues grew to Pounds 4.3bn, up only 3 per cent, while pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 420m (Pounds 459m) in the second year of declining profitability. Mr Temple believes profits will be either flat or reduced in the UK this year. By comparison, the IBM group worldwide turned over Dollars 69bn in 1990, a 10 per cent rise, and pre-tax profits rose 54 per cent to Dollars 10.2bn. Earlier this year, moreover, IBM intrigued Europe's personal computer industry by appointing Mr William McCracken as general manager for personal systems (personal computers) in Europe, only a few months after responsibility for personal systems throughout the region had been given to Mr Tony Cleaver, UK chairman and chief executive. Mr McCracken is based at IBM's European headquarters in Paris. IBM explains the move as a re-organisation made necessary by the fast-changing nature of the personal computer business. Mr Cleaver, Sir Leonard Peach, director of personnel and corporate affairs, and Mr JB Holmes, director of manufacturing, were involved in the preparation of the recovery plan, although its overall shape was the responsibility of Mr Temple, appointed general manager in December last year. This week Mr Temple denied that his authorship of the plan reflected any change of emphasis at the top of the company, explaining that Mr Cleaver's role was focused on IBM UK's external relationships. Mr Temple has been briefing IBM's top managers on the scheme over the past few days and they have been filtering the details to the company's 18,000 UK employees. Senior management from Armonk, IBM's world headquarters in New York State, are taking a keen interest in the development of the scheme. IBM now derives more of its profits from Europe than from the US. The recession in the UK, however, has proved an early indicator of slowing growth in Europe. The UK is seen in Armonk, it seems, as a test case of how to deal with a European market in recession. The plan has six elements: An increase of about 600 to 6,300 in the company's direct salesforce with the objective of bringing more salespeople in touch with customers. Mr Temple said the number of people involved in buying decisions had multiplied as information technology spread through companies and the extra salespeople would be necessary to maintain more comprehensive contacts with customers. A 20 per cent improvement in the effectiveness of the UK salesforce. Mr Temple said this would not be measured in extra sales, but would involve finding ways for salespeople and support staff to spend more time with customers through the elimination of bureaucracy. He was anxious to improve speed of response and quality of service via the reduction of management layers from the present six or seven to five. A new emphasis on market specialisation. In the past, IBM has presented itself as a general purpose computer company, willing to tackle any customer's data processing problem. With increased competition from small, fast-moving niche market specialists, that approach is no longer viable. Local government and the public sector were among the areas where IBM intended to concentrate its efforts. He would not say where the company intended to back-pedal. An increased concentration on computing services, the fastest-growing area of the computer industry. This includes not only computer software but also facilities management - where the company runs a computer centre on behalf of a customer - systems integration and information technology consultancy. There are 400 staff on the computing services side at present; the idea is to increase that number to 2,000 through redeployment of existing staff. Reorganisation of the products side of the company into a number of business units, self-contained in their operations, but not independent of the rest of the company. There will be product business units dealing with, for example, mainframes, mid-range systems and with the company's open systems products which use IBM's AIX operating system. An experiment which has turned the branch at Richmond, London, into a field business unit functioning as a profit centre rather than a revenue centre is to be extended to the rest of the country. Some 30-40 business units are to be established by the end of the year. A new emphasis on selling to small businesses through the addition of a commercial sector to IBM's traditional marketing areas of manufacturing industry, banking and finance, and government.</p>

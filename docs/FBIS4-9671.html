			<p>BFN     [Text] Exploration and exploitation of oil, natural gas,  and telecommunications services will be able to be done by  private enterprises. Such changes are planned in the seven  congressional committee proposals announced today by  constitutional revision rapporteur Deputy Nelson Jobim.    According to these proposals, the right to exploit oil,  natural gas, and telecommunications ceases to be the privilege  of public companies.    [Begin Jobim recording] Look, we want to ensure a state  monopoly, that is, the possibility that the government can  exploit things either directly or through concessions. We are  not forcing public companies to give concessions (?even if the  pertaining) company is monopolistic. That is a government  decision. [end recording]    Flexibility in monopolies also will be adopted for the  distribution of piped gas. The rules for concessions will be  defined by a complementary law.    Jobim also suggested a limitation on government intervention  in the economy by eliminating the requirement of government  authorization to exercise any economic activity. His proposal  also ends differences between national and foreign companies. In  the field of public finances and budget, Jobim suggests changes  to balance the fiscal accounts, and he is open to suggestions  from the Budget CPI [Congressional Investigative Committee].    The main changes he suggested are to withdraw the concept of  a congressional committee from the Constitution, and to end  social subsidies and voluntary transfers of funds to states and  municipalities, which should be authorized only through a  specific law.</p>

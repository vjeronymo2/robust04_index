			<p><P> February 7, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GEN. POWELL GIVES PRIORITY TO FUNDS FOR STEALTH BOMBER  </P> <P> A key congressional Democrat, exploring how deeply strategic weapons can be cut  without losing Pentagon support for arms control talks, was told Tuesday that  canceling the B-2 Stealth bomber could be fatal but that eliminating the  Midgetman missile probably would not.  </P> <P> At a hearing on President Bush's defense budget, House Armed Services Committee  Chairman Les Aspin (D-Wis.) probed the Administration's tolerance for strategic  weapons cuts in a lively exchange with Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff.  </P> <P> The discussion presaged what is expected to be one of the hottest budget  battles on Capitol Hill this year in the midst of massive change in Eastern  Europe and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> Powell testified that ending production of the radar-evading B-2 would cause  the chiefs of the military services to "make a very careful reassessment" of  the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) being negotiated by the United  States and the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> He noted that the chiefs had supported START talks in part because the B-2  could be used to take advantage of proposed rules for counting nuclear warheads  under consideration in the negotiations.  </P> <P> When Aspin asked if Congress had to fund all 132 planned B-2s for the chiefs to  continue endorsing START, Powell said he would have to check that.  </P> <P> Aspin, suggesting how far he might be willing to go beyond the 13 planes  already in the pipeline, rejoined: "Try 30."  </P> <P> "All right, sir," Powell said.  </P> <P> Aspin also asked Powell what the military chiefs would do on START if Congress  killed the truck-borne Midgetman strategic missile but retained the rail-mobile  MX.  </P> <P> Although the Administration has requested funds for both long-range weapons in  its fiscal 1991 budget, Powell said the chiefs probably could live with only  the MX.  </P> <P> Addressing Powell and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Aspin asserted that  "change is outracing both our government's arms control proposals and the  defense budget you have put before us.  </P> <P> "There are new realities in the world but no new thinking at home to match  them."  </P> <P> Aspin and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), who spoke separately with  reporters, predicted that the House would substantially cut President Bush's  $295.1-billion defense request, especially proposed spending on strategic  weapons and troop levels in Europe.  </P> <P> Foley called recommendations for heavy increases in spending for the MX,  Midgetman and the "Star Wars" anti-missile program "highly questionable in  today's environment."  </P> <P> At the House hearing, Aspin led a parade of Democrats and Republicans sharply  challenging Cheney's proposal to close 43 military bases -- including 10 in  California -- and to consolidate or realign scores of others.  </P> <P> In the roughest treatment dealt Cheney all day, Aspin questioned his former  House colleague's reputation as a "smooth operator" and warned: "You've got to  play this thing a little less confrontational if you want this to happen."  </P> <P> The committee chairman said Cheney should have done what his predecessor, Frank  C. Carlucci, did in moving to close bases two years ago: propose having a  bipartisan commission develop the list. Congress eventually approved the  closing of 86 bases.  </P> <P> Aspin suggested that Cheney wants to use his new hit list as a political club  to intimidate lawmakers, especially Democrats, who seek to cut Bush's defense  budget.  </P> <P> Although some bases need to be closed, Aspin said, the Administration must  accept creation of a commission to oversee the process. That is the only way  Congress will pass legislation sought by the Administration to clear judicial  obstacles blocking base closings, he said.  </P> <P> Cheney, responding that he was open to the commission idea, denied that his  list was politically motivated. Aspin challenged that claim.  </P> <P> "Cheney," he said brightly but with an edge to his voice, "you remind me of  Claude Rains in 'Casablanca.' Cheney is shocked -- shocked! -- to discover that  there is politics going on in this town."  </P> <P> "No, that's high praise, Mr. Chairman," Cheney responded, laughing, "high  praise, indeed."  </P></p>

			<p>940218 FT  18 FEB 94 / Survey of Malta (3): More hub action gets to Marsaxlokk - Godfrey Grima on the development of the freeport Mr Marin Hili, chief executive at Malta's freeport corporation, summons up an impressive list of statistics to drive home Malta's success as a cargo transhipment centre. The Marsaxlokk terminal is now the third most active hub port in the Mediterranean and ninth in the region's port traffic league. From a mere 7,788 containers handled in 1988, the terminal's throughput had leapt to 288,192 containers last year. This year 400,000 containers are due to arrive from and leave to north-west Europe, the US, the Mediterranean, the Middle East, the Far East and Asia, a hefty increase in business over last year's figures. In terms of volume the terminal is the world's 65th busiest port. Even the notion of becoming the leading transhipment harbour in the Mediterranean is not enough to satisfy Mr Hili's ambitions. 'This should become a major hub terminal in Europe,' he insists. 'Everything points in that direction.' Judged against the considerable gains that the sprawling customs-free container terminal has made in recent years, the prediction sounds plausible enough. 'The key is to remain efficient and reliable. Depressed international cargo markets made no significant impact on our growth - if anything the recession gave us a chance to compete and time to develop and equip ourselves. When the world's major economies pick up again we shall be in a much stronger position to offer rival ports stiff competition,' Mr Hili insists. For centuries Malta's prosperity has been firmly latched to the fortunes of the world's seafaring nations. Situated at the gateway to the eastern and western Mediterranean and lying half way between Europe and Africa, Malta is one of the world's oldest trading posts. In developing a container terminal from where cargo could be shipped to its final destination by smaller feeder vessels the Maltese have succeeded in realising a notion that was first mooted by the Knights of Malta in the 16th century. With shipping producers now depending on speed, efficiency and an economy of scale for their profits the idea of a hub operation which is relatively close to volume port destinations makes more sense. What makes hub ports an attractive proposition are the many logistical gains they offer: there is the advantage of cutting down on port calls; of reducing voyage time; of netting shorter transit times by switching east and west bound services over one port facility; of freeing fleets and providing them with the opportunity to concentrate on profitable voyage legs; of accessing into north European markets via Mediterranean ports and north African markets by using relay services for small volumes. For example, a switch of operations by a Far East - Northern Europe operator to divert cargo through Mediterranean ports to Marsaxlokk would save up to 10 days on each voyage. The point is not lost on regional and round the world operators who have come to accept the Malta terminal, built at Marsaxlokk, on the island's south coast, as an efficient interface. Malta's position on the Red Sea - Strait of Gibraltar sea lane axis makes it cost-effective for cargo to be transhipped over Marsaxlokk. Maersk of Denmark, P and O container line of the UK and Sealand, the US shipping company, for example, currently operate a service from the US east coast to the Middle East, transhipping North European bound cargo at Marsaxlokk without diverting their voyages. Bulcon, the Bulgarian shipping line, another regular client, runs a service from Varna, the Bulgarian port in the Black Sea to the Middle East transhipping Europe-bound cargo from Malta. Big shipping lines also find Malta a profitable base from which to organise their transhipment operations. Norasia, the Swiss line, closed down its Pireaus operations four years ago and came to Malta. Malta's freeport terminal was conceived and partly built by the socialist administration in the mid-1970s. On taking power in 1987, the Fenech Adami administration set up a freeport corporation headed by Mr Hili, who left the family shipping business. Quayside and stacking areas were upgraded and the quay on terminal one was lengthened and equipped with efficient quayside and landside cranes. As a result, the terminal now accommodates and handles any size of vessel and takes 4,446 container slots. Several support services were set up to make the terminal increasing autonomous. A permanent training school for freeport employees was established with the transport college of Rotterdam: a marine department provides pilotage and safe navigation, tug boat and mooring services, and keeps harbour traffic under control: another company is in charge of coastal engineering works. Equally successful has been the setting up of an oil terminal in which Oil Tanking, one of the world's three largest oil storage organisations with facilities in Europe, Houston and Singapore has a majority shareholding. The outfit will this year double its oil storage, bunkering and blending facilities to 175,000 cubic metres. What makes the terminal particularly successful is the fact it is an independent terminal, is based close to international shipping lines and can accept large volumes of liquid cargo. Financially, the freeport nets Malta an appreciable Dollars 20m a year, excluding income from the oil terminal. With cargo traffic in the Mediterranean on the increase, plans have been drawn for a second state-of-the-art terminal whose first phase is expected to be commissioned by 1996. This will double the Marsaxlokk terminal's capacity to 1m containers. 'The building of a second terminal shows how confident we are in our future. We know the market: it is growing and we're going for it,' Mr Hili remarks. His one elusive task remains convincing Japanese lines to start transshipping at Malta. 'That's a difficult question to answer. But it is not for lack of trying, he admits. Malta's container terminal owes its success to several bold and wise decisions. Investment, which in the end are likely to exceed Dollars 500m appear to have been timely. Targets seem to be realistic. What also accounts for the terminal's popularity is the long stretch of industrial peace that Malta has enjoyed for decades. Mr Hili is first to admit that the unions' support has helped guarantee that port workers are weaned away from outdated port practices without trouble.</p>

The four men, accused of having participated in the attack  against General Augusto Pinochet in 1986, are in Santo Domingo  Prison, tensely awaiting official notification of their pardon.  They were pardoned yesterday by President Aylwin, a decision  about which they have not yet been officially notified.    [Begin Alberto Espinoza, lawyer for the pardoned inmates,  recording] I know nothing besides what has been published in the  newspapers or broadcast on radio. This morning I spoke with  Justice Ministry officials, and they did not tell me anything  about the resolution. [end recording]    The four inmates pardoned by the president are Hector  Figueroa, Oscar Ordenes, Hector Maturana, and Miguel Angel  Colima, the latter having been sentenced for participating in  the attack against the Los Quenes Police Garrison in 1988. The  four men could travel to Belgium, but this has still not been  confirmed.    The Army is distressed, Army Deputy Commander Lieutenant  General Jorge Lucar said upon learning of the president's  decision to pardon the terrorists who participated in the attack  against Gen. Pinochet.    [Begin Lucar recording] Our institution is distressed in  light of the sacrifice, the murder, of four of its members and a  Carabinero. We are faced with a presidential decision, and the  Army will always obey the decisions of the government, without a  doubt. [end recording]    [Begin Brigade General Fernando Torres, Army prosecutor  general, recording] Regrettable. The more so when we all know  the manner in which these people acted. It was a premeditated,  open attack. Armed Forces men were murdered in cold blood. It  was a frustrated attack against the president of the Republic,  which is a very serious thing. [end recording]    Regarding the moment chosen by the president of the Republic  to grant the pardon, Gen. Torres said:    [Begin Torres recording] It took him a long time because he  had doubts for some time about the fairness of this decision.  [end recording]</p>

Designation of a security as a PORTAL security permits the security to be assigned a CUSIP number by Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation and be cleared and settled through the Depository Trust Company. Section 2 of the PORTAL Rules permits any PORTAL participant to submit an application for security designation, rather than the issuer of the security. ``PORTAL participants'' include PORTAL dealers, PORTAL brokers, and PORTAL investors. The first two categories of PORTAL participants are required to be brokers and dealers registered with the Commission under Section 15 of the Exchange Act and members of the NASD. The third category of PORTAL participants are institutional investors that are not members of the NASD that meet the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer'' under Rule 144A. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

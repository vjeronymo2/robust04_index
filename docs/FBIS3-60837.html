O you who belonged to the movements of the companions [not  further identified] and owned this land for more than 500 years.  [passage omitted]    O brothers, the Westerners made a terrible mistake when they  insisted on turning the Lockerbie problem into a political  issue. If they had thought, if they had learned from lessons,  they would not have fallen onto that dangerous, slippery path.  They should have left the Lockerbie case a purely legal issue.  Then they might have been able to try the suspects, to save  their shameless faces. They might have been able to avoid the  pothole they have fallen into if they had not made it a  political issue. [passage omitted condemning France for  following U.S.]    We are prepared to engage in battle with the imperialists.  We held up the olive branch, asked for friendship, asked for  understanding, asked for a peaceful settlement, asked for mutual  reconciliation and asked for friendship and amity to prevail  between the peoples, yet, the colonialist and imperialist  circles are bent on confrontation and clashes. We are for it.  We are prepared. O America, O France, O Britain, we are  prepared for the confrontation. We are prepared to clash.  [passage omitted]    We reject any infringement of our sovereignty, any harm to  our citizens and any violation of our national law. Libyan law  is above the law of the United Nations. Libyan law is above  international law, because it concerns Libya's sovereignty and  its right to live freely on its territory. [passage omitted]</p>

That is, of course, provided  that the new parliament does not begin its own activity by  revoking all the accomplishments of its predecessor, and  provided that the newly constituted government does not shatter  to smithereens the delicate little porcelain bridge which has  just recently connected Ukraine with the world's financial  whales. In the opinion of Serhiy Osyka, deputy minister of  foreign economic relations and trade, there are two realistic  ways to introduce a sound monetary unit--a quick way and a  slower but more durable way. The choice must be made now.    [Vorontsova] Serhiy Hryhorovych, to what extent was the  question of forming a stabilzation fund under the hryvnya roused  from its slumber during the latest visit by the president of  Ukraine to the United States? It is certainly a well-known fact  that this problem has been under discussion in the IMF  [International Monetary Fund]....    [Osyka] Indeed, this question has been worked on for several  years now; without a sound currency it is impossible to carry  out an effective economic reform. The requirements set forth by  the IMF are directly tied in with the need to restore our money  to good health: in its volume a stabilization fund of whatever  currency must not exceed the value of a country's imports during  a period of three to four months. In and by itself, our decline  in production is forgivable, but its sum-total was a bit too  much. The stabilization fund can be formed along various lines.  It can be done not only by enlarging and increasing our exports,  but also by changing their quality. Because Ukraine, of course,  Ukraine is not merely a traditional producer and supplier of  metal. If--thanks to joining GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade) and signing a memorandum on cooperation with the EC  [European Communities]--our high-tech goods (helicopters,  rockets, and space satellites) can be introduced onto the world  market, our state's hard-currency funds will grow sound very  soon indeed. And that would also apply to the stabilization fund.    [Vorontsova] And so it could be said that the absence of a  sound currency in Ukraine has brought about not only the  economic crisis, but also the lack of appropriate international  documents. Without the latter even the best Ukrainian items will  not see the world any farther than our republic-level center for  exhibits and fairs. Isn't that correct?    [Osyka] That's the way matters stood until very recently. A  breakthough occurred literally during the last two months--first  and foremost, after the change in the American policy with  regard to Ukraine as a result of Kravchuk's signing the  trilateral declaration in Moscow. Work is now proceeding on the  preparation of credits from the IMF--something which we have not  succeeded in obtaining for almost two years now. The first few  steps have been taken toward cooperating with the Americans in  the high-tech field. In and by itself alone, the launching of  commercial satellites would bring in billions of hard-currency  units within a very brief period of time. This change in the  stance taken by the United States has likewise brought about a  new policy with regard to Ukraine on the part of the "Big Seven"  states. It has also evoked interest from the countries of  Southeast Asia--countries which have very good future prospects  and which are developing at a tempestuous pace. Prospects are  opening up for the introduction of new credit lines and for  expanding our own trade possibilities by means of selling abroad  those items which we were unable to sell previously because of  certain political and legal obstacles.    [Vorontsova] But the domestic economic situation in our  state  has remained unfavorable: The reforms are marking time,  privatization has just begun, and one hears complaints from  economic experts to the effect that inflation is being warded  off by artificial means....    [Osyka] I would not assert these things so categorically.  Where do you get the idea that we don't have privatization? And  what about the housing fund, and even available housing? And  what about the leasing of enterprises, many of which often are  converted into properties owned by the collectives involved? But  the only realistic remedy against inflation is to increase the  mass of goods. It can be increased in two ways. The first is  calculated to take a 10-year period: This involves modernizing  and renovating our production facilities, as well as  restructuring the economy itself. The second way is faster: It  solves the problems by political and legal methods--via  privatization, when a certain quantity of goods of the requisite  commercial quality have appeared on the market. The money supply  would then form a kind of enclosed circle or loop and be full in  the financial sense. Such a method would ensure an abrupt  stabilization of the monetary system. Money would be put to  work, and other motivation for persons to work would begin to  appear.    [Vorontsova] In emphasizing the prospects for the political  and legal way, you indicated that cooperation with GATT and the  EC would be on a new basis....    [Osyka] Until Ukraine becomes a member of GATT, it will be  confined by numerous tariff barriers and administrative  restrictions from selling its own best goods. After we have  joined in this agreement, we will become a full member of the  world economic space. Certainly, new problems will continue to  arise. For example, lowering our import tariffs will further  exacerbate the position of those enterprises of ours which turn  out products which cannot compete with better ones from abroad.  But we simply cannot go on subsidizing such enterprises. GATT  has 117 members. It is not just a club for the great trading  "whales," but also contains 2/3 of the countries with  transitional types of economies--a category to which Ukraine  likewise belongs. The GATT mechanisms provide for a balancing of  interests between large, small, developed, and almost backward  countries.... As to the prospects for cooperation with the EC, a  system of versatility would be set up, i.e., the attitude toward  our products on the market would have to be the same as for  those economic entities of the EC member-countries. At the  latest round of talks with the EC there was a discussion of  possible cooperation between the Ukrainian National Space Sgency  and the European space agencies.    [Vorontsova] Wouldn't that aggravate our mutual relations  with Russia?    [Osyka] No. Because, of course, both GATT and the EC have  worked out precise mechanisms for regulating the relations in  the free-trade zones and the customs unions. Russia itself will  join GATT quite soon, and if we lose time, we could remain an  outsider in relations with our Eastern neighbors.</p>

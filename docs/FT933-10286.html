			<p>930805 FT  05 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Asian air cargo set to soar ASIA is likely to experience the fastest growth in air cargo traffic over the next 17 years, according to a forecast yesterday from Boeing, the world's biggest aircraft manufacturer, writes Daniel Green. By the year 2010 Asian markets - including links with Europe and North America - would account for half the total air freight market, Boeing said. But profit margins for freight operators will continue to decline as larger aircraft and competition cut costs and prices. Revenue per tonne-kilometre, the standard unit of measurement in the airline industry, fell 7 per cent in 1992 and will slip by 1 per cent a year on average until 2010. In volume terms, the world air freight market will grow at an average of 6.8 per cent a year until 2010. Cargo will grow far faster than passenger traffic, which Boeing estimates will increase 5.4 per cent a year over the period.</p>

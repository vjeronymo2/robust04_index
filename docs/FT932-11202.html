			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / International Company News: Reader's Digest shares drop 13% SHARES in Reader's Digest, the New York-based magazine publisher, fell by 13 per cent yesterday on disappointing revenues and flat operating profits. On Wall Street, the shares closed down Dollars 6 at Dollars 40 1/2 , their 52-week low. Operating profits were up only 2 per cent at Dollars 137.6m in the third quarter to March 31, on revenues 3 per cent ahead at Dollars 737.6m. Net income was 5 per cent higher at Dollars 95.5m. The company said revenues would have risen 8 per cent without the impact of foreign exchange rate movements. International revenues rose 10 per cent and would have risen about 19 per cent without foreign currency movements. Revenues from US operations fell 6 per cent to Dollars 307.6m due to lower sales in the domestic Books and Home Entertainment Division. Mr George Grune, chairman and chief executive officer, said: 'This quarter's lower results stem from an increasing number of product offerings in a relatively short time frame. Our testing indicates that these offerings could have been better implemented.' Mr Alan Gottesman, an analyst with PaineWebber, said the US Books and Home Entertainment Division had been 'pushing too hard, with products competing with each other'. But he added that the problem was now 'as bad as it is going to get'. Mr Grune said there were continued strong advertising sales for Reader's Digest magazine and the company's special interest magazine group. Magazine revenues rose 2 per cent to Dollars 173.5m for the quarter, reflecting higher subscription prices and increased US advertising revenues. The company also announced a programme to repurchase up to 3m class A non-voting common shares after a similar programme in February 1992. It has about 97m of the shares outstanding.</p>

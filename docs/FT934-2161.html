			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Yorkshire confirms approach by LWT The Pounds 600m battle over the future of London Weekend Television hotted up yesterday as Yorkshire-Tyne Tees admitted formally that it had received 'a preliminary approach' from the London broadcaster. Mr Ward Thomas, chairman of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, was prompted by speculation to acknowledge the approach, which could involve LWT taking over Yorkshire and Anglia Television acquiring Tyne Tees. Under new government rules, which come into effect on January 1, one ITV company can hold two broadcasting licences but no more. Neither LWT nor Anglia would make any statement on their intentions yesterday. Granada, the television, rental and leisure group, which last week launched a hostile bid for LWT, immediately pounced on the Yorkshire admission. Mr Alex Bernstein, the Granada chairman, said the announcement meant LWT had accepted the Granada view that scale was essential if ITV was going to compete effectively. LWT shareholders, Mr Bernstein said, would be faced with a clear choice: to combine with 'one of the strongest and best managed media and leisure companies in the UK' or to combine with an ITV company 'making significant losses and burdened with high licence payments'. LWT shed 12p to close at 576p yesterday; Granada finished up 6p at 501p. The defence led by Sir Christopher Bland, chairman of LWT Holdings, will outline the thinking behind the approach to Yorkshire. The hope is that eventually LWT-Yorkshire and Anglia-Tyne Tees would be allowed to combine to form a super-region - even larger than that created by Carlton Communications' planned takeover of Central Television. Sir Christopher insisted yesterday he would never buy any company as a 'poison pill'. Granada turned its attack yesterday on any possible LWT-Yorkshire tie-up and pointed out that the combined annual bids that have to be paid to the government for Granada and LWT amounted to Pounds 16.6m or 5 per cent of the two companies advertising revenue. With LWT-Yorkshire the figure would be Pounds 45.3m or 16 per cent of advertising revenue.</p>

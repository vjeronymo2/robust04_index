			<p>920218 FT  18 FEB 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: World sugar market 'at the crossroads' THE WORLD sugar market is at the crossroads, forcing many producers to review their sugar policies in the light of changing international trade patterns, the Gatt, and other trade liberalisation issues, according to the latest sugar report from ED &amp; F. Man, the London trade house. Should the Gatt talks be successful, cuts in support mechanisms by 1999 'should accelerate the fall in the EC's net exports as marginal producers fail to cover their average production costs. The same argument applies to some of the high cost/less efficient producers in the US.' This will open up new opportunities for many producers in Africa and the Caribbean, but they will need to examine their long-term cost structure and efficiency. Man points out that under preferential access to the US and EC markets, their production costs and efficiency deteriorated to the extent that some have failed even to meet their quota allocations. The increase in international trade will not, however, increase the transparency of the market. The uncertainty of Russsia's effective imports, Cuba's exports and the pattern of trade elsewhere in eastern Europe have 'turned the clock back some 40 years to a time when information about import demand and export availabiltiy was lacking'. Meanwhile sugar prices - which recently fell below 8 cents a lb - are expected to come under further pressure as exportable surpluses come on to the market from Brazil, Cuba, Thailand and the EC.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 22 KYODO -- Finance Minister Hirohisa  Fujii said Wednesday [22 June] he will take firm action against  the dollar's downslide while keeping close contact with other  Group of Seven industrialized nations.    Fujii was asked for comment on the dollar's tumble below 100  yen at one point for the first time in the postwar period in New  York overnight.    Describing the dollar's dip below 100 yen as rapid and  speculative, Fujii pointed out that it will have a negative  impact not only on the Japanese economy but also on the global  economy.</p>

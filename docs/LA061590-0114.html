			<p><P> June 15, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> SILENCE SPEAKS ELOQUENTLY IN 'TO SLEEP SO AS TO DREAM'  </P> <P> Kaizo Hayashi's "To Sleep So As to Dream," which screens Sunday at 7 p.m. at  LACMA as part of Japan Week L.A., is pure enchantment, a tribute to the beauty  and power of the silent cinema that is as knowing as it is affectionate. Except  for sound effects, snatches of music and some ominous tape-recorded messages it  is silent itself.  </P> <P> An elderly lady, Madame Cherry Blossom (Fujiko Fukamizu), whom we learn was a  silent actress, is watching in her home a 50-year-old serial -- in which she  was the heroine -- called Princess Bellflower. Just as the masked samurai hero  is to reveal his identity the film breaks. Her butler (Yoshio Yoshida) -- and  onetime director -- hires a pair of naive young detectives (Shiro Sano, Koji  Otake), saying that Bellflower has been kidnaped by M. Pathe &amp; Co.  </P> <P>  Their investigation takes them to such quaint locales as the General Jintan  Tower, the Flower Star Wheel and eventually the Electric House, an Asakusa  movie theater, where Pathe just happens to be presenting Madame Cherry  Blossom's serial, "The Eternal Mystery." "To Sleep So As to Dream" is set in  the late '50s -- when, incidentally, Hayashi, was born; how the Electric Dream  happens to be still operating can be chalked up to the movie magic that blurs  fantasy and reality and which its writer-director celebrates with such  imagination and precision.  </P> <P>  Madame Cherry Blossom proves to be a benign Norma Desmond whose own devoted  Max Von Mayerling wants to help recapture her youth in the most innocent and  loving way possible. "To Sleep" is at its most touching when expressing the  silent cinema's unique potential for pathos. On another level, Hayashi is  having some gentle fun with early detective serials of the kind pioneered and  epitomized by Louis Feuillade's fantastic "Fantomas" and "Judex."  </P> <P> As for why Hayashi, who will introduce "To Sleep So As to Dream" (Times-rated  Family), chose to make his 1986 feature debut with such a film, he has said  that "This is the origin of the motion picture; there is a sobriety (to  black-and-white silent cinema) which refuses anything which is not enjoyable."  </P> <P> Also screening (at 7:30 p.m. at the Pacific Design Center Theater) as part of  Japan Week L.A. are "The Discarnates" (Monday) and "Buddies" (Tuesday).  Nobuhiko Obayashi's "The Discarnates" connects with our deepest longings in a  remarkably potent fashion. Who, after all, has not yearned for reunion with  long-gone loved ones? Not only does Obayashi and his writers make such an  encounter convincing but also give it a larger purpose; the result is a  graceful, heart-tugging fantasy of the supernatural. The film's hero (Morio  Kazama) is a dapper, 40-year-old writer of TV soap operas; like the detectives  in "To Sleep" he too encounters the past in an old Asakusa theater.  </P> <P> Shown recently at the Little Tokyo Cinemas, Yasuo Furuhata's "Buddies" exudes  such a warm, sentimental glow that it's easy to overlook its subtlety and  complexity, both as a consideration of the sometimes thorny nature of  friendship, and beyond this, the treacherousness of nostalgia. The time is the  spring of 1937, just before the Rape of Nanking, a prelude to wartime madness.  Ken Takakura is wonderful as an industrialist who has an unrequited love for  the beautiful wife (Sumiko Fuji) of an oafish office worker, his army buddy.  </P> <P> Admission is free but reservations are required: (213) 627-6217.  </P></p>

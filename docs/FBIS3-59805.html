			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Marc Yared: "The French Target"--first paragraph </F> is JEUNE AFRIQUE introduction]    [Excerpts] Algeria. The kidnapping of three Foreign Affairs  officials was a carefully planned political and military  operation. A turning point in the Islamic armed struggle. Paris  is on the front line. [passage omitted]    In fact, there is every indication that the kidnapping of  the  three French officials was a large-scale, carefully planned  political and military operation. The banning of the Islamic  Salvation Front [FIS] eighteen months ago, and the ruthless  repression of its militants disoriented the "bearded brothers."  Although dissensions are far from being overcome, the era of  armed-struggle "professionals" and political strategists is  approaching.    The kidnappers, who claim to belong to the GIA [Armed  Islamic  Group], operated in closely watched areas dotted with military  roadblocks, areas that had been under tight police control for  months. They kept their victims in the Oued Koreiche district of  Algiers, close by the Ministry of Defense and not far from the  government palace. For four days, from 26 to 29 October, the  masterminds of the operation led secret negotiations with French  emissaries, including one Foreign Affairs diplomat. Then, in a  communique sent to Western press agencies, they announced the  impending release of the hostages.  <H5>  Scapegoat </H5>   The Islamist operation was spectacular, all the more so  because it crowned a series of attacks against foreigners,  carried out within one month, in every corner of Algeria, by the  GIA or the related GUD (Jihad United Group).    What is the reason for this general anti-European, and above  all anti-French offensive? Paris is not just the traditional  scapegoat of Algerians of all persuasions, or the natural target  of the "bearded brothers" who claim to be the heirs of the  anti-French mujahidins of the fifties. The xenophobic outburst  is not just an easy answer to the extreme violence used by  Algerian authorities: widespread use of torture, summary  executions, over 100 death sentences. As in Egypt, the hunt for  foreigners is also the result of an Islamist strategy of  economic war, which attempts to deprive the Algerian State of  most of its revenues. Islamists know that foreigners who work in  Algeria play a key part in the economy.    But French-Islamist disagreements are also political. Even  the most moderate Islamists, such as the former chairman of the  FIS foreign relations commission, Rabah Kebir, blame French  officials for their "aggressiveness and provocative talk," which  contrast with their formerly more balanced behavior.    This political protest of the "bearded brothers" does not  explain everything. The kidnappings and negotiations of October  1993 were overseen by the two most extremist trends in the  Islamist nebula. These trends have special reasons for attacking  Frenchmen and foreigners. To begin with, the GIA was born of the  al-Takfir Oua El-Hidjra (Repudiation and Renunciation)  organization created in 1971 on the banks of the Nile by  engineer Choukri Mustapha. Before his execution, the latter had  already specialized in the kidnapping and assassination of  personalities such as the former Egyptian minister of religious  affairs, Shaykh Dahab. Back in 1974, the very clandestine  al-Takfir Algerian branch already disseminated tracts denouncing  "the impiety of society" and advocating the use of armed force  to institute an Islamic State. Ten years later, the movement was  one of the first in the Arab world to systematically send its  militants to Afghanistan, to be trained in armed struggle. After  that, al-Takfir took part in the October 1988 and summer 1991  riots before joining the FIS.    Until January 1992, al-Takfir supporters controlled the  En-Nour mosque in Algiers and recruited adherents in two  working-class suburbs east of Algiers, Beni Merad and Ben Zerga.  Then, under the name of GIA, al-Takfir organized underground  groups in Batna, Sidi Bel-Abbes, and Qoleiya. According to the  authorities, it is responsible for most of the assassinations  and holdups perpetrated in Algiers and Blida. Before being  killed in an ambush, Omar el-Eulmi, founder of the Islamic Labor  Union, who had become the GIA's "spiritual leader," issued a  fatwa (religious opinion) authorizing the assassination of  intellectuals, journalists, police officers, and State  employees, including women and older people. It was this fatwa  that cost the lives, among others, of writer Tahar Djaout and  psychiatrist Mahfoud Boucebsi. In addition, the GIA's  second-in-command, Abdelkader Hattab, wrote a brochure whose  title says it all: "Slaughter and Murder, Until Power Belongs to  God."    Based on this reasoning, foreigners were doomed to become  targets in their turn, sooner or later. For instance, the  seven-member GIA commando armed with Kalashnikov machine guns,  who attacked the home of the German Junger family on the night  of 13-14 October, had for mission to warn all Western  communities to leave Algeria within eight days, under penalty of  death.  <H5>  An Outstanding Strategist </H5>   There is a striking similarity between certain methods of  al-Takfir-GIA and those used in Lebanon by the Khomeynist  Islamic Hezbollah-Jihad during the eighties. Both handle  hostages as bargaining counters. Both kidnap and/or assassinate  foreigners not just to punish and deter Western States believed  to be hostile to the Islamist cause, but also to discredit the  local government, to assert that they cannot be ignored, and to  negotiate the release of imprisoned militants. Also to extract  material benefits.    Affinities between the Lebanese Hezbollah and the Algerian  al-Takfir do not stop there. The militants of both organizations  have close links with Iran, which is said to finance them  generously and to train some of their commandos in southern  Lebanon. Was it out of consideration for Tehran that the GIA  Islamists did not manhandle the Junger family--one week after  the Iranian minister of intelligence, Ali Fallahian's official  visit to Germany? On the other hand, do you know that several  Iranians, including one relative of President  Hashemi-Rafsanjani, are still held in French prisons because  they were involved in the assassination of antikhomeinist  personalities, in Paris and in Switzerland?    Other Algerian Islamist leaders asserted themselves on the  occasion of the kidnapping. They included, in particular, Said  Mekhloufi who, in April 1992, was appointed "military affairs  coordinator" by several separate armed groups. A former  lieutenant and chief editor of the FIS daily EL-MOUNQUID, who  organized the departure of Algerian volunteers to Iraq in 1990,  Mekhloufi is an outstanding military strategist.  <H5>  God's Sword </H5>   His supporters, al-Baqun 'ala al-'Ahd (Those Faithful to the  Oath), often disguise themselves as police commandos, wearing  bullet-proof vests and masks to hide their faces.    Said Mekhloufi is the only war lord to maintain cordial  relations with all Islamist leaders: former FIS president Abassi  Madani and his children Salmane, Ikbal, and Okba; "General"  Abdelkader Chebouti and Imam Ali Benhadj; the "moderate" tandem  consisting of Rabah Kebir and Mohamed Said, who control Islamist  information; and finally the GIA "emir," Mourad Si Ahmed, also  known as Djaafar Seifallah (God's Sword).    Whereas Mekhloufi is in a good position to direct the course  of the armed struggle in the field, his alter ego, Kamreddine  Kherbane, another former officer, deploys the external network  of the movement.  <H5>  Pack Up and Leave, or Die </H5>   Helped by his brother in arms from the Afghanistan  guerrilla,  Hadj Boudjemaa Bounoua, by the venerable Shaykh Abdel Baki  Sahraoui, and by Djaafar el-Houari, president of the Algerian  Brotherhood in France [FAF], Kherbane already succeeded in  supplanting the FIS "moderates" in France. He got in touch again  with the French authorities, who had expelled him in August  1992, and he actively contributed to the release of the French  hostages. Without a doubt, the Mekhloufi-Kherbane tandem, which  has connections with a powerful international Islamist network,  will carry much weight in determining the future of Algeria and  its relations with France.    How far can the power struggle between GIA extremists and  Paris go? A process of deterioration, similar to what happened  in Lebanon, cannot be ruled out. The message that the GIA left  next to Michele Thevenot was clear: "Pack up and leave, or die.  Foreigners have one month to get out." Eventually, unless  Algiers and the "bearded brothers" miraculously reach an  agreement and unless the imprisoned Islamist leaders are  released, the departure of the 10,000 or so French expatriates  appears unavoidable. Just like in Beirut not so long ago. They  could be followed by tens of thousands of Algerians belonging to  the intelligentsia, who feel threatened. The wealthiest have  already bought apartments or restaurants on the banks of the  Seine or on the shores of Lake Geneva. Worse still: like the  Lebanese war in the past, the Algerian armed conflict may move  to the other side of the Mediterranean. Djaafar el-Houari  himself acknowledged that much in an interview published in LE  FIGARO of 29 October: "Uncontrolled elements show increasing  exasperation. They may want to strike at targets in France."</p>

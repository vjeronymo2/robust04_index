This type of commodity  represented 27.4 percent (101,980 million korunas [Kc]) of the  overall volume. The percentage of industrial consumer goods  also increased, by 0.5 percent. On the other hand, in the  structure of exports, the percentage of food products declined  by 1.8 percent and fuels and raw and processed materials by 1.1  percent. The Federal Republic of Germany was the largest  importer of our goods; it imported 26.9 percent (Kc100,137  million) of the overall volume of our exports, which amounted to  Kc372,301 million. In 1992, our exports to Germany amounted to  only 4,321 million Czechoslovak korunas. Germany is followed by  the Slovak Republic, with 20 percent, and Austria, with 6.2  percent. The fastest growth last year was recorded in exports  to Egypt, China, and the United Kingdom.    The percentage of plant and vehicles imported was also  different; however, it declined by 3.1 percent. Overall, the  amount of plant and vehicles imported amounted to Kc131,297  million korunas, which is 35.8 percent. On the other hand, the  amount of industrial consumer goods imported increased by 3.3  percent. The amount of food products imported was roughly the  same as in 1992. The value of food products and live animals  imported, expressed in an absolute figure, was Kc22,863  million--that is, 6.2 percent of overall imports, amounting to  Kc366,359 million. Fuels and lubricants had an 11.4-percent  share in Czech imports, and other raw materials had a  5.1-percent share. The Federal Republic of Germany is also our  most important partner in the case of imports; some 25.1 percent  of our imported goods come from there. It is followed by  Slovakia (17.7 percent) and the former Soviet Union (11.5  percent). Imports from Canada, Hungary, and Taiwan increased  most.</p>

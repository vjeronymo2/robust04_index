			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Yekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow March 29 TASS -- "The party, now being formed  on the basis of the Democratic Russia movement, will be closer  to the centre of the political scale than the party that is now  being set up by Yegor Gaydar on the basis of the `Russia's  Choice' movement, which will sooner be liberal-conservative,"  co-chairman of the Democratic Russia movement Lev Ponomarev told  ITAR-TASS.    In Ponomarev's opinion, efforts to guarantee the social  protection of the population will be the main distinction of the  Democratic Russia party. The Democratic Russia movement has  still not officially announced its reorganisation into a party.  However, the decision of the latest plenary meeting of its  council of representatives to draw up lists of movement members  should be regarded as a step in this direction. The question of  whether to set up a party or not will be decided by the  movement's congress. It was decided to leave unchanged the  principle of collective membership and the status of supporters,  not wishing to be registered as official members, until the  convocation of the congress. The regional organisations of the  Democratic Russia movement will independently decide on the  extent of their participation in the formation of local party  cells.    Ponomarev makes no bones of the fact that this decision was  prompted by Gaydar's initiative to set up a party. The  movement, set up about three years ago, has for a long time  provided massive backing to the Russian reforms. It campaigned  in one bloc with the "Russia's Choice" during the recent  elections. Nevertheless, Democratic Russia has still not been  offered to become part and parcel of Gaydar's party, which, in  Ponomarev's opinion, would have been quite natural.    "We have given altruistic support to the Gaydar government  for a very long time and have even backed his shock therapy  idea. However, both they and the leadership of Russia as a whole  have failed to do the main thing -- explain to the nation the  essence of the ongoing reforms. They also forgot to guarantee  the social protection of the Russian citizens," Ponomarev said,  assessing the looming split between the two previously main  allies of the democratic camp. However, he stressed that  members of the Democratic Russia movement still wished to rally  all the democrats, including the "Russia's Choice",  "Yavlinskiy-Boldarev-Lukin", "December 12", and the Democratic  Russia parliamentary factions.    Time will show whether these former allies will become  rivals  or not, and how effective the movement will be in its new form.  In the meantime, only about one thousand people have signed up  as members of the Democratic Russia movement during the few days  of registration in ten municipal constituencies. According to  Ponomarev's assessment at least 40-50 thousand Russians may join  the new party.</p>

Features  France's only remaining town crier. Appears nightly, leading visitors by  lantern light through the cobbled alleyways of Turckheim. You enter Turckheim  through 800-year-old gates. Shops, restaurants, a museum. Try for a room at the  Hotel des Deux Clefs. A medieval setting with timbered walls, leaded windows.  Public rooms feature classical melodies. This is a former coaching stop. In  winter, guests dine by a fire in the lounge. Meals in summer are served in the  garden. The town crier emerges precisely at 9 each evening from a guard house  near the entrance to Turckheim. Crowds join him in his march through the  village.  </P> <P> For brochures, write to the French Government Tourist Office, 9454 Wilshire  Blvd., Suite 3030, Beverly Hills 90212, or call (900) 420-2003 (50 cents per  minute).  </P> <P> River Cruises: In these recessionary times, travel bargains remain. America's  former Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union, will be offering seven-night  cruises on the Volga River in '91 for only $499 per passenger. Trips will be  between Moscow and Kazan, with visits to five ports. Dneiper River cruises are  even cheaper ($399) aboard the MS Glushkov, one of the flagships of the Soviet  River Fleet. Outside cabins, picture windows. Excursions by private motor coach  at each port of call. English-speaking guides. These cruises can be tied in  with post-cruise visits to Leningrad.  </P> <P> Your travel agent or Rivers of Russia, 1601 Industrial Way, Suite 195, Belmont,  Calif. 94002, (800) 552-3032.  </P> <P> New York Taxis: We still get complaints occasionally from disgruntled travelers  who are unhappy with New York taxi drivers. Particularly cabbies serving JFK.  If you feel you've been taken out of your way, report the driver by calling  (212) 221-TAXI. Note the medallion number on the cab's roof, on the outside  passenger door or dashboard. At the same time, jot down the driver's number  (also displayed on the dash).  </P> <P> Here are some sample fares from JFK into Manhattan: $30/$35 to Upper Manhattan,  $25/$30 to Lower Manhattan, $28/$30 to the Bronx, $18/$21 to Brooklyn, $16/$18  to Queens. Tolls are extra and tipping, while optional, is expected. Be sure to  ask for a receipt that contains the cab's medallion number. Remember also that  meters automatically read $1.50 at the start of the trip from JFK. In addition,  a 50-cent toll charge is added between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. The starter who calls  your cab at the JFK terminal will hand you a yellow slip. Keep it in case of  problems.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Reader Recommendations  </P> <P> California -- Lowel and Sabine Parode, Palos Verdes Estates: "There cannot be a  better way to discover the Napa/Sonoma wine country than with Fred Byers of  Vineyard Ventures, P.O.

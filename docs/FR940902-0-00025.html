			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Of all the consultations and comments the Department has received, about half expressed interest in having the Department be more detailed in the regulations, and the other half indicated that the Department was being overly prescriptive in the interim final rule and preferred that the Department provide minimal guidance. The Department reminds readers of these regulations that the JTPA Amendments create more restrictive operational and programmatic requirements in order to address a series of issues that had been identified in connection with JTPA. The Department has sought to strike a balance in these final regulations in terms of guidance and prescriptiveness. In some regulatory areas, such as some of the administrative requirements, the Department has carefully specified requirements to set a strong foundation for program integrity so that in other regulatory areas, such as program design, there can be more flexibility and emphasis on outcomes. Finally, the Department has sought to make these regulations sufficiently clear, so that all parties with an interest in JTPA understand both the requirements and the areas of flexibility in the program.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This final rule is not a stand-alone document; the companion document is the JTPA, as amended. In several instances, however, portions of the Act are repeated to make the final rule user-friendly and to facilitate its use as a reference tool. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the 1992 JTPA Amendments, the Clean Air Act, section 4467 of the Defense Authorization Act and the NAFTA Worker Security Act impacted on title III of JTPA. The final regulations in 20 CFR part 631 provide for limited revisions to existing title III regulations as required by these statutes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> There were a number of comments on specific areas of performance standards and related reporting requirements. On July 11, 1994, the Department published separately in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the final performance standards for PY 1994 and PY 1995. The Department appreciates the issues raised by commenters on the interim final regulations in the area of performance standards and has taken these comments into account in developing the performance standards. In addition, on June 23, 1994 the Department issued Training and Employment Information Notice 5&hyph;93, Change 1 with the revised reporting instructions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department also plans to issue separately revisions to the regulations for title IV, part A, the Employment and Training Programs for Native Americans and Migrant and Seasonal Farmworkers. When it does, the contents of the regulations as reflected herein may change. The Department has issued revised regulations for title IV, part B, the Job Corps. (58 FR 69098 (December 29, 1993)).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Format of These Final Regulations <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The structure, organization, and enumeration of the JTPA regulations have been revised to accommodate the Amendments. Throughout this document, unless otherwise stated, ``JTPA'' or ``the Act'' refers to the Job Training Partnership Act, as amended (29 U.S.C. 1501,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> et seq. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ); ``Department'' or ``DOL'' refers to the U.S. Department of Labor; and ``Secretary'' refers to the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor or the Secretary's designated representative(s). As used in these final regulations, the term ``title'' refers to a title of the Job Training Partnership Act, unless the text specifically refers to another statute. The terms ``section'', ``part'', and ``subpart'' refer to a section, part, and subpart, respectively, of these final regulations, unless the text specifically refers to another document.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As specified at PART 626_Introduction To The Regulations Under The Job Training Partnership Act, part 627 applies to all programs under titles I, II, and III of the Act, except where noted, and part 628 generally applies to title II programs. Parts 629 and 630 are reserved for future use. Part 631 continues to apply to title III programs and part 637 has been revised for the title V Jobs for Employable Dependent Individuals (JEDI) program. Therefore, various sections that previously appeared in parts 627, 628, 629, and 630 have been redesignated to parts 627 and 628.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

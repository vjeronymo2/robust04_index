			<p>931012 FT  12 OCT 93 / Observer: Party time for Brunner Manfred Brunner, former chef de cabinet to Martin Bangemann, the senior German commissioner, had been attending a machine tool trade fair in Frankfurt when his sniping at the process of European union came to the attention of Helmut Kohl back in Bonn. 'I attacked the Maastricht treaty saying it was against the constitution because it held democracy in contempt,' he recalls. 'I was told I could not say anything else, or I would lose my job.' So he signed a call for a referendum in Germany, and sent a copy to Bangemann with his letter of resignation. Today marks the culmination of his campaign, as the constit-utional court in Karlsruhe decides on his legal challenge to the treaty. He is certainly out of pocket for his efforts. While the challenge to the court costs nothing, he has had to find some DM100,000 for legal opinions, not to mention the loss of his Brussels job. As leader of the minority Free Democratic party in Bavaria for several years in the 1980s, Brunner is used to being a loser. But if he does not get his way in court, he will not necessarily give in. Watch out for a new political party, probably the 'D-Mark party', that would campaign in next year's European parliament elections. Given that 71 per cent of the German population said they did not want to swap the D-Mark for the Ecu, at the last count, could he be on to a winner at last?</p>

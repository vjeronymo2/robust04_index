			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Interest-free family loan I PROPOSE to give a member of my family an interest-free loan to enable her to purchase a flat. Will this have any tax repercussions for either me or the recipient? On the bare facts, the practical answer is no. You should write offering her the loan, repayable on demand, with a copy for her to sign and return to you. You may wish to consider (or to discuss with your solicitor) the situation which might arise if you were to die before the loan is repaid.</p>

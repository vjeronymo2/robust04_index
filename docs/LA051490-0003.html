The officer ordered him to drop  his weapon, a .25-caliber automatic handgun, but the suspect fired two rounds,  both of which hit the officer, Cohen said.  </P> <P> The officer returned fire with a 9-millimeter handgun, Cohen said.  </P> <P> Nead suffered a superficial gunshot wound to his right forearm, a spokesman for  UC San Diego Medical Center said. He also suffered a gash in his right forearm  and may have dislocated his shoulder, Cohen said. He was reported in good  condition.  </P> <P> Police said Nead, who was arrested at the scene when backup officers arrived,  was to be booked on suspicion of attempted murder, armed robbery and auto  theft.  </P></p>

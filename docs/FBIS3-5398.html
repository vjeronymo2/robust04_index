			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Answering a question put by a KCNA reporter about  the controversy between the United States and South Korean  authorities over the abrogation of the National Security Law, a  DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman said today:    Recently, the United States expressed its official position  calling for the abolition of the National Security Law in South  Korea.    Several days ago, U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State  Hubbard, speaking at a university of the United States, held  that South Korea's National Security Law must be scrapped.  Afterward, Secretary of State Christopher stated that this  demand was not a personal view but an official position of the  United States.    As the world knows well, South Korea's National Security Law  is a fascist law that defines the North as an "anti-state  organization" and prohibits free dialogue and exchange between  the North and the South and is an offspring of the military  dictatorship.    The successive military dictatorial regimes of South Korea  have harshly suppressed the South Korean people, fostered  North-South confrontation, and obstructed national reunification  by invoking the anti-communist fascist laws such as the National  Security Law under the patronage of the United States.    Those in the so-called civilian regime in South Korea have  trampled underfoot human rights and obstructed reunification and  dialogue so recklessly that even high-placed officials of the  United States have called for the abrogation of the National  Security Law.    The Kim Yong-sam regime is branded as a civilian fascist  regime because it keeps the National Security Law intact. And  it is also due to the National Security Law that the  multi-channel dialogues and exchange between the North and the  South were foiled without progress in the past and many South  Korean people were put into prison or killed for their demand  for national reunification or visit to the North. Such being  the case, the National Security Law can be termed the second  concrete wall, from a legal point of view, built within South  Korea by the South Korean authorities as high as their concrete  wall running along the Military Demarcation Line.    The National Security Law should have been abolished when  the  agreement on reconciliation, nonaggression, cooperation, and  exchange between the North and the South was adopted and  effectuated.    It is a good thing that the U.S. Administration called for  the abolition of the National Security Law, the biggest obstacle  to North-South relations, though belatedly. I think that the  call came from its understanding that the National Security Law  is one of the factors that impede the progress of the  negotiation between the North and the South of Korea.    If the North-South dialogue is to progress successfully and  if peace on the Korean peninsula and the country's peaceful  reunification are to be achieved, such fascist laws as the  National Security Law must be abolished in South Korea without  delay.</p>

			<p>941101 FT  01 NOV 94 / Arts: British fanfare for Beethoven - Concert Under orders to help promote new music, the London orchestras have each come up with their own solution. The Philharmonia has introduced a series entitled 'Music of Today' timed at 6pm before the evening's concert - a clever idea, as it can draw on a captive audience, while leaving the orchestra free to programme the standard classics in its main concerts. So far the new music seems to have been concentrated on weekends. On Saturday a reasonable number of Beethoven-lovers, gathering for the start of the symphony cycle that night, was attracted to the earlier event: three short pieces by British composers all in their mid-30s. An opening fanfare was provided by James MacMillan. Then came Mark-Anthony Turnage's jazzy romp, Release, and Steve Martland's Shoulder to shoulder, a more disciplined exercise in post-Stravinskyan rhythmic battery. Each was a useful thumb-nail sketch of its creator, though not more. None of them will have stolen the thunder from Nikolaus Harnoncourt's Beethoven cycle, which started its two-week journey that evening. For the Philharmonia, which went down in history as the orchestra that marked the Beethoven bicentenary with a symphony cycle under the revered Otto Klemperer, this was quite a jump. On the face of it Harnoncourt is the antithesis of everything Klemperer stood for: a former standard-bearer of the 'authentic' brigade, tireless in overturning accepted ideas, controversial, dynamic. His Beethoven with the Chamber Orchestra of Europe, both live here in London and on record, has made a name for itself with its drive and clarity. Teamed with the full-size Philharmonia, Harnoncourt is able to replicate the drive, but the clarity does not come so easily. The First Symphony opened with two unexpectedly thick-sounding, heavy movements. Then the scherzo and finale exploded with energy. 'Authentic' Beethoven conductors - especially Norrington - have found a Haydn-like humour in this early symphony, but as far as Harnoncourt is concerned, Beethoven bursts forth fully-formed, a tempestuous symphonic composer heading for battle. The 'Eroica' is more Harnoncourt's piece. He relishes its determination to fight until the issues are resolved. Some of the climaxes reached a high pitch of intensity. Although there were rough patches of playing, one can imagine Harnoncourt in rehearsal, knowing exactly what he wants and going over every passage until he has stamped his authority on each note. His Beethoven is entirely his own, which should make the rest of this cycle one to recommend. In that respect he is as worthy a successor to Klemperer as the Philharmonia could have found. Beethoven symphony cycle at the Royal Festival Hall in London and Symphony Hall in Birmingham until November 13.</p>

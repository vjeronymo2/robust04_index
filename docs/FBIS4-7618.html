			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Maciej Jankowski, under the "In My View" </F> rubric: "There Must Be Pressure"]    [Text] The situation is very difficult. But one must  get used to various things, including difficult situations. I  have been saying from the very beginning of the protest action  that one cannot expect spectacular victories, and that this will  be a longer process that we must patiently go through. It will  take at least several months.    All around the world, including in the United States and  Japan, the fight went on for months. That is also what will  happen in Poland. It is my prediction that the protests' first  effects will be visible in a few months, but I doubt that we  will be successful in bringing this fight to an end.    After all, there is also the issue of constitutional  provisions that we must make sure are enacted. If we want to  secure ourselves by protecting employee rights, by protecting  the rights of people who work in trade unions--and also in  various organizations--for free, that must be covered by  constitutional provisions.    We could not have waited any longer to begin the current  protests. If we were to consider a one-time protest, perhaps it  would be worth delaying the action by a month or two--that is,  until society receives the first increased electric and natural  gas bills--and then society's outrage will increase. But that  was not the issue. The fact that the scenario did not  materialize is proof of Solidarity's logical strategies, whose  goal is a wide, social aspect and not just individual interests.    Right now, everything depends on the positions that people  will adopt. More and more people are becoming aware that their  economic and social rights are in danger. But perhaps not  enough people are aware of that.    People still do not realize that they will not get anything  without a fight: They will have no guarantee of the right to  social insurance, to vacations, and to other types of benefits;  they also do not realize that they will cease to be partners [as  published]. But there will come a time when they will lose their  patience.    I was not optimistic from the beginning that our demands  would be met soon. That is because such is the practice adopted  by subsequent governments for very many years now: Specific  problems are not solved but, rather, obscured. And I can see no  reason for that situation to change.    I said during a recent rally in Krakow that this is not the  way it is going to be: We have appointed negotiators, who will  deal with the government for us. If we do not make ourselves  seen in public--in factories, on the streets, and at  rallies--the negotiators' mission will fail. We experienced  that before, for many years, not just after 1980 but also  before. There must be pressure: If there is no pressure, our  demands will remain just that and nothing else.    The trade union should work out a strategy of political  action, and special centers for substantive work should be  established for that purpose. Money must be found. What is  absolutely indispensable is to establish a bureau for economic  and social-policy analysis. We must present specific arguments  to the people--the "Mazowsze" region [of Solidarity] is devoting  1 billion zlotys for that purpose already at this point. One  must not spare money for that goal. We must also have a strong  group that would be prepared to have the trade union participate  in the mass media in order to present our arguments there. The  trade union position on every issue important to society should  be communicated.</p>

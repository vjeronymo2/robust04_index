			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Major-General Ivan Shtopenko, chief of the </F> Finance Directorate of the Ministry of Defense [MO] of Ukraine:  "The State Has Fallen Into Debt to Its Defenders"]    [Text] There have been more and more letters to the  editors in the mail of NARODNA ARMIYA lately (the content of one  of which is presented below).    "I appeal to you in the name of the employees of the  military hospital," writes trade-union member Yaroslav  Mykhaylovych Salabay. "The approach of paydays in the last few  months has caused discontent, nervousness and various types of  discussions and gossip among people. That is because no one  knows whether they will be paid the proper wages on time or not.    "Whereas the pay used to be delayed only a few days, in  September we were paid on the 18th of the month instead of the  5th or 6th. The same thing happened in October. More than half  of it went by, and the pay had still not been issued. And that  is while the latest price increases were occurring. People were  left without money, without the means of existence.    "The hospital employees have a natural question for the  finance workers: How much longer will this go on? This is a  mockery of the people. Matters have gotten so bad that the  patients are not getting food, since the hospital has nothing  with which to pay the stores..."    Letters with similar content, as you know, are being  sent to other places besides the central publishing organ of the  Ministry if Defense. Many of them have arrived directly at the  Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, so the editors of NARODNA ARMIYA  appealed directly to the Chief of the Finance Directorate of the  Ministry of Defense of Ukraine, Major-General Ivan Shtopenko,  with the request to comment on the situation that has taken  shape lately with the payment of monetary sustenance to the  servicemen, as well as wages to the employees, of the Armed  Forces of Ukraine.    The profound socio-economic crisis that has struck the state  has hit first and foremost the least well-protected segments of  the population; among whom, notwithstanding the host of  legislation that has been passed, are the servicemen and the  members of their families. The Ministry of Defense, owing to the  insufficient receipts to the state treasury, is being financed  only allowing for the available resources of the state budget.  The financial status of the Armed Forces of Ukraine remains  extraordinarily difficult and critical under those conditions.  The troops were financed in 13 increments in November alone.    But even these crumbs actually arrived at the recipients  through the banks only after delays of up to two weeks. The  National Bank made the decision back in July to strengthen  monitoring of the trustworthiness of bank documents. Wire  receipts of monetary sums (and that is how we send them to the  troops for the sake of speed) were to be confirmed by the payer  bank therein, and the funds transferred to the military units  only after the receipt of the appropriate confirmation. There  are cases where there have been good profits from dishonest  transactions.    All of this has led to the fact that the servicemen and  employees of the armed forces were paid late at some garrisons  for October--November. And it will be even harder to provide  people with the money they are due for December with this sort  of financing for the armed forces. This is intolerable. The  servicemen and employees should receive everything due to them  on time and in full.    I do not want to be less than straightforward. There are no  funds to pay for food, fuels and lubricants, or municipal and  other services, owing to which a number of military compounds  have been cut off from sources of everyday support. The  employees of the military repair enterprises, whom we are unable  to pay for repairs performed on hardware and military property,  are at the brink of a social explosion along with the military  units.    The command of the military districts and branches of the  armed forces, the chiefs of garrisons, units commanders and  certain subunits, entirely naturally, are also appealing  personally to the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine and to the  Finance Directorate to rectify the situation as soon as  possible, and provide temporary financial assistance in this  truly hopeless situation.    It must be stated that both the Ministry of Defense of  Ukraine and the Finance Directorate are well aware of the  situation that has resulted. Everything possible is being done  to eliminate the tensions in the military collectives, and to  instill order in monetary support for the servicemen and  employees of the armed forces. The Minister of Defense of  Ukraine has personally met with the highest leaders of the state  several times, and appeals have been sent over his signature to  the President of Ukraine, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet,  the acting Prime Minister of Ukraine and the chairman of the  board of the National Bank of Ukraine setting forth the  situation that has taken shape with financing for the armed  forces, and warning of the rise in social tensions among the  military and civilian collectives.    The commanders of units, the socio-psychological service and  the finance bodies are exerting a great deal of effort to  explain to servicemen that this is a temporary difficulty, but  the measures that are being implemented are not finding  understanding among the personnel, since the situation is  repeated every month. Many servicemen are filing requests for  discharge from the armed forces, since they cannot provide for  their families. Not to mention those without apartments, who are  unable to pay for their temporary spots.    As bitter as it may be to read these telegrams, what can you  do--they are the truth. I repeat once again that the Ministry of  Defense is doing everything possible to ease the situation with  the financing for the troops. It must be frankly stated that the  ministry has no money. Everything that is received from the  State Budget is sent to its recipients immediately.    The president and government of Ukraine, despite the  difficult economic situation in the country, have made a very  important and vitally necessary decision pertaining to the  social protection of servicemen and the members of their  families--to provide food rations for the servicemen of the  armed forces and their military formations created in accordance  with legislation, starting on 1 October of this year. And that  is good support for the families of servicemen in today's  difficult situation.    The pay for servicemen has been tripled overall starting 1  December. That is now the fourth increase this year.    There is thus no reason to lose faith in improvements in the  situation, both in Ukraine as a whole and in the armed forces in  particular. We are relying on the fact that the state will not  leave its defenders without assistance in this difficult time  for all the people, the more so as we are receiving proper  support on most issues from the president, the government and  the Ministry of Finance of Ukraine.</p>

			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Hospitals show wide quality differences Enormous differences in the quality of hospital services offered in different parts of the UK are revealed in the first hospital performance league tables published yesterday. In some hospitals, barely half the patients needing the most common types of treatment are operated on within a year of being diagnosed. Others manage to treat all or almost all patients in that time. Even larger variations are recorded in the numbers operated on within three months of diagnosis. In oral surgery, the worst-performing hospital treats less than one in 10 within three months. The best performers treat all such patients in that time. The league tables, covering 470 hospitals in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, are part of the government's drive to improve public services. They contain information on how well NHS hospitals and the ambulance services are meeting Patient's Charter targets. The tables give no guidance on whether some hospitals are offering better standards of medical treatment than others. Instead, they offer a range of 23 performance indicators about the way hospitals treat their patients. In some hospitals barely half of outpatients are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment. And fewer than half of arrivals in accident and emergency departments in the worst-performing hospitals are assessed by a doctor or nurse within five minutes of arrival. In the best-performing hospitals, all outpatients are seen within the 30-minute target and all casualty arrivals assessed within five minutes of arrival. The league tables for ambulance services confirm the relatively poor performance of the London Ambulance Service, which is answering only 62 per cent of emergency calls within the target time of 14 minutes. Other urban ambulance services are typically meeting the target on nine out of 10 calls. Rural ambulance services have a target time of 19 minutes to reflect the greater area they cover. Most are achieving this on 19 out of 20 calls. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, said yesterday that the tables showed improvements in overall health service performance. In accident and emergency departments, 88 per cent of patients are now assessed within the five-minute standard set in the Patient's Charter, compared with 72 per cent a year ago. For outpatients, 84 per cent are seen within 30 minutes of their appointment time - a year ago it was 73 per cent. On waiting times, more than two-thirds of patients in the gynaecology, general surgery and urology specialties are waiting less than three months for treatment. The development of day surgery enables people to go home sooner, with over half of arthroscopies and laparoscopies carried out without an overnight stay. Editorial Comment, Page 27</p>

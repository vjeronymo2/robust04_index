			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE MILKEN ARRAIGNMENT;  </P> <P> MILKEN BROTHERS PLEAD INNOCENT;  </P> <P> LAWYER SAYS DISCLOSURE OF THEIR INCOME MAY PREVENT A FAIR TRIAL  </P> <P> "Junk bond" innovator Michael Milken and his brother Lowell pleaded innocent  Friday to racketeering, securities fraud and other charges in a federal  courtroom swollen with Milken supporters and others eager to witness the  preliminary step of the history-making trial.  </P> <P> Tanned and smiling in a pin-striped suit and deep red tie, the head of Drexel  Burnham Lambert's high-yield bond operation in Beverly Hills answered "not  guilty" in a firm voice when asked how he would plead by U.S. District Judge  Kimba M. Wood. After Lowell Milken entered the same plea, Michael Milken, his  wife, Lori, and his attorneys swept down the front steps of the federal  courthouse to the cheers of dozens of supporters.  </P> <P> One shouted, "Atta boy, Mike." Others wore hats that said, "We believe in you,  Mike," in a scene that more evoked the appearance of victorious political  candidates than accused felons.  </P> <P> In an indictment handed up March 30, the brothers and former Drexel trader  Bruce L. Newberg were accused of turning the investment house into a continuing  criminal enterprise. The government has asked for the forfeiture of $1.85  billion in the case, the most important in the 3-year-old Wall Street  corruption scandal.  </P> <P> As the Milkens sped away in a limousine, defense attorney Arthur L. Liman told  reporters he was "deeply concerned" that Michael Milken would not be able to  receive a fair trial because prosecutors had "broadcast" his 1987 compensation  of $550 million in the indictment.  </P> <P> "The issue here is whether or not Michael Milken can get a fair trial  notwithstanding the fact that he has made that kind of money," he said,  contending that including the figure in an indictment was "unprecedented."  </P> <P> The figure "will be on the minds of thousands of people -- including the people  who will be jurors," Liman asserted.  </P> <P> A spokesman for Milken declined to say whether the defense plans any motions to  try to redress the effects of the publicity.  </P> <P> Newberg did not appear for arraignment because he recently injured his back  while skiing, according to his attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, who declined to say  where, or precisely when, the accident took place. Newberg is now scheduled to  be arraigned April 25.  </P> <P> While 42-year-old Michael Milken has become a familiar public figure, his  brother Lowell had succeeded until Friday in keeping his face out of the press.  Lowell bears a marked resemblance to his older brother but is several inches  shorter and has a deeper voice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Another Hearing Set  </P> <P> Wearing a gray suit, light blue shirt and blue spotted tie, Lowell Milken also  smiled and looked relaxed as he stood to his brother's left during the  10-minute arraignment. The Milkens were released on their own recognizance.  </P> <P> During the arraignment, the Milkens' wives sat in the second row of the  audience of several hundred in the courtroom.  </P> <P> Assistant U.S. Atty. John Carroll told the judge that prosecutors and defense  attorneys have made "substantial progress" toward resolving whether they will  be required to post bond during the trial. The prosecution had reportedly  earlier sought posting of a $1-billion bond to make it unnecessary for the  government to freeze the defendants' assets, as it is entitled to do under the  federal anti-racketeering statute.  </P> <P> A separate hearing will be held before Wood on Tuesday to take up that issue.  </P> <P> Michael Milken intended to make a few brief comments after the arraignment but  decided it would be "physically impossible" to do so because of the throng of  television cameramen and reporters who had waited for hours for his appearance,  a Milken spokesman said.  </P> <P> The Milkens had eluded the press awaiting their arrival by slipping into the  courthouse at 11 a.m., more than three hours before the arraignment was  scheduled. As they awaited the proceeding, they stayed in a small room next to  the courtroom, where a federal marshal stood guard to shoo away the curious.  </P> <P> Among the Milken friends on hand was Ralph Ingersoll II, chairman of Ingersoll  Publications Co., a Princeton, N.J.-based newspaper chain. Wedged between TV  cameramen and reporters as they pursued the defendants and their attorneys  outside the courthouse, Ingersoll protested, "You people are animals!"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exercising 1st Amendment  </P> <P> Among the other Milken supporters were a number of well-dressed young men and  women from the investment house. A report that federal prosecutors had  discouraged Drexel officials from organizing a demonstration in support of  Milken was untrue, prosecutor Carroll said.  </P> <P> "If they want to exercise their First Amendment freedoms, that's not our  business," he said.  </P> <P> While the Milkens are probably still not as well known to the public as another  Wall Street scandal figure, speculator Ivan F. Boesky, the arraignment drew a  larger crowd than Boesky's 1987 sentencing, according to people who attended  both.  </P></p>

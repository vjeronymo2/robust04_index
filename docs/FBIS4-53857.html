			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Michio Watanabe, former deputy prime </F> minister, by unidentified MAINICHI SHIMBUN reporter; place and  date not given]    [Text] [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Could you please tell us about  your abortive plan to leave the Liberal Democratic Party [LDP]  to seek the support of the ruling coalition in your bid to  become prime minister? What was your biggest miscalculation in  this affair?    [Watanabe] I did not make any miscalculation. I know that  this kind of attempt has only a 50-50 chance of success. I  wanted to participate in the new government, because I wanted to  translate my political ideology into reality. If my opinion  does not go down with parties in the ruling coalition, there is  no point in participating in the new government. Some people  criticized me by saying that I wanted to become a cabinet member  again to finish my political career on a high note. They are  wrong, because I have already been appointed minister seven  times. To me, becoming a cabinet member is not uncommon. So  even if the coalition had offered me the post of deputy prime  minister in the new cabinet, saying, "We cannot have you as our  prime minister, but we can offer you the post of deputy prime  minister," I would have rejected the proposal. And besides, to  speak the truth, the coalition never made such an offer.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] We understand that Rengo [Japan Trade  Union Confederation] was unwilling to endorse your bid for  premiership.    [Watanabe] Yes, I suppose it was. To be more precise, it  was the Social Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] that did not  support me. I never wanted to become the head of a minority  government. This is why I did not push my bid for the  premiership this time. In any case, Tsutomu (Hata) seemed to be  interested in taking over, so there was no reason why the  coalition parties should choose an outsider like me as their  prime ministerial candidate. I was able to form a clear view of  the situation and make up my mind very early on because I had  floated several trial balloons.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Nevertheless, the SDPJ opted out of the  ruling coalition, forcing Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata to form a  minority government. What do you think of the new cabinet  lineup?    [Watanabe] This should be the best cabinet Prime Minister  Hata is able to assemble, because the ruling coalition does not  have many people capable of assuming government posts. The new  cabinet is controlled by the Shinseito-Komeito bloc. If the  Hata administration wants to pursue policy goals similar to  those pursued by the LDP, it has to proceed humbly. If not, it  will be short-lived. There is a limit to the tolerance that  will be shown the high-handed tactics of Shinseito [Japan  Renewal Party] Secretary General Ichiro Ozawa, whose principal  objective is to wreck the LDP.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think Mr. Ozawa is now placed in a  difficult situation?    [Watanabe] As I did not see him in person, I do not know  exactly what is happening. But I think he should be reflecting  on his conduct, because it is now clear that, like Nobunaga Oda  [feudal lord known for his high-handed attitude toward  administrative matters], his approach no longer works every time.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What should Mr. Ozawa do in order to get  out of his current difficulties?    [Watanabe] Shinseito was formed defectors from the LDP. It  bears a different party name, but it is identical to the LDP in  substance. Shinseito professes to be an advocate of political  reform. However, all the Shinseito leaders were once at the  center of LDP power as members of the faction controlled by Shin  Kanemaru. Although they are not in a position to criticize the  LDP, they are saying that the LDP is absolutely wrong. So, the  LDP and Shinseito are hostile to each other. Relations would be  a lot better if Shinseito leaders thought much more about the  nation rather than being full of themselves: 80 percent of their  work should be directed toward the conduct of state affairs, and  less than 20 percent in looking after the interests of their  party or in contriving strategy.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What are the chances of such an  improvement?    [Watanabe] I am not sure, but Shinseito should at least try,  because the LDP has decided to take a case-by-case approach to  the government's policies. For instance, the ruling coalition  can now work out a bill to expand the role of the Self-Defense  Forces and submit it as a government-sponsored bill, because the  SDPJ, which is opposed to this kind of legislation, bolted from  the Hata administration. The LDP would probably not oppose such  a bill in the Diet. At least, it is certain that I will support  it. I cannot oppose something that I agree with. I think many  LDP members share my view on security issues.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think many LDP members also share  your view on tax reform?    [Watanabe] Well, it is not easy to find an LDP member who  has the same view as me regarding tax reform. However, there  will be some.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Is the LDP going to judge each of the new  government's policies by comparing it with its own policy  platform?    [Watanabe] Yes, because this is exactly what party politics  should be, and because it is not logical for the LDP to  emotionally reject what it used to advocate while in power. The  only problem will arise if there is conflict within the LDP  between "genuine members" and "unauthentic members."    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] The opposition parties possess the  numbers to pass a motion of no-confidence in the prime minister,  because he heads a minority government. Will the prime minister  dissolve the lower house for an election, or will he ask his  cabinet to resign?    [Watanabe] The odds are 50-50.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think that the next general  election will take place under the old electoral system of  multiseat constituencies?    [Watanabe] That is the problem. The Diet has already passed  a package of political reform bills that call for the  implementation of a single-seat electoral system. The question  is whether a bill to divide the nation into single-seat voting  districts will clear the Diet smoothly. I do not think such a  bill will be enacted during the current Diet session. It is not  possible. And if the next general election is held under the  old electoral system, whether the political reform legislation  would be reversed is another question. The SDPJ would probably  strengthen its power by winning about 100 seats.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Do you think it inevitable that the next  general election will be held under the old electoral system?    [Watanabe] There is no other possibility if the prime  minister is forced to dissolve the lower house at an early stage.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] What about the possibility of him getting  the cabinet to resign en masse?    [Watanabe] Well, I don't know, but if the Hata  administration were to collapse, the reins of government would  be restored to the LDP. I do not think the reins of government  can be handed over from one coalition member to another  coalition member by prearrangement three times in a row. If the  Hata cabinet were to resign en masse, a regular procedure of  constitutional government would be the restoration of the LDP  rule. It would be quite normal to hand over the reins of  government to the largest political party in terms of number of  Diet members, namely the LDP. However, although the LDP is the  largest party in the Diet, it only has 200-odd seats in the  lower house. It will, therefore, have to join hands with other  parties to form a new coalition government. The search for a  coalition partner will certainly cause big trouble. If the LDP  were to join forces with the SDPJ to form a coalition  government, once again the new cabinet would not be able to  govern effectively, because of the difference in policies. In  any case, the LDP would lose its influence, because the casting  vote would always be held by the SDPJ.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] Does this mean that either the SDPJ or  the ruling coalition should split?    [Watanabe] Which side should break up, the LDP side or the  non-LDP side? That is the question.    [MAINICHI SHIMBUN] How do you assess Tsutomu Hata as prime  minister?    [Watanabe] Mr. Hata has a fine personality, and he seems to  prefer politics of consensus. However, he will certainly find  himself in a very difficult position, because there are so many  pressing problems confronting Japan, and because circumstances  will not allow him to maintain a noncommittal attitude toward  these issues. I wonder how far a gentle person such as he will  be able to paper over the difficulties.</p>

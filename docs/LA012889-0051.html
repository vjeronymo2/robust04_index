			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WRITER FAILS TO SEE ALL DIMENSIONS OF SUPER BOWL  </P> <P> In Monday morning's Super Bowl wrap-up, Bob Oates describes Joe Montana as "the  greatest come-from-behind quarterback the game has known."  </P> <P> Fame is fleeting.  </P> <P> How soon we forget!  </P> <P> Montana is great at performing last-minute heroics, but certainly he is no  better at beating the clock than Baltimore's Johnny Unitas. Unitas had Raymond  Berry to throw to, but Berry is no Jerry Rice.  </P> <P> FRANK FINCH  </P> <P> Temple City  </P></p>

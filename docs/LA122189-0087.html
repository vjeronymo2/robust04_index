			<p><P> December 21, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD;  </P> <P> RECYCLING PROGRAM BEGINS  </P> <P> West Hollywood has begun the first part of a long-awaited recycling program,  with the second phase scheduled to begin shortly after New Year's Day.  </P> <P> The city has placed six large bins in central areas where residents can drop  off aluminum, glass, paper and soft plastic containers for recycling. In  addition, single-family homes will be able to set out recyclable material for  curbside pickup after the new year.  </P> <P> The City Council worked for years on the issue, and some members hope a  successful program will pave the way for an even more comprehensive approach.  </P> <P> "The step I am anxious to take is a little more difficult. I hope the next  stage will include on-site pickup at apartments and condominiums as well," said  Councilman Paul Koretz.  </P> <P> Koretz said the council will wait to see how the new program works before  expanding it.  </P> <P> Under the program, only single-family homes are included in curbside pickup on  garbage collection days. The majority of West Hollywood residents live in  multiple-unit buildings and will be able to use the centrally located  collection bins.  </P> <P> The bins are located in the parking lot at 8878 Sunset Blvd.; West Hollywood  Park; the Center for Early Education at 563 N. Alfred St.; Plummer Park; City  Hall, 8611 Santa Monica Blvd., and at the ARCO gasoline station, 8020 Santa  Monica Blvd.  </P></p>

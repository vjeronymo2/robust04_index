			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 3 May (MTI) -- The first freely elected  Hungarian parliament in forty years, convened on May 2, 1990,  ended its work on April 7, 1994, after 378 days of sessions. In  this time, deputies passed 432 laws that created and expanded  the framework of a democratic law-governed state, continued the  creation of a social market economy, and accelerated the  emergence of capitalist property relations.    One of the most important laws passed, regulated on  compensation, as a result of which 670,000 people acquired about  one-third of the arable land, and two-fifths of the forests.  The minority law ensures extensive personal, cultural, and  administrative autonomy to the ethnic and national minorities  that account for about one-tenth of the Hungarian population.    Under the 1989 electoral law approved in the former system,  176 of the 386 deputies in the single-chamber Parliament were  elected from individual constituencies, 152 from regional lists,  and 58 from national lists.    An electoral majority made it possible for the conservative,  Christian parties to form a government. The ruling center-right  coalition, first led by Prime Minister Jozsef Antall, then,  following his death in December 1993, by Prime Minister Peter  Boross, initially consisted of 165 deputies of the Hungarian  Democratic Forum (MDF), 44 deputies of the Independent  Smallholders+ Party (FKGP), and 21 deputies of the Christian  Democratic People"s Party (KDNP). The opposition parties were  the liberal Alliance of Free Democrats (SZDSZ) with 94 deputies,  the liberal Federation of Young Democrats (FIDESZ) with 22  deputies, and the Hungarian Socialist Party with 33 deputies.  Apart from these six parties, seven independent deputies also  won seats. (The proportions changed significantly over the four  years, the government majority was reduced to a minimum, the  number of independent deputies rose fourfold, and new party  groups were set up.)    There were very few professional politicians among the 358  men and 28 women deputies, but very many with higher  qualifications: 244 deputies had had professional careers, 80  scientific careers, 20 were entrepreneurs or farmers, and only  10 were from the former political elite. As regards their  former occupations, 33 deputies were researchers, 27 lawyers, 22  hospital doctors, 21 company managers, 20 journalists, 17  university professors or secondary school teachers.    In order to increase government stability, the two strongest  parties agreed with each other at the end of April, 1990, on the  principles for a partial amendment of the Constitution, which  was approved by deputies. The parts of the amendemnt which  affected Parliament were the election of the President by  deputies (Arpad Goncz has been President of the Republic since  1990), and that the scope of authority of the president extends,  under certain conditions, to the dissolution of Parliament.  Parliament elects the prime minister, the president appoints  the ministers on the proposal of the prime minister. An  absolute majority (50 percent of deputies plus one vote) is  needed to elect a prime minister, or for a no- confidence vote  against him. A constructive no-confidence motion (supported by  one-fifth of the deputies, also having to include the name of  the new prime ministerial candidate) can be submitted only  against the prime minister.    The legal measure in force lists 20 basic institutions and  basic rights for which qualified, two-thirds majority is needed  (that is votes from two-thirds of the deputies) to amend them.  These include changes to the Constitution, making peace  agreements, and declaring war or states of emergency.    These created the unique features of Hungarian  parliamentarism, which shifted the focus of legislation from the  English model to the German "chancellorship" model. With the  two-thirds majority laws, the Constitution also ensured  legislative rights to the opposition. Apart from the general  principle of government accountability, parliamentary control  also includes a reporting obligation for the government and  certain of its ministers. However, with the introduction of the  conservative no-confidenc vote, the government can be  overthrowin only through the person of the prime minister. A  characteristic element in preparation of laws is that the role  of parliamentary groups is greater than that of parliamentary  committees. However, the House rules provide extensive  opportunities for control by institutionalizing questions to the  prime minister and ministers, political debates, contributions  before the session, and submitting amendment proposals.</p>

He  said that the policy towards countries situated east of Poland  should focus on developing good relations with those which were  important from the viewpoint of Polish political and economic  interests and Polish security.    Olechowski stated that the countries of special interest to  Poland were Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic states, Moldova  and Kazakhstan.    "We want the climate of our relations with Russia to warm  up," the minister told senators. He added that the desired  openness and friendliness of relations with Russia would depend  on whether Russia respected the strategic option of the Polish  foreign policy, ie. Poland's striving to join the European  Union, NATO and the Western European Union. Olechowski added  that the neo-imperial option in Russian foreign policy had to be  regarded as a real threat.    He said the independence of Ukraine was of strategic  importance for Poland. "We will act in favour of Ukraine's  acquiring a position in international relations reflecting her  potential," said the minister.    Olechowski also voiced support for the process of uniting  the  west and the east and stressed that by taking part in the  Partnership for Peace initiative Poland not only strove for NATO  membership, but also wanted to cooperate with Russia, Ukraine,  Belarus and Lithuania.    The minister announced Polish support for the development of  market relations and democracy in the countries east of Poland.  He said he would appoint a commissioner for eastern policy and  propose that the government establish a council for eastern  policy.</p>

			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Inflation up slightly in Italy during August ITALY'S inflation rate rose by 0.1 per cent in August, the lowest monthly increase since 1986. The figure suggests that Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's government will be able to meet its target of an annualised rate of 4.5 per cent this year. Last week Confindustria, the industrialists' association, maintained that the annualised rate at the year-end could even be lower than envisaged by the government. But a recent report from Salomon Brothers was more cautious, predicting a rate of 5 per cent, reflecting in large measure the continued impact of devaluation. The August figure reflects the depressed state of the economy. Normally in August restaurants, bars and hotels as well as food shops tend to raise prices. This year prices have either been held or reduced. According to a report released yesterday, restaurants saw their custom fall by 30 per cent last month and 13 per cent lowered their prices. At the same time many stores discounted goods in sales. The other important factor in gradually pulling Italy's inflation rate into line with that of its main EC partners is that pay lags inflation by as much as 2 percentage points.</p>

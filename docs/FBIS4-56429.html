			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Chamber of Deputies' human rights committee  is alarmed by the numerous acts of violence perpetrated in the  country. The president of this committee, Deputy Edmonde  Supplice Beauzile, particularly emphasized the incidents that  occurred in Borgne and Raboteau. She denounced these acts as  serious affronts to human rights and launched the idea of  forming an independent investigation committee to identify the  perpetrators. National Progressive Revolutionary Party of Haiti  Deputy Edmonde Supplice Beauzile also deplored the poor means at  the disposal of the human rights committee to carry out an  investigation.

			<p>930731 FT  31 JUL 93 / High crime risk for small business SMALL BUSINESSES run a far greater risk of becoming a target for crime than individuals or homes, a Home Office study of crime prevention schemes has shown, Charles Batchelor writes. The study found that 40 per cent of burglary victims suffered a second burglary within 12 months, and 48 per cent of 're-burgled' businesses suffered a third burglary. There was widespread concern among owners of small businesses - up to two thirds were 'worried or very worried' about becoming victims of crime. The study, which looked at small businesses in Hartlepool, Lewisham in south-east London, Nottingham, Salford, Sunderland and Wirral, recommends a seven-point plan for crime prevention. This includes closer co-operation between businesses in High Street Watch schemes, more help from large companies and better collection of data to identify patterns of crime against small business.

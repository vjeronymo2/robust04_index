			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lordships resist breath of fresh heirs THE House of Lords last night struck a blow for tradition and against equal opportunities by rejecting a proposal which would have given hereditary peers the choice of passing titles to their daughters instead of their sons. On a day when apparently immutable parts of the UK's constitution were in flux, peers decided by 60 votes to 33 to block a backbench bill that would have given an hereditary peer the option of nominating his eldest daughter, rather than his eldest son, as heir. The bill was proposed by Lord Diamond, who said the present 'discriminatory practice' should not continue. Opposition to the bill was led by Lord Denham, a former government chief whip and himself an hereditary peer. He argued that it would be unfair to eldest sons who already had the expectation of succeeding to a peerage. The Duke of Norfolk said that the bill would mean 'interfering with history', while Lord Mowbray and Stourton, whose peerage was created in 1283, said that most people thought of a family line as the male line. 'The male line of inheritance ought not to be disregarded.' A number of those against the bill said they were not anti-feminist, but were opposing it because they feared it would divide families.</p>

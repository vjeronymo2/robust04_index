			<p>920926 FT  26 SEP 92 / A tender trap for Our Man in Berlin: For a decade, the East German secret police watched Leslie Colitt's every move. His newly-opened file reveals a tale of suspicion, treachery - and farce SHE WAS raven-haired and dark-eyed, as attractive a woman as I had ever seen in Saxony, a region extolled for its beautiful maidens by no lesser connoisseur than that old philanderer, Goethe. Her name was Beate and I first met her when she was scrubbing the hallway of her Leipzig flat. She gazed at me, her pretty features twisting into a scowl. 'What do you want?' I explained that the accommodations office for journalists had given me her registration card and that I needed a room for a few days. She grudgingly obliged and her mood gradually improved. A few years later when I was visiting the city, we became friends, swapping criticisms of the East German Communist authorities and discussing the rise of the Solidarity movement in Poland. We visited the Falstaff restaurant, where her enticing gaze - and a prodigious amount of drink  - soon took effect. We returned to her flat, and I succumbed to her charms. BEATE was a Stasi informer. Every word we exchanged, every move I made, was dutifully reported to the East German secret police. My thoughts, business trips, meetings, indiscretions; all - except, as I later discovered, that fateful night in the Falstaff in 1981 - were added to the voluminous file the Stasi was collating on 'Caesar', alias Leslie Colitt, the Financial Times' Berlin-based correspondent for East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary since 1972. I was suspected of enough anti-socialist crimes to land me behind bars for years if the authorities so desired. Only now, poring through the newly-released two-volume, 278-page file kept on me for more than 20 years by the Ministry of State Security of the German Democratic Republic, do I realise how dangerous the Communist security police thought I was. I was code-named 'Caesar' in the early 1970s when I was placed under OPK, Operative Personal Control (surveillance). I was pursued by a secret police organisation numbering 100,000 officers and more than 200,000 informers. Yet in spite of the terror the Stasi aroused, the omnipresent eyes of the 'shield and sword of the Party' are now revealed to have been extraordinarily, appallingly near-sighted. My file, released by the German Federal Office Administering the Stasi Documents, shows that I was suspected by the secret police in Berlin, Prague and Budapest of 'hostile and subversive activities in obtaining information', of 'influencing the political underground' and 'other forms of state crimes.' The files say my reporting for the FT was 'negative-defamatory.' Like its Soviet model, the Cheka, the Stasi saw treason and counter-revolution lurking everywhere. It believed I was a probable spy for an 'imperialist' intelligence agency. At the time I tried not to worry about surveillance, as I was busy fighting battles to obtain visas and interviews with political officials. I thought anyone - including the Stasi - could discover virtually everything of importance I knew simply by reading the FT. Now, even though the Stasi is dead, I find I am strangely flattered and repelled by an informer's remark that: 'he is self-assured, always friendly and modest' - and a border controller's comment after searching me: 'He was very well-groomed, clean and modernly dressed.' For some years the surveillance was relaxed but I came under intense scrutiny again after the rise of the Charter 77 civil rights movement in Prague. In January 1977 I spent two emotion-charged weeks in Czechoslovakia interviewing Charter's first spokesman, the ailing Professor Jan Potocka and its founder, Vaclav Havel. Potocka died a few weeks later after interrogations by Czechoslovak STB security officers. On my return by train to Berlin in February I was searched by Czechoslovak border officials at the Decin crossing point. All 90 pages of my notes and my tapes were confiscated, in spite of my protests against this violation of the Helsinki Accord. I spent the night under East German custody in the Mitropa restaurant at Dresden railway station. In this bizarre setting, interrupted only by occasional Soviet military policemen, I managed to reconstruct the notes of my conversations with the dissidents. STB never forgot the prominence my case was given by the Western media. Since I am a US citizen, the State Department protested to Prague. The secret police in Prague warned the Stasi, which issued 'search number 222959' and ordered that I be watched by the counter-espionage branch whenever I entered the eastern sector from my office in West Berlin. My file says: Excerpt from a report by HA II under General Gunter Kratsch: '17 December 1982: Unofficial indications suggest that Colitt has access to information of the most internal nature on the economies of the European socialist states and CMEA (Comecon). Our experts estimate they could only be surreptitiously obtained. Furthermore, we understand that the British secret service uses Colitt's articles as a basis for gathering further information.' Kratsch was arrested only last month on charges of directing senior Stasi agents in the West who betrayed top-secret West German and Nato defence documents to East Berlin and Moscow. I was amazed to discover that several years before I was accused of being a probable spy, the Stasi's powerful espionage wing, HVA, led by the legendary General Markus Wolf, had unleashed a swarm of IMs - informers - on me. They were to gather as much information as possible to see whether I could be used in East Germany's interest. But this plan failed ignominiously. The files reveal that the chief IM, code-named 'Bertram,' lied outrageously to the Stasi officers about the success he claimed to have had in gaining my confidence. General Wolf, who was also deputy Stasi chief under the aged Erich Mielke - himself on trial in Berlin - faces similar prosecution. Meanwhile, he is confined to his flat less than 1km from where I am writing this in my office in east Berlin. 'Bertram' and all the other informers who reported on me each had a weakness which the Stasi was able to exploit - they could not escape. Yet, perhaps because they were forced into it, they were often filing information of amazing triviality: 16 March, 1978, 11:28am - 'Caesar' goes to ticket window 20 (of Leipzig railway station) where he buys a ticket to Erfurt. 11:44am - 'Caesar' buys a packet of biscuits from a wagon and again proceeds to platform 11. 11:47am - 'Caesar' enters express train Krakow-Eisenach, car no. 34 and walks through several cars before taking seat in non-smoking section of car 28. 11:52am - 'Caesar' departs on the express train for Erfurt. 14:09pm - 'Caesar' leaves express train at Erfurt main station in direction of exit. Along the way he throws a plastic bag in a refuse basket. After approx. 15 metres he turns, walks back to the refuse basket, and removes from it the plastic bag he previously threw away.' This was analysed to be a clever means of 'control' on my part to check whether I was being followed. In reality, I had not a clue that I was being shadowed and merely thought I had forgotten something in the bag. Unknown to me, on that particular trip to Erfurt I walked into one of the most dangerous situations of my years in the East. This is what my Stasi tail reported: 14:30pm - 'Caesar' enters Burgerhof restaurant but leaves although there were empty tables. He (14:32pm) enters the Winzerkeller restaurant opposite and sits down at an empty table. 'Caesar' orders a Margon mineral water without flavour and one portion of chicken hearts. 14:50pm - a Lieutenant of Air Defence Command enters and approaches 'Caesar's' table to ask if there is a seat empty. He is given code-name: 'Himmel' (sky). 'Himmel' sits down and they begin to converse. The conversation gets livelier and more intense. They drink several cognacs and 'Himmel' also has several beers. The following words of their conversation could be overheard: ' . . . political instruction, bill of sale, show exit pass at the gate . . .' In fact, my Stasi tail appears to have seriously misunderstood our conversation or wilfully made up these fragments in order to advance his promotion to a desk job. The officer, tall, uniformed and in his mid 20s, at first assumed I was an East German. He told me about his father, who had served with the Wehrmacht in Italy, and believed it was 'Italian cowardice', not the Wehrmacht's fault, that Italy fell to the Allies. When he discovered that I was an American he became uneasy. We shook hands and parted strangers. This chance encounter, which the Stasi thought virtual proof of espionage, almost got us both arrested. My file reveals that a tail was put on this hapless officer after we departed. 'Himmel' drank several beers and liquor on the train to Leipzig where he got drunk in the railway station restaurant. At 8:20 pm he was joined at his table by two 'female persons.' At 11 pm 'Himmel' bought a bottle of Sekt which they drank and at 11:45pm 'Himmel' bought a box of chocolates at the bar. Just after midnight 'Himmel' and the two ladies took a taxi and vanished. The report ends by giving 'Himmel's' real name and unit which, however, were blackened out in my copy of the file. Only after prolonged investigation was 'Himmel' cleared of the suspicion of being a spy. I was then returned to the status of suspected agent. By September 1980, however, the Stasi was forced to concede that 'until now this suspicion could not be hardened.' The Stasi pulled out all the stops for my twice-yearly visits to the Leipzig Fair, where I always lived with private families who were officially permitted to rent to Westerners. One of them, Frau M, a teacher with whom I shared many insights on the Communist system, gave exhaustive information about me to a fulltime informer. She could hardly have refused, as she, like hundreds of thousands of other East Germans, was listed by the Stasi as a GM, or 'Social Contributor'. Besides, her son was in prison - she was in no position to turn down a Stasi 'request' to turn informer. What she told them was essentially true: 'He told my husband that after visiting the Akademixer cabaret he asked young people what they had personally gained from detente. They replied only that they were still unable to travel where they wanted.' She described interviews I had conducted among private tradesmen and shopkeepers in her neighbourhood and my questions to her about the hard currency the repairmen demanded. I was also particularly interested in 'heavy machinery', she asserted, with gross exaggeration. When I visited Frau M last year I found a personal tragedy. She had joined the many losers of German unification for which she had demonstrated in Leipzig in 1989. Her son was free but had lost his job, while she was rapidly sliding into economic poverty and ill health. By the late 1970s my surveillance by the Stasi attained new heights of intensity and absurdity. Leipzig, 6 September, 1978 - 2.24pm - After getting off the tram he walked purposefully to Fair building 17. 3:16pm - 'Caesar' left the above-named exhibitor and walked to the snack stand next to the Fiat exhibit. He bought roast chicken and stowed it in his bag. 3:36pm - 'Caesar' left Fair stand 4 and went to the toilet for about five minutes. It was at that time that I first met Beate. She told me she had attended one of the GDR's only schools for classical Greek and Latin. She was employed as a German-Russian translator; her flat had belonged to her father. She was divorced and had a small son. We swopped experiences about Russia and Eastern Europe and parted as friends but no more. I returned to stay with her two years later, in 1981, after assignments in Poland reporting on the rise of Solidarity. I told her about the exhilaration of being in the midst of a revolution which I was convinced would sweep to victory in Poland and of Communism in Eastern Europe. By this time she had probably applied to leave East Germany and was told by the Stasi that she stood a chance only if she became an informer. She reported on my every move. Intentionally or not, she managed to relay to the Stasi the message that Solidarity was going to prevail: '18 March, 1981 - 'Caesar' has close contacts with the Solidarnosc trade union movement in Poland and had several interviews with Walesa. He also has extensive ties to the intelligentsia and to the unions in key factories whose names were not revealed. 'Caesar' is convinced that Solidarnosc will prevail. Large numbers of Communists (Party members) have deserted to the union. According to him Poland is virtually a free country. She also reported that she was with 'Caesar' in the Falstaff restaurant until 11:30pm - but of the events later that night, there was nothing. We met again by chance last year with her parents in Leipzig during a demonstration against east Germany's economic collapse. Beate told me she had married and joined her husband in Belgium, where she was working as a translator. Did she get out with the help of the Stasi before the Wall was opened in November 1989, I wondered. 'It's awful what is taking place here,' she remarked. 'This is not what we demonstrated for in 1989,' her father said, sadly. I looked at Beate, but she lowered her gaze. My Stasi file was closed and sealed on October 9 1985 for lack of evidence.</p>

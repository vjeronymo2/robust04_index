			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by A. Hayane: "The Former FIS (Islamic Salvation </F> Front)  in Germany: Close to 200 Militants"--first paragraph is EL WATAN  introduction]    [Excerpts] [passage omitted] All Islamist organizations in  the world have a pied-a-terre in the Federal Republic of  Germany. In fact, this country has long been a favored meeting  ground for these organizations, to hold their conventions,  seminars, and conferences. Due to their very "official" nature,  these activities are widely tolerated by German authorities.  [passage omitted]    Turkish and Iranian extra-Islamist ties in Germany--which  remains one of the main destinations of the ayatollahs' agents  in Europe-- are also very strong within the Turkish community,  by far the most imposing and one of the oldest in the country;  numerous and very- well-organized fundamentalist networks were  created already a long time ago.    As a rule, they are the ones who provide financial and  material support to their Algerian "brothers," members of the  former FIS [Islamic Salvation Front], who reach Germany through  France or Italy.    Since the state of emergency was declared in Algeria in  February 1992, close to 9,000 Algerians are said to have applied  for "political asylum" with German authorities. Some are genuine  militants of Abassi's party; most of the others are just young  black-market traffickers or illegal aliens taking advantage of  the Bonn government's generosity toward militants of the  Islamist party to try and settle in the country. Many succeed  with various degrees of luck, with the complicity of some very  lenient officials.    Actually, Germany is said to number now close to 200  Algerian Islamist fundamentalists who are genuine activists, and  therefore dangerous. As these militants of the banned FIS settle  and travel, they seem to favor the area extending from  Alsace-Lorraine (France) to Belgium and Germany. They settle,  among other places, in the towns of Neunled, Kaiserlautern,  Stuttgart, and Mannheim.    Rabah Kebir, who was just forbidden by German authorities  to engage in any subversive political activities or statements  against Algeria, lives in Soest, near Dortmund. There, he was  allowed full latitude to engage in subversive activities until  he was called to order.</p>

			<p><P> September 22, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> 3 NOBEL JUDGES QUIT OVER PANEL'S REFUSAL TO PROTEST RUSHDIE THREATS  </P> <P> Three members of the Nobel Prize selection committee for literature have quit  over the body's refusal to speak out against threats to British author Salman  Rushdie, but the committee has refused to let them go.  </P> <P> Novelists Kerstin Ekman and Lars Gyllensten submitted their resignations to  Sweden's Academy of Letters with a third member, Werner Aspenstrom, Thursday  night.  </P> <P> Academy Chairman Sture Allen said the resignations could not be accepted. "The  work will go on. Members serve for life so we cannot grant their resignation  requests," he said.  </P> <P> Iran's late leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, called on Muslims  worldwide to kill Rushdie for blasphemy against Islam in his book "The Satanic  Verses." Rushdie has been forced into hiding by the threat.  </P> <P> In March the 18-member Academy issued a statement deploring attacks on freedom  of speech but failed to mention Iran or the Indian-born author. It is the first  time since the Academy was founded in 1786 that a disagreement has been made  public. The Academy is to announce the 1989 Nobel Prize winner in literature  next month.  </P></p>

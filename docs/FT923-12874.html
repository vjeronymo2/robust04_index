			<p>920716 FT  16 JUL 92 / Finance body warns on upturn A FURTHER warning that the UK faces a slow economic recovery came yesterday from the Finance and Leasing Association, whose members last year financed more than 30 per cent of fixed investment. The FLA said its latest economic survey showed that confidence about future business conditions had declined since the general election. The survey, carried out in June, found that 55 per cent of FLA members polled expect confidence to increase over the next three months compared with 83 per cent that expected an improvement immediately after the April election. 'Post-election realism has set in and most companies now realise a recovery will be slow,' said Mr Tony Mallin, deputy chairman of the FLA. However, he added: 'Members have noticed some signs of revival in investment and long-planned projects are now getting under way.' The association said the most promising areas for investment activity financed by leasing were in the small and middle ticket ranges. Some 70 per cent of FLA members forecast an increase in leasing and hire purchase agreements of up to Pounds 50,000 value over the next three months, while 51 per cent expected the demand for leases in the Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 1m range to rise. The FLA was founded this year to represent companies offering business finance and leasing, consumer credit and motor finance. It expects its members to have more than Pounds 30bn of new business this year.</p>

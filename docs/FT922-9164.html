			<p>920508 FT  08 MAY 92 / International Company News: Iveco expects losses to continue IVECO, Fiat of Italy's commercial vehicles arm and Europe's second largest truck maker, expects another loss this year, for the second year in succession. This follows a so-far undisclosed loss for 1991 which 'will be a lot smaller than many expect,' according to Dr Giancarlo Boschetti, chief executive. Dr Boschetti declined to elaborate on the potential size of the losses. The net profit of Dutch-headquartered Iveco had already slumped to Fl 23m (Dollars 12.7m) in 1990 from Fl 590.9m a year earlier. However, Dr Boschetti said Iveco, which built 124,000 vehicles last year and claims just over one fifth of Europe's total truck market, could have made an operating profit in 1991 but for continuing losses at its Spanish acquisition, Enasa. Iveco acquired a majority stake in Enasa, which also includes UK-based heavy truck maker Seddon Atkinson, early last year and has committed nearly Pounds 250m (Dollars 425m) to its restructuring. Speaking before Iveco's new heavy truck range, the Eurotech, makes its debut at the Hanover commercial vehicle exhibition today, Dr Boschetti said Iveco had fully expected it would take three years 'to turn Enasa round'. As part of the recovery programme for Enasa, its Valladolid plant near Madrid is being used as one of two production bases for the Eurotech range, the other being Ulm in Germany. However, Iveco has also suffered financially from adverse conditions in several markets, notably the UK. Iveco Ford Truck, which Iveco owns jointly with Ford of the US, and over which Iveco has management control, itself made a net loss of Pounds 38.6m last year, as a result of the UK truck market falling into its steepest decline since the Second World War, with sales last year falling to their lowest level since 1954. Iveco has lost 7,000 jobs in pursuit of higher productivity over the past several years, and plans no let-up in seeking further productivity gains. However, Dr Boschetti said that Iveco expected to achieve this without resorting to significant redundancies. Dr Boschetti said that it was highly unlikely that Iveco would seek further acquisitions after Enasa, had been fully absorbed. The Eurotech trucks range marks one of the final stages of a L5,000bn (Dollars 4bn) investment by Iveco over the past five years, effectively to renew its product range and update manufacturing facilities.</p>

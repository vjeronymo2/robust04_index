			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Apolinary Wojtys: "What's the Talk in the </F> Aviation Industry?"]    [Text]  <H5>  Dreams and Reality </H5>   Once Deputy Prime Minister Goryszewski was put into a  plastic  and wood mock-up of the Skorpion, set up at the PZL [Polish  Aviation Plant] Okecie. In response, a competitor from behind  the fence, the Institute of Aviation, presented the Kobra  design, with a great deal of fanfare.    Subsequently, absolutely nothing more was heard about the  Kobra, while, for the Skorpion, there were still all kinds of  offers, even at the government level. Several ministers had  apparently signed something like a "declaration of intent," but,  ultimately, (officially at the International Defense Industry  Show in Kielce), Henryk Goryszewski himself declared, with a  note of sadness in his voice, that "at least for the time being  nothing is going to happen with the Skorpion."    Everyone knows the problem is money....    Roman Czerwinski, deputy minister of Industry and Trade (as  one of the few people in government who really understand  aviation), told POLSKA ZBROJNA that additional thought needs to  be given to the question of a new Polish "battlefield" aircraft.  He also asserted, "As long as I am here, I will not allow the  plants to limit themselves to research and development work."  There is hope that a team of designers will appear who are  detached from their home plants and will take a serious interest  in this subject. The money that is reallocated to this will not  be eaten up by the factories as a whole.    It is possible that this opinion has reached other ears as  well. The reason is that the editors recently received two  invitations: the first from the Institute of Aviation, and the  second from the PZL Okecie. There was again talk of "the need to  preserve the Polish defense [industry]" and of "the need for  assistance from the government." (We do not question either  one.) A large number of urgent warnings and sounds of  disappointment (which we understand) were heard. In this entire  outpouring, however, we got the feeling that they had their feet  more firmly planted on the ground (which is otherwise  understandable from people who deal with aviation) rather than  floating around up in the clouds.    It turns out that neither the Institute nor Okecie has  stopped working on its ideas because "right now you have to make  proposals rather than just sitting around waiting for offers."  "We finance what we can from our own resources," said the  director of Okecie, Ryszard Leja. The PZL was recently visited  by representatives of a possibly interested party in the United  States, saying that there are several engines set aside for the  Skorpion. "They are waiting, as are we, for a decision."    "We are doing the work on the D-18 power plant (a  double-bypass engine with the thrust of about three tons) almost  on a charity basis," was what we heard at the Institute of  Aviation, where they also claim that they are ready to take part  in an actual military aircraft program that would be 70 percent  Polish-designed and developed.    Right now the best advertisement for the PZL Okecie is  Lieutenant Colonel Andrzej Strigl. What he does during  demonstrations on the Orlik is a piece of aerobatics in the  shape of a large "S." He is convinced that the aircraft is  outstanding.    "I have been flying it for quite a while now. I have also  written an item on training pilots how to fly the Orlik. So that  my younger colleagues will be able to feel safe in it, I myself  have tested out many unconventional elements."    Lt. Col. Strigl currently flies nine types of aircraft,  including the latest creation from the Institute of Aviation. He  is thus in a position to compare:    "These are different aircraft in their classes. Flight  students can go from the Orlik to the Iryda, but never the other  way around. They may not be top of the line compared to  corresponding world designs, but Poland is not that far  behind...."    However, Andrzej Stigl has not yet flown the Iryda with the  1.5-ton-thrust K-15 engines. To date, the only one to do so has  been Ludwik Natkaniec, the Polish aviation legend, who has spent  10,000 hours in the air, mainly in prototypes.    "This is the aircraft we have been waiting for," he says  after 50 hours of testing the Iryda with Kaszub [engines]. The  more he learns about the aircraft, the more it impresses him.  Favorably. He had not expected that all of the designers'  calculations would turn out to be so accurate.    "On paper, these calculations are one-dimensional. It is  only  in the air that you can really feel what this aircraft is  capable of. It is dynamic and easy to operate because its  performance has so much in reserve that even high temperatures,  heavy loads, and heavy weather do not overwhelm it."    Natkaniec has looked "into every nook and cranny." He has  verified that the aircraft remains stable at maximum speeds,  when diving, when pulling up, and in spins. The tests obviously  still have to be run again, but it can already be said that the  Iryda has already done extremely well, even in situations that  are not provided for by the requirements. It is a safe aircraft.  Its takeoff run has been shortened by 40 percent (compared to  aircraft equipped with the Iskra power plants). It climbs very  quickly (its rate of climb is 40 meters per second). The pilot  sitting in the cockpit has a very good field of view.    "It is an aircraft that is fun to take through the air. Yes,  an old pilot would like to emphasize that strongly." The test  pilot from the Institute of Aviation is afraid that the M-93  version, bristling with automated equipment, will not measure up  in this regard.    "Which does not mean, of course, that it is not necessary to  go in that direction...."    The Kaszub engines were developed and built entirely in  Poland.    Domestic Polish materials are also used in it. With one  exception: In the first compressor stage, titanium vanes, the  forgings for which come from Russia, are employed. This  considerably lengthens the service life of the power plant.    Docent Martin Kowalski, who oversees the work on the Iryda  as  regards the use of the K-15 power plant in it, thinks it will  easily pass the 600-hour government test that began on 1 October  in a test bed. The K-15 has already achieved the other design  parameters. And, most important, it has proved itself in the air.    Work has now been completed that will make it possible to  increase the aircraft's load capacity and check the resistance  of the gas-dynamic curve of the power plant under combat  conditions, as well as increase the flight range to the absolute  minimum limit of flutter resistance.    The next stage will be the Iryda M-93, which should be a  very  strong competitor for the best aircraft in its class worldwide.    The Iryda M-93 is the immediate future for the Polish  aviation industry and that of the former Central Industrial  District, and, consequently, for the Polish Air Force.    Its chief designer, Wlodzimierz Gnarowski, says that the new  Polish trainer-combat aircraft, which took a long time getting  born through the fault not only of the designers (although they  obviously had to overcome certain, not insignificant limitations  of knowledge and experience), will ultimately be just as we want  it to be. The most important thing is that the designers of the  Iryda and its manufacturers from Mielec and Rzesow are not  telling fairy tales illustrated with wood and plastic mock-ups.    The Iryda can already easily reach a speed of 830 kilometers  per hour ("We feel we will soon be up to 920 kilometers per  hour"). There are real prospects for export, which will improve  even more as the avionics of the aircraft are modernized.  Unfortunately, with the production base that now exists, we are  not in a position to domestically produce for the Iryda highly  integrated systems that would meet NATO requirements.    The Institute of Aviation and the WSK [Transportation  Equipment Plant] of the Polish Aviation Plant Mielec have thus  entered into a cooperative venture with the French firm SAGEM  [Company for General Electrical and Mechanical Applications],  which is disposed to invest its own funds in modernizing the  avionics of the Iryda, accepting a minimal return. The French  also want to undertake broader cooperation with the Polish  electronics industry. Engineer Gnarowski has issued an  invitation to a demonstration of the Iryda with the new  avionics, which is scheduled to take place in late January or  early February.    "In my view, this will be the culmination of a multiyear  effort on the part of designers and manufacturers whose names  are worth mentioning here: Faleski, Rucz, Pogoda, Szelag,  Jonski, Zawadzki, Kania, Lipinski, and Kowalski from Warsaw, and  Potapowicz, Sek, Kozik, and Wojtkowski from Mielec. We should  mention that none of them have yet said the final word...."    The Polish aviation industry, which has been hardened on the  roller of its survival, wants to keep rolling, undertaking the  venture that is associated with this or relying on what it has  already learned. It is typical that those who most often speak  well of the Iryda are those who have flown it, including people  in the military. And they are considerably more enthusiastic  than those who just think they know it, including people in the  military.    At the Institute of Aviation, there is the hope that in the  near future the Command of the WLiOP [Air Force and Air Defense  Forces] will pick it up unconditionally--equipment decisions  uninfluenced by economic pressures. An increase in orders would  reinforce a normal path toward coming up with a fully mature  design for a Polish "battlefield" aircraft. On the basis of the  experience gained with the Iryda and the K-15 and D-18 engines,  it is possible (it appears) to consider it entirely realistic to  make this transition.    And, after all, this is not the only asset. All calculations  indicate that every aircraft made by the Poles themselves will  be 25-50 percent less expensive than comparable foreign ones.    What Poland can do, however, is also indicated by the  example  of the Transportation Equipment Plant of the Polish Aviation  Plant Swidnik. It is unfortunate that, in order to get even  Polish decisionmakers to like its Sokol, it first had to gain  recognition from overseas specialists.    "It is important that Polish aviation design thinking, which  was once well respected throughout the world and still is, not  be lost even now, despite what some people may think. This also  depends on MON [Ministry of National Defense], where a  tremendous variety of views and ideas now prevails," Wlodzimierz  Gnarowski told us. However, he unfortunately lacks a solid,  economically realistic understanding of the military's equipment  policy.</p>

			<p><P> August 9, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> L.A. REJECTS LIQUOR PERMIT FOR STORE NEAR CRIME-RIDDEN PARK  </P> <P> The Los Angeles City Council refused Tuesday to issue a liquor sales permit to  a Canoga Park mini-mart owner who wanted to sell beer and wine near a park  notorious for drug dealing and alcohol-related arrests.  </P> <P> Capt. Alan Deal, commanding officer of the West Valley police division, told  council members that the permit should be denied because the neighborhood near  the mini-mall is experiencing skyrocketing crime rates, largely due to problems  at Lanark Park, which he called "the worst park in the West Valley."  </P> <P> Liquor already can be purchased at eleven businesses within 1,000 feet of the  new gas station and mini-mart on the southeast corner of Topanga Canyon and  Roscoe boulevards, said Councilwoman Joy Picus, who represents the area.  </P> <P> About 48% of the arrests made at the park and in the surrounding neighborhood  involve public drinking charges, Deal said. The excessive public drinking in  the area exacerbates the drug problem, he said.  </P> <P> Between 1977 and 1988, arrests jumped 52% from 455 to 696. Figures so far this  year show 980 arrests have been made for crimes such as drug dealing, public  drinking, assault and theft.  </P> <P> "These are incredible statistics," Picus said. "We don't need another place  selling liquor in an area that already has an over-concentration of them."  </P> <P> Bishara K. Helo, who was seeking the liquor permit for his 24-hour mini-mart,  did not appear before the council.  </P> <P> The City Council has the authority to deny the necessary zoning permits to  liquor store applicants. The council unanimously rejected Helo's application.  The decision was sent to Mayor Tom Bradley for approval.  </P></p>

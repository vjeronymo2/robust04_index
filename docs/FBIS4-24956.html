			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhu Baoxia: "Steps Taken To Clean Up Pollution"] </F>   [Text] The quality of China's environment is fairly good,  considering the pressures put on it from the country's rapid  economic development.    But in a few places, pollution and other kinds of  environmental deterioration have worsened, according to a  national report on last year's environmental status released by  the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) yesterday.    On a positive note, less waste water was discharged last  year. Total waste water discharges amounted to 35.5 billion  tons, or 3 percent less than the year before. Industrial  discharges accounted for 21.9 billion tons of the total, a 6.2  percent drop over last year.    The volume of solid industrial wastes stabilized at 20  million tons last year.    Meanwhile, more trees were planted, leading to a new total  of  133 million hectares of forested land.    But some environmental problems became worse last year.    Emissions of certain air pollutants grew. Soot emissions  rose by 7.1 percent, and sulphur dioxide, which causes acid  rain, went up by 6.5 percent.    All waste gases last year totalled 11 trillion cubic metres.    The worse places for air pollution due to coal burning were  found in the bigger cities of north China during the winter and  spring.    The extent of acid rain did not expand much but it was found  more frequently in the southern cities, including Jiangxi  Province's Ganzhou, Changsha of Hunan, Chongqing of Sichuan, and  Hangzhou of Zhejiang.    Atmospheric pollution has become one of the major causes of  respiratory diseases such as chronic bronchial pneumonia and  lung cancer. The mortality rate of lung cancer in cities was 34  per 100,000 people, a rise of 18.5 percent over 1988.    Among farmers, respiratory ailments have become the  number-one killer, with a death rate of 165 per 100,000.    The report also said that the urban stretches of big rivers  and some lakes were seriously polluted.    Noise pollution has also worsened, mainly due to crowded  urban conditions, traffic, and industry.    Last year, over 2,700 industrial pollution cases were  reported throughout the country, an increase of 94 cases over  the previous year, causing an economic loss of over 220 million  yuan ($25 million).    More than 10 million hectares of farm land were polluted,  reducing grain harvests by 12 billion kilograms.    There were 107 large-scale geological disasters such as land  collapses, land-slides, and mud flows, claiming 432 lives.    The report noted progress in some areas, however. The  disposal rates of waste gases, water, and solids have been  raised. And more people have the benefit of central heating and  piped gas.    By the end of last year, 766 natural reserves had been set  up, taking up 6.8 percent of the country's total area.    Preservation centres for endangered animals were established  in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Guangdong Provinces and Guangxi Zhuang  Autonomous Region. Over 300 wild animals have been put under  State protection.    Xie Zhenhua, NEPA administrator, said that the country's  challenges for the future are to improve its energy efficiency,  control greenhouse-gas emissions and industrial and urban  pollution, and develop new technology to protect the environment.</p>

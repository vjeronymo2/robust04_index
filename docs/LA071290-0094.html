			<p><P> July 12, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NAACP CALLS FOR END TO EMPLOYER SANCTIONS  </P> <P> Despite opposition from a vocal minority who briefly disrupted the NAACP's  national convention, the civil rights group Wednesday approved a resolution  calling for a repeal of penalties against employers who hire illegal immigrant  workers.  </P> <P> The vote gives a major boost to the drive to abolish employer sanctions and  helps salve wounds that have developed in the relationship between the NAACP  and Latino groups.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, Latino groups had threatened to withdraw from a key civil  rights coalition if the NAACP did not back repeal of the sanctions, a key  provision of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act.  </P> <P> Some blacks argue that illegal immigration contributes to high unemployment  among blacks. The Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and other  Latino groups argue, however, that the sanctions provision has fostered  widespread discrimination against all Latino workers, regardless of their  immigration status.  </P> <P> The NAACP's move came after an angry debate at the Los Angeles Convention  Center. Most of the opposition was voiced by delegates from Southern  California, where the impact of illegal immigration has been strongly felt.  </P> <P> One San Fernando Valley delegate moved that the resolution be tabled until a  study of "the high unemployment among black Americans" could be completed.  </P> <P> That motion was defeated 279 to 175. Larry Steele, the NAACP official presiding  over the meeting, then called a vote on the employer sanctions resolution. "No  discussion against," he announced, hurriedly calling for a vote on the  resolution. "Motion carries, resolution adopted," he said.  </P> <P> Feeling that they had been denied a chance to debate the issue, several  delegates began shouting "No!" Their cries soon grew into a loud chant. After  more than a minute, Steele agreed to allow discussion.  </P> <P> "We used (the sanctions) to keep undocumented aliens from taking the food from  black children," said Charles B. Johnson of the Pasadena NAACP branch. "If you  withdraw those sanctions, then you open the door and you flood this state with  a multitude of undocumented aliens who will take the jobs of blacks and other  minorities."  </P> <P> About half a dozen speakers came out against the resolution, while only one --  Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP -- publicly  defended it.  </P> <P> With passage of the resolution in doubt, NAACP Executive Director Benjamin  Hooks, who had given personal assurances to Latino leaders that it would be  adopted, stepped to the microphone to address the delegates.  </P> <P> "I urge you to vote for this resolution," Hooks said. Because a recent General  Accounting Office report had shown that the employer sanctions had contributed  to workplace discrimination, Hooks said, the civil rights organization had  little choice but to call for their repeal.  </P> <P> The resolution was then approved by about a 3-1 margin.  </P> <P> Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, one of two Latino  organizations leading the fight against employer sanctions, said he was  "elated" to hear of the NAACP vote.  </P> <P> "We had a commitment from the NAACP leadership that this was going to happen,"  Yzaguirre said. "This means we can have real solidarity with the NAACP on civil  rights issues. It will initiate a new era of mutual cooperation."  </P> <P> Antonia Hernandez of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund  said her organization would work to dispel the "misconception that Latino  immigration causes job displacement."  </P> <P> In other developments at the convention, which ends today, Rev. Jesse Jackson  called on President Bush to host a summit meeting with U.S. civil rights  leaders aimed at hammering out a domestic economic aid policy.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Sam Fulwood III contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: EX-CITY OFFICIAL CLAIMS BIAS  </P> <P> Former El Segundo Public Works Director Bill Glickman, who was abruptly fired  in April after 18 years on the job, has filed a $3 million age discrimination  claim against the city.  </P> <P> In his claim, Glickman, 55, also contends that his rights to a hearing were  violated when he was terminated. As a result, Glickman contends in his claim,  his reputation has been hurt, and he has suffered emotionally.  </P> <P> Glickman was fired by then-City Manager Fred Sorsabal, who has since left the  city to become Mission Viejo's city manager. At the time of the firing,  Sorsabal would say only that his action adhered to city personnel regulations.  </P> <P> Those regulations specify that department heads, including the public works  director, serve at the pleasure of the city manager and can be terminated at  any time.  </P> <P> Glickman, who earned $79,560 annually, has said that he was not told why he was  being let go.  </P> <P> Council members have 45 days to act on the claim. If they deny it, Glickman can  file a lawsuit against the city.  </P></p>

Enrique Bethancour, executive director of the Union of  Banana-Exporting Countries (Upeb), said yesterday  representatives of Upeb countries have decided to undertake the  negotiations with the Europeans collectively and within the  framework of GATT rules.    Not all representatives of the countries that are members of  this organization have agreed with this proposal, however.    During the 5 February meeting in Panama City, it was decided  to invite Colombia, Costa Rica, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, which  to date have not accepted the proposal by the majority of Upeb  members.    Panama, Guatemala, and other producers, including Ecuador,  the world's largest producer and not a Upeb member, maintain the  negotiations must be held within the free trade framework  established by GATT.    Ricardo Fabrega, Panamanian commerce and industries  minister,  said on 4 February the proposal that would be analyzed in this  meeting consisted of a specific quota, which he refused to  disclose, and two tariff levels. He said the first tariff level  would be established at 7 percent. There would be a second  tariff level after the requested quota is filled, and this level  would be reduced in the next seven years.    Fabrega added the quota to be requested from the European  Union would include the quantities sold to the Nordic countries  and Austria, which will become EC members in 1995.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by V.A. Reznikov, T.A. Berrezina, L.B. Volodarskiy, </F> and E.G. Lubenets, Novosibirsk Institute of Organic Chemistry,  Siberian Department, Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk;  UDC 547.781.3+547.898]    [Abstract] Spin-labeled crown ethers containing a spin  label both in and not in direct proximity to the coordination  sphere have been produced previously. In both cases,  coordination of the nitroxyl group with the metal ion in the  complex was not observed. For this reason, new ways of  introducing a spin label at the amino group of easily accessible  amino derivatives of crown ethers were proposed. Diazonium salts  prepared from aminophenyl-substituted crown ethers were reacted  with a paramagnetic imidazolinium salt to form spin-labeled  crown ethers containing an arylazoenamine group as a component  of the molecule. A second approach to synthesizing spin-labeled  crown ethers was also proposed. It entailed reacting amino  derivatives with paramagnetic isocyanate, which reacts with  amines to form paramagnetic ureas. Equimolar quantities of  isocyanate and amine were mixed to produce spin-labeled crown  ethers that, together with an NaOH water-alcohol solution, form  paramagnetic amidines. The latter approach makes it possible to  synthesize spin-labeled crown ethers that contain an amidine  grouping as a component of the molecule. This in turn makes it  possible to control pH in a study micro-object by means of  electron paramagnetic resonance. Table 1; references 9: 3  Russian, 6 Western.</p>

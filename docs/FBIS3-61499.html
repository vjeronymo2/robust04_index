A. </F> Tsybikov, Russian Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and  Environmental Monitoring; UDC 504.3.054. (1993.03) (047)(47+57)]    [Abstract] During March 1993 extremely high atmospheric  pollution was not registered (in March 1992 one such case was  observed), nor were such cases registered in the first quarter  of this year (two such cases were observed in the first quarter  of 1992). During March in 7 cities (Omsk, Glazov, Tomsk,  Kemerovo, Norilsk, Tolyatti, Moscow) in 12 cases the presence of  pollutants in concentrations of 10 times the maximum admissible  concentrations (MAC) were observed (in March 1992 this was true  in 58 cases in 14 cities). In Moscow during March two cases of  high atmospheric pollution with ammonia with 28 MAC and two  cases of pollution with carbon monoxide with 12 MAC were  observed. In this month extremely high pollution levels (MAC  greater than 100, with a sharp worsening of organoleptic  properties) resulted from 22 accidents in 16 water bodies (in  comparison with March 1992 with 25 such events in 17 water  bodies). During March 1993 there were 153 cases of high  pollution in 103 water bodies, especially rivers. Various cases  of oil spills in Russian rivers occurred. During March 1993  radiation conditions in the Russian Federation did not change  substantially in comparison with February. The diurnal  concentrations of radioactive aerosols in the atmosphere and  their fallout onto the underlying surface were at the level of  the background values.</p>

			<p>920210 FT  10 FEB 92 / Moscow business centre wins backing TWO initiatives to promote enterprise in central and eastern Europe have been announced by the government. They are a business-support centre in Moscow and a conference in London of employment ministers from 11 former Communist states. The first Russian support centre for small businesses will open in Moscow in September with the help of finance provided by Britain's Know-How Fund, Mr Michael Howard, employment secretary, said. The Pounds 50m fund was established in 1989 to help countries in east and central Europe to develop market-oriented economies. The centre, which will provide advice and training to small-business owners and would-be entrepreneurs, is intended to be the forerunner of a network throughout Russia. The announcement of the planned opening follows visits by British experts to Moscow to provide advice on staffing the centre, staff training, the availability of premises and equipment, and help with evaluating the needs of entrepreneurs in Russia. A team of Russian experts paid a two-week return visit to the UK, leaving for home last Saturday. In a further move to help eastern European countries develop more enterprising economies, the government has invited the employment ministers from 11 countries to a conference in London this month. Delegates will examine the political and practical difficulties of establishing an enterprise culture and promoting the growth of small companies. Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the three Baltic states are expected to send delegates. The International Labour Organisation and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will also be represented. Twenty managers from businesses in St Petersburg are due at Manchester Business School today at the start of a four-week management development programme. They come from businesses involved in boat building, hotel construction, fashion knitwear and computer science.</p>

			<p>930717 FT  17 JUL 93 / UK Company News: Resort suspended as board asks for accountants' report SHARES IN Resort Hotels, a chain that grew from humble origins in Brighton with the help of four rights issues in five years, were suspended on the Stock Exchange yesterday. The board said in a statement it was concerned 'over a number of financing and reporting issues'. Independent accountants have been asked to put together a report. Mr Robert Feld, managing director and the head of the family that built the group, has resigned his executive duties with immediate effect. Neither Mr Feld, nor Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the company's advisers nor Mr Roland Lewis, the finance director who is to become acting managing director, would expand on the brief statement from the company. Mr Tim Barker, non-executive deputy chairman since March, said he would not be drawn on what the investigation would cover. 'All I can add is that the matter that gave rise to it happened very recently,' he said. Analysts were not altogether surprised yesterday that there might be problems at Resort Hotels given the speed at which it has been growing and the high gearing involved in hotel ownership. Since 1988 the group has raised more than Pounds 50m through four rights issues, the most recent in April 1992, underwritten by BZW at 63p. The shares fell to a low of 24p by early December but had recovered to 45p yesterday when they were suspended. Some analysts which follow Resort Hotels had thought, however, that trading was going fairly well. They had seen Thursday's announcement that Resort Hotels would lease a number of hotels owned by Welsh Water as further evidence that trading was on track. Resort was formed with the backing of four Business Expansion Schemes in 1984 and became the second BES scheme to float. As with Queens Moat Hotels, which was suspended in April, yesterday's announcement comes just two weeks before Resort Hotels was due to report its preliminary results.</p>

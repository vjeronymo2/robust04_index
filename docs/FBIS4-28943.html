			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee  [C.C.] of the Union of Agricultural Working People of Korea  [UAWPK] proposed to the "National Federation of Peasant  Associations" the "National Council of Peasant Organisations"  and other peasant organisations of South Korea to hold a contact  in Pyongyang or Seoul or Panmunjom for the discussion of the  matter of convening a national conference.    This proposal was made by Choe Song-suk, chairperson of the  C.C., the UAWPK, in a statement Friday.    A consultative meeting of representatives of the DPRK  Government, political parties and public organisations which was  held on May 25 urged the South Korean authorities to respond to  the proposal for the convocation of a national conference and  select South side's delegates to the preparatory committee of  the conference at an early date, keeping pace with the North.    She said the peasant organisations of South Korea should  launch brisk activities for an early selection of South side's  delegates to the preparatory committee of the national  conference and acceleration of the preparations for the  conference.    "If the peasant organisations in the North and the South are  to share the same view and achieve the unity of action in the  efforts to convene the national conference, they must sit at one  place, first of all, and come to an understanding", she said,  adding: "The contact should not be wedded to a form. With the  date set for the convocation of the national conference two  months off, the sooner the better."    She expressed the hope that the peasant organisations of  South Korea would show an affirmative response to the North's  proposal for a bilateral contact.</p>

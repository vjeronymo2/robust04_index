			<p>921215 FT  15 DEC 92 / US wants war crime trials THE US yesterday proposed that the perpetrators of crimes against humanity in the former Yugoslavia should be brought to justice in person, in the same way the Nazi leaders were at the Nuremberg trials after the second world war. The proposal was made by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, secretary of state in the outgoing US administration. He spoke at the opening of a meeting of the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), at which the conflict in the former Yugoslavia is the most important item on the agenda. Mr Eagleburger tabled a series of measures to transform the CSCE, widely criticised for failing to back up its declarations with practical measures to solve the growing number of conflicts in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, into a more positive problem-solving organisation. The CSCE had to develop a strategy which was proactive, not reactive, he said. The aim should be to detect early signs of crises and instability and undertake preventive diplomacy. 'We must seek early enough to prevent the outbreak of conflict, or else find ourselves, as in Yugoslavia, constantly reacting to new horrors.' CSCE missions to assist with the enforcement of UN sanctions, of the kind already sent to Kosovo, Macedonia and Georgia, must be expanded to prevent war from spilling over into neighbouring countries and regions, as it threatened to do from Bosnia. The US would contribute, 'on an urgent basis,' to the expansion of the Kosovo mission, Mr Eagleburger promised. In addition, the administration and financing of the CSCE had to be strengthened to ensure a more effective response to the challenges of conflict prevention and crisis management. The ministers are due to agree in principle today to the appointment of a permanent secretary-general, a post for which the Germans have put forward their permanent representative to the CSCE, Mr Wilhelm Hoynck. They will also formally approve the nomination of Mr Max van der Stoel, a former Dutch foreign minister, as the CSCE's new High Commissioner on National Minorities, another post which has been created to strengthen the organisation's capacity for preventive diplomacy and wider respect of human rights. In line with the general desire to prevent conflicts before they become unmanageable, the ministers have decided to send a small CSCE mission to Estonia for six months from next February, to try to ease the tension between the country's Estonian and Russian population and help create a civil society on the western model. Ethnic Russians make up about 40 per cent of Estonia's total population of 1.6m, but they do not have the automatic right to citizenship of the country.</p>

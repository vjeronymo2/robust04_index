			<p><P> September 4, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> CHP ARRESTS 167 ON DUI CHARGES IN ORANGE COUNTY  </P> <P> The California Highway Patrol, armed with hand-held Breathalyzers and a tougher  legal standard for drunkenness, arrested 167 people on suspicion of driving  while under the influence of alcohol on Orange County freeways over Labor Day  weekend.  </P> <P> Three people involved in two traffic accidents related to drunk driving were  killed on the county's freeways during the traditional final weekend of summer,  the CHP reported.  </P> <P> CHP Officer Lyle Whitten said officers from the Westminster station arrested 59  motorists on suspicion of driving while under the influence of alcohol.  </P> <P> That figure is nearly double the number of arrests the Westminster station made  last Labor Day, and the most arrests over a weekend in years, Whitten said.  </P> <P> He attributed much of the increase in arrests to greater enforcement and a new  law that allows police to arrest motorists found to have a blood-alcohol level  of .08.  </P> <P> The law that lowered the legal standard for drunkenness from .10 took effect on  Jan. 1. Whitten said 9% of the arrests over Labor Day weekend involved people  who could have passed the old test.  </P> <P> "They would have driven away last year," Whitten said.  </P> <P> Whitten also said, however, that it appears more people are drinking and  driving, despite heavy advertising campaigns aimed at discouraging the  practice.  </P> <P> "Drunks are out there killing innocent people," Whitten said. "That's the  reason we are putting so much emphasis on drunk driving. (But) you'd think DUI  would be reduced, not increased, because of enhanced enforcement."  </P> <P> CHP Officer Ken Daily said officers stationed in the San Juan Capistrano office  made 45 DUI arrests. That figure was up from 25 arrests the previous year.  </P> <P> And CHP Officer Angel Johnson said the Santa Ana office arrested 63 motorists  for suspected DUI. That figure was five fewer than last year.  </P></p>

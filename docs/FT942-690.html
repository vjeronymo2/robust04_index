			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Observer: Foot in it One World Cup spin-off sales promotion which is unlikely to be repeated is Heineken's competition to collect bottle tops of its Amstel beer. The idea was that beer drinkers who collected bottle-tops carrying the flags of all 24 football participants won a book on the World Cup. Unfortunately, one of the contestants was that well-known country of teetotallers - Saudi Arabia. Popping the Saudi flag on top of a bottle of beer might not damage Heineken's Middle Eastern beer sales but it caused such a diplomatic stir that Heineken was summoned to the Saudi embassy in The Hague, and forced to take out ads in two Dutch newspapers, apologising for the insult. Indeed, it seemed at one stage that the company might even have to recall several million bottles of the offending ale.</p>

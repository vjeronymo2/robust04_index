			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Christophe Boisbouvier in Goma] </F>   [Excerpts] [Boisbouvier] [passage omitted] In Corfu, the  European Union summit has asked for the trial of those behind  the genocide in Rwanda. Europe has also expressed its support  for the French operation. [passage omitted]    And now the situation in Kigali: Violent fighting took place  again this morning, but subsided in the afternoon. However, the  United Nations was not able to continue its humanitarian  missions. (Pierre Mehu), the UNAMIR [UN Assistance Mission in  Rwanda] spokesman in Kigali, has some explanations:    [(Mehu)] The situation is still very tense. [Words  indistinct] we were not able to evacuate the orphans from the  Saint-Michel orphanage; we were to take them to the King Faisal  hospital today, but we couldn't because of the bad security  conditions.    [Correspondent Ghislaine Dupont] Do you have the impression  that the Rwandan Patriotic Front is still very hostile to the  French intervention operation?    [(Mehu)] I would say that their hostility has subsided.  Colonel Frank Mugambage, who is the leader of the delegation at  the cease-fire talks, gave a news conference yesterday. He said  that the Rwandan Patriotic Front may reconsider its  position--not renounce, but reconsider its position--if the  French initiative is limited to the humanitarian side of things.    [Dupont] Does UNAMIR have any contact with those behind  Operation Turquoise?    [(Mehu)] Well, telephone contact has been established. The  commander of the general force, Dallaire, is to meet the  commander of the French intervention force over the next few  days.</p>

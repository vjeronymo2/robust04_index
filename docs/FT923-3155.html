			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Revival scheme failings identified LACK of co-ordination among schemes for promoting economic regeneration has been criticised at a Business in the Community conference on development in the east Midlands. Mr David Grayson, managing director of Business in the Community's strategy group, said the UK led the world in the number of regeneration schemes it produced, but they were often unco-ordinated. He listed several factors that could thwart efforts to revive a rundown area. They included unrealistic timescales and funding, and the adoption of too many different priorities. Experience elsewhere in Europe suggested that organisations involved in regeneration should have firm agreements on their respective roles and should pool their resources towards a few defined goals. His complaints were echoed by Mr Mick Lyons, chief executive of Nottinghamshire County Council. He said: 'There is too much worry about setting up new agencies rather than getting existing agencies to work together.' He said economic development could not be done by the public sector alone or without public-sector input. Mr Philip Champ, a main board director at East Midlands Electricity, warned that 'no business can continue to thrive in an area where other business is not doing well'.</p>

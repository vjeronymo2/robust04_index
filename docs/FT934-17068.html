			<p>931002 FT  02 OCT 93 / Finance and the Family: The Perpetual search for long-term growth - Unit Trusts / Scheherazade Daneshkhu meets professional investors who feel it helps to make money if you live outside London FAR AWAY from City bustle, Stephen Whittaker runs Perpetual's UK growth fund from an 18th century house in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire. Perpetual has had its offices in this building ever since the 1970s, when its founder, Martyn Arbib, launched the first fund. Whittaker finds distinct advantages in being distant from London. On Monday, for example, news of the restructuring of Grand Metropolitan, the food, drinks and retailing group, came over at just after 1.45pm. 'Instead of being in a City wine bar, I was here and was able to add to my holdings quickly,' said Whittaker. Grand Met's share price rose 10p by the day's close. Such short-termism however, does not characterise the fund which is run to produce good long-term performance. It is is fifth in the UK growth sector in the five and three years to September 1 according to Micropal but 24th in the year to September 1. Whittaker says he does not aim to be at the top because that is usually the result of a risky or focused strategy which carries the danger of sliding down the performance tables the next year. Instead he aims to be constantly in the first or second quartile (the top 25 or 50 per cent). He argues that the performance will come through in the longer run as other, less consistent, funds drop out. Whittaker runs the fund with the aid of Neil Woodford, who looks at the income side, and John Sweet, who is a small companies specialist. The fund is large and diversified and contains more than 100 stocks. The largest holding is in British Telecom with 4 per cent: 'It is one of the cheapest utilities around,' says Whittaker. Standard Chartered is the next largest with over 2 per cent. 'I bought it for recovery and am now holding on to it for growth. It has gone from Pounds 2 to Pounds 9 in those years.' Perpetual, which had an established reputation for its international funds, launched a UK growth fund in June 1987. Margaret Thatcher had just been re-elected and, like many others, Perpetual thought that her victory would underpin an already strong market. The Pounds 30m which the fund pulled in within the first three days of its launch reflected general optimism. Whittaker was recruited from Save &amp; Prosper in August that year to run the fund which was languishing at the bottom of the performance tables. Within two months, the stock market crashed and the unit price of the fund fell to 32p from 50p at the time of the launch. 'It was a baptism of fire,' says Whittaker. 'We had to work hard to stem the flow of money out and having had ideas about how to run the fund when I joined, I had to kick these out of the window and develop a new strategy.' Instead of focusing on aggressive acquisition-driven stock, Whittaker decided, particularly after Nigel Lawson's deflationary 1988 Budget to move to the sanctuary of large companies instead of a diversified portfolio split between companies of all sizes. 'Although 1989 was a difficult year, if we had maintained out weighting in in recovery and smaller company stocks, we would have been much worse off,' says Whittaker. By 1991 when the recession was well underway and small companies were performing badly, Whittaker tried to predict what might happen in 1992. 'I thought the next move in interest rates and inflation would be downwards and that we should be thinking about a higher weighting in smaller companies and recovery stocks. This became the strategy by the end of 1991 and into 1992.' However, the government's decision to remain in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, even if this meant raising interest rates, appeared to prove him wrong. Whittaker says summer last year was difficult for his fund's recovery-based strategy. 'Raising interest rates instead of cutting threatened to cause a depression. I thought there would be rioting in the streets if this was to happen. In the end the currency markets and George Soros did us an enormous favour by pushing the government into a decision it had not wanted to make,' says Whittaker. Soros, a New York hedge fund manager sold sterling and arguably precipitated the UK's exit from the Exchange Rate Mechanism last September. Today over half the fund is invested in small- to medium-size companies and Whittaker is gradually selling stocks and buying new ones because he expects a shift in the economic cycle next year. He believes the return of inflation is possible next year, arguing that the government is likely to be pressed to deal with unemployment and may not be able to continue cutting spending. If inflation returns, companies which are highly-rated now because of expectations of growth next year, could turn out to be a disappointment, particularly in a fragile market. Whittaker is therefore switching from what he has identified as vulnerable areas - property, construction, engineering and other capital goods areas - into those he believes are undervalued - food retailing and brewing. He likes the financial sector and is overweight in banks and insurance. Recent purchases have been in food retailers Argyll and Tesco, and in leisure stocks such as Thorn EMI, Rank Organisation, Forte and Granada. 'The difficulty is that I tend to be early so I have an uncomfortable period. The difference between having an idea and being right is timing, so when I have an idea I move carefully and slowly by putting in a little bit of money and waiting and then putting in a bit more.' Whittaker says that whenever he has reacted 'like a raging bull', he has invariably been wrong. After Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi president, invaded Kuwait in August 1990, he worried that the portfolio did not contain any oil stocks and bought into the market. Within a few weeks, he realised that he had been mistaken and sold the stock at a loss. 'You have to be prepared to do that and, by the same token, you should nto become too wedded to any stock,' says Whittaker. He is usually cautious. 'I move slowly and carefully. The key to the very high ranking of the fund over the longer term is this inherent conservatism.' Charges. The initial charge is 5.25 per cent and the annual charge is 1.25 per cent. The bid-offer spread is about 6.5 per cent. Minimum investment is Pounds 1,000 or Pounds 500 through a Pep. There is a savings scheme of Pounds 20 a month minimum. Peps must be taken out so via the company's self-select Pep. The plan charge is 5 per cent plus VAT but the 5.25 per cent initial charge on the fund is then discounted.</p>

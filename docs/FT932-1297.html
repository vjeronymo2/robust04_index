			<p>930624 FT  24 JUN 93 / Arts: Successful rustic intrigue at Garsington No, it is not quite another Glyndebourne, though the comparison inevitably arises from the combination of opera with garden vistas and posh picnicking. Garsington Opera, just outside Oxford, is a smaller enterprise, without the heavy presence of corporate hospitality - and with less expensive and therefore less lustrous casting. Spectators are seated almost in the open air, with a tented overhang and a descant of bird song, and with the stone-work of historic Garsington Manor forming the backdrop of the stage. The new restaurant is decorated with wood panelling from the former Glyndebourne theatre. Garsington's surprising speciality is Haydn: following other operas in the last two seasons, the current festival opened with L'infedelta delusa. It is a triumph of modest yet clever opera production, thanks chiefly to the stage direction by Anthony Besch: indeed, in 30 years of viewing Haydn operas, I would rate this as the first to justify the composer as a master wholly in command of his musical and comic material, rather than groping towards what Mozart would achieve a decade or two later. A compliment to the librettist Marco Coltellini would not be amiss. With Peter Rice as scene designer, Besch's comic invention on stage falls entirely within the opera's proper bounds. Even the serving and eating of a three-course meal during the singing of a rapid duet - to the audience's uproarious delight - follows on from the original stage direction. Vespina, plainly a model for Despina in Mozart's Cosi fan tutte, is at the centre of the rustic intrigue, dressing up in four differently absurd guises to bring love, marriage and property into harmonious relationship. Claire Daniels was mistress of this part and its impersonations, her thigh-slapping German soldier helped by Sally Gilpin's choreography. As Vespina's brother Nanni, David Mattinson was warm in character, rich in voice; as Sandrini, in love with Nanni, Patricia Rozario added grace on stage to her smallish but cultivated tone. Some roughness elsewhere arose from Haydn's free use of very high and very low notes, but it was more important that all the singing kept so well in character. The quietly alert conducting of Wasfi Kani drew happily on the resources of the Guildhall String Ensemble - which, with wind and percussion added, needs to change its name. Bilingual librettos being on sale and readable by daylight the decision to perform Haydn in the original Italian was defensible. With Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf Naxos, however, the language shipwrecked the comedy - especially in the prologue, where the extensive role of the major-domo (Thomas Hemsley) is entirely spoken and not sung. Far better to perform this prologue in English even if the German is preferred for the opera proper. Damage was also inflicted by the switch of the setting to a post-1900 period. Had Strauss been confronted with that period, who could suppose that he would have provided a score full of 18th-century musical pastiche? Julie Gossage's voice sounded prematurely forced in the role of the Composer in the Prologue, but Carol Smith had the true Strauss style as Ariadne, though not quite sustaining the necessary force up to the end. The earthy good-nature of Zerbinetta but not all the vocal brilliance of the part was conveyed by Linda Kitchen. Aidan Crawley's direction helped to ease the paralysis inherent in the last half-hour of the piece, and Ivor Bolton drew expressive sonorities from the Glyndebourne Touring Opera Orchestra.

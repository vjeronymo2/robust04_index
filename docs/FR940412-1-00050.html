Included in this part are explanations of the steps followed in developing a pilotage rate adjustment, the analysis used, and the guidelines followed in arriving at the pilotage rates contained in part 401 of this chapter.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) The Director determines the timing for reviews of Great Lakes pilotage rates. These reviews are conducted at his or her discretion and are intended to determine whether existing Great Lakes pilotage rates are fair and reasonable, or should be adjusted. An interested party or parties may also petition the Director for a review at any time. The petition must present a reasonable basis for concluding that a review may be warranted. If the Director determines, from the information contained in the petition, that the existing rates may no longer be reasonable, a full review of the pilotage rates will be conducted. If the full review shows that pilotage rates are within a reasonable range of their target, no adjustment to the rates will be initiated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;404.5  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Guidelines for the recognition of expenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) The following is a listing of the principal guidelines followed by the Director when determining whether expenses will be recognized in the ratemaking process:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Each expense item included in the rate base is evaluated to determine if it is necessary for the provision of pilotage service, and if so, what dollar amount is reasonable for that expense item. Each Association is responsible for providing the Director with sufficient information to show the reasonableness of all expense items. The Director will give the Association the opportunity to defend any expenses which are questioned. However, subject to the terms and conditions contained in other provisions of this part, expense items which the Director determines are not reasonable and necessary for the provision of pilotage services will not be recognized for ratemaking purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) In determining reasonableness, each expense item is measured against one or more of the following:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Comparable or similar expenses paid by others in the maritime industry,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Comparable or similar expenses paid by other industries, or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) U.S. Internal Revenue Service guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Lease costs for both operating and capital leases are recognized for ratemaking purposes to the extent that they conform to market rates. In the absence of a comparable market, lease costs are recognized for ratemaking purposes to the extent that they conform to depreciation plus an allowance for return on investment (computed as if the asset had been purchased with equity capital). Lease costs which exceed these standards are not recognized for ratemaking purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) For each Association, a market-equivalent return-on-investment is allowed for the net capital invested in the Association by its members. Assets subject to return on investment provisions are subject to reasonableness provisions. If an asset or other investment is not necessary for the provision of pilotage services, the return element is not allowed for ratemaking purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) For ratemaking purposes, the revenues and expenses generated from Association transactions which are not directly related to the provision of pilotage services are included in ratemaking calculations as long as the revenues exceed the expenses from these transactions. For non-pilotage transactions which result in a net financial loss for the Association, the amount of the loss is not recognized for ratemaking purposes. The Director reviews non-pilotage activities to determine if any adversely impact the provision of pilotage service, and may make ratemaking adjustments or take other steps to ensure the provision of pilotage service.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6) Medical, pension, and other benefits paid to pilots, or for the benefit of pilots, by the Association are treated as pilot compensation. The amount recognized for each of these benefits is the cost of these benefits in the most recent union contract for first mates on Great Lakes vessels. Any expenses in excess of this amount are not recognized for ratemaking purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7) Expense items which are not reported to the Director by the Association are not considered by the Director in ratemaking calculations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (8) Expenses are appropriate and allowable if they are reasonable, and directly related to pilotage. Each Association must substantiate its expenses, including legal expenses. In general, the following are not recognized as reasonable expenses for ratemaking purposes:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (i) Undocumented fees;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (ii) Fees for lobbying;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iii) Fees for non-pilotage personal matters;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (iv) Fees which are not commensurate with the work performed; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (v) Any other fees not directly related to pilotage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (9) In any Great Lakes pilotage district where revenues and expenses from Canadian pilots are commingled with revenues and expenses from U.S. pilots, Canadian revenues and expenses are not included in the U.S. calculations for setting pilotage rates.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (10) Profit sharing expenses are not recognized for ratemaking purposes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=80 g=1 f=1 --> &sect;404.10  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=89 g=1 f=1 --> Ratemaking procedures and guidelines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> (a) Appendix A to this part is a description of the types of analyses performed and the methodology followed in the development of Great Lakes pilotage rate adjustments. Ratemaking calculations in Appendix A of this part are made using the definitions and formulas contained in Appendix B of this part. Pilotage rates actually implemented may vary from the results of the calculations in Appendices A and B, because of agreements with Canada requiring identical rates, or because of other circumstances to be determined by the Director. Additional analysis may also be performed as circumstances require. The guidelines contained in &sect;404.05 are applied in the steps identified in Appendix A to this part.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

With the enforcement of the law Korea became  the first tax-free country in the world.    The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the  Democratic People's Republic of Korea that regard it as the  supreme principle of their activities to promote the welfare of  the people have paid deep attention to making the working people  evenly well off and steadily improving their living.    Under the popular policies of the party and the state the  predatory tax system, a leftover of the old society, was  destroyed to give place to a popular tax system after the  liberation of the country. More than fifty kinds of  miscellaneous taxes were abolished and tax was unified.    Even in the difficult period after the war measures were  adopted to systematically reduce the tax burden of the people.    In 1955 the income tax of the factory and office workers was  cut by thirty percent and the tax burden of the handicraftsmen,  entrepreneurs and traders slashed drastically. The rate of the  agricultural tax in kind which accounted for 25 percent of the  harvest dropped to 20.1 percent on an average in the same year  and it again went down to 8.4 percent in 1959.    The agricultural tax in kind from which farmers had been  partially exempted was completely abolished in 1966 so that all  the farm produce could be turned entirely to the improvement of  the living standards of the agricultural working people.    Later, even the negligible income tax levied upon the  factory  and office workers was completely repealed.    The word "tax" is gradually fading in the memory of the  people. The younger generation does not know what it means.    The people enjoy the daily growing, enormous benefits from  the state, far from paying taxes to the state.    The additional benefits rendered by the state under the  social and cultural measures such as free education, free  medical service, paid leave, free accommodation at sanatoria and  holiday homes, old age pension and social security, exceed the  wages of the working people.</p>

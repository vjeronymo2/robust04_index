According to a report released by  Unomoz [UN Operations in Mozambique] today, half the government  and Renamo regulars, are already in confinement centers. The  United Nations representation is now waiting for demobilization  to start on Tuesday [1 March], as scheduled. But Renamo has not  yet handed in the list of its soldiers to be demobilized and to  avoid delays, UN representative Aldo Ajello is proposing that  the government should take the first step. The proposal has  been totally rejected. In statements this evening to RDP, the  Armed Forces chief of staff recalled that such a measure would  infringe the Rome peace agreement:    [Begin recording] [General Antonio Hama Thai] That is  incorrect, that is not what is contained in the agreement, that  is not what we agreed with Renamo. I would like to say this is  my personal view -- we did not agree that, we did not sign that,  we do not have any problems with Renamo. The agreement does not  say that.    [Unidentified correspondent] As far as you are concerned,  the  government should not demobilize before Renamo does so?    [Thai] Of course, it has to be simultaneous, that is what is  contained in the agreement. Because the agreement, the  agreement means that there are signatories. As for this new  story telling people to demobilize, it is a bad one. [end  recording]    That was General Antonio Hama Thai, the Mozambican Army  chief  of staff. The Mozambican Government rejects a two-speed  demobilization.</p>

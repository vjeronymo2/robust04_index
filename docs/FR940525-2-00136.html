By letter dated March 8, 1994, the licensee requested an exemption from the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Section IV.F.2, that would delay the exercise scheduled for 1994 until early 1995. The delay was requested in order to allow for the approval and implementation of revised emergency classification criteria submitted to the NRC by letter dated December 15, 1993, and to avoid conflict with the seventh refueling outage currently scheduled to begin in September 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 50.12(a)(2)(v) of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations provides an example of a special circumstance for which the NRC will consider granting exemptions that involve cases providing only temporary relief from the applicable regulation and for which the licensee has made good faith efforts to comply with the regulation. The licensee completed an annual exercise in December 1993 and had scheduled the 1994 exercise for June 29, 1994. The proposed exemption would delay the 1994 exercise until early 1995, approximately fourteen months after the 1993 exercise, and would not affect the requirement to conduct the normally scheduled 1995 annual exercise. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> The Need for the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The proposed exemption provides temporary relief to delay an annual emergency exercise in order to provide the licensee an opportunity to implement revised emergency classification procedures and avoid conflict with a scheduled refueling outage. The transition to the revised emergency action levels includes NRC review and additional training of licensee personnel. Although these activities are expected to be completed during 1994, scheduling of the exercise for late 1994 would result in its coinciding with activities associated with the seventh outage. Both activities, the exercise and refueling outage, are resource intensive and therefore, it is undesirable to schedule them for the same time period.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission has completed its evaluation of the proposed exemption and concludes that granting of the temporary relief does not affect the configuration of plant systems or any manner of their operation. The proposed exemption is limited to a delay in the conduct of an annual emergency exercise such that the interval between the 1993 exercise and the delayed exercise is extended to approximately fourteen months. The delay in the exercise does not constitute a significant degradation in emergency planning and would therefore not result in an increase in radiological consequences in the event of a major accident involving the release of radioactive materials. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significant radiological evironmental impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemption only involves the action of emergency plan exercises. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents and there are no other nonradiological environmental impact associated with the proposed exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternatives to the Proposed Action <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmental impacts that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives with equal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested exemption and require the licensee to conduct an emergency exercise during the 1994 calendar year. Conducting an exercise prior to implementation of the revised emergency action levels would reduce potential benefits since key event classification procedures would be superseded shortly following the exercise. Conducting the exercise late in 1994 would result in conflicts with the planning and execution of the seventh refueling outage.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Alternate Use of Resource <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in the Final Environmental Statement in the Wolf Creek Generating Station dated June 1982.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Agencies and Persons Consulted <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and consulted with the Kansas State official. The State official had no comments regarding the NRC's proposed action. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Finding of No Significant Impact <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The NRC staff has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed exemption. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemption dated March 8, 1994, which is available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the Local Public Document Rooms, Emporia State University, William Allen White Library, 1200 Commercial Street, Emporia, Kansas 66801 and the Washburn University School of Law Library, Topeka, Kansas 66621. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 19th day of May 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <SIGNER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=06 g=1 f=1 --> James E.

			<p>940923 FT  23 SEP 94 / Komatsu makes it to a milestone Komatsu UK, the hydraulic excavator manufacturer, reaches a milestone today when it hands over its 10,000th machine from its Birtley site in Tyne and Wear. The years since 1985 have not been easy. That was when Komatsu took over the plant from its US rival Caterpillar. After initial rapid growth Komatsu UK saw production slashed from a 1989 peak of 1,900 units to 1,200 in 1992 because of the UK construction industry's dramatic slump. In spite of two bouts of job losses which cut employee numbers from 430 to 350, its Japanese parent insisted it remained committed to Birtley and continued an Pounds 8m investment programme. Now, nearly three years since the dark days of winter 1991-92, Komatsu UK has been helped by a sharp rise in the UK and US markets - although this is counterbalanced by a downturn in Germany, its main export market. It is also having to fight increasing competition from imported and UK-made equipment, but is maintaining a 20 per cent share of the UK market, where it sells a fifth of its output. The rest is exported to continental Europe and Scandinavia. 'It seems like we're running very hard to stand still,' said Komatsu managing director Mr Keith Tipping. But he added: 'We think it's going in the right direction.' This year has seen important advances which could help iron out future troughs in the cyclical construction equipment business. For the first time Komatsu UK has exported to the US, with sales of tracked excavators and machine arms worth Pounds 4m to its parent operation. Arm exports to the US will continue in 1995 and possibly beyond. A wheeled excavator, the second model designed entirely at Birtley, will be launched soon. Until now its designs have been solely for Europe - but it has been asked by its parent to design a new excavator for the world market. Birtley hopes also to win the manufacturing of the model. The plant's turnover this year should be about Pounds 78m and its output 1,300 excavators - less than 60 per cent of its 2,400 unit capacity - but the likely 1995 target is 1,500. 'We have come through the worst,' Mr Tipping said. 'We are certainly looking at more stable prospects.'</p>

			<p>921201 FT  01 DEC 92 / FT selects agency for advertising THE Financial Times has selected the advertising agency Delaney Fletcher Slaymaker Delaney and Bozell to handle its Pounds 1m annual UK advertising campaign. The agency replaces Ogilvy &amp; Mather, which handled FT advertising from 1981 until August. The successful agency was chosen from a shortlist of three - the other two were BMP DDB Needham and Laing Henry. Ogilvy &amp; Mather was responsible for the slogan 'No FT: No Comment'. Mr Terry Damer, the FT's UK marketing director, said: 'We don't expect it (the slogan) to be buried but the new campaign, to be launched early in 1993, will not depend upon it.' The new agency will handle only the UK account. The FT's advertising in continental Europe is created by Ambler Rodford Stevns.</p>

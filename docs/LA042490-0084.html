			<p><P> April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> HAWAII;  </P> <P> 'GLACIER' OF LAVA DESTROYS 3 HOMES  </P> <P> A massive "glacier" of molten rock from erupting Kilauea Volcano destroyed  three more homes in a rural housing area near Kalapana, Hawaii, civil defense  authorities said.  </P> <P> The lava flow from the volcano has destroyed 10 homes in four days. The flow  has halted no more than 40 feet away from another dwelling, following its  pattern of spending long periods reinflating and then suddenly surging forward  to engulf more land. "It's stopped, but it's still hot underneath. We don't  know where it will break out yet," said a civil defense worker.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The dear leader Comrade  Kim Chong-il on June 15 sent a benevolent centenary birthday  table to Yun Chin-ok residing in Kim Chaek City, North Hamgyong  Province.    Born into a fisherman's family, she was subjected to all  manner of maltreatment and humiliation in the period of the  feudal rule and during the harsh Japanese imperialist rule. She  could enjoy a happy life after the liberation of the country  and, now, has attained the age of 100 years thanks to the  popular health policy of the party and the state.    She is still in good health with a family of more than 50.</p>

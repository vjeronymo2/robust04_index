			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / International Company News: BHF ahead 17% at DM238m BHF-Bank, the Frankfurt-based merchant bank, began this month's reporting season for the German banking sector with a set of sparkling figures for the 10 months to the end of October. Partial-operating profits - profits without a contribution from trading activities - rose 17.2 per cent to DM238m (Dollars 149.3m) at the parent bank against the comparable period for last year. The figures, achieved on business volume up 6.7 per cent to DM35.6bn, suggest that the German banking sector remains an island of prosperity amid a rapidly deteriorating economic environment. In the next few weeks, other, larger German banks are expected to report significant profit growth for the 10 months, reflecting strong growth in lending despite high interest rates. Mr Wolfgang Strutz, senior partner, warned, however, that the lending climate had clearly deteriorated in recent months and was likely to do so further over the course of next year. The mounting risks hung 'like Damocles' sword' over the whole banking sector and would be met with extremely vigilant credit assessment, he said. Mr Strutz attributed the profits climb primarily to earnings on interest which rose 12.6 per cent to DM410m in the 10 month period. Fee income from areas such as corporate finance, securities business, and foreign trade financing was of special importance for the bank, he said, and would probably amount to about half of the interest earnings over the full year. BHF, unlike most other larger German banks, gives no figure for total operating profits.</p>

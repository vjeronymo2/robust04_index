			<p>931008 FT  08 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Heseltine returns to cheers THE RETURN of Mr Michael Heseltine to the political stage with a silent appearance at the scene of some of his greatest oratorical triumphs was greeted with an emotional welcome from conference representatives. Making a comeback after his heart attack in June, Mr Heseltine came on the platform to hear Mr Tim Sainsbury, his deputy at the department of trade and industry, announce that the deregulation bill planned for the new parliamentary session would include powers to deregulate in future without necessarily having to go through the process of introducing a bill. The extent of those new powers is still the subject of a behind-the-scenes battle in Whitehall, where other departments are concerned that if these are too wide-ranging then the government will face opposition from constitutionalists in both houses of parliament. The choice of deregulation as one of the government's main themes in the coming months, has struck a chord with the party faithful, who have chosen the issue as the subject for one of this morning's debates. Mr Sainsbury received a sympathetic standing ovation at the end of his speech, but the debate was overshadowed by the reception for Mr Heseltine. Although unable to give the conference one of his customary barnstorming performances, because of his illness, Mr Heseltine cheered the representatives by miming some physical jerks to demonstrate his fitness, and drew his own standing ovation to an end by gesturing to the audience to sit down. He is expected to be back in his department by the time the Commons resumes in ten days, and is due to be interviewed on television this weekend. While Mr Heseltine's conference appearances - he will be on the platform again today for Mr John Major's speech - mark the beginning of his return to political life, there are still questions about how long he will remain in office. But Mr Keith Hampson, one of Mr Heseltine's closest parliamentary colleagues, yesterday dismissed the idea that the trade and industry secretary might not continue in his job. He admitted, however, that Mr Heseltine's absence had already had an impact on the party, contributing to this week's marked rightward shift. He said: 'There is a responsibility that the Tory party has always felt on social policy which I do personally feel has been slightly missing in the tone of this conference and that would have been very much part of Michael Heseltine's performance.'</p>

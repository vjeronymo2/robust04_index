			<p>941019 FT  19 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sappi doubles income to R145m for six months Sappi, the South African pulp and paper company which last week acquired US-based SD Warren, has announced much improved results for the first six months to August, more than doubling attributable income to R144.8m (Dollars 40.5m) from R64.3m, writes Mark Suzman in Johannesburg. Turnover rose 14 per cent to R3.1bn, up from R2.75bn on the back of greatly improved trading conditions in the pulp and paper industry. Operating income rose 105 per cent to R207m from R101m. The company's balance sheet remains strong, with gearing only marginally up at 44 per cent from 41 per cent. However, this picture will change from next year when the debt-laden SD Warren deal is included. Sappi announced that it would change its financial year-end from February to September from next year.</p>

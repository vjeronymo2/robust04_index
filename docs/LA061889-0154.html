			<p><P> June 18, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FUEL OIL SPILL FORCES BRIEF CLOSURE OF BEACH  </P> <P> A diesel fuel spill apparently caused by last week's sinking of a tugboat in  Long Beach forced the brief closing of a small area of beach Saturday in  Newport Beach, authorities said.  </P> <P> The fuel washed ashore between 17th and 19th streets, and the area was closed  for 30 to 40 minutes Saturday morning, said Marine Safety Lt. John Bauer. By  afternoon, the sun had evaporated the fuel, he said.  </P> <P> The fuel spill occurred Wednesday when a Navy attack submarine accidently  snagged the tugboat's towline and dragged the vessel under. One of three men  aboard the tugboat is missing and presumed dead.  </P></p>

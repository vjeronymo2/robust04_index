			<p>Language: <F P=105> Bulgarian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Speech by President Zhelyu Zhelev at National Day ceremony </F> on Mount Shipka in commemoration of the Russian soldiers, other  foreign troops, and Bulgarian volunteers who died in battle  during the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War of Liberation -- live]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Today, 116 years later, as we  look back over the distance that separates us from that  memorable event, we see that despite the vicissitudes of fate  and the trials of history, our people still preserve feelings of  gratitude and appreciation. Alongside this, however, a sense of  national dignity has developed, although this was extremely  debased during the previous regime. Together with the  democratic process, we have strengthened our efforts to follow  an independent foreign policy solely in conformity with our  national interests and with the principles and norms of  international law.    This is why today, while preserving our own firm foreign  policy orientation toward Europe, toward integration into the  European structures, toward the Euro-Atlantic system of  security, the Republic of Bulgaria renounces neither the  historical and cultural values that bind us to Russia, such as  our common Slavonic roots, the alphabet introduced by Cyril and  Methodius, our century-long spiritual and religious links, and  our national liberation, nor do we renounce our economic  positions and interests in the Russian markets and the markets  of the other former Soviet republics. What is more, we consider  that the historical values that bind us together, cleansed of  ideological overlays and freed from political exploitation to  which they were subjected by the communist regime, precisely at  this time are revealing their true value. Now our relations  with Russia are being built upon a democratic foundation of  equality in the eyes of the law. For this reason, no political  force or group in Bulgaria has the right to appropriate or  monopolize the links between our two peoples and countries, nor  identify its narrow party interests with the interests of the  state in relation to Russia. This was the case at one time, and  the sad results of it are sufficiently well-known to all.    On a day such as this, I believe it is important that we  should show that we have dissociated ourselves from violence and  phobias, to recall what happened more than a century ago, and to  realize that we are first and foremost citizens of the Republic  of Bulgaria, within which we not only live but also have common  national interests. In this context, it is foolish to put our  relations with one group of countries in opposition to those  with others. Partisanship in foreign policy has never brought  anything good for our country, all the more now, when the  Balkans are an extremely explosive region.    Apart from everything else, the Third of March returns our  thoughts to Bulgaria's unrealized national ideals. Taught by  the bitter experience of four wars and the ravages wrought by  two uprisings in this century, today we seek to realize these  ideals not though shifting borders, but through opening them up  with free intercourse, by making the Balkans an inseparable part  of a single, democratic, united, civilized Europe.    Homage to the bright memory of the heroes of the War of  Liberation!</p>

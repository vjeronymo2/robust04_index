			<p>930629 FT  29 JUN 93 / World Trade News: US warns of threat to Japan alliance THE US has warned Japan that their economic relationship could become increasingly fraught, straining their security alliance, unless Japan responds to Washington's proposals for a framework for further detailed trade talks. A senior US administration official, speaking after two days of talks in Tokyo ended without agreement, indicated that the US would start to take a firmer approach, and warned Japan that the entire relationship was at stake. He said: 'The relationship as it stands is corroded. The corrosive effects of limited market access and the corrosive effects of Japan's large current account surplus will exacerbate an already difficult bilateral relationship.' The official was reflecting mounting frustration with Japan's refusal to accept numerical measures of the openness of its market. He said the issue was not whether the US would threaten to use sanctions in particular areas: 'The real issue is the long-term quality of the relationship.' It is almost certain that the US and Japan will not meet the original goals set by President Bill Clinton and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa at their April summit. Two days of negotiations in Tokyo ended last night with the US team exhausted and Japan vehemently opposed to targets for opening the Japanese market. The two sides have little disagreement over the five baskets of issues which the US has proposed for discussion, covering areas such as trade in vehicle parts and supercomputers as well as macro-economic imbalances. But Japan is opposed to a specific target for a swift reduction of the current account surplus. The difference between the two sides on this issue is mainly one of how quickly the surplus is reduced.</p>

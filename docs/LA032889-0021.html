			<p><P> March 28, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ REVIEWS ;  </P> <P> JONATHAN BUTLER DID IT -- A STAR IN THE MAKING  </P> <P> The most amazing thing about singer-guitarist Jonathan Butler is that he isn't  better known. With two Grammy nominations and a gold record under his belt, he  would seem ripe for major stardom. But it still hasn't happened.  </P> <P> The South African-born performer's appearance at the Pantages on Friday night  underscored the fact that a good portion of the music audience is missing an  opportunity to see a star in the making. Roving the stage with the dynamic  energy of a young James Brown, ripping off guitar licks with the creative  ingenuity of a George Benson, singing with the style and communication of an Al  Jarreau, Butler gave a performance that was just about as good as a pop music  concert can get.  </P> <P> Add to the fact that he wrote most of the material he sang, and the picture of  an artist destined for much, much bigger things came clearly into focus.  </P> <P> Butler opened his set with an instrumental in which his left-handed guitar  chording exploded with bristling, brasslike clusters. Shifting to single-note  lines, he spun out a sequence of disjunct melodies (blended, occasionally, with  vocal scatting) that took persistently startling twists and turns.  </P> <P> His singing was as good as his playing. On "I'm a Sucker for You" (from his new  album) and "Lies" (a Grammy nomination in 1988), Butler told his stories of  capricious desire in rhythmic bursts of high-voltage energy. Softer ballads --  "True Love Never Fails" and "More Than Friends" (his current single) -- were  treated gentler and more sweetly, but without ever losing the undercurrent of  performing passion that is intrinsic to Butler's singing.  </P> <P> Angela Bofill, opening the program, sounded a bit more subdued than usual.  Halfway through "Down the Line," however, she broke out in a soaring vocal  improvisation that recalled how good she can be when she is at her best.  </P> <P> Saxophonist Najee, also on the bill, displayed characteristically broad strokes  of bright musical colors, but his finest moments came during a beautifully  basic chorus on the standard "When Sunny Gets Blue."DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

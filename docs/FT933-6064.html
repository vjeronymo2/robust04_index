			<p>930831 FT  31 AUG 93 / Observer: Black horse's uncertain bet Now that Barclays has roundly trumped National Westminster, bringing in 41-year-old Martin Taylor, who beats Derek Wanless by four years in the chief executive youth stakes, the question of succession at Lloyds recurs, both men being a generation younger than Lloyds' 61-year-old boss. Brian Pitman, a wise old bird who has avoided some of the obvious pitfalls of the last decade, will bow out in 1995, three years after the bank's retirement age. Inside favourites as next-in-command include 51-year-old Paul Brown, a talented linguist, now heading retail banking. Another front-runner, David Pirrie, three years his senior and in charge of international and private banking, was in 1986 tipped to run Standard Chartered had that eccentric bid gone through. John Anderson, boss of Lloyds' National Bank of New Zealand, is also thought to be in with a chance, even if his British banking experience is limited. None, however, is a sure-fire custodian of Lloyds' daunting reputation as the UK's best-managed bank, so perhaps it is time to search the younger echelons. There are a couple of bright regional heads; Gordon Pell, 43, in charge of Thames Valley, and Dennis Holt, 44, for the south-west. Or perhaps Michael Hepher, 49, who departed for British Telecom two years ago, could be lured back. The real, but unlikely, trump would be a female candidate. Prominent as City regulators - think of Frances Heaton of the Takeover Panel or Rosalind Gilmore at the Building Societies Commission - women have yet to breach the formidable terrain of the senior clearing bank hierarchies. Nor is the current fad for ex-journalists - Taylor, but also Rupert Pennant-Rea - a rich vein. Sarah Hogg, ex-Telegraph journalist turned Number Ten policy unit head, was an outsider as the next Bank of England governor, but running number three of Britain's 'big four' clearers might be a come-down for one sometimes assumed to be running the country.</p>

			<p>930122 FT  22 JAN 93 / International Company News: Amdahl returns to profitability AMDAHL, the US mainframe computer manufacturer, returned to profitability in the fourth quarter and increased revenues by about 27 per cent over third-quarter levels. Net income for the fourth quarter amounted Dollars 2.5m, or 2 cents a share, on revenues of Dollars 745m. This compared with a net loss of Dollars 12.7m, or 11 cents, on revenues of Dollars 389.9m, in the corresponding period a year ago. For the full year, the company recorded a loss of Dollars 7m, or 6 cents a share after charges of 11 cents a share to cover costs of a 9 per cent reduction in workforce completed in November. In 1991, Amdahl reported net income of Dollars 10.6m, or 10 cents per share, including a tax credit of 6 cents. Revenues for 1992 rose 48 per cent to Dollars 2.5bn from Dollars 1.7bn in 1991. The rise in fourth-quarter revenues reflects the normal cyclical pattern in which the largest number of mainframe computer purchases were typically made near year-end, said Mr Joseph Zemke, Amdahl president and chief executive. Sales of data storage products also increased substantially, he added. Mr Zemke noted, however, that prices have been under competitive pressure for much of the year, cutting into profit margins. He remained guarded in his outlook for 1993, particularly the first quarter which is generally the weakest quarter of the year. Tandem Computers announced a 6 per cent increase in first-quarter revenues, which rose to Dollars 483.9m. Net income was Dollars 17.5m, or 16 cents per share, including a gain of Dollars 12.4m, or 11 cents, from a change in accounting for income taxes. In the same quarter a year ago, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 94.6m, or 88 cents a share, after a pre-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 98m. Marketing sales and general expenses declined for the first quarter, Tandem said. As well as continuing to cut costs, it is considering finding partners to invest in some of its subsidiaries.</p>

			<p><P> October 21, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MEASURES THAT TARGET THE USE OF LAND  </P> <P> Re the "Yes on Measure C, No on Measure D" editorial (Oct. 14): This initiative  is not going to "save the beaches or parks" but is directed specifically to  thwart the construction of a sorely needed Par 3 golf course on about 100 acres  of abandoned oil fields and mushroom farms located directly south of Central  Park. This "self-supporting" course would serve some 400 golfers a day -- most  of them senior citizens -- not counting the benefits of extending the green  belt in the area.  </P> <P> What the chief architects of initiative C do not tell you is that they are  residents in an affluent equestrian subdivision south of Ellis Avenue, and the  area in question is used as their own private riding trail at no cost to them.  Further, if you counted three or four at any one time riding there, you would  count a lot. I am not talking about the established horse-riding corral in the  area, which poses no problem.  </P> <P> J.R. OSTERLIND, Huntington Beach  </P></p>

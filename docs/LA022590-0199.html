			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESTIVE NEPALESE ARE TURNING AGAINST HARSH MONARCHICAL RULE;  </P> <P> PROTEST: PRO-DEMOCRACY DEMONSTRATIONS HAVE BROUGHT POLICE GUNFIRE AND DEATHS.  HUNDREDS OF DISSIDENTS WERE JAILED IN A CRACKDOWN.  </P> <P> Jyoti Bagra Shakya had never thought much about democracy until last week.  </P> <P> At 50, his entire life had been his grimy, one-room sweets shop. The poverty  endemic to this remote Himalayan kingdom had largely isolated him from news of  the extraordinary wave of democracy that has been sweeping much of the outside  world.  </P> <P> But then last Monday morning, the most distant ripples of this international  wave touched his little town of Bhaktapur as a pro-democracy demonstration took  place just down the street. Its force changed Shakya's life forever.  </P> <P> His only son was shot and killed by the police.  </P> <P> "Now I would like to die for this," Shakya, told a couple of visitors in the  dingy fluorescence of his shop, his voice trembling with anger and despair. "I  would like to put myself in front of the guns now and shout against this  government."  </P> <P> Today, Shakya and the thousands of other Nepalese who have grown increasingly  disenchanted with three decades of sometimes-harsh monarchical rule will have  their chance.  </P> <P> Billed as "Black Sunday" by its organizers, a planned pro-democracy  demonstration will be the latest in a series of anti-government protests that  have left at least 10 dead and hundreds injured -- and the nation deeply  concerned as it joins in the rising global clamor for democracy.  </P> <P> Leaders of Nepal's pro-democracy movement -- they call it "The Stir" -- say  they were inspired by the recent success of similar movements in Eastern  Europe, an international wave that has finally reached "the top of the world"  in the Himalayan country that is the site of the world's highest mountain, Mt.  Everest.  </P> <P> "The wave of democracy, which is sweeping the whole world, has encouraged the  opposition forces in Nepal," Govinda Biyogi, president of the Nepal Journalists  Assn. and a staunch supporter of The Stir, declared the other day.  </P> <P> So far, though, the government's reaction to the movement has had less in  common with that of most governments in Eastern Europe than with events in  China, Nepal's ally and northern neighbor, where soldiers killed hundreds of  people last spring in suppressing the pro-democracy demonstration in Beijing's  Tian An Men Square.  </P> <P> For example, in Monday's protest in Bhaktapur, the riot police quickly opened  fire, killing at least four people, after the demonstrators began pelting them  with stones. The police started firing even though, according to witnesses,  they outnumbered the protesters by at least 4 to 1.  </P> <P> On Friday, nearly 1,000 Nepalese doctors and nurses staged an emotional sit-in  and silent protest march alleging that police are using special fragmentation  bullets that they said have caused maximum internal injury.  </P> <P> Marching under a banner proclaiming "Medics Against Violations of Human  Rights," the strikers also condemned the police for refusing to release the  bodies of slain demonstrators to their families for cremation rites. The rites  are sacred in Nepal, but police said they fear the corpses might be used as  emotional catalysts in future rallies.  </P> <P> In fact, the crackdown began even before the protest movement got under way  last Sunday in the capital, Katmandu, and other major cities. Government forces  swept through the capital and arrested hundreds of dissidents.  </P> <P> According to a government spokesman, 760 leaders and protesters are now in  jail. But members of the opposition put the number of detainees in the  thousands -- a charge supported by independent diplomats. Even the government  concedes that its jails are so crowded that many prisoners are being held at a  Katmandu granary.  </P> <P> In addition, more than a dozen independent newspapers have been shut down, some  by the government and others in protest after their owners refused to obey  censorship orders.  </P> <P> Now many Nepalese, among the world's friendliest and most engaging people, are  afraid to talk to strangers. The few who do talk decline to give their names.  </P> <P> "No one likes this government now," said one of the many guides who make their  living in Nepal's booming tourist trade. "They're just killing too many people.  And, more and more, the people are blaming it all on the king."  </P> <P> But the campaign for democracy here is unlike any other in the world. What sets  it apart are King Birendra, the Nepalese culture and the monarchical tradition.  </P> <P> "Politics moves to a different rhythm here," one diplomat based in Katmandu  said. "They're much less aggressive, much less violent. This is a society where  the level of political consciousness has never been very high, due largely to  the low literacy, rugged geography and superstitious traditions."  </P> <P> Opposition leaders are not calling for the overthrow of the king, despite a  widely held view that the king has ruled as a virtual autocrat and that his  family is responsible for deep-seated official corruption.  </P> <P> Rather, the opposition is appealing for the king's support in its bid to create  a multi-party system and an elected legislature more independent than the  rubber-stamp National Assembly created by King Birendra's father, Mahendra, 30  years ago.  </P> <P> "So far, there is no one calling for the abolition of the monarchy," the  diplomat said. "The role of the king is an all-important one, part of the  uniqueness of the country."  </P> <P> Nepal is the world's only officially Hindu nation, and many of its 17 million  people still believe that their king is divine, an incarnation of one of many  Hindu gods. He is venerated by many, respected by most and heeded by all.  </P> <P> Yet many analysts are predicting that the king's popularity and power will wane  if he fails to defuse the present crisis.  </P> <P> Members of the National Assembly are popularly elected from among a list of  candidates largely handpicked by the monarchy. This system was adopted in 1960  under King Mahendra after a decade of near-anarchy under a multi-party system.  </P> <P> Supporters of this panchayat system argue that it is a form of democracy best  suited to Nepal, but the National Assembly has never challenged the king or his  Cabinet ministers, not in enacting laws or in making policy.  </P> <P> "This system cannot last forever," another diplomat said.  </P> <P> He predicted that the pro-democracy movement will ultimately bring about some  kind of change.  </P> <P> "The king will have to allow a National Assembly that is more representative of  the people," this diplomat said, "rather than an executive body that does what  it thinks will please the palace."  </P> <P> Diplomats and other analysts said the opposition has been strengthened by a  recently formed alliance with old-guard, conservative politicians from the  Nepalese Congress Party, which ran the multi-party National Assembly in the  1950s, and the hard-line Communist parties, a mixture of Maoists and Marxists  who have strong organizations in several areas.  </P> <P> "The presence of the Communists in the pro-democracy cause makes this a strange  movement," another diplomat observed. "The government loves to point out that  this movement is being led by a discredited ideology."  </P> <P> Up to now, the united opposition has managed to bring only students and old  firebrand politicians into the streets. Most mainstream Nepalese have been  spectators.  </P> <P> But there are indications that popular, grass-roots support is growing,  especially after the shootings Monday in Bhaktapur. It is not clear, though,  whether this support will translate into larger protests in a nation where the  riot police inspire fear.  </P> <P> The Nepalese, who are among the world's poorest people, are reeling from  unprecedented inflation, the result of a yearlong trade dispute with Nepal's  southern neighbor, India. Most analysts predict that continued  government-sponsored bloodshed could easily turn the popular tide in favor of  the demonstrators.  </P> <P> "A lot depends on the kind of police tactics that are used," one diplomat said.  "In the Katmandu demonstrations last Sunday, they were pretty restrained. But  Bhaktapur is an example of precisely what they cannot afford to have happen  here this Sunday, which is seen as an acid test of the future of this  movement."  </P> <P> Bhaktapur was tailor-made for the confrontation. An ancient city of  spectacular, wood-carved temples and palaces, it is deeply mired in poverty and  has been a Communist stronghold for years.  </P> <P> And its recent history is at least as brutal as the ancient Hindu battles  described in Vedic texts. About a year and a half ago, a former Communist  leader who had abandoned the party to join the National Assembly was seized by  a mob while distributing earthquake relief to his supporters. The mob stripped  him naked, poked his eyes out with an umbrella tip, castrated him and then beat  him to death.  </P> <P> It is this kind of violence that the government now fears, analysts said, and  in the angry, desperate eyes of townspeople like Jyoti Bagra Shakya, even an  outsider can detect such sentiment.  </P> <P> Shakya has not been able to claim the body of his son, Nirmal, 24, despite  several days of appealing to police officials and doctors at the hospital  where, he has been told, the young man's remains lie on a mortuary slab.  </P> <P> Every time he has tried, the police have refused. They reiterated their fear,  he said, that he and the townspeople might use the body as the focus for  another anti-government procession.  </P> <P> Such fear seems well-founded. On Thursday, a crowd of several hundred  protesters gathered outside the hospital to demand that the bodies of the  victims of last Sunday's shooting be handed over.  </P></p>

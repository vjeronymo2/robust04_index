			<p>910416 FT  16 APR 91 / UK Company News: What Everyone Wants boosts Amber Day profits to Pounds 5.5m AMBER DAY, the fashion retail group, yesterday reported a sharp increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 5.52m in the six months to January after the acquisition last June of What Everyone Wants, the Northern and Scottish discount shopping chain. The profit compared with Pounds 1.31m, and was achieved on sales up Pounds 44.82m at Pounds 55.45m. Earnings per share rose 84 per cent to 3.86p (2.1p) and the interim dividend is increased to 0.9p (0.7p). Mr Philip Green, the chairman, said that the What Everyone Wants value-for-money formula had proved profitable and resilient in the recessionary climate, and the management had successfully improved gross margins. The interest charge rose to Pounds 1.5m on debt that last year-end stood at Pounds 23m at which time the company had a negative net worth of Pounds 5.6m. Debt is expected to fall Pounds 6-7m by the financial year-end, depending on whether the company sells a department store site in Glasgow, where planning permission has recently been granted, and on the level of year-end stocks. Operating profit from retailing accounted for Pounds 7.17m and should reach Pounds 12m for the full year, brokers said. The Review and Woodhouse menswear businesses, which constituted the core of Amber Day's activity ahead of the What Everyone Wants acquisition, suffered from the recession, particularly in the south of England, and contributed only Pounds 400,000. During the period Mr Gerald Weisfeld, who founded What Everyone Wants with his wife and built the 37 store group, resigned as chairman after a disagreement over the future direction of the company. Mr and Mrs Weisfeld sold their combined 17 per cent stake in Amber Day in February and severed all links including non-executive roles. The group planned to continue its acquisition of cheap leaseholds mainly from receivers, its brokers said. This was unlikely to have a large impact on cash flow as the company never paid more than 'peanuts' for its leases. It would confine its acquisitions to the north of England and to Scotland, where it could control growth, and was unlikely to spread south of Warwickshire.</p>

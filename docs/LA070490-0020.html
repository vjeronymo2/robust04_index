			<p><P> July 4, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK TAKES STEP BACK INTO THE REGION'S PAST;  </P> <P> THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY: CHRONICLES OF AN ABUNDANT LAND, BY WILLIAM F. KING.  WINDSOR PUBLICATIONS INC.. $27.95, 152 PAGES  </P> <P> When the Roman Catholic Church and the Spanish government established La Mision  del Santo Arcangel San Gabriel de Los Temblores in 1769, the surrounding land  was marked chiefly by broad grass plains and clusters of oak and alder trees.  </P> <P> Today, the area known as the San Gabriel Valley is better identified as home to  nine freeways, more than two dozen cities and communities and close to 2  million residents.  </P> <P> That transition from virgin land to major metropolis is the subject of  historian William F. King's "The San Gabriel Valley: Chronicles of an Abundant  Land."  </P> <P> Commissioned by the Alhambra Chamber of Commerce, the book looks at the area's  history and its impact on the rest of California.  </P> <P> For example, as one of the state's most fertile regions, the valley was an  original site of what was to become California's booming citrus industry, King  writes.  </P> <P> In 1940, the state's first freeway was built in the San Gabriel Valley. The  opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway, later called the Pasadena Freeway, ushered  in an era of great highway construction for the West Coast.  </P> <P> Today, King said, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena and the region's  aerospace industry continue to affect the rest of the state, country and world.  </P> <P> A native of Glendora and history professor at Mt. San Antonio College, King  said much of the material for the book came from the college courses he  teaches.  </P> <P> "Chronicles of an Abundant Land" is one of a series of community and regional  histories produced by Windsor Publications. Others in the series include the  San Fernando Valley and St. Paul, Minn.  </P> <P> According to Windsor editor Jeffrey Reeves, the books chronicle histories of  areas that might otherwise go unrecorded. "They tell a story that doesn't  normally get told."  </P></p>

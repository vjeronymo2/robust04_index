			<p>931018 FT  18 OCT 93 / Survey of International Telecommunications (13): Regulators keep tight control - Japan / Japan's telecommunications industry is still highly regulated THIS summer, NTT, the world's second largest telecommunications company, said that fierce competition from competitors was forcing it to seek voluntary retirement among its employees in a bid to reduce staff numbers by 30,000 over the next several years. The move by NTT, which shook a Japanese public long accustomed to stability in the labour market, revealed one of the more unfortunate effects of the growing trend in Japan to liberalise the telecommunications industry. But, while NTT's decision was made in response to market forces, it was also dictated to a large extent by a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications' decree that even in an increasingly competitive environment, the telecommunications operator will cut costs before it is allowed to raise prices where it has the ability to do so. NTT's plight stems from a need to adjust its operations to a fast-changing environment. It will have to make further adjustments as the Japanese telecommunications industry, in common with those of other leading economies, undergoes a period of rapid transformation that is being triggered by the speed of advances in telecommunications technology. Optical fibre technology, for example, is making it possible to offer more advanced and speedier forms of communications, such as video on demand or video conferencing services. But, while such technological progress forms the basis for change in the industry, it is the policy decisions made by public regulators striving to keep pace with the technology that determines the nature of the changes the industry will have to live with. Despite a broad move towards deregulation in the country, regulation of the telecommunications industry in Japan is still very tight, and there are few signs that the grip of the regulators is set to relax dramatically in the next few years. Characteristically, the Japanese authorities continue to take a paternalistic attitude towards the telecommunications industry, which they see primarily as a provider of a public service. That view has shaped their approach not only to the liberalisation of the telecoms market but also to the introduction of the new services that are becoming possible with the rapid advances in fibre optics technology. The enhancement of capacity and speed will make telecommunications a key element of Japan's social infrastructure by making possible new services, such as improved teleconferencing, interactive TV and video on demand, says Mr Tetsuo Yamakawa, senior advisor in the communications policy bureau of the policy division at the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. This, in turn, will help revitalise manufacturing industry, ease overcrowding in cities and improve the quality of life, he believes. But at the same time, however, these changes throw up difficulties that are challenging the Japanese authorities' ability to decide what policies are in the best public interest. The spread of fibre optics, which allows broadcasting and telecommunications services to be provided on the same network, will erode the boundary that separates the two industries. While this may not normally be a problem for industries that operate strictly on market forces, it is posing a major dilemma for the Telecommunications Ministry which sees a fundamental difference in the aims of the two industries. 'The problem with putting broadcasting and telecommunications on one network is that broadcasting is a service that is by its nature open, whereas telecommunications is private and closed,' says Mr Yamakawa. 'Is it a good idea to put these two industries together?' he asks. The other problem, Mr Yamakawa points out, is that the two industries are structured completely differently. The broadcasting industry only has to worry about making profits, whereas the telecommunications industry must concern itself with the needs of the public. If the two businesses come together, which will take priority, profits or the public? Next spring, the ministry is beginning a pilot project to study the feasibility of integrating broadcasting and telecommunications services through optic fibre networks. The pilot project, supported by telecommunications carriers, broadcasters and equipment manufacturers from both Japan and overseas, will construct a model network including 300 end-user facilities in the Kansai Science City near Kyoto, Osaka and Nara. It will provide high definition TV, bilateral advanced cable TV, video on demand, videophone and video-conferencing services on an experimental basis. The ministry sees the pilot project as an experiment in policy rather than technology - 'we will be considering through the project, who should be the provider of the new integrated services,' Mr Yamakawa says. The pilot project will go on for three years. In the meantime, a government advisory committe which is deliberating on the issue, will present its proposal next March on how the infrastructure for the new telecommunications network should be built. In parallel with these developments in their home market, Japan's telecom operators are facing the need to keep pace with developments on the international front to secure new sources of revenue but also to ensure that they do not get left behind in the race to provide new telecommunications services. The separation of domestic and international telecommunications businesses under Japanese law makes this extremely difficult. 'Telecommunications is a trans-national business, so separating the two sides is like putting a rope around your own neck,' says Mr Kazuo Asada, senior vice president of international affairs at NTT. But an easing of this rule of separation by the Ministry last May is providing possibilities Japan's telecommunications operators did not have before. Although domestic carriers are not allowed to do trans-national business, they are now allowed to operate within the domestic market of a foreign country. The relaxation of the rule is encouraging NTT, for example, to move into the mobile communications and mulitmedia businesses outside Japan. Mr Asada is interested in the US in particular, since that country is a melting pot of new communications technology and services and would provide opportunities to test the company's hand at new services such as personal handy phones which combine computer capabilities with mobile communications. Mr Asada is looking for opportunities to tie up with a cable operator in the US or form a joint venture with a mobile phones business there. 'We want to do something different from conventional phone business,' he says. While Japan's technological know-how in telecommunications has a high reputation internationally, the restrictions imposed by the country's regulatory regime has made it necessary for the Japanese industry to follow the lead of the US in providing new services. The hopes in the industry are that the regulators will take a more forward-looking view in their decision over who should provide the next generation network.</p>

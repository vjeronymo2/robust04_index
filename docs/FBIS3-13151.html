In an exclusive interview with Palestinian reporters at the  Israeli Foreign Ministry, Peres said that if talks are held on  the final stage, the two sides will reach more documents and  papers but the situation on the ground will not change.  Instead, he called for concluding the negotiations within  several days and implementing the transfer of power, including  the arrival of the Palestinian leadership and police force, so  that they would take charge of the situation in Jericho and the  Gaza Strip.    Peres said that subsequently it will be possible to  negotiate  over expanding the area of Palestinian control, whereby it will  include all the occupied territories. Afterward, talks will  begin on the final status.    In response to the journalists' questions about disarming  the  settlers and negotiating on settlement activity and  international protection, Peres said that those steps pose  complications because Rabin's government relies on a one-vote  majority in the Knesset. Despite this, Peres believes that  acceptance of the Gaza-Jericho plan, which he described as a  first step, will lead to a tangible change among the Palestinian  people.    Regarding the continuation of settlement activity and the  confiscation of land, Peres vehemently denied that land  confiscation was continuing except for street expansion and  nature protection. When one of the journalists presented him  details of land confiscation, Peres said that he would study the  issue.    With regard to evacuating the settlers from Hebron, Peres  said that he would state his position on this issue in the  cabinet meetings, but he added that there were legal problems in  terms of evacuating the settlers en masse.    In answer to a question about whether it was possible to  vacate the Hebron bus station, taken over by the Israeli Army  since 1980, Peres said that he would study the matter. During  the meeting, which lasted more than an hour, Peres tried to  persuade the journalists to defend the peace process, saying  that it was the best practical means for achieving Palestinian  demands and aspirations. Peres expressed understanding of the  Palestinian position's dilemma. He said that anyone who  participates in a peace process will lose popularity because  peace requires concessions from both parties. It is common  knowledge that concessions do not increase the leadership's  popularity.    Peres urged the Palestinian people to support 'Arafat  despite  all the difficulties. He said that the Palestinian people  should be more supportive of 'Arafat, because he has given them  something tangible by negotiating cleverly. Every Palestinian  leader in the past failed to do this, and the Palestinian  problem had remained in limbo. [passage omitted]    In answer to a question about the UN Security Council  deliberations, Peres said that Israel's objection to applying  the Geneva Conventions to the occupied territories stems from  the fact that Jerusalem has been included in the resolution.  This is opposed by Israel, because it considers Jerusalem to be  part of Israel, not part of the occupied territories.    On whether a meeting between Rabin and 'Arafat was possible,  Peres said that they will meet to sign the agreement and not  earlier, but contacts are under way on different levels and  through different channels.</p>

			<p><P> June 25, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE PEOPLE PROF;  </P> <P> WHAT DO YUPPIES, GANGS SHARE? A UCLA ANTHROPOLOGIST KNOWS  </P> <P> Walter Goldschmidt lives worlds away from the violent streets of South-Central  Los Angeles. He has a house and study in an idyllic setting high above Bel-Air  -- trees and flowering bushes line the lane, goldfish and water lilies float in  a brick-lined pool, a waterfall quietly trickles down a rocky hillside. Yet the  professor emeritus of anthropology at UCLA finds himself in accord with the  judgments that residents of South Central have been passing on "Operation  Streetsweep," the recent nationwide roundup and arrest of scores of suspected  gang members.  </P> <P> "Those guys are right. It's not the way to tackle the problem," Goldschmidt  says, adding that he was not against the arrests per se, but that they are  ineffective in the long run. The actions of gang members are often antisocial,  but the motivation behind them, he says, is the universal need for acceptance.  </P> <P> "We have to create an environment to which boys, and to some extent girls, are  drawn, where they can see positive opportunities, the possibility of being part  of the mainstream culture that many of them want to be in."  </P> <P> Goldschmidt says all people have the same need for recognition, validation and  acceptance from their culture and subcultures. Getting it constitutes what he  calls the "human career." As with gang members, so with yuppies on the career  ladders of corporate America, so with faculty members aiming for tenure and  departmental chairs, so with the Tlingit Indians of southeastern Alaska, giving  away their worldly goods to rival clans in order to demonstrate the power and  prestige of their tribe over others.  </P> <P> "Every man and every woman in every human society is engaged in the pursuit of  career," Goldschmidt says, and while the nature of the pursuit varies with each  group, the basic drive is the same: "the need to validate oneself, the desire  for acceptance and prestige."  </P> <P> He does not mean career in a narrow sense -- the "human" career includes such  activities as creation of a family, public conduct, even the making of one's  living space -- all the things that "the people of his or her community think  makes a good person."  </P> <P> Goldschmidt calls this need for a positive response "affect hunger," and he  traces it to both biological and cultural programming. Affect hunger can be  seen in various species of animals as they groom each other in the forest and  care for their offspring.  </P> <P> Much of Goldschmidt's own human career as an anthropologist has been spent  researching and developing that view of human nature. Recently he pulled his  ideas together, using his own and others' field research, in a book titled "The  Human Career: The Self in the Symbolic World," published by Basil Blackman.  </P> <P> Now 77, Goldschmidt, who first joined the UCLA faculty in 1946 after receiving  his doctorate from UC Berkeley and working for the Department of Agriculture,  has made it his life's work to make anthropology more relevant to contemporary  society and problems.  </P> <P> He talks about his life's work -- which includes studies of the Sebai people in  Uganda, Indian tribes in Northern California, and an agricultural community in  California's Central Valley -- first in his living room filled with Chinese  furniture and antiques, then in his study, a light-filled  book-and-memorabilia-lined place overlooking the garden.  </P> <P> Operation Streetsweep is not the first time he has thought about gangs.  </P> <P> When Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates announced in 1988 that the department  was declaring war on gangs, Goldschmidt predicted the violence would increase,  the killings would go up. Which they did. That year, gang-related killings  increased by 25% over 1987.  </P> <P> "It served only to challenge them," he says. In "The Human Career" he writes of  Gates' action and choice of the war metaphor, saying it "feeds directly into  the central values of the gang, (machismo and loyalty) inevitably evoking a  spirit of revenge."  </P> <P> "I think the solution is obvious and expensive," Goldschmidt continues. "We  have to offer real career opportunities to underclass youth. Getting them to  play football and basketball against each other is not enough. We've got to  make it clear at the ground level that there really are opportunities, and get  these children being courted by the gangs. Get them to see the payoff may not  be as fast but it's more certain and satisfying.  </P> <P> "It'll be expensive, but not as expensive as what we're paying now. We are  spending a lot of money on the problem. We're spending it on police; we're  building jails like crazy rather than schools and teachers salaries. It's not a  simple solution but it's the only one." Gangs are not the only element of  society where the values of the group work negatively against the values, or  welfare, of the larger society. Goldschmidt sees a similar dynamic in the  Chernobyl and Challenger disasters.  </P> <P> "If there's a disaster, like a plane crash," he says, people always ask, 'Was  it a human error, or was it a technological error?' But there's a third  question: 'Was the error at the organizational level, the institutional level?'  "  </P> <P> That was the case with the Challenger and Chernobyl incidents, he says. In both  the American and Soviet disasters, overzealous bureaucrats were working to make  their boss, their company, their division, their politicians look good.  </P> <P> "There were people performing responsible acts, acting with the best of  motives, or motives viewed as best. And yet, (the disasters) proved such people  could be just as destructive as those feathering their nests. The institutions  were inadequate. They did not create a moral environment to meet the  situation."  </P> <P> Whether gang members, bureaucrats or aborigines, he says, the task for society  is the same: to provide institutions and rewards that harness selfish  motivations so they can serve the common good. "That's what totemism is all  about."  </P> <P> Totems, objects that are emblems or symbols of a group and which frequently  serve some sort of mystical function, are crucial to him -- and to us. Whether  the flag, a monument, a sacred relic of the past, or individual status symbols  -- the sports car, the Phi Beta key, the club membership, the regimental tie or  the gang's colors -- they help define a person's status and achievement in a  culture.  </P> <P> In Goldschmidt's career there have been an abundance of such markers, some of  them predictable: the chairmanship of UCLA's anthropology department, grants  and fellowships from Fullbright, the Ford Foundation, the National Science  Foundation, the National Institute of Mental Health, presidency of the American  Anthropological Assn. and the American Ethnological Society.  </P> <P> Twice his former students honored him with an old academic custom, presenting  him with a limited edition of bound copies of essays they had written in his  honor. In February, on the 30th anniversary of the founding of the African  Studies Center at UCLA, which coincided with Goldschmidt's 77th birthday, the  academic community honored him for his leading role in establishing the center  by throwing him a "thousand moons" party. (Based on a lunar calendar, he was  1,000 moons old.) Emeritus since 1983, he still teaches several classes for the  department, "elementary Goldschmidt and a seminar."  </P> <P> Closer to home, there is his family. Saying, "there's no fool like an old  fool," Goldschmidt reaches for some photos "at the ready" on an end table and  shows off his first grandchild, marveling at his pleasure in having people tell  him she looks like him.  </P> <P> He has two sons, Karl and Mark, both in Los Angeles. He married his wife, Gale,  in 1937. They spent their honeymoon among the Hupa Indians in the Pacific  Northwest, watching the White Deerskin Dance, and spent much of their life  together working closely, collaborating in research but not writing, with Gale  taking many of the photographs that illustrate his books. For the past few  years she has been hospitalized with Alzheimer's disease.  </P> <P> Goldschmidt, who was born in 1913 to German immigrant parents in San Antonio,  Tex., received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from the University of Texas, before  going to Berkeley in 1935.  </P> <P> Although most of his professional reputation is as an Africanist and derives  from the work he did among the Sebai people in Uganda, his early research  focused on Indian tribes in the Pacific Northwest, the Nomlaki and the Hupa.  </P> <P> His doctoral research, studying the effects of industrialization on an  agricultural community -- Wasco, Ca. -- led to his work with the Department of  Agriculture, conducting a comparative study of two rural communities: one  composed of traditional, small family farms; the other adapting to large-scale  industrialized farming.  </P> <P> All of that research may be eclectic, but it does not mean it is without a  pattern, all of it sharpening and focusing the fundamental questions and  hunches about why we are the way we are and how we got to be that way. And,  Goldschmidt says, with a long list of books and publications along the way, it  all led to "The Human Career."  </P> <P> "I think anthropology has a lot to say about human nature," he says, going on  to describe what he attempts in his latest book. "It's an effort to bring  together ideas of our biological heritage as animals and what we've done with  it through the process of creating a second world, a symbolic world. We live in  two worlds at the same time."  </P> <P> For the individual, he says, the process begins in infancy. There is a dynamic  between biology and culture, he says, and what starts out as infantile  programming becomes the process by which all human experience of things is  transformed into the symbolic world.  </P> <P> "The child is inducted into this world," he says, and, driven by affect hunger,  endeavors to evoke a positive response from his environment.  </P> <P> Goldschmidt has spent his academic life studying what makes man a social,  morally responsible being, immersing himself in the symbols, rituals and  beliefs that form societies and hold them together.  </P> <P> Ironically, he says, it was probably atheism that got him into anthropology.  </P> <P> "I was raised an atheist with a high sense of morality, too much morality.  That's what gave me the questions."  </P> <P> Somehow or other, he says, human beings evolved into something more than a band  of monkeys. The somehow has to do with the creation of symbols, shared values  and beliefs.  </P> <P> "You have to get people to feel the clan is important, and to feel strongly  about each other. I've come to the conclusion . . . that the ability to  believe, the suspension of disbelief, is an essential ingredient in the  transition of the prehuman to the human. . . . To me, religion is all a great  metaphor for the human capacity to have empathy for a fellow human being."  </P> <P> Human nature is nothing if not fascinating, and, sounding as if, overall, he  rather likes it, he says of his lifelong pursuit: "This was the genesis of it  -- wanting to know how human beings got to be the crazy animals they are."  </P></p>

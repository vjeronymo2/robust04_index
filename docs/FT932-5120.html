			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Masters of fudge declare a victory: South Africa's constitutional talks veer from the sublime to the ridiculous It was an unedifying spectacle. After bargaining all day and into the night on Thursday, South Africa's constitutional negotiators reached what can only be described as a tentative provisional agreement to recommend a date for the first multi-racial elections. Then they declared victory, and went home. Thursday's 'decision' by the 26-party constitutional body, that elections should be held on April 27 next year, has no more than symbolic significance. It must first be confirmed by the same 26 delegations who failed to confirm it on Thursday; then it must be ratified by their political masters, at a meeting of the 208-member 'negotiating council' on June 25. And then, most difficult of all, delegates must agree a constitution under which elections can be held. Until they do, April 27 1994 is no more than a target. With luck, the simple existence of that target will, in the words of Mr Joe Slovo, delegate from the South African Communist party, 'put a fire under' the negotiators. Now that they have set that target - however conditionally  -they dare not ignore it; to do so would be political suicide. Indeed, it was to prevent the political suicide of the African National Congress leadership that a date was set at all. ANC leaders had promised their increasingly restive constituents that a date would be set by the end of May. They could not afford to disappoint them. Small wonder that ANC leader Nelson Mandela chose to embrace chief government negotiator Roelf Meyer after the decision. The government, which supported the date, had saved him and other moderate leaders from the wrath of the militant ANC youth, who had already threatened protests unless a date was set. But it may prove a pyrrhic victory. To hold elections next April, delegates must agree a new constitution by September at the latest (this will be referred to as the 'interim' constitution, to remain in force until the election provides a constituent assembly to write a permanent one). They must agree the principles by which writers of a final constitution will be bound; resolve more immediate problems such as the powers of the so-called Transitional Executive Council (TEC), due to take power soon to oversee government in the transition; put in place independent commissions to oversee elections and the state broadcast media in the transition; resolve the vexed issue of joint control of the security forces and political armies; agree a bill of rights for the transition. The list goes on. But so far, with few exceptions, delegates have taken the line of least resistance on all these issues - refer the problem to a 'technical committee' and hold a press conference to claim triumph. Thursday provided ample examples of this syndrome. Delegates congratulated themselves for 'tabling' (not agreeing, which is something they could not do) proposals on combating violence. They commended each other for 'receiving' proposals on devolution of power to regions, and for establishing a commission to demarcate regions. It would be splendid farce, if it were not so serious. On the central issue of whether South Africa should be a unitary or a federal state - the issue which will determine whether several of the 26 parties will sign an eventual agreement - delegates staged a masterly fudge. Faced with opposition from the secessionist Conservative party to a principle declaring South Africa a 'single sovereign state', delegate Rowan Cronje, from the black homeland of Bophuthatswana, declared that this did not exclude the Conservatives' demand for a separate Afrikaner homeland. His reasoning was that 'South Africa' would still be a single sovereign state even if there was another single sovereign state of 'Afrikanerland' in its midst. So the problem was not resolved but avoided - and Mr Cronje was proposed (privately) for the title 'man of the negotiations' by a government official. Delegates moved on to debate extensively whether the constitution should forbid Moslem men from mistreating their wives (Catholics will apparently be free to do so), as well as other gender issues. But at least the conference avoided the embarrassment of one recent session, when debate had to be interrupted because two delegations had no female representation (each is meant to be a man-woman team). Once women were found to complement delegation leaders from the Transkei and Solidarity party, proceedings resumed. (The government delegation fielded a secretary to fill its female seat.) Though the ridiculous vies daily with the sublime at the talks - and often wins - concrete progress is gradually being made. Earlier this week, delegates moved toward agreeing the process by which South Africa should reach democracy - in two phases, with an interim constitution written by the present body and a final one by an elected constituent assembly (though the KwaZulu government, speaking for Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, gave notice on Thursday that it was having second thoughts about this agreement). And delegates are finally on the point of debating the detailed distribution of power between central, regional and local governments under the interim constitution (as well as a devolution principle to guide a final constitution). But as one government minister commented privately this week: 'When you take away all the fancy documents, we are at the same point as last year at this time.' There are more parties participating in the talks; but their continued presence is guaranteed only by avoiding the hard issues. South Africa's constitution obviously needs broad multi-party support to gain legitimacy, but not if the quest for legitimacy compromises agreement itself.</p>

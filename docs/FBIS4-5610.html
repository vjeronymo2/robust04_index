			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Haruo Shimada, professor of economics, Keio </F> University: "A Difficult Choice for Japan"; from "My Viewpoint"  column]    [Text] The United States has demanded the unification of  labor standards, bringing up the topic as a new issue in  post-Uruguay Round trade talks. We may say this is natural for  Western nations. This implies that these nations seek to limit  exports by developing countries and secure employment at home.  Wages are low in developing countries. On top of this, these  countries are proceeding to destroy price standards on a global  economic scale by keeping the exchange rate of their currencies  lower than their actual values. In this way, these countries  are definitely taking away jobs from workers in the major  industrialized nations.    It can be well expected that sooner or later, Japan, too,  will tread the same path as the Western nations because, among  other reasons, it has proceeded with technological transplants,  and its domestic industries have been hollowing out.  Consequently, Japan should go along with the United States, but  that would antagonize Asian countries. Therefore, Japan cannot  choose this option. In that case, the only alternative is for  Japan to thoroughly open its markets to foreign access and, as a  result, help create more jobs. Unless Japan promotes industrial  restructuring and clenches its teeth to strive toward high net  productivity, it will not be able to open its markets to  developing countries' products, nor will the Japanese economy  continue to thrive in the future.</p>

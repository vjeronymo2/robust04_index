			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Chuanxi (1728 0278 3556)] </F>   [Text] Guangzhou, 18 Jan (ZHONGGUO XINWEN SHE)--A  resolution adopted by the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress  Standing Committee today said the province still has not gone  far enough in the anticorruption operation and various  localities need to further step up their efforts to fight  corruption.    The "Resolution on Carrying on the Struggle Against  Corruption Further in Depth Across the Province" adopted at a  meeting of the Eighth Guangdong Provincial People's Congress  Standing Committee this morning pointed out bluntly the  seriousness of some corrupt social phenomena. The resolution  said: "Some corrupt phenomena in state organs have aroused  strong grievances among the public. If these corrupt phenomena  are allowed to spread unchecked, they will one day ruin our  people's regime."    It is disclosed that recently some 23,000 cadres at and  above  the county and office level in Guangdong underwent a  self-examination process, and some 16 percent of these cadres  admitted that their behavior in certain aspects did not fully  meet the standards as prescribed by the "five rules" set by the  central authorities on honesty and self-discipline.    This resolution by the provincial people's congress demands  that people's congresses at all levels in Guangdong Province  take the struggle against corruption as an important part of  their supervisory duty and strengthen supervision over the  operation of the government, the people's courts, and the  people's procuratorates, as well as grass-roots organizations in  townships and towns.    The ongoing meeting of the Standing Committee of the Eighth  Guangdong Provincial People's Congress has heard reports by  departments concerned on recent progress in the anticorruption  operation. Some ugly social phenomena and some issues of  corruption among some government staff have drawn great  attention from members of the people's congress standing  committee.    Standing committee member Rao Fanzi held that the main  reason  for worsening corruption is not the lack of applicable laws, but  the failure to observe laws. A small number of individuals just  fail to rule according to law, and some of those who enforce the  law violate the law themselves or engage in illegal activities.    Standing committee member Liu Wenqiao noted that practicing  extravagance in ceremonies and festivities, vacationing at  public expense, and rush purchasing of luxury cars are very  common and have become serious problems in Guangdong nowadays.  These practices should be checked and redressed.</p>

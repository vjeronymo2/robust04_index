			<p>BFN     [Text] Pusan, April 30 (YONHAP) -- Chinese patrol boats  seized two South Korean dragnet fishing boats and took away one  boat and 22 fishermen on Friday.    When the No. 2 Songgwang-ho, 98 tons, was under repairs in  the seas about 220 miles southwest of Cheju Island around noon,  a Chinese patrol boat seized it and whisked its Skipper Sin  Hyon-pok, 43, and 10 fishermen to the patrol boat to tow the  empty boat to China, the No. 1 Songgwang-ho, a sister boat of  the seized one, cabled to the Pusan Marine Police Saturday.    The Chinese boat gave up the No. 2 Songgwang-ho, cutting the  rope, when the sister boat chased it, the cable said.    Another Chinese boat also seized and took away the No. 27  Taehung-ho, 123 tons, with 11 crewmen, including Skipper Pak  Hong-yang, 40, aboard, in the open seas 175 miles southwest of  Cheju Island about the same time when it was adrift owing to  engine trouble, according to the Pusan Marine Police.    Although the No. 2 Songgwang-ho was caught in an area  believed to be China's territorial waters, the No. 27  Taehung-ho was seized in open seas and this is expected to cause  a diplomatic row between Seoul and Beijing, the police said.</p>

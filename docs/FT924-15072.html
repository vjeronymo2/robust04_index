			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Italian lira yo-yos wildly against DM THE ITALIAN lira oscillated wildly on the foreign exchanges yesterday following the announcement by trade unions of a four-hour general strike next Tuesday and growing concern about slow parliamentary approval of the 1993 budget. The lira plunged to 980 against the D-Mark in early trading, before recovering to a L948-L952 range by mid-morning and L930 by early afternoon. Later, the Bank of Italy's indicative rates put the lira at L927, down marginally from L925.49 on Monday. Dealers admitted the heavy fall had been exaggerated by relatively thin trading. However, they warned that yesterday morning's speculative attack had brought the currency close to the L1,000 level originally proposed by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, as a realistic future parity. Earlier this year, forecasts of the L1,000 rate drew sharp criticisms from ministers. The steady fall in the lira - it has now lost more than a fifth of its value from last month's pre-devaluation levels against the D-Mark - has been attributed largely to speculation at a time of a political vacuum pending parliamentary approval for the budget. Recent auctions of government bonds have caused concern that the Bank of Italy might have difficulty finding buyers for Italian government debt. 'Prices for 10-year government bonds at Monday's auction were so low that investors are growing worried that the central bank may have to step in and monetise the debt, fuelling inflation,' said an economist at one leading bank. However, many domestic observers now believe the lira has 'overshot'. Mr Claudio Cavazza, a spokesman for the Confindustria employers' federation, thought the currency was now 'undervalued'. The first step to alleviate the current currency crisis was 'to approve the budget. . . . It's necessary to send a positive signal abroad, because every day which passes costs us very dear', he said. Economists doubt Italy's European Community partners will accept a fall of more than 20 per cent because of the sharp boost it would give to Italian exports. Editorial comment, Page 18</p>

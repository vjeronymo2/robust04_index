			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Kostas Venizelos] </F>   [Text] The Cypriot Government submitted seven proposals to  the United Nations on the future of the Cyprus issue. Foreign  Minister Alekos Mikhailidhis is presenting this document during  his U.S. meetings. According to reports, the foreign minister  notes that this policy will create the appropriate climate for a  solution, not the confidence-building measures as the United  States is suggesting.    On the other hand, an effort by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf  Denktas to appear as if he is accepting the confidence-building  measures fell apart following a statement-denial by Gustave  Feissel, the UN secretary general's alternate special  representative in Cyprus. UN Secretary General Butrus  Butrus-Ghali and the Security Council will decide whether  Denktas' clarifications are satisfactory. Reports say that the  occupation leader listed a series of conditions on the document  that cancel out its acceptance.    Government Spokesman Ioannis Kasoulidhis confirmed that a  document has been sent to the UN Secretariat but avoided  revealing its contents. Turkish Cypriot newspaper KIBRIS  yesterday referred extensively to the document, and diplomatic  sources confirmed to I SIMERINI its validity. The document  reiterates Nicosia's decision not to resume talks on the  confidence-building measures and Nicosia's warning that it will  withdraw its support for the 21 March UN document and promote  its own reservations. The seven proposals are as  follows:     -  First: The demilitarization of the  island.    -  Second: The issue of guarantees in a future  solution.    -  Third: A UN Security Council reconfirmation that it  will not accept any decision but one based on one sovereignty,  nationality, and international image.    -  Fourth: An issue of  demographic changes and a population census.    -  Fifth: The Turkish  troops issue.    -  Sixth: An appeal for Turkey to return Famagusta  according to UN Security Council resolution 550.    -  Seventh: An  appeal by the five UN Security Council permanent representatives  for European Union representation in the talks.     In any case, questions have been raised about yesterday's  meeting between UN officials and Denktas. In his statement,  Denktas appeared to have accepted everything. He said: "We  have accepted the UN demands and they promised to incorporate  what was agreed in Vienna into the document." Clarifying on  which positions he had changed, Denktas referred to the issue of  access to Famagusta's fenced-off area, which remained one of the  basic obstacles. Denktas said he agreed to move the Turkish  troops 1 kilometer according to UN wishes, but noted by doing  this (the Attila) will approach the National Guard positions by  200 meters. At the same time he agreed to move the "police"  station from the eastern part of Dherynia Road and that the  international organization will cover the cost.    New York will evaluate Denktas' clarifications (which  Butrus-Ghali demanded) and decide whether these positions  constitute an agreement for the talks to continue. In any case  Feissel described Denktas' clarifications as positive, but as  soon as his statements became known he was quick to say that it  is Denktas' personal view that he has accepted the document. He  even clarified that he made no promises.    Feissel had a telephone conversation with the president and  briefed him on the meeting. According to our information,  Kliridhis did not want to be informed about Denktas' positions;  he only wanted to know whether or not he had accepted the 21  March UN document. Yesterday the government spokesman said that  Denktas' remarks do not constitute an acceptance of the document  and added that our side was not told that Denktas' positions  constitute satisfactory answers.    Yesterday, Feissel sent the UN secretary general a report on  his meeting with Denktas.</p>

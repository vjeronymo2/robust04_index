			<p>BFN     [Text] London, May 4 (CTK) -- Central European states'  "cooperation with other countries -- be they Visegrad partners  or elsewhere in the region -- remains a useful preparation for  the discipline of eventual membership (of the European Union  [EU])," British Secretary of State Douglas Hurd told CTK today.    However, it is "quite possible -- perhaps even likely --  that  different members of the Visegrad Group (the Czech Republic,  Hungary, Poland, and Slovakia) will fulfil the political and  economic conditions for EU membership at different times," Hurd  said in an interview with CTK before his visit to Prague next  week. "Appllications from individual Central European countries  will be judged on their own merits by the member states," he  added.    Hurd said "the main task for the Czech Republic is that of  adjusting its legislation and administrative rules to European  standards so that it will be able to play full part in the  single market."    Asked about EU trade restrictions of the imports of the  goods  that the Central Europeans produce most efficiently, Hurd stated  that "politicians must be prepared to act if (Western) markets  are to be kept open" for the goods from Central and Eastern  Europe. "That is why the United Kingdom has consistently opposed  proposals for measures restricting trade to the Czech Republic  unless they have a clear economic justification," Hurd said.    As for the Czech Republic's membership of NATO, about which  Russia has had reservations, Hurd said it was "important to  bring home to the Russians that integrating the countries of  Central Europe into Western institutions will enhance regional  stability -- which is in the interest of us all." He said he  welcomed and considered still valid the statement made by  Russian President Boris Yeltsin during his visits to Warsaw and  Prague last August, that "it is the sovereign right of every  nation to decide to which alliances it belongs."    Hurd pointed out that the Czech-British relationship was  "very close" now, and mentioned the Czech and Slovak servicemen  who had fallen in defending freedom during the Second World War.</p>

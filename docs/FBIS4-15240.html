			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Literally a few minutes before the start of our  program, the Information Television Agency received a statement  issued by Russian President Boris Yeltsin, which expresses  regret that the results of the voting in the Federation Council  did not make it possible to adopt a final decision on the  appointment of a procurator general. This outcome, the document  says, does not mean that the former procurator general will  return to his post; and thus Aleksey Ilyushenko will remain as  acting procurator general. The president also considers that the  Federation Council deputies who have been invested with the  people's trust will find a suitable way out of the situation  that has arisen.</p>

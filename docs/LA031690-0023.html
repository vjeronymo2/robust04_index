			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOB HOPE'S 7,400 ACRES  </P> <P> In "Park Advocates Pressure Bob Hope for Land Gift" (Part A, March 7), it  stated that when Bob Hope views his land he sees it as a potential golf course.  But when I look at his land in Corral Canyon, I see a place of beauty and my  only real home.  </P> <P> I grew up in Corral Canyon, and as a boy I used to explore its cliffs and  caves, untouched by mankind since the Chumash Indians first tread there. Now I  live in the city, but my heart still remains in Corral Canyon.  </P> <P> Now Hope plans to sell the canyon to Sun Pacific to build an exclusive country  club. But how does one put a golf course, which must be fairly flat, into a  canyon with towering thousand-foot cliffs? The plans are to move 5 million  cubic yards of earth, equal to one and a half times the volume of the Great  Pyramid. To Hope this may be one of the great wonders of the golfing world. But  to those who love the canyon and places like it, the great wonder is why the  Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors would approve such a massive  desecration of the land. The supervisors apparently favor this project so  highly that they gerrymandered Corral Canyon out of the boundaries of the  proposed city of Malibu, knowing that the vast majority of Malibu residents  oppose the project.  </P> <P> The question remains, who should own a place of natural beauty such as Corral  Canyon? The truth is that no one can really own it. What Hope owns is a permit  to legally destroy it.  </P> <P> STEPHEN MILLS  </P> <P> Glendale  </P></p>

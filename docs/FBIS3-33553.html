			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Salvadoran Edgardo Rodriguez, National </F> Solidarity Movement, MNS, presidential candidate, by  unidentified PRENSA GRAFICA reporter; place and date not given]    [Text] [Reporter] Do you consider your economic program  substantially different than the one the government has  implemented? What are your main points?    [Rodriguez] MNS' government platform contains general and  specific objectives. Five of our general objectives are the  following: the elimination of poverty as an essential factor;  simultaneous sustained development and social development; the  broadening of the business sector; the modernization of the  state; and a change of the nation's economy toward a solidarity  economy.    A solidarity economy is one that seeks a better distribution  of the nation's economic surplus. Arena's [Nationalist  Republican Alliance] "Achilles heel" is the thesis of monetarism  it has implemented. The ripple effect theory has not been  produced simultaneously with economic growth. A social economy  market is not the most adequate label for the current model.    [Reporter] According to your proposal, what is missing in  the  current model?    [Rodriguez] There is a lack of openness in the market, and  the tendency is not toward fair competition.    There are monopolies and oligopolies that influence  important  products in El Salvador. We could mention, for example,  fertilizers, which have a bearing on all the basic grains.  There are companies that have imported shiploads of  fertilizers. The decisions of such a powerful group of  speculators has an influence on prices.    We will not discuss progress, rather, extreme liberalism,  which has put the businessmen who for many years supported the  economy in a difficult situation. A market economy encourages  equal conditions and openness. The state should regulate and  orientate.    [Reporter] What does it mean the state should be the  economic regulator without intervening in the market?    [Rodriguez] For example, by not exporting beans. What  happened last year? Since Antonio Cabrales, agriculture and  livestock minister, talked about a record harvest of cereals,  speculators have decided to export beans to Nicaragua and  Honduras, leaving our people hungry.    We do not think the state should intervene in certain  matters  but should in the food supply and strategic industries.    [Reporter] Would you, for example, fix prices for strategic  products?    [Rodriguez] No. I would not, but I would prohibit the export  of basic grains until the local market is guaranteed, and I  would promote their production.    I would support the small producers with credits, low  interest rates so they can produce more. In that case, the law  of the market would work, because there would be a surplus.    [Reporter] What is the difference between what you are  proposing for the state and what the PDC [Christian Democratic  party] has, for example?    [Rodriguez] We would have the control and organization to  enforce regulation, but we would not take over the role of the  private sector. The PDC has intervened in the economy and  substituted the private sector. This was an error, as it  generated corruption. Neither did we believe in liberalism as  applied by the government, where anything goes.    We believe the market economy strategy should be preserved,  but social responsibility should be included. This is  solidarism's proposal based on its two pillars, active  participation and social responsibility in the nation's problems.    [Reporter] What measure would you apply, if these have a  name, to make social development effective?    [Rodriguez] We are not going to entitle these measures,  rather, criteria. In the government's strategy the ripple  effect thesis is upheld. Its theory is to have investment there  must be savings--it is axiomatic--and to have savings there must  be a concentration of wealth. What have they done? They have  promoted the large companies so they can concentrate wealth,  save, and from there generate investments.    The truth is investment generated from the concentration of  wealth in a few sectors does not translate into broad benefits.    We want to broaden the base of the private sector. We are  talking about the poor in the marketplace, the shoemaker, the  small businessmen who do not have access to credit. We want to  promote them to strengthen the local market and to integrate  them into an export economy similar to the Taiwanese model,  where the family business has been essential in the export  process.    [Reporter] What do these views mean specifically? Tax  reforms? A change in the interest rate? Subsidies with  international aid?    [Rodriguez] The assistant World Bank director visited us two  months ago and informed us the IMF and the World Bank and other  international organizations have given priority to supporting  programs to eradicate poverty in developing countries.    These institutions pressured the countries of Latin America  during the 1980's to make structural changes so they could  improve their economies, and they then realized this caused an  enormous level of poverty. The UN Development Program points to  the imbalance: Twenty percent of the world's population earns 82  percent of the world's income, and conversely 80 percent of the  population earns 18 percent of the world's income. This tells  us of the errors that even institutions such as the World Bank  and the IMF have made in their policies. We hope to raise the  national tax rate from 9 to 11 percent. We believe the  value-added tax must be reformed. Everything that hurts the  basic family basket and medicines must be eliminated. There  should be a tax on luxury items, namely, jewelry, expensive  clothes, and a stiffer tax on nonessential items, such as luxury  cars. We plan to revise the tax law chiefly on income and  family goods to make the wealthier pay more.    We also have international loans that have been negotiated  lately. We know those resources will be effective. It is a  matter of time. An important element we are considering is  austerity in public administration. We plan to lower the fiscal  deficit with austerity. There is no reason for the government  to promote costly publicity campaigns such as the current one.    We will lower the Armed Forces budget. Why spend on  television programs? Every night, they pay for a program on all  channels. That money could be eliminated from the budget to  lower the deficit. We are going to dispense with armored  vehicles for public officials and lower traveling expenses.    We are even going to review the president's confidential  expenditures. There is no reason for them to be confidential,  but we must lower them to begin with. A Treasury Ministry union  has told us some months ago the president withdrew 22 million  colones in one day. For what?    We have a major resource abroad sending us large amounts of  foreign exchange. We do not think those resources should be  oriented toward the purchase of houses, as that is consumption.  We must create an entity that steers those resources toward  productive investments. In addition, we are proposing a reform  in the foreign service. The southeastern Asian countries will  encounter problems entering the United States. With an  investment program brought before companies from Taiwan,  Singapore, etc., we could become the entry point into the United  States, making use of the advantages we still have under the  General Preference System, the Caribbean Basin Initiative, and  what remained of the Initiative for the Americas.    There is also the possibility of strengthening the  integration of the isthmus, given figures indicate El Salvador's  level of commerce with the region has registered a big increase.    [Reporter] The National Solidarity Movement did not complete  the registration of candidates in all municipalities; yet you  said the party's position is good. On what do you base your  optimism?    [Rodriguez] We believe we are fighting for a second or third  position nationwide. We were planning to run in 120  municipalities but have entered 80 races for a lack of  resources. We are running excellent candidates, however. We  believe we can win in 40 percent of those 80 municipalities. If  we are in fourth place, according to the polls, we will win a  minimum of 12 deputies. At the presidential level we are making  a major effort to maintain a higher profile. We think we are  winning great support. In addition, everywhere we go we have  found the support of the people from the churches, the Catholic  and Evangelical Churches. We have candidates who belong to the  Elim Church, Mormons, winners who will win in major centers. We  have put forth the best we could without compromising the party.  We trust in the people's sensible nature.</p>

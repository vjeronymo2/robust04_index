			<p><P> October 16, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: FIRST OFF . . .  </P> <P> One young man was shot and injured and several dozen others sustained minor  injuries during a melee at a rap concert at the Oakland Coliseum Arena Friday  night. The show featured Cool Moe Dee, MC Hammer, the Boys and Heavy D. Blamed  with starting the trouble were about 50 fans who were dressed entirely in  black, and thought to be members of the Funktown Oakland street gang. Witnesses  said the fighting broke out when Heavy D refused to go on stage unless the  house lights were turned out. During the delay, the 50 or so reputed gang  members reportedly began picking fights at random in the audience, and Henry  Fields, 19, was shot several times in the abdomen and trunk. He was  hospitalized in stable condition. The people injured were caught in a stampede  as panicked concert-goers tried to flee the arena. There were unconfirmed  reports of a second shooting victim. Of the 14,000 ticket-holders, only about  4,000 remained in the arena when the headliner Dee appeared, long after order  had been restored. Shauna Snow  </P></p>

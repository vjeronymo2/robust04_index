			<p><P> November 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AVOIDING THE WATER-STEALER IMAGE  </P> <P> Rural counties in Central and Southern Nevada are starting to fear that what  happened to the Owens Valley 75 years ago might happen to them. The Los Vegas  Valley Water District has filed 146 applications with the state engineer for  unallocated water rights in parts of Clark County and in neighboring Nye,  Lincoln and White Pine counties. Rights on stream flow and underground aquifers  total about 865,000 acre-feet of water, a bit more than Los Angeles uses in a  year.  </P> <P> But Las Vegas is trying to avoid the image of water-stealer that Los Angeles  has borne over the years. Patricia Mulroy, general manager of the water  district, said Las Vegas is not seeking exclusive rights and that the growing  urban center is willing to share the water if the sparsely populated counties  demonstrated a need for some of it. Las Vegas also would offer a package of  economic incentives to compensate for the loss. "We don't want to be perceived  as going in and grabbing the water," Mulroy said.  </P> <P> If the Las Vegas district succeeds in winning the rights, the district would  spend an estimated $1.5 billion over the next 20 to 30 years developing a water  collection and delivery system. The Las Vegas area has doubled in population  during the 1980s, to about 700,000. Officials in the other counties indicated  they would not allow Las Vegas to get their water without a contest. Nye County  Manager Frank Hershman said, "We need the water desperately for our own  development."  </P> <P> The situation may present a chance for both the city and counties to avoid all  the anger and trauma involved when Los Angeles bought up the Owens Valley for  its water rights. A cooperative agreement might provide the water development  rural areas need and cannot afford, while giving the Las Vegas area enough new  supply to accommodate reasonable growth. With careful planning now, both  regions might be able to develop the supplies they need. The tactic of fighting  it out in court might result in losses for everyone.  </P></p>

			<p>941005 FT  05 OCT 94 / Record growth in mobile phones The UK's two biggest cellular phone companies yesterday reported record subscriber growth for the summer months, continuing the strong upward trend in mobile phone usage which started last December. The two companies attracted 256,000 net new subscribers for the third quarter to September, more than twice the number for the same period last year. The number of mobile phone users stands at about 2.8m, including subscribers to the two newer networks, Mercury One-2-One and Orange. With more than five mobile phone subscribers per 100 people, the UK has bigger cellular usage per head than any European country outside Scandinavia. Sweden has more than 12 subscribers per 100. Cellnet, a joint venture between British Telecommunications and Securicor, made the biggest gain for the quarter, with 133,000 net new subscribers compared with 123,000 for Vodafone, the biggest operator. Vodafone blamed its fall on problems with fraud, which led to a high drop-off rate over the quarter as new credit-checking measures were introduced. Both operators expect a sharp rise in sales in the approach to Christmas.</p>

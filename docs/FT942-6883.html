			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / International Company News: Indian paper backlog almost cleared Banks handling the stock market paperwork for foreign portfolio investors in India have mostly cleared the backlog which threatened to overwhelm the country's primitive stock settlement and transfer system. However, the banks, which provide custodial services to overseas fund managers, are keeping a tight check on the business they handle. Existing clients are being told to limit purchases; new clients are being asked to wait until processing capacity is increased over the next few months. The paperwork problems stem from woefully outmoded procedures geared mainly toward millions of individuals buying as few as 10 or 100 shares, not institutions purchasing lots of 100,000. A single large purchase can generate a trunk-full of share certificates and transfer forms which must be processed manually. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the biggest provider of custodial services for foreign clients, says its backlog was cleared at the end of March; clients who were asked to stop trading are now permitted to resume with limited amounts. New clients are not yet being accepted. A foreign fund manager says: 'The custodial problem is the single largest speed-breaker on foreign institutional investment on the Indian stock market today. At the end of 1993, custodians imposed limits on clients. Today, they claim that they have licked the problem, but there has been no public announcement to this effect and the limit still exists.' The fund manager estimates the limit to be about USDollars 3m a month per client. Given that specialised India funds have raised USDollars 100m and more, this is very tight, although fund managers do have the option of investing in Indian company euro-issues. Mr Samir Arora, vice-president of the Indian affiliate of the Alliance Capital fund management group, says: 'We have earmarked 5 per cent of our USDollars 1bn Global Privatisation Fund for India. We could, if allowed to, easily invest USDollars 100m in the next few weeks, but we cannot.' Partly because of these difficulties, Indian foreign portfolio investment has slowed in recent months, though fund managers have also been influenced by the worldwide correction in stock markets. Net investments by foreign institutions fell from Dollars 398m in January to Dollars 163m in April. Total cumulative investment at the end of April was Dollars 1.77bn - up from almost nothing a year ago. Hongkong Bank, Citibank and Standard Chartered Bank are increasing custody staff to boost capacity. Stock Holding Corporation of India, a company created by Indian financial institutions, could take on more business but its capital is too small to satisfy the security needs of most foreign fund managers. State Bank of India and ICICI, two leading institutions, are also establishing custodial services, but foreign fund managers are reluctant to entrust the work to Indian banks they scarcely know. The extra capacity will permit only steady increases in trading volumes and faster growth will require a radical overhaul of the trading system. The goal is a paper-less trading system, which is under development by Indian banks but still far from complete.</p>

			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / World Stock Markets: Stale Japanese bulls explore pastures new - Disappointed investors have stopped holding their breath JAPANESE investors have been holding their breath for the past few weeks, waiting for a reduction in official interest rates. But the cut has not come, the stock market remains sluggish, and the recently expectant investors are putting their funds elsewhere. Over the past month, the Tokyo market has been characterised by low volumes and a narrow trading range, in spite of Japanese institutions' best intentions to begin the new financial year positively and to leave behind a bruising fiscal 1990. While the impact of a cut in the Official Discount Rate (ODR) on real lending rates is questionable, the ODR still exercises a powerful influence on the market's outlook. Shares were bought in February and March on the presumption of a rate reduction. It was expected that the ODR, now at 6 per cent, would fall to 5.5 per cent; and, for the past two weeks, brokers have attempted to extract extra hope and client purchases out of the situation by talking of a cut of 0.75 of a percentage point. The argument went that Japan was under severe international pressure to reduce rates, and that a 0.5 per cent reduction would not be enough to keep Washington happy. Until now, the Bank of Japan has been unmoved, as has the Tokyo market. Volumes have been around a poor 300m shares in recent days, and the Nikkei average has alternately risen and fallen by small amounts, without any real signs of buying confidence. The central bank argues that further heat needs to be removed from an overwarm economy, and that a cut in rates could prompt a return to the speculative share-buying binges of 1989. The bank's argument seems to be supported by the erratic movements of a few stocks, which have apparently been targeted by still-active speculator groups looking for quick profits in a dull market. Among the more volatile movers have been Kawai Musical Instruments, the world's second largest maker of pianos, and Taiyo Sanso, a semiconductor cleaning equipment maker, both of which hit 1991 highs during trading yesterday. Brokers indicate that they are typical of the small to medium-sized issues chosen by investors more for their volatility potential than for business-related reasons. Japanese brokers are hoping that the business results season, which begins next week, will inspire interest. Mr Paul Heaton, deputy head of research at WI Carr, says that investors are likely to be more interested in the forecasts for this year than in last year's results, most of which have already been released on an informal basis. 'Most companies have already announced the revisions for expected results for last year, so it will be more important to look at the predicted profits. For example, companies in the service companies could be looking at good profit growth,' Mr Heaton adds. Mr Craig Chudler, investment strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, says that the market would have fallen further but for strong arbitrage-related buying. This has allowed the Nikkei average to settle at around at 26,000, he says, but essentially it is not a reflection of confidence in the market's strength. Individuals and foreign investors were enthusiastic buyers of shares earlier this year, but their interest has waned. The buying by foreigners followed a realisation by fund managers, at the end of last year, that they were underweight in Tokyo. As for individual investors, officials at the Tokyo exchange and the Finance Ministry have attempted to lure them back to the market by encouraging companies to pay higher dividends. The focus on dividends was sharpened by life insurance companies' threats to sell stock holdings unless yields were improved. So far, there has been little evidence of either an increase in dividends or a sell-off of strategic stock holdings by the life insurance companies. A survey released this week by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the leading Japanese financial daily, indicates that Japanese executives remain convinced that shareholders come low on the list of priorities. The survey of 2,396 listed companies found that 41.3 per cent of executives want earnings to be used for capital spending, while 30.2 per cent think that they should be distributed among employees and 19.6 per cent believe that shareholders should receive the benefits. Meanwhile, 86 per cent of the respondents said that US companies' focus on high dividends was partly responsible for their present financial problems. Some Japanese companies are making an attempt to attract individual investors by reducing their minimum trading units from 1,000 to 100 shares. In recent weeks, Asatsu, the advertising agency, Tachikawa Corporation, the leading maker of blinds and partitions, and Sega Enterprises, an amusement equipment maker, have announced reductions, and brokers say that many other companies will follow if the move proves to be successful.</p>

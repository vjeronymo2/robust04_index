			<p>920619 FT  19 JUN 92 / GPA Group's Aborted Global Issue: Advisers learn a costly lesson from success-related deal THE GLOBAL offer for GPA Group's aborted Dollars 800m (Pounds 432m) flotation was billed as the first of its kind. For the advisers involved it proved to be the most expensive None of the investment banks engaged for the flotation, which included Nomura International as global co-ordinator, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers in the US and Schroders and BZW in the UK, will be paid a penny. Their fees were success related. Failure will have cost them dear: during the past year GPA absorbed a bigger chunk of their time than any other planned flotation. Only Hambro Magan, the company's permanent financial adviser, is on a retainer. Some of the advisers yesterday said, that after having done so much work on the issue, they would like to establish an arrangement whereby they might be put on a retainer for future advice. Mr Maurice Foley, GPA's chief executive, said he was still looking at all the options, including whether it was possible to seek a public listing. But, as to retainers, it was too early to tell. All he could say was that technically all of the advisers' contracts have expired and so they could be seen to have 'stepped down'. Although he made it clear that they had neither been fired nor resigned. The listing was to have been simultaneous in New York, London, and Dublin, with a placement of shares in Japan. There was to be a public offer by tender to give the issue maximum flexibility. Instead of asking US banks to underwrite a fixed price without knowing the demand - something which they are increasingly reluctant to do - lead managers sought to build up a book of orders before pricing the shares. There was a price range of Dollars 10 to Dollars 12, following a 1-for-1 scrip issue, but the actual price would not be fixed until the investment bankers had clear figures of demand in each country. Each market was given an indicative amount; 30m shares to the UK, 20m to the US, 15m to Japan and 15m to the rest of the world. The competitive tensions between the different markets was expected to ensure demand. As late as last Sunday evening the advisers believed that the issue would be oversubscribed. This was because they had a better response from retail investors than institutions. Indeed, only 10 days ago the advisers leaked the fact that they had persuaded the company to issue another 5m shares. 'I am not into recriminations, but we were advised to increase the number of shares on offer (from 80m to 85m) 10 days before we had to pull the issue,' Mr Foley said yesterday. The issue collapsed when it became clear on Monday that there was no institutional demand from the US. According to Mr Foley that affected sentiment in the UK and the rest of the world. 'The complexity of the the bookbuilding issue,' said Mr Foley, 'with one domino leaning on the other, may not have been the right way.'</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report on interview with Seyran Bagdasaryan, chairman of </F> the special commission of the Supreme Council of the Republic of  Armenia on Artsakh, recorded by M. Grigoryan: "Who Is Who -- Was  Clearly Shown by the Meeting in Bishkek"]    [Text] As we know, on Saturday a news conference was held  by the speaker of the Armenian parliament, B. Ararktsyan, where  he told journalists about the meeting in Bishkek of  parliamentary delegations of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, but the press center of the Supreme  Council of the Republic of Armenia, for incomprehensible  reasons, did not consider it necessary to invite a correspondent  from GOLOS ARMENII to it. We asked a member of the Armenian  delegation and chairman of the special commission of the Supreme  Council of the Republic of Armenia on Artsakh, Seyran  Bagdasaryan, to share his impressions.    The meeting in Bishkek, which by stretching things a great  deal might be called negotiations, was planned back last fall  during a meeting on the Aland Islands, whose delegation,  incidentally, also came to the capital of Kyrgyzstan. A fair  amount of weight was added to the Bishkek meeting by the  participation in it of the chairman of the Interparliamentary  Assembly of the CIS, V. Shumeyko. Since it was planned for the  top people of all three countries -- the Azerbaijan Republic,  the Republic of Armenia, and the Nagorno- Karabakh Republic --  to participate, it was suggested that the range of issues be  broad and significant, the more so since the meeting was  preceded, as we know, by a trip to Moscow by the chairman of the  Azerbaijan parliament, Guliyev, during the course of which an  agreement was signed for interparliamentary cooperation of the  two countries. All this showed that the groundwork for Bishkek  had been done fairly well.    But expectations were not met from the very beginning:  Instead of Guliyev, Azerbaijan "jokingly" sent his deputy  Dzhalilov. And this was when the night before Shumeyko had  personally received Aliyev's assurances that the chairman of the  Assembly would arrive in Bishkek the next morning. For Shumeyko  and Shirinkulov this was, one might say, a "cold shower,"  exacerbated even more by the personality and behavior of  Dzhalilov, who came as the leader of the delegation from the  Republic of Azerbaijan. The explanation that Aliyev was in  Brussels and therefore, Guliyev could not come was not taken  seriously.    All this showed that the Azeris certainly did not come with  serious intentions and were merely trying to take advantage of  the meeting for their own irritating propaganda statements and  tricks. Predicting this, the delegation from Armenia prepared a  number of statements and documents in response. Unfortunately,  our misgivings were confirmed: Instead of a greeting, the Azeris  offered worn-out cliches about aggression, seizure of territory,  etc., etc. In my view, this more likely produced the opposite  reaction. B. Ararktsyan, conversely, in his speech suggested  discussing all possible approaches in the most serious way.    A document prepared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of  Russia headed by V. Kazimirov was distributed. It was called  the "Bishkek Protocol" which essentially in the style of appeals  presented suggestions to participants in the meeting. I  consider a key feature of the document as well, incidentally, as  of the whole meeting, to be the appeal to the heads of the CIS  states to immediately discuss and resolve the issue of creating  a contingent of peacekeeping forces in the CIS.    But from the very beginning of the negotiations there was a  fairly heated "dialogue" between the representatives of  Azerbaijan and Nagorno-Karabakh, in which the delegation from  Armenia was fairly restrained, thus emphasizing that the main  problems lie on the plane of mutual relations of these two  parties. Incidentally, there is no truth to the rumors that the  Karabakh delegation was not allowed into the negotiation hall on  the first day. The Karabakh delegation consisting of K.  Babulyan and A. Gukasyan was very active, demonstrating their  natural right to be called leaders of the Nagorno-Karabakh  Republic and to represent it.    As for the Azeri parliamentarians, they basically used the  same old cliches they used two years ago and a similar primitive  approach could not but surprise the other participants in the  meeting.    Be that as it may, work was started on Kazimirov's document,  and if the delegation from Armenia fully supported it with small  corrections, Azerbaijan from the very beginning started to  demand that representatives from the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic  be excluded from those who signed it. In my view, their  behavior was based primarily on their refusal to accept the  point about the creation of peacekeeping forces in the CIS.  Such a "work style" on the part of the Azeri delegation forced  Shumeyko and Shirinkulov to get together for a couple of hours  with the leaders of the delegations. Essentially Shumeyko's  authority was on the line and his desire to bring the two sides  to common ground was quite understandable. But this looked  rather strange if not ridiculous: Almost every hour Dzhalilov  ran out of the office and disappeared into the corridor, after  which he was almost forced to return (even, excuse me, from the  toilet). And he would disappear at precisely those moments when  it seemed that everything was ready for signing. After his  return everything would begin all over again. Dzhalilov wasted  time and, if I may say so, simply made fools out of all the  participants, stating that he had to coordinate the text with  Baku.    Unfortunately, as a result, changes were made in the  document that weaken it a fair amount. Dzhalilov demanded that  a point be included concerning occupation of 20 percent of the  territory of the Republic of Azerbaijan, to which K. Baburin  responded that he would agree under the condition that they  specified precisely who would occupy it: troops of the  Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Toward the end of the meeting the  leader of the Azerbaijan delegation stated that in general, he  was not authorized to sign anything at all. In his concluding  speech, Shumeyko clearly summed everything up, stating, in  particular, that Nagorno-Karabakh had to be recognized as a  party both to the conflict and to the negotiations -- without  this, no solution would be found. The Azeri delegation ended up  in simply an odious position and this, incidentally, was felt by  its members themselves, with whom we had numerous meetings. Our  opponents accused us of causing Russia to return to the region  and this could lead to an encroachment on the independence of  our states. They also suggested direct bilateral negotiations,  but we know quite well what attempts at such contacts can lead  to.    I think that now Aliyev is playing out the Western "part" of  his policy, trying to straddle the fence. But his game is so  transparent that only naive people could fail to see through it,  and the response, it seems to me, will be appropriate for his  policy.    As for the Bishkek Protocol, it is so weak on the plane of  concrete content that even in Baku they considered it necessary  to announce its signing. Nonetheless one can say simply that  the Azeris lost in Bishkek--and mainly in terms of their  political image in the world. And, conversely, the Karabakh  representatives, who signed the document and committed  themselves to a unilateral cease-fire, took the political  initiative in the region to a certain degree.    At the last hour, speaking at a session of the Armenian  parliament on 9 May, speaker B. Ararktsyan announced that the  night before he was told by telephone from Baku that Azerbaijan  had agreed to sign the Bishkek protocol.</p>

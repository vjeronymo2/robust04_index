			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Vladimir Bauer, chairman of the Duma </F> Organizing Committee, by Yuriy Serov: "On 11 May the Duma Will  Sit in a New Building" -- place, date not given]    [Text] [Serov] Vladimir Anatolyevich, what does your  committee engage in?    [Bauer] The Duma is not an industrial enterprise and the  Duma chairman is not an enterprise director. It is not only  inconvenient but partly unethical to engage in organizational  and economic matters. The committee created specially for these  purposes and consisting of deputies from various factions is  another matter. It is quite able to assess objectively the  professionalism of key officials in the State Duma apparatus.  The committee is working out proposals on standing orders and  the law on the status of deputies.    [Serov] Nonetheless, the media criticize the State Duma:  Too many of the public funds go to maintain it and the people's  choices have great appetites....    [Bauer] There is a government decree signed by Chernomyrdin  a few days ago that says in black and white: To ensure within  10 days the movement of the State Duma without renovating the  building. This will allow us to sue those who are distorting the  truth in print. I think that such articles are inspired by  people who are not very happy with the fact that the Duma will  occupy the building at Okhotnyy Ryad, 1. As for perks and  benefits, whether we want this or not, in mass consciousness the  State Duma is the legal successor to the former Supreme Soviet.  The shadow of the former confrontation between the "power  branches" is falling on the Duma, as it were, with all the  ensuing consequences: talk about perks, and so forth. State  Duma deputies have none. Moreover, the conditions in which the  deputies have to work are humiliating.    [Serov] When will the movement take place?    [Bauer] On 11 May we are planning to hold a plenary session  in the new location. The movement will apparently be complete  by the end of May.    [Serov] How long will it take the Duma to readjust?    [Bauer] As is known, one relocation is equal to two fires.  I suppose several months will pass before everything gets back  to normal. Work efficiency is bound to rise, although the  building on Okhotnyy Ryad is certainly not the Parliament Center  or the White House. The compound on Okhotnyy Ryad is a  ministerial complex built in the thirties. The fact that the  Duma has acquired a place of its own is an indisputable success  of parliamentarianism in Russia.    [Serov] Many deputies believe that the State Duma apparatus  is pulling -- and quite successfully -- the blanket of power  over itself. Has the Duma acquired financial independence?    [Bauer] We are still financed from presidential  administration accounts: We have no account of our own and no  legal entity status in spending. This surely complicates the  solution of certain questions. But I think that soon the  situation will change. As for relations with the apparatus,  this must be clear: The apparatus exists for the deputies, not  the deputies for the apparatus. The apparatus and the deputies  are two parallel worlds, but the danger that the apparatus will  pull the blanket of power over itself does exist. Our committee  guards the deputies' interests. We confirm appointments to all  key posts in the apparatus. Normative documents also pass  through the committee. We see to it that the deputies'  interests are not infringed. Our committee seeks to unite the  efforts of the deputies and the apparatus for the good of the  common cause.    [Serov] What is the committee doing at present in the  legislative sphere?    [Bauer] In addition to what I have already mentioned, it  participates in working on the budget and the pension law.  There are lawyers in the committee who are preparing amendments  to the Criminal Code and the law on corruption. We intend to  devote the next few months to organizing the State Duma's  activity and helping accommodate the deputies in a new place.    [Serov] How do you see the future of the State Duma?    [Bauer] The level of the new deputy corps is relatively  high. Former deputies were elected to the Supreme Soviet  primarily riding a tide of populism. As a matter of fact, some  former deputies too have entered the Duma. However we might  treat them, this ensures a certain level of continuity. I dare  say that party affiliation as an element of the Duma's internal  organization is a factor enhancing the State Duma's  effectiveness. Yes, sometimes one bill or another may be voted  down thanks to a consolidated discipline. But if there is an  agreement at the level of factions, laws tend to be adopted. Let  us take, for instance, the election of committees and  commissions. Within half a day the Duma has done what took the  Supreme Soviet several months to accomplish. The Duma is a  fairly hard-working body. This may sound paradoxical, but the  State Duma is more inclined to cooperate with the president and  the government than the Federation Council. (A different point  of view is in Vladimir Shumeyko article, ROSSIYA, No. 16 -- Yu.  S.). Once the consideration of the budget begins, they will  immediately start lobbying, pursuing their own, utterly  parochial interests. There is nothing of the kind in the Duma.  As for my opinion on the document about accord, I think that it  is the State Duma elected by the people that should be the  guarantor of its implementation. The president should put up  with it, come closer to the Duma, and recognize its rights.  Then laws passing through the State Duma will acquire the  nature of national accord. At the same time, personally I am  dissatisfied with the lack of provisions in the document  specifying the responsibility of the central authorities for  their adherence or failure to adhere to the principles of  national accord.</p>

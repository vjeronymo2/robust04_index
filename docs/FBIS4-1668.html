			<p>BFN     [Text] Yu Peigao, president of the Shandong Provincial  Higher People's Court, delivered "the work report of the  provincial higher people's court" to the second session of the  eighth provincial people's congress on the morning of 3 March.    Yu Peigao said in his report: In 1993, the provincial court  conscientiously implemented the major policy decisions of the  party Central Committee and the State Council and the decisions  and resolutions of the provincial people's congress; strictly  enforced the constitution and laws; positively carried out the  judicial work in line with the requirements for safeguarding  social and political stability, strengthening the macroeconomic  regulation and control, and waging the struggle against  corruption; and better accomplished the tasks. In the past  year, the courts across the province accepted 329,733 lawsuits  of various types, an increase of 22.5 percent over the previous  year; and concluded 328,003 cases of this kind, an increase of  23 percent. Through the trial activities, the courts brought  into play their judicial and guaranteeing roles in safeguarding  social and political stability, punishing the corrupt, and  promoting reform, opening up, and economic development.    Yu Peigao said: To safeguard social and political stability,  the courts at various levels across the province strengthened  the trial of criminal cases and sternly dealt blows to various  criminal activities according to laws. Last year, the courts at  various levels accepted first rulings on 19,071 criminal cases  and concluded 19,133 criminal cases. The courts at various  levels prominently dealt blows to serious cases and examined and  handled, according to laws, 8,169 criminal cases of seriously  jeopardizing social order and examined and handled 2,262  economic criminal cases under first rulings.    Yue Peigao said: Last year, the courts at various levels  across the province conscientiously implemented the central  authorities' major policy decisions on setting up the socialist  market economic system and strengthening macroeconomic  regulation and control and vigorously strengthened the trial of  economic cases. The courts accepted first rulings on 148,745  economic dispute cases and concluded 146,336 cases of this kind,  both showing increases of nearly 50,000 cases over the figures  of last year. The cases that had been concluded were estimated  at 8.5 billion yuan, showing an increase of 210 percent and  surpassing the total sum in the previous 14 years.    Yu Peigao said: Along with the development of the market  economy, great changes have taken place in the mainstays,  contents, and categories of the civil lawsuits. At the time  when the number of traditional civil dispute cases continues to  increase by a big margin, the proportion of civil cases due to  economic disputes gradually rose. To this end, the courts at  various levels further strengthened the trial of civil cases.  The courts across the province accepted first rulings on  146,740 civil cases and concluded 147,644 cases of this  category, respectively increasing 7.6 percent and 8.9 percent.    Yu Peigao said: Achieving the administrative trial work is  of extremely importance to supervise and safeguard  administrative organs to exercise their functions according to  laws; protect the legal rights and interests of citizens, legal  persons, and other organizations; and promote the building of  socialist democracy and politics. In line with the Supreme  Court's guiding ideology of boldly accepting and handling cases,  last year, the provincial court made efforts to carry out the  administrative trial work. A total of 1,444 administrative  cases were accepted and 1,436 cases were concluded, respectively  increasing 55.8 percent and 64.1 percent over the previous year.    Yu Peigao said: Strengthening the supervision over the  trial work is an effective measure for upgrading the judicial  quality and ensuring the strict enforcement of laws. Last year,  the courts at various levels strictly carried out the system of  bringing lawsuits such as open trial, defense, second rulings,  last rulings, and retrials; comprehensively strengthened the  supervision over the trial work; and ensured the quality of  handling cases. Judging from the assessments and examinations  of cases and the general inspections on the enforcement of laws,  we know that 98 percent of the cases that had been handled  attained the qualifications.    Yu Peigao said: Last year, the courts at various levels  positively explored ways for reforming the forms of trying  civil, economic, and criminal cases; carried out the method of  opening an court session "in one step;" and ensured to state  reasons at courts, to publicly give evidence, clearly make  statements, and investigate facts at courts. Thus, the  functions for trying cases at courts were intensified, the  efficiency and quality of handling cases were upgraded, and the  unhealthy trends interfering in the trial work were effectively  prevented.    Yu Peigao said: The year 1994 is a key year to  comprehensively promote China's economic restructuring and to  make a key breakthrough in the reform. So, the people's courts  are confronted with heavier and more arduous tasks. We should  take Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism with  Chinese characteristics as a guidance, conscientiously implement  the guidelines of the third plenary session of the 14th party  Central Committee and the sixth provincial party congress,  strictly enforce the resolutions of this session, further  emancipate the mind, conduct reform, blaze new trails,  comprehensively strengthen the trial work, create prestige  through the strict attacks against criminal activities, make  achievements in cracking major and appalling cases, make big  development in readjusting the relationship between various  sectors of the economy, and comprehensively upgrade the judicial  quality.    Yu Peigao said: In the new year, we should further  consciously rely on the leadership of the party committees, more  actively accept the supervision by the people's congresses,  positively strive for the support of the governments and the  departments concerned, comprehensively achieve the trial work,  and make new contributions to safeguarding the province's social  and political stability and ensuring the smooth progress of  reform, opening up, and economic construction.</p>

			<p><P> May 27, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE ECONOMY;  </P> <P> CONSUMER SPENDING IN APRIL UP A ROBUST 1.1%  </P> <P> Consumer spending in April posted its best performance in nearly a year, rising  1.1%, the government said Friday in a report that analysts said shows the  economy remains healthy even as growth slows.  </P> <P> While consumer spending rose at its fastest pace since a 1.3% increase last  June, much of the growth was attributed to a sharp increase in auto sales  because of rebates, low-interest loans and other industry incentives to move  cars off dealers' lots.  </P> <P> The Commerce Department also reported that personal income rose a weak 0.4%  last month, compared to hikes of 0.8% in March and 1% in February. The April  figure was the smallest increase since last November's 0.2%.  </P> <P> But analysts blamed the sluggish income growth in April on lower farm subsidies  over the past two months and on a fallback from higher auto industry bonuses  and retroactive Social Security payments in March.  </P> <P> Discounting the auto sales and one-time weakness in incomes, "what you come out  with is reasonably decent income and consumption growth which tends to make the  Fed's soft-landing scenario look more realistic," said analyst Cynthia Latta of  Data Resources in Lexington, Mass.  </P> <P> Federal Reserve credit-tightening designed to stem inflation has caused some  economists to worry that resulting higher interest rates could move the economy  into a recession, rather than the targeted soft landing.  </P> <P> But recent reports continue to point to an economic slowdown without recession.  </P> <P> And Friday's income and spending report tells the Fed "that so far, so good;  that there's no reason to change what they're doing because it doesn't yet look  like they're guilty of overkill," Latta said.  </P></p>

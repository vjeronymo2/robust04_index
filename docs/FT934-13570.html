			<p>931021 FT  21 OCT 93 / Rebel Names were resigned to defeat DISSIDENT Lloyd's Names reacted with resigned acceptance last night to their heavy defeat in attempts to delay and oppose the introduction of corporate capital into the insurance market. They expressed only mild surprise at the results. They had been determined to pursue their objections to the ballot box - in spite of knowing that they would be defeated by the large number of proxies held by Mr David Rowland, the chairman. Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Names Action Group, which opposed the Lloyd's resolutions, said: 'We got more votes than I expected. I thought we had some kind of chance. But when we moved for the adjournment we knew we were going to lose. 'The fundamental reason is that Names are terrified. For the moment all they have to cling on to is a belief in Peter Middleton.' Mr Christopher Stockwell, chairman of the Lloyd's Names associations' working party, said: 'It was extremely predictable. We knew from our predictions this would happen weeks ago. But we felt a very large number of people wanted to put on record their feelings that the time was not correct.' The extraordinary general meeting attracted a relatively small number of dissident Names, and Mr Rowland sometimes struggled to find speakers to oppose his proposals and maintain a balanced debate. Just half-a-dozen speakers raised critical points, although others could not resist asking questions outside the remit of the meeting, including demands to know when a settlement with lossmaking Names would be agreed and when their allegations of fraud would be answered. Mr Stockwell, opening the speeches from the floor after Mr Rowland's introduction, said: 'Most (Names he represented) believe the society should have reached a settlement of the disputes within it before it attempted to decide whether or not the terms for the admission of corporate capital are fair . . . We believe the council has got the cart before the horse.' He stressed that most of those he spoke for approved of corporate capital. However, he added it was 'the tactics, terms and timing that have been in dispute'. Ms Sally Knowle, another lossmaking Name, said: 'We won't go away. We will fight for justice and for truth. If those jumping on to the corporate capital bandwagon have to pay for the sins of the past, so be it.' Mr Rowland told Names it would be 'a pointless disruption' to insist on an adjournment to propose delaying the vote on introducing corporate capital. He stressed that he commanded roughly 13,000 of the 19,000 proxy votes allocated and was bound to win. But the Names insisted - holding up discussion for about 30 minutes, before contributing modestly to the debate on the seven motions proposed by Lloyd's at which they were heavily defeated. Mr Deeny said after the vote: 'What is being done today is bad for individual Names. It is not in our best interests. I think it is very sad to see Lloyd's going down the road of gigantism. The market isn't about size, it's about profitability. They would do much better to turn people away.' His objections during the debate had focused on the danger of introducing excess capacity to the market, and not on issues of compensation for lossmaking Names. 'There is a separate war on compensation,' he said. 'And that is a war we are going to win.' Mr John Rew, a leading dissident Name and co-editor of Chatset's league tables of Lloyd's performance, said he voted to adjourn the motions, and abstained in the motions on the introduction of corporate capital. 'I'm not terribly against corporate capital but it takes the pressure off Lloyd's,' he said. 'I felt on balance that it's a pity that corporate capital was brought through. It would do Lloyd's no harm to suspend a decision on its introduction.'</p>

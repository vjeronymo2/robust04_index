			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.02.4(2)(d)(i) to require that irrevocable letters of credit be issued by a bank, not only authorized to do business in the United States, but also located in the State of Colorado. In its ``Statement of Basis, Specific Statutory Authority, and Purpose,'' Colorado stated that it proposed this revision because it has experienced problems with bankruptcy notification from out-of-State banks, which caused delays in timely legal responses necessary to secure claims. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The corresponding Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.21(b)(1) only require that the bank be authorized to do business in the United States. Colorado's proposed Rule 3.02.4(2)(d)(i) provides a requirement for letters of credit as forms of collateral bond that is in addition to those provided in the Federal program. This requirement affords a measure of protection beyond that afforded by the Federal regulations and is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Therefore, the Director finds that proposed Rule 3.02.4(2)(d)(i) is not less effective than the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 800.21(1)(e), and approves it. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 8. Rules 3.03.1(2), 3.03.1(2)(b), 3.03.1(3)(b) and (d), and 4.15.5(3)(a), Criteria for Bond Release <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> a. Rules 3.03.1(2) and 3.03.1(3)(d), The Amount of Bond That Can Be Released and the Amount of Bond Which Must Be Retained <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise Rules 3.03.1(2) and (3)(d) to use the term ``amount'' in place of ``liability'' when referring to the portion of a bond that may or may not be released. These proposed rules, respectively, (1) set forth the amount of a bond that may be released after certain conditions are met and (2) require that the amount of a performance bond may never be less than that necessary for the Division to complete the approved reclamation plan. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The counterpart Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c) and 30 CFR 800.14(b), respectively, (1) set forth the amount of a bond which can be released in phases I, II, or III, and (2) require that the amount of bond shall be sufficient to assure the completion of the reclamation plan if the work has to be performed by the regulatory authority. These Federal regulations also use the term ``amount.'' Thus, Colorado's proposed changes simply revise the State regulations so that they are consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations, which use the term ``amount.'' <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on the above discussion, the Director finds that the revisions to proposed Rules 3.03.1(2) and (3)(d) are consistent with and no less effective than the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 800.40(c) and 800.14(b), and approves them. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> b. Rules 3.03.1(2)(b), The Criteria for Successful Establishment of Revegetation Which Must Be Met Prior to Phase II Bond Release <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Colorado proposed to revise Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) to specify certain requirements and revegetation success standards that must be met prior to phase II bond release. Specifically, Colorado proposed to require, prior to the phase II release of up to 85 percent of the applicable bond amount, (1) seasonality and species composition consistent with the ultimate achievement of the success standards and (2) establishment of vegetation which meets the approved success standards according to Rule 4.15.8 for cover, Rule 3.03.1(3)(b) for productivity on prime farmlands or alluvial valley floors, and Rule 4.15.9 for productivity on croplands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Colorado clarified that the demonstrations of successful establishment of vegetation required by Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) shall be based on statistically valid data for the each parameter collected during a single year of the liability period, with the exception of productivity on prime farmlands for which establishment of vegetation shall be based on statistically valid data collected during 3 years (administrative record No. CO&hyph;648). These requirements replace the following requirements in Rule 3.03.1(2)(b) that Colorado proposed to delete: (1) a more general requirement that phase II bond release can occur after successful establishment of vegetation in accordance with the approved reclamation plan and (2) the requirement that such release shall be based on the costs of reclamation activities, including but not limited to replacement of topsoil, seeding, irrigation and fertilizing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

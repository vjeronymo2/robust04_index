			<p><P> April 16, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CARTER MEETING WITH ARAFAT  </P> <P> A most depressing picture appeared on the front page of the Los Angeles Times  (April 5).  </P> <P> It was Jimmy Carter shaking hands with PLO chief Yasser Arafat after their  meeting with French leader Francois Mitterrand in Paris at the Elysee Palace.  The former U.S. President said that the reason why he met with the PLO chairman  is because Arafat wanted "peace" in the Middle East. Yeah! "Piece" of the West  Bank, "piece" of the Gaza Strip, "piece" of Israel, "piece" of Palestine and so  on.  </P> <P> CLARENCE B. SANTOS  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

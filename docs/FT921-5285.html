			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / EC food credit signed for Russia AN Ecu500m (Pounds 350m) line of credit guaranteed by the EC for supplies of food and agricultural products to the former Soviet Union, delayed since November because of the political turmoil in Moscow, has finally been signed, for Russia alone. Deutsche Bank, whose Luxembourg subsidiary is the lead bank of the consortium providing the EC-guaranteed credit, said yesterday the necessary legal and financial alterations to the contract had been agreed. Meanwhile, an unidentified number of banks in the consortium have dropped out, their participation taken over by Deutsche Bank. The turnover is not a response to uncertainty in the former Soviet Union, because the entire credit enjoys an EC guarantee. The delay was caused by uncertainty over the status of Vnesheconombank, the foreign trade bank of the former Soviet Union, whose status Russia has reduced to agent responsible for repaying historic debts. In this case, it has been allowed to take on a new loan, probably its last, because the deal was agreed before the Soviet Union collapsed. 'The Vnesheconombank can now open letters of credit in favour of the exporters,' the Deutsche Bank said yesterday. The fact that the entire credit will now go to Russia was determined by the fact that the Vnesheconombank is now entirely controlled by that country, the bank said. The other republics will have to seek their share of EC food credits from the subsequent Ecu1.25bn - still blocked by disagreement over counterpart guarantees from Russia.</p>

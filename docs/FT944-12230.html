			<p>941102 FT  02 NOV 94 / International Company News: DnB expects to pay first dividend since 1990 Den norske Bank, Norway's largest commercial bank, yesterday said the country's four-year banking crisis was over. The bank also said it expected to pay its first dividend since being formed out of a merger in 1990, following a strong performance during the year. Nine-month pre-tax profits almost trebled to nearly NKr2bn (Dollars 305.3m) from NKr720m last year. The bank benefited from a sharp improvement in non-performing loans and a reversal in loan losses, as a result of a marked improvement in the domestic economy. The volume of non-performing loans plunged NKr3bn to NKr7.2bn since the start of the year, with one-third of the decline occurring in the third quarter. 'In light of this performance, the bank expects to be in a position to declare a dividend for 1994,' said Mr Finn Hvistendahl, group managing director. The bank's continued improvement was curbed by a reduction in gains on shares, bonds and foreign currency following rising domestic interest rates. Last year, the bank benefited from declining rates. Net interest income declined NKr368m to NKr3.6bn but the reduction of non-performing and doubtful loans cut interest expenses by NKr268m. Other operating income - from securities, bonds, foreign exchange and other financial instruments - fell NKr987m to NKr1.7bn. Nevertheless, the bank's result was helped by a gain of NKr147m due to lower than expected loan losses. This compared with loan losses of NKr2.5bn last year. The bank said the volume of doubtful loans had been cut by NKr1bn since the end of 1993. DnB said a NKr37m rise to NKr3.4bn in operating expenses partly reflected an increase in statutory guarantee fund contributions to NKr189m from NKr120m but that personnel expenses were cut by NKr48m to NKr1.65bn.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The prime minister is conferring with opposition  leaders on the situation in the territories. Before the  meeting, the opposition leaders met and decided to urge Mr.  Rabin to make a commitment not to evacuate any settlements.    There was a large meeting at the prime minister's bureau  this  morning to sum up the agreement reached on Hebron security  arrangements and the resumption of the Gaza-Jericho first talks.  Our political correspondent reports that Israel has expressed  displeasure with the suspension of the Israeli-PLO economic  talks, which the PLO initiated. The delegation for talks on  Gaza-Jericho security will leave for Cairo on Sunday and on  Monday the delegation for talks on civilian matters will leave.</p>

			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Rise in Euromarks EUROPEAN money markets were extremely quiet in the run-up to Christmas but, as the new year approaches, there may be another surge of speculation over whether Germany will cut official rates, writes James Blitz. In the first two weeks of December the market took an extremely pessimistic view about the prospects for an easing of policy by the Bun-desbank. On December 10, the German central bank decided not to ease policy at its council meeting, and the March Euromark contract fell as low as 91.92 shortly thereafter. At that level, the market assumed that three-month money in the spring would be at about 8.18 per cent, barely below the current discount rate level of 8.25 per cent. The run-up to Christmas saw a change of mood, partly triggered by comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, who said that inflation could be contained to 3 per cent by the end of next year. On Christmas Eve, the March Euromark contract was back up at 92.24, pricing three-month money at 7.76 per cent in the spring and assuming a small cut in offic-ial rates. On December 24, German call money was at the low end of the current range, at 8.76 per cent. Economists believe that the pressures on the Bundesbank to ease policy are stronger than ever. The German economy is entering recession, and the Ifo institute recently reported that German GDP could decline by 0.5 per cent next year. Inflationary pressures may not be as great as the Bundesbank fears. 'The idea that Germany will suffer inflationary pressures when they have not had a devaluation of the D-Mark is bizarre,' said one commentator last week. The crucial issue now is when Germany will ease policy. Miss Alison Cottrell, who keeps a close watch on the Bundesbank for Midland Global Markets in London, believes that a reduction in official rates is unlikely to come before the council meetings on February 4 or 18. The next council meeting is set for January 7, but this is one day before talks on the German public sector wage round are due to take place. 'The Bundesbank is unlikely to take any policy decisions before it knows the results of those talks,' she said.</p>

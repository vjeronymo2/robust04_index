Those officers said the head of  Futungo de Belas is misinformed about the military situation in  the country, since it is the Popular Movement for the Liberation  of Angola-Labor Party [MPLA-PT] who is currently involved in an  offensive in the north, center and south of Angola. They added  that at present the MPLA-PT is launching an offensive in the  north of Bengo Province, in the east of Cubal, and north west of  Lubango, displaying sophisticated war materiel recently acquired  from Western countries. The FALA officers said Eduardo dos  Santos' speech expressed the desire for war. Another source in  Jamba said the speech was characteristic of warmongering  generals who only prosper with prolonged war, and it is typical  of communist generals to pretend to be victims while in fact  they are the aggressors.</p>

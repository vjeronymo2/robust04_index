			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Marxist-Leninist followers on 19 February  commemorated the 66th anniversary of the founding of the  Paraguayan Communist Party [PCP], recalling the many  persecutions of the party and the deaths of various leaders  during the military dictatorships. The political association's  leaders expressed their commitment to the peasant and labor  masses during all the ceremonies and acts celebrating their  anniversary during the week, which concluded on 19 February with  a political activity at the Salesian school.    Socialism as a political and economic alternative for  Paraguayan society and the responsibility of the leaders of the  various progressive organizations in the creation of better  living conditions for peasants, workers, and other social groups  were the most-discussed items during two panel-debates at Viola  House during the week. All the activities were organized by  members of the PCP, which celebrated its 66th anniversary on 19  February.    Two commemorative activities were organized 19 February:  During the first ceremony a flower wreath was laid at the Ortiz  Guerrero-Flores public square in Jose Asuncion Flores' honor at  1000. During the ceremony PCP leaders outlined the participation  of the creator of the Guarania [Paraguayan music] in Communist  Party activities. The central activity, which had a political  and cultural tone, was carried out at the Salesian Sacred Heart  of Jesus School at 2000. Speaking on the occasion were PCP  President Ananias Maidana, Febrerista Revolutionary Party  President Victor Hugo Sanchez, political expert Line Bareiro,  and others who expounded on the critical situation of poverty in  the country and proposed a further unity of leftist forces and  progressive organizations in actions seeking to better organize  groups affected by the present socioeconomic situation.  <H5>  "Socialism Has Not Died" </H5>   Maidana held a news conference. He said Marxism has a lot to  contribute to the country's new era. "Those who say that  socialism has died have bad intentions or do not know anything  about the historic process of peoples development," Maidana said.    "A form of socialism has died, yes, but we know that the  greater victories in favor of the most unprotected groups of  society have been achieved following pressure exerted by society  in demand for respect for their rights. The achievements in the  area of social rights were not won by just conservatives and  reactionaries," Maidana said.    Asked about the PCP position regarding private property,  Maidana said that at present "we are not against private  property, but we favor the idea that land should be in the hands  of those working it, which in this case are the peasants."</p>

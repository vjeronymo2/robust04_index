			<p><P> April 21, 1989, Friday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> A judge has ordered a Ridgecrest couple to stand trial on felony child  endangerment charges stemming from the malnutrition death of their 2-month-old  daughter. Kern County prosecutors charge that James Lee, 37, and Tonnette Rae  Lee, 28, allowed conditions to exist that were likely to produce great bodily  harm or death to their daughter, Janelle Lee. Sheriff's reports said the baby  weighed 3 pounds, 14 ounces when she died Dec. 8, well below the 5 pounds, 6  ounces she weighed at birth on Oct. 1. The couple, who have two older children,  said they fed Janelle a milk formula and a brand-name baby food regularly. They  said they discussed taking her to a doctor two weeks before she died. However,  the couple had only one car, which Lee needed to get to work at China Lake  Naval Weapons Station. West Kern Municipal Judge Phil McNutt scheduled  arraignment May 3 in Superior Court.  </P></p>

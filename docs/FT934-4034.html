			<p>931206 FT  06 DEC 93 / Volvo - Collapse of the merger with Renault: Soren Gyll denies that he betrayed Pehr Gyllenhammar / Hugh Carnegy talks to the man who recommended that the merger with Renault should be withdrawn In the final, dramatic days last week that led to Volvo pulling out of its controversial plan to merge with France's Renault, Mr Soren Gyll, Volvo's chief executive, was identified as the man who led a 'palace coup' to kill the deal. Mr Gyll does not deny his central role in the merger's demise. But he stiffened with anger yesterday afternoon at the suggestion that he betrayed Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who quit after 22 years as Volvo's leader when confronted with a demand from senior management that the merger be dropped. 'Absolutely not],' Mr Gyll exclaimed. 'That is complete nonsense. I met him as we are sitting now and told him exactly what my position was. Is that betrayal?' Sitting in a small conference room in Volvo's headquarters outside Gothenburg, Mr Gyll said that under Swedish corporate law he was under no obligation to give prior notice to the chairman of the company before making a recommendation to the board that the merger should be withdrawn, but he had done so last week. He said he met Mr Gyllenhammar on Wednesday, the day before the fateful board meeting, to tell him he (Mr Gyll) had concluded that shareholder opinion and opinion within Volvo was now against proceeding with the merger. He had not gone behind Mr Gyllenhammar's back in any way. 'I am really upset, because that is not my way of working,' he said. 'I didn't betray anybody. I am surprised and also upset because I have tried to do everything right. 'This is the worst decision I have ever been involved in. It is a serious one, of course, but I was prepared to take all the responsibility. 'And I am still convinced the decision was right. And remember, the board took the decision, not me. I just gave the recommendation . . . PG (Gyllenhammar) took his own decision (to resign). 'I didn't know when I went into the board meeting what the outcome would be. They could have fired me. That could have been my last board meeting - that's what I told my wife when I went there. I could have been shooting myself in the head]' Mr Gyll said that he had come to realise over last weekend that the chances of winning shareholder approval for the merger - originally announced in September - at a special shareholder's meeting on December 7 had all but disappeared. At the same time, he was alarmed by growing dissent within Volvo, where engineers, white collar workers and a number of senior managers were expressing opposition to going ahead. Mr Gyll therefore asked a group of senior managers from Volvo's car and truck divisions to come to his home in Gothenburg last Tuesday evening for what was to prove the decisive blow to the merger. 'They came on Tuesday night. My only question was what do you think about the situation we have now. After a couple of hours it was obvious there was a uniform view that the conditions were not there to make a successful merger - both with the external reactions, but also the internal situation. 'A lot of people in managerial positions were very doubtful about it. 'The conclusion I think was that you can't have a successful merger if you don't have the people with you.' The next day, some 25 managers signed a letter to Mr Gyll asking him to tell the board that they wanted the merger scrapped and expressing their full confidence in him to lead the company thereafter. But Mr Gyll strongly denies that he either initiated the letter, or that he presented it to the board. 'The letter to me is not important. I asked for nothing,' he said. 'On the contrary, on Wednesday when Gyllenhammar came back from a visit to the States, we met and talked and I said I didn't see the prerequisites for a successful merger. Then I prepared a memo myself for the board meeting. I didn't refer to the letter, I didn't present it.' Despite being irked by the label of coup leader, Mr Gyll was for the most part in remarkably relaxed mood yesterday. Dressed in a sweater and corduroy trousers and nursing a cold, he seemed relieved that the tension of the past weeks was behind him. Amid the uncertainty and bitterness left behind by the broken merger, Mr Gyll looks to be unchallenged as the new man in charge of Sweden's biggest and best-loved industrial concern. While Volvo's institutional shareholders are mostly glad to see the back of Mr Gyllenhammar, who rubbed them up the wrong way once too often, they appear to have full confidence in Mr Gyll. The irony is that it was Mr Gyllenhammar who brought him in to be Volvo chief executive early last year from Procordia, the drugs and food group which Mr Gyll had headed for eight years. Procordia, previously half owned by the state and Volvo, has been broken in two. Volvo is taking over all its food operations through a company called BCP, and retaining a big stake in the other half, Pharmacia. Mr Gyllenhammar's idea was that Mr Gyll was the man to run the newly-structured Volvo parent, which in effect was to have become a diversified industrial investment company. Meanwhile, Mr Gyllenhammar was to have played the main role from Volvo's side in what was to have been its 35 per cent investment in a new Renault-Volvo company. Now Mr Gyll, a man with no previous experience of the motor industry, is left in charge of a Volvo which may again focus on its core vehicle making business. He must also pick up the pieces with Renault, where he is inevitably regarded with some suspicion compared with the previous enthusiasm for the French-speaking Mr Gyllenhammar. Mr Gyll, who agrees Volvo still requires a long-term partner in the motor industry, wants to continue a three-year old alliance with Renault. He says he told Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chief executive, about his decision to recommend dropping the merger before Thursday's board meeting. He told him such a decision was preferable either to an outright shareholder rejection, or a narrow approval that would have been challenged in the courts. The two will discuss the future of their co-operation early this week. 'I have to offer them apologies because we haven't delivered what we promised and I am very sad about that because if you can't deliver on your promises, that is not good for the future.' Mr Gyll acknowledges that both sides will need time to 'cool off' before deciding how to proceed. But he made clear Volvo would like to maintain initiatives taken under the existing alliance with Renault, such as joint purchasing and quality organisations. 'Now we are back in the position where we should consider if we can build the alliance for the future. I mean we could create some joint structure if we want - with 50 - 50 ownership, for example. It's a question of whether Renault still has a trust in Volvo, because we know we have failed to deliver.' As for Volvo itself, Mr Gyll admits it 'could be' that the long-time Gyllenhammar strategy of diversification will be altered in favour of a stronger focus on vehicle manufacture - something most Swedes would applaud. But he stressed that it is too early to predict what shape the company will take - except to affirm that 'there will be life after this'. He rejects the parting judgment of Mr Gyllenhammar that Volvo is now a 'wounded company' as it faces a future with its central strategy shattered and without the man who was 'Mr Volvo'. 'Of course I feel sad that Pehr decided to leave. He was the reason I came to Volvo. On the other hand an organisation cannot be built on one man. I am convinced we have the resources, we have the people. But you have to give us a little time so that we can fit together.'</p>

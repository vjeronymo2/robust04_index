			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Finnair goes back on Boeing order FINNAIR, the loss-making Finnish national airline, yesterday said it had decided not to proceed with plans to replace its 10 McDonnell Douglas and Airbus wide-bodied aircraft with Boeings because of the cost. The airline announced in April that it had signed a letter of intent with Boeing and International Lease Finance Corporation that envisaged the replacement of Finnair's entire 44-strong fleet with a new fleet based on the Boeing 676 and 737 families of aircraft by the end of the decade. Since then Finnair has reported losses after financial items in the year to the end of March 1993 of FM415m (Dollars 72.8m), more than double the loss the previous year, and warned of a hard year ahead.</p>

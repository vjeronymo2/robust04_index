			<p><P> September 28, 1989, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TEACHERS UNSURE ABOUT FLUNKING;  </P> <P> SOME STUDENTS BENEFIT, BUT OTHERS SUFFER FROM LOWERED SELF-ESTEEM  </P> <P> The letter last June from Sun Valley Junior High School to Miguel Hernandez's  parents, informing them that their son would have to repeat seventh grade  didn't exactly come as a surprise.  </P> <P> All year, Miguel's teachers and parents had warned him that if he didn't shape  up and do his work, he would flunk. And all year, Miguel hadn't listened.  </P> <P> "I was lazy," said Miguel, 14. "I went to class, but I didn't do anything else.  They told me I would flunk, but I didn't pay any attention to them."  </P> <P> The letter changed that. Faced with watching his friends go on to eighth grade  without him and having to live with the humiliation he said he felt, Miguel  suddenly got a new attitude. He signed up for summer school and attended math  and computer classes, even when other students with similar problems were  encouraging him to leave school. He pulled his grades up to B's and C's. And  when school began in September, Miguel entered eighth grade with his friends,  grateful to have gotten a second chance.  </P> <P> "I was embarrassed about it," he said about the possibility of retention. "I  don't know anyone who wants that to happen."  </P> <P> Miguel's story of sudden motivation isn't the most commonly heard one when  educators discuss retention. In most cases, the debate over the pros and cons  of holding a child back have traditionally focused on a few key issues: Does  retaining a child give him a chance to catch up with his peers and increase the  likelihood of his succeeding in school? Or does it do the opposite, instilling  in him a sense of low self-esteem that sets him up for later failure?  </P> <P> Faced with new research that suggests the latter may be the case, educators,  teachers and parents are beginning to more closely examine retention. For  example:  </P> <P> * A recent study of 70,000 students in four school districts found that  students who are forced to repeat a grade are 20% more likely to drop out of  high school than their peers.  </P> <P> * Research at the University of Colorado found that students who spend two  years in kindergarten because they failed kindergarten readiness tests fared no  better in first grade.  </P> <P> * One study on teacher attitudes toward retention showed that among those  surveyed, the majority of teachers exaggerated the benefits of retention and  held beliefs not necessarily borne out by statistics.  </P> <P> "It used to be that if a child didn't get what was being taught, we just held  him back," said Carol Fox, curriculum consultant with the Los Angeles County  Office of Education. "Now we're finding that retention has all sorts of  problems.  </P> <P> "Even at a very young age," she added, "it can show up later in low  self-esteem. It's a very serious move that leaves its mark."  </P> <P> In June, 1987, the last year for which figures were available, 29,786 out of  586,590 students in kindergarten through 12th grade were retained districtwide,  according to the Los Angeles Unified School District's office of research and  evaluation. That number reflected no significant change from 1983, when 27,168  out of 549,198 students were retained.  </P> <P> Although the decision to hold a child back must be approved by the parents, Fox  said, many teachers overestimate the benefits of retention and may convey that  at decision-making time.  </P> <P> Citing the study on teacher attitudes, she said, "They believed that retention  early on tended to prevent it in later grades, and also that it took students  from the bottom of one class and put them at the top of another. But neither  has ever been substantiated by research."  </P> <P> Research or no research, some education experts believe retention is a positive  option in some cases.  </P> <P> "Retention at the elementary school level, if it's not done as punishment for  failure to achieve but instead as a chance for something different, can pay off  and be valuable," said David Bower, administrator of the student guidance  services division for the LAUSD. "The problem comes later on in junior and  senior high school, when it almost becomes a set-up for failure."  </P> <P> Some parents apparently share that opinion. One school administrator recalled a  case two years ago in which the parents of twin girls in fourth grade asked  that one of the girls be retained. Although the principal advised against it,  the parents felt that the girl's lagging academic skills, which were two years  below grade level, warranted the move. The school finally agreed, and both  girls have reportedly adjusted well.  </P> <P> Fox, however, questions such a move. "Especially considering the close  relationship most twins have, it's bound to have an effect on her self-esteem  later on," she said.  </P> <P> Sarah Jane Moody, a sixth-grade teacher at West Vernon Elementary School in Los  Angeles, sees the issue from a slightly different perspective: "I think it  lowers a child's self-esteem a lot more to be in a class and not be able to  read what the other children are reading or to be able to answer a simple  question. To me, that is worse."  </P> <P> Moody had three children in her fifth-grade classroom last year whom she  recommended for retention. When she was given the sixth-grade teaching  assignment, she later decided to bring the three children into that classroom  instead. The combination of her knowledge of their weak areas and hard work on  their part, she said, will give them another chance to bring their skills up to  grade level.  </P> <P> On the flip side are students who are not held back but who perhaps should be.  "You have to understand that there is a battle of ages going on. The student is  getting older," said Linda Markham, an eighth-grade teacher at Sun Valley  Junior High School. "If a student has a number of fails, some are passed on not  because of academic merit, but because of their age. You can't have a  16-year-old in seventh grade."  </P> <P> The issue of retention has come to the attention of more and more parents in  recent years, especially in the face of a growing national trend to give  children standardized tests to determine whether they are ready for  kindergarten or first grade. According to the Washington, D.C.-based National  Assn. for the Education of Young Children, it is not uncommon for 20% of young  children to be held back from entering kindergarten, put in to a remedial or  developmental program or be held back from entering first grade.  </P> <P> "This happens despite the fact that research shows retention has potential  long-term effects on children's self-esteem," said Asa Hilliard, an Atlanta,  Ga., psychologist and professor at Georgia State University. "Significantly,  research does not show that retention has a positive effect on children's later  academic achievement."  </P> <P> Proponents of the developmental programs vehemently disagree. Instead of  putting socially or academically ill-prepared children in school just because  they are legally old enough to be there, they say, the transitional programs  allow them to mature and enter school a year later with stronger skills and a  positive attitude.  </P> <P> Although developmental or transitional programs for kindergarten-age children  have been adopted by about 25% of the Los Angeles County's 74 districts with  elementary schools, Fox said, they are not endorsed by the state Department of  Education. In a recently published report, she said, a departmental task force  said districts should concentrate instead on creating "integrated educational  programs" that are "age and individual appropriate."  </P> <P> "The thinking until now has been that the curriculum was OK, but that the child  wasn't ready for it. Now that's changing," Fox said. "Schools and teachers are  beginning to think that maybe it's not so much that the child isn't right for  the program, but that the program isn't right for the child. Still, we don't  have a magic wand to make the change overnight."  </P> <P> Contrary to some assumptions, the greatest number of children who are retained  in elementary school do not have identified learning disabilities, said student  guidance administrator Bower. Instead, he said, they are children "who are not  achieving up to their potential, for as many reasons as exist."  </P> <P> As with Miguel Hernandez, who simply chose not to do his work, teachers say it  isn't always so much that Johnny can't read, as much as Johnny won't read.  </P> <P> In a nationwide poll, conducted by the Institute for Motivational Development  in Chicago, teachers said that 40% of students don't work to capability. Adding  to the problem, parents are often either disinterested or too busy working to  take part in the educational needs of their children; kids may have an  emotionally difficult situation at home; and those children who have fallen  behind in a few classes may become overwhelmed, believing there is nothing they  can do to catch up.  </P> <P> Although the debate about retention is likely to rage for some time, teachers  and educators do appear to agree on one factor: the importance of parental  involvement.  </P> <P> "It's amazing how often a parent will be contacted about a student who is  failing, and the parent will express tremendous concern and then not do a  thing," said sixth-grade teacher Moody, who is trying to devise creative ways  to bring the children up to grade level.  </P> <P> "To help these kids outside the classroom, I told their parents I would be at  school each morning at 7:30 a.m. for homework help. So far this year," she  said, "only one student has showed up once."  </P></p>

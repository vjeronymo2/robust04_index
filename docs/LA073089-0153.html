			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DANNEMEYER ON HOMOSEXUALS  </P> <P> Well, another flap and more oppression as Rep. William E. Dannemeyer  (R-Fullerton) is at it again: Rather than striving for progress, growth, and  social relevance, he continues to incite and feed the flames of racism and  widespread prejudice against "the homosexual movement."  </P> <P> I think Dannemeyer's tactics are despicable and contemptuous of the system of  democracy that he infests. Dannemeyer is really out on a limb, however, this  time.  </P> <P> Dannemeyer has no business airing that kind of discussion in our Congressional  Record. We don't have straight congressmen describing heterosexual sex for the  sake of straw issues. There is no reason to further cloud and bias the issues  by Dannemeyer's feeding into ignorance in such a forum and in such a  self-serving and self-righteous manner.  </P> <P> I am outraged at Dannemeyer's actions because he continues to abuse and tax the  ideals of Democracy with his perverted and twisted ideas of what constitute  morality, fairness and human compassion.  </P> <P> I strongly support the legislative efforts of my progressive and clear-thinking  elected officials in their affirmative efforts to pass the legislation to  guarantee my fellow gay men and women the same anti-discriminatory protections  afforded racial minorities in the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  </P> <P> ANTHONY RAMIREZ  </P> <P> Santa Ana  </P></p>

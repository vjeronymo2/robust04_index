			<p><P> November 9, 1989, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN;  </P> <P> HOESTEREY TO RESIGN FROM CITY COUNCIL  </P> <P> In a development that could deadlock the Tustin City Council, Councilman Ronald  B. Hoesterey announced Wednesday that he will resign.  </P> <P> Hoesterey said the Nov. 20 meeting will probably be his last, because he is  moving from Pepperwood to Orange Park Acres and a house large enough that his  mother-in-law can live with the family.  </P> <P> Hoesterey, Mayor Ursula E. Kennedy and Mayor Pro Tem Richard B. Edgar have  frequently disagreed with Council Members John Kelly and Earl J. Prescott on  major issues. They have recently divided on the regulation of news racks and  the shift of election dates from November to April.  </P> <P> Those issues, plus the possible selection of a new mayor and mayor pro tem, are  scheduled for consideration at Hoesterey's last meeting.  </P> <P> Although his family will move next week, Hoesterey said he plans to stay with  relatives in Tustin to retain his resident status.  </P> <P> Without Hoesterey's vote, key issues could deadlock. "There is a possibility  for 2-2 votes that could stagnate the operations of the city," he said. "It is  my sincere hope that that doesn't occur."  </P> <P> The council has 30 days after Hoesterey resigns to appoint a replacement. If  members cannot agree, they must call an election.  </P> <P> Kennedy and Edgar said they are disappointed to see the departure of Hoesterey,  who has served on the council for almost 10 years.  </P> <P> "He's provided very good leadership, and he has a good balance between the  interests of the business community and the residential community," Kennedy  said.SHANNON SANDS  </P></p>

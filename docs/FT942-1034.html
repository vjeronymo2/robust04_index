			<p>940627 FT  27 JUN 94 / Major's defiance wins support from backbench Tories: Euro-sceptics welcome PM's veto of Dehaene to succeed Delors Mr John Major appeared to have strengthened his position within his party yesterday as Tory Euro-sceptics yesterday welcomed his veto of Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene as European Commission president. After his climbdown two months ago over majority voting, Mr Major is hoping that his defiant performance at the Corfu summit will appease his party's right wing enough to remove the threat of a challenge to his leadership in the autumn. The anger and bewilderment Mr Major left behind in Corfu will be followed today by noisy applause from the Euro-sceptics on the Tory backbenches in the House of Commons. Having narrowly avoided serious defeat in the recent elections for the European parliament, Mr Major decided that his precarious political position meant that isolation among his European partners was preferable to criticism from Conservative MPs at Westminster. However, leading Euro-sceptics warned that the prime minister's position could quickly weaken if he allowed another federalist to be appointed at the special European summit called for July 15 to resolve the issue. The decision to use Britain's veto appalled Tory members of the Positive European group who warned Mr Major that he could find himself in a weaker position by relying on the support of Euro-sceptics. However, he had little choice but to use the veto following a warning from Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, that acceptance of the Belgian prime minister as commission president would provoke a vicious backlash on the Tory backbenches. Speaking after the summit, the prime minister said he was 'unperturbed' by his isolation. He said: 'I believe that it is necessary, even at the expense of painful decisions and difficult moments to make sure that we have the best possible person for this vitally important job.' Mr Major attempted to play down suggestions that the move could signal a long-term crisis in Britain's relations with the other EU governments. He said that he 'warmly welcomed' the decision to hold another summit in July and was 'entirely' confident that a new candidate could be found that was acceptable to everyone. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, denied that Mr Major had acted against his advice in using Britain's veto, saying that he had no doubt about the 'rightness' of the prime minister's course. But there were clear signs that the foreign office would have preferred to avoid an 11-to-1 position. Despite his public protestations to the contrary, Mr Hurd seemed less than happy at the outcome. He had told cabinet colleagues before the summit that Mr Dehaene was not a federalist in the mould of Mr Jacques Delors. Mr Hurd has indicated that he does not plan to bow out from the government in the impending cabinet reshuffle. The Corfu vote, however, will encourage speculation over how long Mr Hurd will be content to run a European policy over which the Euro-sceptics appear to have such influence. Euro-sceptics such as Mr Norman Lamont, former chancellor, and Sir George Gardiner, chairman of the 92 group of Tory rightwingers, strongly backed the prime minister's 'robust stance'. But Mr Robert Hicks, a member of the Tory Postive European group, described the veto as 'regrettable'. Corfu summit analysis and reports, Pages 2-3 Editorial Comment, Page 23</p>

That notice listed almost all of the direct grant and fellowship programs under which the Secretary planned to make new awards in FY 1994 and included the application notices for many of those programs. The list included some programs for which application notices had not yet been published.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Since publication of the CAN, additional application notices have been published. In addition, on February 11, 1994, the Secretary published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 6826) a notice extending application deadline dates for certain programs. The Secretary took this action to assist potential applicants who may have been adversely affected by severe weather conditions in various parts of the Nation or by the earthquake in California. Also, since publication of the CAN, some new programs have been added, and some other programs have been withdrawn or replaced. The Secretary therefore determined that publication of an update would be useful to the educational community.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This notice, therefore, lists all FY 1994 programs previously announced in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , including those for which the deadline dates have already passed, as well as FY 1994 programs to be announced at a later date. As is the case with the CAN, this notice is designed to assist potential applicants in planning projects and activities. However, to expedite publication of this update, the Secretary has decided not to include any individual application notices. Application notices are published separately in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . If additional competitions are carried out in FY 1994 because of events not known at this time, the Secretary will announce those competitions in future issues of the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

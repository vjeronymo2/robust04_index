			<p><P> January 17, 1989, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Damon Corp. accepted a $223-million takeover offer from a group led by American  Magnetics Corp. in Sherman Oaks, apparently ending Damon's seven-month battle  to remain independent. However, the companies' agreement also allows Damon, a  Needham Heights, Mass.-based operator of clinical laboratories, to solicit  other offers for 30 days. American Magnetics makes optical-character  recognition equipment, the machines used to scan credit card data at store  checkout counters and the devices inside automated teller machines that read  customers' bank cards.  </P></p>

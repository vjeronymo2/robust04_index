			<p>910503 FT  03 MAY 91 / International Company News: Sharply higher costs leave Concept with FFr563m loss CONCEPT, the French computer services company now controlled by Altus Finance, the finance subsidiary of state-owned Credit Lyonnais, has announced heavy losses after writing off FFr206m (Dollars 36m) from the value of its acquisitions. The company, which plunged into the red last year as it struggled to cope with the management and financial costs of an ambitious expansion programme, said it made net losses of FFr563m. Altus took control of Concept last November, replacing Mr Olivier Spire, the company's founder, with its own nominee, Mr Eric Blot-Lefevre, and acquiring 45.8 per cent of its capital. It plans to take this stake up to a majority through a FFr140m capital increase, but this operation, originally intended for January, has been suspended because of an investigation into the company by the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock market regulatory authority. Altus, the former banking arm of the state-owned Thomson defence group, was transferred to Credit Lyonnais in 1989. It operates independently, however, doing 'what the Credit Lyonnais cannot do, does not want to do or does not know how to do,' according to Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, the banking group's chairman. It specialises in taking over bankrupt or failing businesses such as Concept with the aim of turning them round. It is leading a consortium discussing the takeover of the stricken Executive Life insurance company in California. On the operating level, Concept said FFr210m of 'non-recurrent' current expenses had taken it to an operating loss last year of FFr153m. Concept's debt burden, on which it incurred FFr131m of net financial expenses last year, has now been trimmed from FFr1.2bn to FFr960m. Sales of FFr470m in the first quarter were below budget. The company forecasts full-year sales of FFr2.1bn, against FFr1.9bn last year.</p>

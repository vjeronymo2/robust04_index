			<p>921002 FT  02 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major off the fence THE DECLARATION by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, that he wishes to bring the Maastricht treaty back for ratification in the House of Commons around the end of the year, is a welcome step forward. Everyone knows that the ratification debate is likely to be the scene of a bruising confrontation between the government and the Eurosceptics in the Conservative party; but in the last resort Mr Major is politically committed to the treaty, and there is no sense in which he can avoid the confrontation by procrastination. If the treaty is to be ratified, the Eurosceptics will have to be faced down, and it will be up to Mr Major to exercise the appropriate leadership over his party to secure the necessary majority. As far as it goes, then, Mr Major's announcement sends the right signal to the Conservative party, to British public opinion, and to the governments of the other member states in the European Community. If the government looked as though it was scrabbling for any and every pretext to run away from the Maastricht treaty, Mr Major has now given notice that he intends to stand and fight, for a treaty which he claimed a bare 10 months ago as a triumph for Britain. Moreover, his words last night may gain him time. In the face of what looked like British delaying tactics, some other European governments have apparently been flirting with the idea that an inner core of member states might move ahead without Britain. If they are now persuaded that Mr Major is really determined to stand up for the treaty, they may also be readier to negotiate with Britain rather than leave it behind. Mr Major seems to have been emboldened to declare his position by the belief that he can secure agreement with the other member states, perhaps at the Birmingham summit this month, on a form of words which will make it easier for him to get the treaty through the House of Commons. Since the government is most anxious to fend off accusations by Eurosceptics that the Maastricht treaty will introduce an interfering, centralised federal state, its top priority will be to strengthen the principle of subsidiarity by which the Community should only engage in policies which cannot be done better in the nation states. Whether an interpretative declaration by the 12 governments will really give the principle of subsidiarity the force of law may be open to doubt; it may also be questioned whether a mere declaration will make a large difference to the balance of votes in the House of Commons. But that is the judgment which the government must make; and it is in the House that it must fight and win its victory. Last night's lecture to the European Policy Forum, by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, was obviously intended to prepare the ground for this debate. But it cannot be described as an inspiring document. Mr Hurd is known to be a committed European and supporter of the Maastricht treaty; yet his lecture was an exercise in faint praise, in which his main purpose seemed to be to minimise the significance of the treaty. It is now up to Mr Major to lead his party beyond this timorous position.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Illusory gains of Britain's 'competitive devaluation' FROM the sheltered environment of the British Home Office, chancellor Kenneth Clarke must step into the real world. Managing the government's current exchange rate and fiscal policies in the face of the harsh financial markets and the UK's irritated European partners leaves little room for the robust approach. Mr Clarke may find it politic to join the rest of his colleagues in biting his lip when Britain's partners boo and hiss. The ostensible cause of the present continental hostility towards the UK is the accumulating evidence that British economic growth has revived, following sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism last September. Meanwhile, the rest of northern Europe slips towards recession. With economic cycles so out of line, the British government argues that re-entry into the ERM would be foolish. But even if Britain's Euro-enthusiastic chancellor wanted to bring sterling back into the ERM, it is uncertain that re-entry would soothe the wounds. More likely, the UK would be accused of trying to 'lock-in' a lower exchange rate, at the expense of its European partners. For the UK, along with Spain and Italy, stands charged with using last September's difficulties to gain an advantage through 'beggar-thy-neighbour' devaluations. Mr Erik Hoffmeyer, the Danish central bank chief, said last week that monetary co-operation in Europe had broken down because devaluing currencies had been allowed to 'win' an unjustified advantage. Mr Hoffmeyer is not the first person to make this charge. Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgium's prime minister, said recently that monetary union was needed to 'put an end to competitive devaluations.' Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, also worries that the Single Market would not survive if Europe were hit by further 'competitive devaluations'. The UK, Spain and Italy have indeed seen an improvement in the price competitiveness of their exports within Europe since last summer, as the charts show. Against a trade-weighted basket of European currencies and adjusted for relative inflation rates, the Spanish peseta and the Italian lira have both depreciated by 14 per cent since last August. The UK real exchange rate initially fell by 13 per cent, but sterling's subsequent relative strength has reduced the gains in export competitiveness, within Europe, to 7 per cent. The accusation of competitive devaluation does not seem fair. The implication that Spain, Italy or the UK deliberately chose to devalue does not fit the facts. Politicians in all three countries staked their credibility on defending the ERM parities; some, notably Mr Norman Lamont, have suffered for their failure. Since all three countries have suffered rising trade deficits in recent years, it seems wrong to argue that these devaluations increased competitive advantage. They were rather about removing the competitive disadvantage of over-valued real exchange rates. In the case of the UK, the charge is empirically incorrect. Since the beginning of 1987, when the hardened ERM emerged, Spanish competitiveness has improved by 7 per cent, while Italian competitiveness has improved by 11 per cent. But UK competitiveness has declined by 9 per cent, as the chart shows. The UK's gains since last summer do not compensate for the loss of competitiveness during sterling's appreciation between 1987 and 1988 and the UK's relatively high inflation between the end of 1989 and 1992. The charge that the British government engineered a competitive devaluation looks weak. The risk for the rest of Europe is not that the UK is going to 'lock-in' at too competitive a rate. The danger for continental Europe is rather that the combination of Britain's trade and fiscal deficits with a bombastic chancellor may send sterling spiralling down again, unless sterling rejoins the ERM soon. A better strategy for northern Europe would be to stop complaining and start wooing.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------         INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC INDICATORS: MONEY AND FINANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- This table shows growth rates for the most widely followed measures of narrow and broad money, a representative short- and long-term interest rate series and an average equity market yield.

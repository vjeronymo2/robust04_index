			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / International Company News: Sharp rise in profits at Guoco Guoco Group, the Hong Kong-based financial services and garment company controlled by the Malaysian Quek family, yesterday reported a sharp rise in net profits, to HKDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 168.4m) from HKDollars 573.8m for the year to June 30. The group made HKDollars 309m from investment and property sales, which were taken above the line. Earnings did not include transfers to inner reserves, although this practice - now widespread among the colony's banks - is being phased out. Earnings per share rose to HKDollars 3.43 from HKDollars 1.64. A final dividend of 45 cents is recommended. This, taken with the interim dividend, marks a 23 per cent increase on the previous year's payout. The result was boosted by Dao Heng Bank, the group's main operating subsidiary which was spun off in a separate listing last December. The group, which has 90 branches in Hong Kong, saw net profits surge to HKDollars 1bn from HKDollars 400.8m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Guarded calm and tension prevail in the southern  villages adjacent to the contact lines with the enemy positions  inside the occupied border strip after continuing acts of  aggression. The Israeli occupation forces in Tallat Sujud  bombarded the Iqlim al-Tuffah hills at 1600 today. The sporadic  bombardment reached Mlita, al-Luwayzah, and Mlikh. The Israeli  forces raked al-Luwayzah with heavy machine-gun fire for 30  minutes.    The Israeli forces in al-Qantarah pounded Qabrikha with  about  20 tank rounds at 0600 today, causing damage to property. They  also pounded the valleys and hills surrounding Qabrikha. They  shelled the same area last night. At dawn today, the Israeli  forces raked the Jabal al-Rafi' in Iqlim al-Tuffah with heavy  machine guns and illuminated the area with flares. Israeli  helicopters staged several sorties over al-Shaqif castle, Kafr  Tibnit, 'Ali al-Tahir, and al-Burj. [passage omitted]    The Islamic Resistance issued a statement saying that three  members were martyred in an encounter between its groups and the  Israeli occupation forces in the Bi'r Kallab-Sujud area last  night. The funeral of the three martyrs took place this  afternoon. [passage omitted]    An Israeli gunboat this afternoon intercepted a Lebanese  commercial ship coming from Germany off Tyre and subjected it to  a search that lasted for several hours.</p>

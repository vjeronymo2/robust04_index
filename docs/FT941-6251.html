			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / International Company News: Deficit deepens at Nissan Spanish unit Expectations of sharply deteriorating results at Nissan Motor Iberica, the Spanish subsidiary of the Japanese Nissan car group, were confirmed yesterday with the announcement of a Pta40.95bn (Dollars 293m) pre-tax loss for 1993. This was almost three times its deficit of Pta14.37bn the previous year. The figures were in line with forecasts. They reflected a rise in net operating losses, to Pta23.21bn from Pta8.26bn, and higher financial costs of Pta21.17bn compared with Pta11.10bn. However the year showed an increase in sales by the company, which makes commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles, to Pta182bn from Pta163bn. Unit sales rose by about 3,500 to just over 100,000. Last November, Nissan increased its stake in the company from 70 per cent to 96 per cent at a cost of about Pta8.5bn. It also announced a three-year restructuring plan, including the laying off of 1,000 of its 7,000 employees. Nissan's difficulties in Spain, where it has five plants, have coincided with problems at Volkswagen's Seat subsidiary and Suzuki's offshoot, Santana Motor, which filed for receivership earlier last month and is seeking government support.</p>

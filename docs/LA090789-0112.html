			<p><P> September 7, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PEOPLE: MCKESSON CEO RESIGNS AFTER BOARD DISPUTE  </P> <P> The chairman and chief executive of McKesson Corp. has abruptly resigned from  the $7-billion drug and health-care distribution company after a disagreement  with the board.  </P> <P> Thomas Field Jr. resigned "because of differences with the board over  management philosophy and the future direction of the company," the firm said  in a brief statement.  </P> <P> A company spokesman said Field submitted his resignation at a regularly  scheduled board meeting in San Francisco. The spokesman would not elaborate on  Field's differences with the board and had no comment on whether his  resignation was requested.  </P> <P> Field could not be reached for comment.  </P> <P> Field, 55, joined McKesson in 1984 as president and chief operating officer. In  July, 1986, he was named president and chief executive, and in July, 1988, he  assumed the duties of chairman.  </P> <P> Neil Harlan, Field's predecessor as chairman from 1979 to 1988, was elected  chairman and chief executive on an interim basis in the wake of Field's  resignation, the company said.  </P> <P> During his tenure, Field oversaw much of a corporate restructuring begun under  Harlan that refocused McKesson on its core drug and general merchandise  distribution businesses.  </P> <P> In 1988, the company sold all of its wine, spirits and liquor businesses.  Earlier this year, it signed an agreement to sell its veterinary products  distribution division to a division of Colgate-Palmolive Co. for an undisclosed  sum.  </P> <P> In the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, McKesson reported a 3.9% increase in  earnings to $24 million, or 57 cents a share, but earnings from continuing  operations were flat. Sales grew to $1.49 billion from $1.35 billion in the  same quarter of 1988.  </P></p>

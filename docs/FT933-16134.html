			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / The G7 Summit: Lame duck Miyazawa will try to do his duty - Japan's premier faces a clash between his responsibilities as G7 host and as a leading LDP campaigner THE summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations this week has become caught in the swirl of campaigning for Japan's snap general election on July 18. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa is almost certain not to remain prime minister after the election. His mismanagement of the ruling Liberal Democratic party's warring factions provoked the split in its ranks which led to its defeat in a no confidence motion, thence to the election. Since then, Mr Miyazawa's authority has drained away. Mr Michio Watanabe, former foreign minister, has called for his resignation. Mr Kabun Muto, present foreign minister, who will be alongside the prime minister at many of the summit sessions, has remarked darkly that Mr Miyazawa's greatest contribution to the LDP election campaign might be to die suddenly, inspiring sympathy votes. In spite of the attacks on him within his own party, as well as from the opposition, Mr Miyazawa will want to be seen to be fulfilling his national and party duty. The LDP will want to use the summit to show it is the only party capable of the statemanship needed to represent Japan at the top table of international politics. Mr Miyazawa will make polite noises about Japan's aspiration to become a permanent member of the United Nations security council, about its international aid programme and its role as a representative of Asian interests within the G7. Yet several issues will present him with a clash between his responsibilities as host and his duties as leading LDP campaigner. President Bill Clinton and other leaders are likely to play up the significance of the planned Dollars 2bn privatisation fund for Russia, even though most of the money will be redirected from existing aid programmes. The idea of giving more money to Russia is unpopular in Japan, however, partly because President Boris Yeltsin has twice cancelled recent visits to Tokyo to discuss unsettled territorial disputes. As host, Mr Miyazawa will be unable to distance himself from the fund, which he will officially present to the world. As LDP leader, he knows his party's electoral standing would be improved by taking a hard line on the issue. So one of the more significant meetings for Japan could be Mr Miyazawa's session with Mr Yeltsin. The LDP hopes the Russian leader will stress the significance he attaches to good relations with Tokyo and promise to reschedule his visit. Such a pledge might soothe Japan's badly wounded pride and get Mr Miyazawa out of his dilemma. Electoral considerations will also weigh heavily in Japan's conduct of talks with the US and over the Gatt world trade negotiations. Mr Miyazawa will not want to be seen to concede anything to the US president on trade talks between the two countries. A tougher line will play better with the Japanese electorate. Japan would like to claim responsibility for overseeing a Gatt talks breakthrough, but it will not make concessions that could hurt domestic constituencies which, two weeks later, could punish the LDP. Even so, Mr Miyazawa will not be able to do much about his main problem  - his image as a tired, ageing politician alongside the youthful Mr Clinton, who is to meet some of the opposition leaders who could form the next government. The president's zest will only strengthen the reformers' argument - particularly that of relatively young leaders such as Mr Morihiro Hosokawa of the New Japan Party and Mr Tsutomu Hata of the Japan Renewal Party - that Japanese politics needs to jump generations so as to produce new policies for Japan's expanding world role. The more this is Mr Clinton's summit, the less it will be Mr Miyazawa's. A few months ago, the latter was looking forward to the summit as a staging post to his second two-year term as LDP president and prime minister. Instead, it could be an uncomfortable end to a long career at the top of Japanese politics.</p>

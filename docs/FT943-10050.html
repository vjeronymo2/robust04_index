			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / China to assess state assets China plans a nationwide survey to assess the value of assets of some 150,000 state-owned enterprises, as part of its efforts to salvage an indebted state sector and establish procedures for the sale of state assets. The official China Daily newspaper reported at the weekend that the survey was aimed at improving the management of state assets and follows a pilot project last year that found 10,000 state-owned companies had understated their assets by 42 per cent, or Yn180bn (Pounds 13.3bn). Assessing the true value of their assets has become one of the most vexed issues facing China's economic reformers in their efforts to rescue faltering state enterprises whose best hope of survival lies in being converted to shareholding companies or merged with other enterprises, securing foreign partners, or being sold to the private sector. But questions over the real value of assets in a country where markets are primitive has become a sensitive political issue, with claims that the state's birthright is being squandered. The State Asset Management Bureau estimates that 'losses' of state assets, mostly by undervaluation, amounted to Yn500bn in the past decade. The bureau also said two-thirds of state businesses setting up joint ventures with overseas companies had not properly evaluated their assets. The State Council, China's cabinet, issued regulations last month requiring proceeds from the sale of state assets to be lodged in a central fund which would be used to 'promote the development of large and medium-sized state enterprises', according to China Daily.</p>

			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / International Company News: Ontario Hydro takes CDollars 1.3bn charge ONTARIO Hydro, Canada's largest power utility, is to take a CDollars 1.3bn (USDollars 1.03bn) charge this year to cover the cost of its restructuring. About 4,500 staff will be leaving, including senior managers. The charge will include a penalty of several hundred million dollars for cancellation of a multi-billion 15-year power contract. The contract was signed with Manitoba Hydro but is now considered superfluous because of lack of growth in the Ontario market. The charge also takes in CDollars 500m for the staff reductions. 'We're taking the big hit in 1993,' said Mr Maurice Strong, chairman, who was appointed last year to reverse the deterioration in Ontario Hydro's fortunes. The company is being divided into three groups: Ontario Hydro Enterprises, headed by Mr Strong and handling the marketing of expertise abroad and development of new technology; Ontario Hydro Electricity, run by Mr Allan Kupcis, president, and operating 80 nuclear, coal and hydro-generating plants and the distribution grid; Ontario Hydro Energy, handling conservation and customer relations and headed by Mr John Fox, a Canadian formerly with Pacific Gas &amp; Electric in California. The utility is revaluing assets to be placed into each group and allocation of its CDollars 34bn debt. Mr Strong said that Ontario Hydro would now sell power at competitive rates and costs would be tailored to set the market.</p>

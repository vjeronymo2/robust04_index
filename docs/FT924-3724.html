			<p>921205 FT  05 DEC 92 / Finance and the Family (Briefcase): Protected investments IN COMMON with many thousands of self-employed people, we paid single premium pensions each year to the maximum allowed. These have now been converted into annuities. In the event of the issuing insurance companies finding themselves in financial difficulties - not impossible these days - what would be the position of the annuitants? Insurance policyholders and annuitants enjoy better protection as a result of the Policyholder Protection Act 1975 (in most cases, 90 per cent-plus of their investment guaranteed) than depositors with banks (whose deposits are protected only up to Pounds 15,000) and users of other financial institutions. No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

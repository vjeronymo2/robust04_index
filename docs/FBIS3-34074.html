			<p>Language: <F P=105> Turkish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "The Security Agreement Between </F> Turkey and Israel"]    [Text] In a statement to the Zionist newspaper YEDI'OT  AHARONOT last week, Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said: We  support the concept of Turkey's strategic cooperation with  Israel against terrorism and we do not hide the fact that we  cooperate with Israel against the Hizbullah in Lebanon. We are  not worried in any way.    Meanwhile, President Ezer Weizman said in Turkey: Israel is  prepared to exchange information with Turkey on matters related  to the struggle against terrorism.    Turkey and Israel have maintained relations since the  occupation of Palestine in 1948. Ankara's relations with the  Zionist regime improved further after the PLO concluded an  agreement with Tel Aviv and autonomous status was given to Gaza  and Eriha [Jericho]. That was followed by Foreign Minister  Hikmet Cetin's visit to the occupied territories. That was the  first time a Turkish foreign minister had visited the occupied  territories for 45 years.    Several political experts believe that the improvement of  relations between Ankara and Tel Aviv should be assessed within  the framework of the U.S. plan for a new order in the Middle  East. The experts are convinced that Washington is directing  pressure on the Arab countries in the Middle East to force them  to coexist in peace with the Zionist regime. As far as  Washington is concerned, that will establish a kind of peace  that will safeguard U.S. interests in the region. Considering  that, the political experts in Washington are trying to draw up  plans for a rapprochement among the countries of the region,  using pretexts such as the establishment of the Middle East  [words indistinct] or the establishment of a common market in  the region.    However, several political experts are convinced that the  aim  of establishing such organizations is to obstruct the  strengthening of the activities of Islamic movements, such as  the Hizbullah, which pose a threat to the interests of Western  countries and reactionary forces in the region. The political  experts are also convinced that, in addition to their struggle  against the Islamic movements, the organizations will try to  resolve the problems that threaten tranquillity in the region,  problems that concern security, the water supply, and economic  development. These organizations will be established through  economic, military, and political cooperation between the  Zionist regime, Turkey, and Egypt, the strongest allies of the  Western countries in the region. They will be assigned two  tasks to fulfill in the political and economic fields. Israel,  Turkey, and Egypt have been assigned to cooperate to facilitate  the establishment of a new order in the Middle East, as planned  by the Western countries.    However, the Western countries and their allies have failed  to realize a fact in the Middle East: the existence of the  Islamic revolutionary movements, which are strengthening  regardless of the strong pressure on them. U.S. and Zionist  designs cannot obstruct those movements, even if certain  countries in the region cooperate with Washington and the  Zionist regime.</p>

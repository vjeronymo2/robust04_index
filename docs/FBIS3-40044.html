			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Greek Aegean Minister Konstandinos Skandalidhis said  that Greece believes the current strategy of resolving national  issues here and now ignores history, is dangerous, and presents  a hazard for all who express it and promote it. Skandalidhis  was speaking this evening at Famagusta Gate in Nicosia. He  stressed that the so-called Greek-Turkish differences are no  longer being dealt with in a framework in which the balances are  negative. He added that although Cyprus has been at the center  of attention for 20 years and the tragedy of the Cypriot people  seems endless, there can be no final division in which there are  hostages and occupation in the name of despair or fatigue.    Skandalidhis agreed with President Glavkos Kliridhis' view  that the final solution does not seem close. But, he said, this  does not mean we should refrain from using every international  framework for dialogue or from searching for secondary solutions  when these do not hurt the final goal. Let us be aware, he  said, of time as a strategy.    The Greek Aegean minister said the Cyprus issue was, is, and  will be a problem of invasion and occupation and change in  demographic norms by force. He added that having as firm goals  a united and independent Republic of Cyprus and the withdrawal  of the occupation troops, we are promoting a pannational effort  for a productive, just, and viable solution.    Skandalidhis added that when it comes to the structural  choices-- the pannational conference, the amendment of the  Butrus-Ghali set of ideas, and Cyprus' accession to the European  Union--Greece backs the common will of the Cypriot leadership.    The Greek minister said he thought Turkey would not succeed  with its final goals. Time works against Turkey, its alliances  lose strength, and its position is getting weaker all the time.    Skandalidhis said that Hellenism has two major strategic  directions. One is the national defense line that unites Thrace  with the Aegean and Cyprus. The other is the Balkan and  Mediterranean axis, that is, the offensive line connecting the  eastern and northern borders and that has as a front, the Balkan  peninsula, Central and East Europe, and the southeast  Mediterranean.</p>

			<p>930224 FT  24 FEB 93 / World Trade News: UK upset over minimum price plan EUROPEAN Commission plans to press for minimum prices on east European steel exports go against the spirit of free trade agreements with emerging democracies to the east, according to Britain, Andrew Hill writes from Brussels. Brussels has said the EC should persuade east European governments to impose minimum prices over three years, or face stiff anti-dumping duties. Community industry ministers will discuss the plan tomorrow, when they are expected to give initial political backing to an overall programme of support for the ailing EC steel industry, in exchange for deep cuts in capacity. Britain made the development of partnerships with eastern Europe a priority of its EC presidency, which ended in December, and believes the Commission proposals run counter to the conclusions of the Edinburgh summit. EC leaders at Edinburgh called for implementation of last year's commercial and political agreements with the Czech and Slovak republics, Poland and Hungary 'speedily and in full'. However, it is already clear that the British position is unlikely to win much support in tomorrow's council. Germany, Italy and Spain are said to be particularly eager for more protection against cheap imports.</p>

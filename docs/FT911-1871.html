			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / Letter: Advice to banks - try paying more visits Sir, P H Nunnerley, in his letter of April 23, states that 'we constantly remind our customers to come to their bank manager at the first signs of problems'. Sadly, despite all the glitz and rhetoric of the marketing men, this is the same old tongue-in-cheek message preached by many bank managers up and down the country. Since problem detection in this manner can be a highly subjective exercise (how many small business owners, totally immersed in the running of their business, would elect to soldier on in the sometimes mistaken hope that the matter would self-correct, rather than admit they had a problem?), would it not be both more productive and desirable for the bank manager TO GO AND SEE HIS CUSTOMER? By so doing, he would be demonstrating a real interest in his customer's affairs as well as acquainting himself first-hand with some of the problems and frustrations of trying to do business in the real world. To maintain, as Mr Nunnerley does, that banks 'are largely in the hands of the companies themselves', smacks of appalling smugness: try telling that with a straight face to a small business owner, mortgaged to the hilt and with a debenture around his neck. In the final analysis, there can be no substitute for the good old-fashioned virtue of customer service and in a world where long-established beliefs and conventions are rapidly being swept aside, bank managers would do well to spend more time in the field with their customers and, as a corollary, less time in the relative comfort of the bank worrying about the size of their provisions.

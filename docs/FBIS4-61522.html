			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Presidential Bulletin" feature No. 86 (576)] </F>   [Text] President Islam Karimov in a keynote speech at the  opening session of parliament in Tashkent on Thursday [5 May]  said his country was firmly on the road of independence. He  spoke of intensive work under way to try to implement market  reforms and promote private enterprise.    Karimov put the number of state-run businesses falling into  private hands at more than 800 with the number of private  companies being doubled. He said the country's privatization  process had no analogs adding that one in three workers was  employed in the private sector.    On the country's interim currency unit, the som-coupon,  introduced six months ago, he said that although it was gaining  in strength against other currencies, Uzbekistan was in need of  a permanent national currency unit as an indication of its true  independence. Karimov called to examine the experience gained  by other countries to make the new currency unit prestigious.    He expressed surprise why preference should be given to the  Russian ruble rather than the currencies of neighboring states  of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkmenistan. This, he said, is  throwback to the times when Uzbekistan depended on Moscow and  was considered to be a net exporter of raw materials. "We are  well aware that the ruble is stronger than the coupon. That is  why Uzbekistan must also introduce a strong currency unit  similar to Russia's to help us break into the world market," he  said.    Karimov said that the newly-built money-printing facility  could help produce a sufficient amount of new banknotes and  coins to be circulated soon, possibly in July.    At the same time, he called for higher exports as a way of  increasing foreign exchange revenues including the U.S. dollar  which was stronger than the ruble. Karimov said this year's  export earnings would run at 1.5 billion dollars or 40-50  percent of the country's potential of export trade. But the  figure can be doubled, he said.    Karimov spoke of widespread public support for economic  reforms. But the process must evolve within the framework of  law. In this connection, he stressed the need to step up the  war on corruption which was capable of eroding government  activity.    The Uzbek leader called on commercial structures to do their  job honestly. "If the businessmen break laws, the people will  curse them," he said.    Karimov accused whom he described as some CIS leaders of  having engaged in rhetoric "which has led to bad results."    He also spoke of the newly-emerging situation in Russia and  a  drive by some of its politicians to restore Russian clout to the  region. Karimov is worried over LDP leader Vladimir  Zhirinovsky's statements which, he believes, "poses threat to  the future of Uzbekistan."    Karimov is also opposed to concepts such as common  parliament, language and currency. The leaders of Uzbekistan,  Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan during a recent summit had agreed to  drop the concept of a Eurasian Union, Karimov said.    IF Note: The idea of a Eurasian Union complete with  supranational structures to coordinate economic and defence  policies was put forward by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of  Kazakhstan during a visit to Moscow in March. He said such an  entity could help pursue a common economic policy, introduce  common frontiers and a supranational currency unit with national  currencies kept intact. However, Nazarbayev's initiative has  drawn little support from other CIS leaders.    Our main task, said Karimov, is to preserve the country's  independence and work together with other CIS states to try to  bring an early economic recovery. No one will give us any  reversal to the past, he said.</p>

			<p>941029 FT  29 OCT 94 / One last drive to the end of the road: The car has smoked itself to death. Peter Aspden laments the passing of a furtive pleasure If it is true that we are witnessing the beginning of the end of the car culture, then be sure that it will not go out without an explosion of blown gaskets and a few righteous puffs of blue smoke. For hell - or the M25 - hath no fury like a motorist, surrounded by traffic cones, juggernauts and vapid environmentalists, being asked to pay more for the 'privilege' of using his or her car. This anger is not so hard to understand. Bizarrely, taking a car out for a spin has come to represent one of the few expressions of personal freedom left in a world of increasing uniformity and staleness. Perhaps only the historians of the 25th century will be able to tell the story with the necessary degree of detachment; how strapping yourself into a confined space for a couple of hours came to symbolise the ultimate in liberation from modern life's quotidian drudgery. But such are the claims made for car culture. Listening to a mournful radio phone-in following the report of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution, which had the temerity to pronounce that Britain's road-obsessed transport programme was unsustainable, it was as if we were being asked to sacrifice the most inalienable of our rights. Well, I like a whirl in my Alfa like the next man (and, my goodness, what a boy's world it is). But the man ringing the radio station from his mobile telephone in the middle of his traffic-jammed route to central London must surely have realised how absurd he sounded when he talked, like an old trucker, of 'the freedom of the roads'. In truth, the romantic view of car culture, the world of throbbing engines, hair-raising curves and consummate clutch control, is fast dying on its wheels. There is not much fun to be had in driving today's bland, sanitised cars; indeed, to talk of a 'culture' at all is to evoke a whimsical image far removed from the belchingly slow reality of the average city vehicle, power-steering (what a mocking misnomer) its way at 7mph into another gormless queue. Car designers have realised this. After a brief spasm of 'supercar' madness in the 1980s, they have settled into their more pragmatic briefs of producing neat, small, efficient cars for the 1990s. Advertisers, ahead of the game as always, have plucked out a series of neat, small, pretty girls to promote these otherwise charmless items. Nicole, in her oh-so-wicked fling through the Provencal countryside, is the future of car culture; slinky, surreptitious, a bit on the side, like a quick drag on a Gauloise. Soon, cars will become so naughty and so compact that we will deny that we possess one at all, only to disappear for a couple of hours to a concealed entrance, like the launchpad of Thunderbird Two, for some serious clandestine pleasure. Of course eventually, no one will be able, nor feel the need to drive because we shall have a perfect public transport system. But we shall just sit there, on a specially-painted double yellow line, challenging the world at large to come and give us a ticket if it dares] It will be the quintessential free thinker's act of civil disobedience, recalling a world when the boundaries of state power were drawn well beyond the twinkling horizon of the next service station. In the meantime, we are stuck with what we have got: too few roads, too many fumes, tempers fraying and time running out. When they all come together, as they presently do if you are trying to drive into Heathrow Airport, for example, they represent the very opposite of freedom, the flip-side of culture, the most appalling example of over-consumption and stress mis-management you could ever hope to see. Political will is at last catching up with the public perception that the cost of the motorist's freedom has simply grown too high to bear. It is time for all of us, macho boys and furtive girls, to grow up.</p>

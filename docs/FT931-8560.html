			<p>930218 FT  18 FEB 93 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P asked to withdraw rating for Dai-Ichi DAI-ICHI Mutual Life Insurance Company has taken the unusual step of requesting Standard &amp; Poor's to withdraw its credit rating, after the US agency lowered the company's rating on claims paying ability from triple-A to double-A+, S&amp;P said, writes Tracy Corrigan. 'In the light of the withdrawal, S&amp;P will no longer be able to maintain surveillance of this insurer's financial strength at a time of growing uncertainty surrounding Japanese financial institutions,' the agency said. The downgrade was prompted by the earnings and capital deterioration caused by the economic downturn in Japan. S&amp;P said that the sharp decline in the Japanese stock market had greatly reduced unrealised gains in Dai-Ichi's equities portfolio.</p>

			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Demand for back tax IN THE Weekend FT recently, there was an article headlined 'Cash in on Uncle Dollars am.' Under the section 'Currency funds,' it was stated that interest can be rolled up so that tax is postponed until income is bought back into the UK. In November 1985, I bought some shares in the Kleinwort Benson International Income bond fund. As requested at the time, the purchase was entered on that year's tax return. But as income received each year was rolled up in the form of further units, no declaration of income has been made on subsequent tax returns. I have now been told by the Inland Revenue that the rolled-up interest should have been declared each year, and payment of tax at 25 per cent is being demanded together with interest due to late payment. First, we must point out that your investment in an offshore unit trust is quite different from an offshore deposit account, so the brief remarks in Philip Coggan's article have no relevance to your tax position. One message we have tried to convey over the years is that the British tax system is complex and arbitrary, and that there is a sophisticated armoury of anti-avoidance legislation. Nobody should invest offshore in the hope of avoiding (or deferring) UK tax liabilities without checking tax law thoroughly; the cost of professional advice can be less than the interest and penalties which an investor faces if he fails to understand the rules. On the bare facts of your case as outlined, the Revenue appears to be correct. (This reply is based upon the assumption that, as well as being ordinarily resident in the UK, you are domiciled in either England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

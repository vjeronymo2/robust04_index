			<p><P> February 5, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> '69 CUBS WIN SERIES IN A DREAM  </P> <P> It took 21 years, but the 1969 Chicago Cubs finally have something to brag  about.  </P> <P> Ken Rudolph hit a two-run double in the bottom of the seventh and final inning  to give the Cubs a 3-2 victory over the 1969 Baltimore Orioles in Sunday's  fifth annual Dream Game, billed as "the World Series that never was but should  have been."  </P> <P> The Cubs, with an eight-game lead in the National League East standings on Aug.  28, 1969, finished eight games behind the pennant-winning New York Mets that  year. The Miracle Mets then went on to upset the favored Baltimore Orioles in  five games, winning the last four straight.  </P> <P> "We waited a long time to beat these guys," said Cubs third baseman Ron Santo,  who also served as manager in place of the ailing Leo Durocher. "It's great to  finally get a victory."  </P></p>

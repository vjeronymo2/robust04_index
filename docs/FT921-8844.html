			<p>920215 FT  15 FEB 92 / Museum sets the Basques ablaze PLANS to build a giant new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the industrially blighted centre of commerce in Spain's Basque country, have led to a revolt against the local government by some of the region's most famous artists, including two renowned sculptors, Jorge Oteiza and Eduardo Chillida. The site chosen for the museum is home to a disused factory and shipyard on the banks of the Rio Nervion in the city centre. The museum will be bigger than the Guggenheim in New York and the first European branch in Venice. Construction is due to begin early next year. It will cost between Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.2m) and Dollars 200m and will, say angry Basque cultural groups, drain public subsidies away from Basque art. The province of Vizcaya, of which Bilbao is the capital, is donating the site and the building to the Guggenheim Foundation. More than 400 Basque painters, sculptors, actors and writers have joined Kultur Kezka (Cultural Complaint), created to oppose the financing of the project. The organisation says it plans to mount a determined campaign to force the local authorities to back down. Local officials say there is no turning back. 'Industry is losing importance here,' says Mr Juan Ignacio Vidarte, director of fiscal policy for the province. 'We cannot bet on it indefinitely.' The deal has been signed and work on the plans for the building - a 'constructivist' or sculptured design - is already under way at the Los Angeles studios of the current hero of American architecture, Frank Gehry. Mr Gehry, a maverick addict of form and materials, has called the Bilbao project 'my idea of heaven'. The building is at a bend in the river, next to a large modern iron bridge. 'Its got to be one of the most extraordinary sites for a piece of architecture in any city,' says Mr Thomas Krens, director of the Guggenheim in New York. But architecture is not what worries the project's Basque critics. 'It is not the museum that bothers us,' says a spokesperson for Kultur Kezka. 'A museum like that is needed in this region but not at that price. The money is being taken away from us.' Earlier this month Jorge Oteiza, 84, called the plans to build the museum for Guggenheim 'an anti-Basque soap opera' and called on Basques to make criminal charges against the leaders of the region's conservative nationalist party, the PNV, presumably for maladministration of public funds. Disgusted with the PNVs cultural budget, he has given his collected works to neighbouring Navarra. For the local government, Mr Vidarte makes no attempt to hide the fact that Bilbao selected the Guggenheim Foundation because the treasury was looking for an investment that would generate tax revenues. Just over a year ago, Guggenheim was about to sign a deal to build a new museum in Salzburg, Austria. 'They were looking for a unique building, a container, and a site that could show it off and we gave it to them,' he says. The impact on the local economy of new visitors to the city will, he calculates, generate some Pta600m (Pounds 3.3m) in new taxes every year. The PNV is quite unsympathetic to charges that the museum represents a form of American cultural imperialism. The Guggenheim foundation will run it and make most of the decisions about what is shown in it, but, says Mr Vidarte, 'it was never meant to be a Basque museum. We will be showing international art and, anyway, about 90 per cent of the Guggenheim collection is European'.</p>

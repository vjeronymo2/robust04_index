Because so much of  the funds are held up by pending accounts, it is extremely  difficult to make financial dispositions. Some expenditures that  should be ensured cannot be ensured, and allocations for normal  budget expenditures cannot be made and paid out. In many places  even the monthly wages cannot be paid. This state of affairs is  certainly on the minds of people of all walks of life.    There are many different causes for the financial  difficulties of Xinjiang:    Weak economic foundation, insufficient income logistics.  Xinjiang's industrial production is undiversified, of low grade,  and poor quality, while production costs are high. There are  hardly any specially successful enterprises or hit-type products  that would yield high tax revenue or profits. This restricts the  scope of financial revenue and limits quite substantially the  depth and breadth of financial revenue growth. Even though  Xinjiang's financial revenue increased progressively 17.4  percent during the years from 1985 to 1992, that was, to a  certain extent, due mainly to a change in taxation policy.    Because of insufficient investments in the technological  transformation of enterprises during the Sixth and Seventh  Five-Year Plan, technical equipment has remained rather poor,  and the organizational structure of enterprises and the product  mix is highly irrational. This is one of the reasons why the  present enterprises are operating at low speed and low  efficiency. Profits and tax revenue from budgeted industrial and  commercial enterprises throughout the region show negative  growth, and up to the end of September of 1993, profits turned  over to the finance authorities had declined 14.33 percent,  compared to the corresponding period of 1992. Among the 524  budgeted industrial and commercial enterprises, the dimensional  spread of losses and the amount of losses has gradually  increased, with 200 enterprises being implicated to the amount  of 166 million yuan. This is 19.05 and 110.14 percent more,  respectively, than during the corresponding period of 1992.    The county-level economy is not well developed. Most county  (city) economies consist of large farms and small industries;  they are correspondingly producing little financial revenue. In  1992, total revenue from all the 85 counties (cities) of the  region was 1.386 billion yuan, which amounted to 53.1 percent of  the entire revenue of the autonomous region. Only the cities of  Korla and Kuytun had been places with more than 100 million yuan  revenue. The counties (cities) with less than 100-million yuan  revenue had brought in 231 million yuan, which amounted to 8.8  percent of the total revenue of the autonomous region. The  overwhelming majority of counties (cities) are subsidy counties.  County-level finance is the foundation of national finance. If  county-level finance lacks vitality, no turn for the better can  be expected in the financial condition of the entire autonomous  region.    Development of the region's individual and private economy  and of village and township enterprises is relatively backward.  For all of 1992, the region's individually operated industrial  and commercial businesses and privately run enterprises turned  in 261 million yuan of taxes, which amounted to 10.01 percent of  the autonomous region's total revenue, and which was somewhat  more than 20 percentage points lower than the national average.  Total output value of village and township enterprises amounted  to 15 percent of the total rural social output value, which was  45 percentage points lower than the national average. Total  value of industrial output of village and township enterprises  amounted to 7.26 percent of the total industrial output value of  the entire region, which was 22.74 percentage points lower than  the national average. Village and township enterprises produced  a tax revenue of 204 million yuan, which amounted to 7.8 percent  of the total revenue of the autonomous region and was 7.4  percentage points lower than the national average. These facts  reveal that the development in Xinjiang of the individual and  private economy and of village and township enterprises has been  much slower than in the developed regions in the rest of the  country. The level of development is very low, and revenue  provided by this sector is very little.    The party committee and the people's government of the  autonomous region have adopted various measures to accelerate  the economic development in Xinjiang. They have gradually  increased, at an accelerated pace, investments for the  technological transformation of enterprises, they have raised  input in key capital construction projects, and started up some  large-scale projects. From a long-term point of view, these  measures may have a major impact on the resolution of the  autonomous region's financial difficulties. However, these  investments have been made with borrowed funds, and their  repayment, with interests, will of course take up a considerable  portion of the anticipated revenue. In the next few years,  there cannot possibly be any great improvement in the revenue  situation, and the state of insufficient sources of financial  income will be a long-range phenomenon.    Insufficient financial income logistics, combined with a  tendency toward increasing expenditures, will no doubt further  aggravate the financial difficulties.    Xinjiang is inhabited by several different nationalities.  Newspapers, periodicals, books, documents, broadcasts, and  television must all use different languages and scripts.  Separate middle and primary schools must be set up at various  places for Han-nationality and for minority-nationality  children. The population of Xinjiang is small, but it has an  administrative organization with a multitude of units and a huge  personnel. Educational and public health affairs have to be  attended to at many widely scattered places. Government  employees and teachers account for around 4.5 percent of the  total population. Xinjiang has a vast territory, its lines of  communications are long, it has a long cold season, and  expenditure on these accounts is therefore higher than the  national average. As to expenditure for organizational personnel  alone, the proportion of persons on government payroll in 1993  was 4.3 percent of the total social population, which was over 1  percentage point above the national average, with an expenditure  that was over 40 percent more than in ordinary areas.  Expenditure for business trips, postal and telecommunication  services, heating, and other public utilities are twice as high  as in other, ordinary areas.    In the last few years, many factors have contributed to the  increase of fiscal expenditure, with increases especially large  for personnel, and these expenditures have, furthermore, been  inflexibly necessary. By the end of 1992, staff and workers in  the administration and public institutions and retired personnel  throughout the entire region amounted to 650,000 persons.  Considering additionally that the state is coming out year after  year with new policies for raising wages and allowances, the  sums involved here are very large. According to statistics,  personnel expenditure for wages alone has increased from 630  million yuan in 1985 to 1.88 billion yuan in 1992, an increase  of almost four times in seven years and a progressive increase  of 16.9 percent every year. This is more than local finance can  bear, and any increase in revenue will almost all have to be  spent every year on increased wages for personnel. On the other  hand, organizational reforms and redistribution of personnel  require transitional processes, and adding to it the impact of  commodity price increases and the corresponding rises in the  tariffs of various expenses, the result is that expenditure will  continuously broaden in scope.    During the change-over from planned economy to market  economy, the pattern of unified and centralized state control  over income and expenditure has been broken up, but centralized  expenditure still persists. During 1992, the one item of price  subsidies alone resulted in an expenditure for the entire region  of over 600 million yuan, while the condition of overcommitment  of public finance could not be mitigated or resolved. It so  happened that expenditure that should have been ensured could  not be ensured anymore. Under the market economy system, some  undertakings can be carried out by fully mobilizing social  forces and thereby lightening the burden on public finance.  However, presently, due to the limitations of objective  conditions and insufficient subjective effort, this kind of  effort is still in its initial stage, and its effectiveness  cannot yet counted on to lighten the burden on public finance.    Extravagant spending and incidents of wastefulness are still  occurring in some places, departments, and units. Frequently,  the ineffectual supervision and investigation of such violations  of discipline by fiscal departments and departments charged with  just such supervision and investigation contribute to  unnecessary increases in the fiscal burden. The great difficulty  of rectifying and cutting down on the scope and structure of  such kind of expenditures adds to the difficulty of balancing  fiscal revenue and expenditure.    Changes in the system of public finance are also a  contributing factor to Xinjiang's economic difficulties.    From 1980 to 1986, when the state worked with a financial  contractual responsibility system, the appraised basic figures  for revenue and expenditure were essentially quite reasonable,  and that allowed Xinjiang to get along not too badly. Because  the self-sufficiency of the region in financial respects is  rather low--it was only at a 46.4 percent rate in  1992--increases in fiscal expenditure mainly relied on  progressively increasing subsidies from the state and  supplementation by fiscal income growth. From 1987 on, the  central finance authorities adopted a policy of retrenchment,  reducing the flat rate subsidy for Xinjiang, and also including  it in the contractual base figure. As a result, to cope with its  increased expenditure, the region had to mainly rely on growth  in its own financial strength, thereby greatly weakening the  autonomous region's ability at fiscal macro-regulation and  control. Because of the small revenue base figure of the  autonomous region and its large expenditure base figure, only a  2 percent increase of revenue could ensure satisfying the needs  of a 1 percent increase in expenditure. The absolute figure of  increased revenue cannot by far catch up with the growth of the  absolute figure of increased expenditure, and as a result the  fiscal revenue-expenditure contradiction is deteriorating almost  by the day.    Besides this, some of the financial distribution functions  have been dismembered, which also aggravated the financial  difficulties of the autonomous region. Following the initiation  of the socialist market system, some departments and units  erroneously assumed that market economy is "free economy," and  without going through the finance departments and without  authority of their own, they decided on some policies of their  own that involved matters of public finance. This has caused  the diversion and loss of some part of the revenue, while it  increased some unnecessary expenditure and weakened the  distributory function of public finance.    Because of all the above-mentioned reasons, which had the  effect of continuously widening the dimensional spread and the  amount of the deficit, an aggravation of the fiscal difficulties  had become a matter of course. Without any doubt, the widening  of the region's fiscal deficit and the deterioration of its  financial difficulties have naturally added to a certain extent  to the difficulties of performing financial tasks and have  hampered the development of the region's economy and  undertakings. However, as far as minority regions are concerned,  we must not taken this as the only criterion to assess the  quality of financial work performance. The arduous labor  expended by the financial departments of all ranks throughout  the entire region to promote the region's reform, opening to the  outside world, and economic development, must be fully affirmed.  Insufficient effort is certainly one of the causes for the  above-stated financial difficulties, but the main causes are  deep-rooted problems in the reform and in the developmental  process that have affected public finance, and some of these are  historical causes. Resolving these problems cannot be achieved  by relying merely on the financial sector, the solution must  rely on the energetic efforts of all sectors of society.</p>

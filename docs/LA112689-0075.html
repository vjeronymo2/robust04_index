			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DENTISTS  </P> <P> I am writing in response to Calvin Trillin's column "A Costly Hour With Sweeney  Todd, DDS," (Op-Ed Page, Nov. 14).  </P> <P> I happen to be a retired dentist who was in active practice for many years. I  resent the implication that all dentists are interested only in gouging their  patients and determining the treatment on the money involved. If this article  was written to be a comic piece, it is a failure and ends up being a vindictive  diatribe against a dedicated group of honest and sincere professionals.  </P> <P> By the way, Mr. Trillin, how much did you receive as payment for this silly  piece? Whatever it was it was a lot more than the hourly fee of your dentist, I  am sure, and much more than you deserve.  </P> <P> SAMUEL LAVINE, D.D.S., Laguna Hills  </P></p>

			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / Accountancy Column: Working Russian model now in need of overhaul - Andrew Jack looks at how the traditional Soviet accounting system is adapting to modern demands ASKING A foreigner to understand the Russian accounting system is as daunting as learning to ride on the Moscow underground. Being able to read the script is only the start of overcoming the challenge. The metro system's use of the cyrillic alphabet is intimidating enough, let alone how it is spoken by announcers on the trains. The practice of naming each line after its final destinations - which, since most have been extended, are no longer the end points - is still more confusing. Add to that the recent practice of re-naming a vast number of stops which have connotations with the old Communist regime, and it should come as no surprise that the unsuspecting visitor can end up heading at full speed in the wrong direction. So it is with the Russian accounting system. A casual glance at the continued widespread use of abacuses in shops and offices, for example, makes it tempting to say that there is no system, or only a very inefficient one. But that would be as inaccurate as saying that the metro does not work because it may not always deliver foreign visitors to their chosen destination. The idea of financial reporting is firmly rooted in the enterprises of the former Soviet Union. A sophisticated system did exist, and it operated effectively. But its objectives were entirely different to capitalist equivalents. Accountancy was and remains a thriving occupation in the Commonwealth of Independent States. There are many hundreds of thousands of accountants, and the chief accountant in an enterprise is generally an extremely powerful figure. Nevertheless, the vast majority of accountants are in practice really book-keepers. Mr Richard Lewis, a partner in the Moscow office of Ernst &amp; Young, says: 'Accounting was not financial but statistical. The accountant was reduced to filling in forms on a matrix. The job did not have much prestige.' This reflects the purpose for which Soviet accounts were prepared in the past. Under the old political regime, the objective was to provide central planners with the necessary information to achieve centralised control of the economy. That meant controlling operations to achieve planned targets, and protecting socialist property. It was implemented through a single, unified accounting system, which would allow data from every enterprise to be easily aggregated. This was achieved by a formulaic 'chart of accounts' with detailed instructions and categories for every budget item, and by a series of standardised record-keeping and reporting forms. But as Mr Leonid Schneidman, a senior official with the former Soviet Ministry of Finance who works for Price Waterhouse in Moscow, says: 'The objectives of accounting have become much wider now.' Difficulties with the old system emerged in the late 1980s, principally as western companies began to establish joint ventures. Before that time, there was little communication with or attempt to understand the eastern system by the West, or vice versa. Since then, accountancy firms opening offices in the CIS have been able to find work doing 'accounts conversion', translating the Russian accounts of joint ventures into a format which is more easy and useful for western companies. Mr Lewis recalls a great deal of resistance from the Ministry of Finance when it came under pressure to adjust its existing system simply because western companies did not understand how it operated. But - partly in response to the disappointing volume of interest in joint ventures by western partners - it has bowed to calls for reform. A series of regulations has allowed reporting in a more western-style format alongside the traditional requirements. Now with a new Chart of Accounts approved at the start of this year, legislation on financial reporting and a series of new working parties are helping to create a framework for reform in Russia. Many of the same elements are being echoed in the other CIS states. One of the most significant changes has been the greater emphasis placed on the profit and loss account. Traditionally, Soviet accounts laid most stress on the balance sheet. This reflected the state's concern with guarding socialist assets. Enterprises were required to keep track of how asset purchases were financed, to reflect this custodial role. Depreciation rates were very low, reflecting the longer period of use for which assets were employed than in the West. And all assets were held at historical values, since there was no concept that changes in economic conditions would change their value. Profits were far less important for enterprises. As Mr Richard Lewis says: 'No one in the past was concerned about whether you made a profit. If you made one, it was likely to be taken away, whereas if you made a loss, you would be given money by the government.' A profit and loss account has always existed, but in a very different format. Costs of production included 'period costs' such as administrative and general expenses as well as 'product' costs. That makes it very difficult to calculate trading profits. Where earnings existed, they had to be distributed. There was no concept of retained earnings which could be held in reserve. At the same time, revenues were historically only 'recognised' on the profit and loss account when cash was received. This was partly a conservative response to concerns over whether or not the enterprise would be paid. But it makes it impossible to correlate income and expenditure in a single accounting period. The new chart of accounts permits the western concept of accrual accounting  -which matches expenses to the period in which they are incurred, and income to when it is invoiced. It introduces the idea of retained earnings and distinguishes period and product costs. Significantly, it allows for provisions for bad debts, which were only written off in the past when there was absolutely no chance of recovery. It also give instructions on the treatment of foreign currency transactions, share issues, leaseholds and investments, and permits the inclusion of certain intangible assets on the balance sheet. These modifications will be welcomed by westerners trying to understand Russian accounting. But they are not without problems - a point made by Mr Zubaidur Rahman, a director of Deloitte &amp; Touche in Moscow who is an academic and a key representative on the working parties bringing about accounting reform. He stresses that the changes have been introduced within the existing framework of the chart of accounts, to prevent the transition from being too sudden or marked. Even so, the changes listed are optional, and are unlikely to be adopted quickly by many enterprises. Many Russian accountants are concerned that preparation according to the new rules could make the financial statements look less favourable, and threaten their jobs. Like the Moscow underground, which works well but uses antiquated equipment, modifications will probably come only over a considerable period of time.</p>

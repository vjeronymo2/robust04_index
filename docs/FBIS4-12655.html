			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh, head of the PLO </F> Information Department, by Mufidah al-Hashani in Tunis; date not  given -- recorded]    [Text] PLO Information Department Head Yasir 'Abd-Rabbuh  has said the negotiations with Israel are being obstructed. He  critized the U.S. position toward the faltering Middle East  peace process. Mufidah al-Hashani interviewed 'Abd-Rabbuh in  Tunis:    ['Abd-Rabbuh] The situation has actually resulted from the  Israeli position, which offers proposals that try to regulate  the occupation more than end the occupation of the Palestinian  territories. The Israelis propose some ideas that aim to slice  off parts of Gaza, especially in the coastal area and along the  green line between the Gaza Strip and Israel. They also propose  other ideas, greatly restricting and narrowing the powers of the  Palestinian authorities and police.    [Al-Hashani] What is the new Palestinian proposal?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] What is now required is that the peace process  be salvaged on a new basis and through a new approach; that is  by the immediate transition to negotiations on the final stage.    [Al-Hashani] What is the current U.S. stand on the  negotiations?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] So far we have not sensed a serious U.S. stand  to affect the course of negotiations. The U.S. side merely  presents proposals of a procedural and administrative nature.</p>

			<p>931217 FT  17 DEC 93 / Metallgesellschaft loses chief of US arm Metallgesellschaft, the German mining, metals and industrial group, faced deepening problems yesterday when the head of its US trading subsidiary resigned. The resignation of Mr Siegfried Hodapp, the MG Corp chief, came before a special meeting of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board which will take place in Frankfurt this morning. This is likely to focus on problems at MG Corp and is widely expected to lead to the departure of Metallgesellschaft board directors. Last week Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, Metallgesellschaft's chief executive, successfully negotiated new lines of credit from the group's bankers. This was in response to what Metallgesellschaft said then were temporary liquidity problems arising from the need to meet margin calls  - cash payouts - on oil futures contracts taken out by MG Corp in New York, triggered by the sharp fall in the oil price in recent months. There is a growing concern that the liquidity problems are greater than have been indicated. Shares in Metallgesellschaft yesterday dropped DM12.30 to close at DM293, against the trend of the German stock market. The shares have fallen more than 30 per cent since the start of last week. Mr Hans Schreiber, Metallgesellschaft spokesman, said that the supervisory board meeting would focus on 'the status of business developments at Metallgesellschaft in general, with special reference to developments at MG Corp'. He did not know why Mr Hodapp left MG Corp, saying reports that a further five senior MG Corp employees had resigned were 'rubbish'. Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, shareholders in Metallgesellschaft as well as creditors, backed the company's version of events last week. Mr Hilmar Kopper, Deutsche's chief executive, said last Tuesday that the group's liquidity problems were not 'life-threatening'. However since then it is understood that the banks have investigated MG Corp's activities and have been revised their original assessment of the situation. It is likely that Mr Ronaldo Schmitz, the Deutsche Bank main-board director who is chairman of Metallgesellschaft's supervisory board, will today detail MG Corp's problems and their impact on the parent company's liquidity.</p>

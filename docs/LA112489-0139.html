			<p><P> November 24, 1989, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JAPAN OFFERS SMALL LOAN TO AID POLAND  </P> <P> Japan today pledged a $150-million loan for "remote" Poland and said it is  considering other aid to Poland and Hungary to help relieve their economic  crises and promote democratic reform.  </P> <P> By contrast, the U.S. Congress has voted $864.5 million in outright aid to  Poland, France has pledged $645 million and West Germany has offered $1.62  billion in trade credits.  </P> <P> Japan's low-interest loan would be used for Poland's currency stabilization  program, said Mayumi Moriyama, the chief Cabinet secretary.  </P> <P> Japan is also considering loans through the Export-Import Bank to cover trade  and investment insurance for Hungary and is studying plans to provide emergency  food aid to Poland and technical assistance to both countries, said Kenzo  Oshima, director of the Aid Policy Division at the Foreign Ministry.  </P> <P> Asked why Japan was giving a loan rather than a grant, Oshima conceded Poland  probably would have been happier with a grant.  </P> <P> "It is up to each country to decide what fits," he said. "The U.S. apparently  felt a grant would be more preferable. . . . As far as Japan is concerned, we  felt a concessional loan would meet, if not 100% of their requirements, at  least an important part."  </P> <P> Japan has defended its relatively slow development of an aid package for  Eastern Europe by saying the region is remote from Japan and relations had not  been important during the time those countries, as members of the Soviet Bloc,  had little independence.  </P> <P> "It can't be denied that part of the world is remote," Oshima said. "It is not  something like China or Korea to Japan."  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Summary of Impacts  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> These standards will reduce nationwide emissions of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> hazardous air pollutants (HAP) from ethylene oxide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial sterilization and fumigation operations by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1,030 Mg (1,140 tons), or 96 percent, in 1997 compared to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the emissions that would result in the absence of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards. No significant adverse secondary air impacts,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> water, solid waste or energy impacts are anticipated from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the promulgation of these standards.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The implementation of this regulation is expected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> result in nationwide annualized costs for existing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial EO sterilization facilities of about $6.6 million  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> beyond baseline based on an analysis of the application of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controls to all existing facilities not currently controlled  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the level of the standards. Capital costs incurred by a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> typical uncontrolled existing source such as a large  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commercial EO sterilization and fumigation operation using  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 68,000 kg/yr (75 ton/yr) of EO would be about $310,000 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> controlling the sterilization chamber vent emissions, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about $290,000 for controlling the aeration room vent and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chamber exhaust vent emissions. The annualized cost  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> incurred by this typical source to operate the control  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> devices would be about $100,000 to control the sterilization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chamber vent emissions and about $80,000 to control the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aeration room vent and chamber exhaust vent emissions.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The economic impact analysis done prior to proposal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> showed that the economic impacts from the proposed standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be significant. No changes have been made to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed rule that would increase the economic impacts to a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant level.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Significant Changes to the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Public Participation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Prior to proposal of the standards, interested parties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were advised by public notice in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (56 FR 1186), of a meeting of the National Air Pollution  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Control Techniques Advisory Committee to discuss the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ethylene oxide commercial sterilization and fumigation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> source category recommended for proposal. This meeting was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> held on January 29&hyph;31, 1991. The meeting was open to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public and each attendee was given an opportunity to comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the standards recommended for proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standards were proposed and the preamble was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on March 7, 1994  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (59 FR 10591). The preamble to the proposed standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discussed the availability of the regulatory text and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal BID, which described the regulatory alternatives  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> considered and the impacts of those alternatives. Public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments were solicited at the time of proposal, and copies  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the regulatory text and BID were distributed to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> interested parties. Electronic versions of the preamble,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation, and BID were made available to interested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parties via the TTN (see  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preamble).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> To provide interested persons the opportunity for oral  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> presentation of data, views, or arguments concerning the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed standards, a public hearing was offered at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposal; however, one was not requested. The public  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment period was from March 7 to May 6, 1994. Twenty  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment letters were received (two letters were received  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from one commenter; nineteen commenters submitted comments).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The comments have been carefully considered, and changes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have been made to the proposed standards when determined by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Administrator to be appropriate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Comments on the Proposed Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the proposed standards were received from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nineteen commenters composed mainly of States, environmental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> groups, control device vendors, industry, and trade  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> associations. A detailed discussion of these comments and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responses can be found in the promulgation BID, which is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> referred to in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> section of this preamble. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> summary of comments and responses in the BID serve as the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for the revisions that have been made to the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between proposal and promulgation. Most of the comment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> letters contained multiple comments. The comments have been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> divided into the following areas:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Determination of MACT floor for major source  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chamber exhaust vents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>921001 FT  01 OCT 92 / International Company News: Skandia cancels sale of majority stake in US unit SKANDIA, a leading Swedish insurance group, yesterday cancelled plans to sell a majority shareholding in its US subsidiary Skandia America Corp (SAC). Plans to introduce SAC's shares on the New York Stock Exchange have also been abandoned. The group said it took the decision because 'the final offering price for the SAC shares would not be in the best interest of the Skandia group, in view of the current international market situation'. Skandia planned to issue 9m shares, but decided the Dollars 18 per share level was too low. When it first announced the filing in July, it was hoping to get Dollars 25 per share. SAC's reinsurance operations in the US and Canada recorded net premium volume of SKr2.55bn in 1991.</p>

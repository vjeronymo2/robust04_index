			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Zhao Haikuan (6392 3189 1401) of the People's Bank of </F> China Financial Research Institute, edited by Wang Yi (3769  3085): "Monetary Policy Under the Socialist Market Economy"]    [Text] The 14th CPC National Congress unequivocally stated  that: "the aim of the reform of our economic structure is to  establish a socialist market economic structure." The question  which needs to be studied now is what monetary policy should be  adopted under such an economic structure in order to further  develop the productive forces.  <H3>  I. The Socialist Market Economy Still Needs a Stable  Monetary Policy </H3>   Under the socialist market economic structure, we must  continue to implement a stable monetary policy because, only in  this way, will the national economy be able to maintain the  following desirable elements:    1. The coordinated, sustained, and rapid development of  production.    Under the socialist market economy, the operation of the  economy and the deployment of resources as a whole will  basically be regulated by market forces instead of mainly  through planning as was the case in the past. Regulation by  market forces must be realized through the money medium. Thus,  only by maintaining a stable money market will production be  able to develop in a coordinated, sustained, and rapid manner.  On the other hand, according to our experience in the 40 years  and more since the founding of the People's Republic, and  especially in the more than 10 years since reform and opening  up, inflation upsets the existing economic structure, disrupts  the production order, and results in abnormal economic  development. Let us take the situation after the beginning of  reform and opening up as an example. An important cause of  inflation during this period was the fact that investment in  capital construction increased by too great an amount too  swiftly. Blind investments produced and intensified the  economic imbalance. When this state of affairs became so  serious that capital construction funds were not forthcoming and  there was a serious shortage of capital goods, readjustment  became necessary. For example, in order to halt inflation in  1988, a policy of rectification and readjustment was introduced  in the fourth quarter. The result of this was that by early  1990, industrial production was sluggish and the market was  slow. There was serious stockpiling of finished products and  arrears in payments. The economic performance of enterprises  had declined and economic development had suffered.    Is it possible, in times of inflation, for the original  production pattern to be affected not or for production order to  not be disrupted? No, it is not possible.    Fundamentally, the effect of inflation is to change the  patterns of production and resource distribution. If it does  not change the pattern of production and resource distribution,  inflation becomes a phenomenon of no real significance. With  all other conditions remaining the same, if money supply is  doubled and divided equally among the various economic sectors,  units, and individuals in accordance with the original pattern  of distribution, then the money supply increase will neither  bring any benefit nor harm. Although prices will double, the  fact that the money in people's hands has also doubled means  everything will be the same. It will just be that the current  two yuan note will be worth the same as a one yuan note in the  past. This was what happened in 1954 when new one yuan notes  were issued as replacements when the old 10,000 yuan notes were  withdrawn. In reality, however, additional money supply cannot  be divided so equally. Quite the contrary because, due to a  combination of reasons both subjective and objective, some  people end up having more money and others less after inflation;  some enterprises are able to grab large quantities of  commodities in short supply, while others have difficulty  satisfying their normal needs. There is thus bound to be a  blind redistribution of funds and materials in society. The  original production pattern will be upset and economic  development will suffer. This is true under a planned economic  structure and also in the process of economic structural reform.  Under the socialist market economic structure when  microeconomic activities are no longer subject to the restraints  of central planning and the guidance of administrative units at  the higher levels, and are basically dependent on market forces,  this is even more true.    2. Making full use of the material resources of society.    The fundamental factor determining the speed of our economic  development is goods and materials. Since we already have an  abundance of labor supply, we will be able to develop at a high  speed provided that we have sufficient goods and materials. If  we have a shortage of goods and materials, development will slow  down. This basic condition will not change under the socialist  market economy. During inflationary times, people will  anticipate that prices will further escalate, and goods and  materials will be in short supply, and thus they will strive to  stock up more, especially those goods in great demand.  Subsequently, some enterprises will have stocks that exceed  their normal needs. The resultant stockpiling will render it  impossible to bring into full play the limited material  resources of society and this will further aggravate shortages  and production and construction will be subject to even greater  material resource restrictions.    When inflation occurs, people prefer goods to money. This  mentality also has an impact on the consumer goods market. With  people buying more consumer goods than they need, the limited  supply of consumer goods cannot be reasonably distributed, with  the result that the actual needs of the majority cannot be met.    3. Raising more funds for construction.    Under the socialist market economy, economic development  will  accelerate and more construction funds will be needed. Personal  bank deposits and the purchase of various types of bonds will  continue to be an important source of funds for economic  development. In the primary distribution of national income,  due to various constraints, it is not possible to retain too  great an amount of the funds for construction. On this basis,  in order to further increase construction funds and accelerate  development, it is necessary to increase bank savings deposits  and rationally issue bonds so as to turn more consumption funds  into production funds. Absorbing people's savings deposits and  selling them bonds is a means of financing which only requires  people to temporarily assign the use rights of their money  without changing the ownership and payment is offered for the  concession. This method of raising funds for construction can  truly increase the volume of construction funds, without  changing the balance between total supply and total demand,  since all that it requires is to use those material resources  set aside for consumption on production instead. It can also  increase people's incomes or provide them with safeguards  against inflation so that they can relax and really devote their  energy to work. However, people will only show a positive  response to deposit-taking and bond issues if the currency is  stable. If inflation occurs, prices go up, money depreciates,  and interest rates fall below the degree of devaluation and  people will not only fail to get any real interest by putting  their money in savings deposit accounts or buying bonds but will  also not be able to even maintain the value of their principal.  In times like these, bank savings deposit balances and the  amount of bonds purchased will not increase and may even drop as  a result. This is precisely what has happened in the past. In  1988 China was hit by inflation. In the first seven months of  that year, the increase in the balance of urban and rural  savings deposits was 4 billion yuan less than in the same period  of the previous year. In August, the balance was 2.6 billion  yuan less than the July figure, and the annual figure was tens  of billions of yuan less. In the first half of 1993,  inflationary pressure increased and national retail prices were  up by 10.5 percent. Between January and the end of June, urban  and rural savings only increased by 124.4 billion yuan, 9  billion yuan less than in the same period the previous year.  Sales of state bonds were slow. Although the state could  increase its note-issue funds by issuing more bank notes,  inflation would reduce bank savings deposits and funds obtained  from bond issues. Thus, for the country as a whole, the issuing  of more bank notes will not in fact increase the pool of funds,  while the reduction in savings deposits and bond sales means  that material resources that could have been used in economic  construction will be spent on consumption and this implies a  real cut in funds. Hence, inflation definitely leads to a  reduction in funds for national construction.    It must be pointed out that when we spoke of savings and  bonds in the previous paragraph, we did not touch on the  question of the purchase of shares by individuals. This is  because, unlike savings deposits, the purchase of shares is an  act of direct investment. The value of shares changes with the  financial and profit-making capabilities of the shareholding  companies and automatically serves as a guarantee for value in  times of inflation. However, as inflation escalates,  shareholding companies will not be able to conduct normal  production and operations. Profits from production and  operations will drop and dividends will fall as a result. This  will also dampen people's enthusiasm for share purchases.    4. Giving full scope to the enthusiasm of the broad numbers  of workers for labor.    Under the socialist market economy, it is necessary to keep  workers' wages at a reasonable level when turning production  factors into commodities. This is also dependent on the  stability of currency value and prices. When currency value and  prices are stable, the broad numbers of workers will not have to  worry about the devaluation of their income and it will be  possible to fully arouse their enthusiasm for labor. If  inflation and price rises occur, workers will find their real  income diverging from their nominal income and some will even  find their real income slashed. Even if the state continues to  provide price subsidies, it will be impossible to make up for  the losses incurred by individual staff and workers because  losses due to devaluation are shared by people's monetary  income, savings deposits, and cash in hand and cannot be  entirely offset by increased subsidies. Ours is a socialist  country where the masses of the people are masters of the  country. Workers and other people will understand and accept  the need to rationally control the growth of consumption funds  in order to more rapidly develop the economy. However, they  will have objections if inflation occurs and part of the value  already in their hands is taken away. In a socialist market  economy, people's income will generally increase and the extent  of income growth will exceed that of price rises. Does this  mean they are willing to accept inflation? Under the  circumstances, they will naturally be less resentful of  inflation, but it will be impossible for them to have no  objections at all. Since the beginning of reform and opening  up, people's income has generally gone up swiftly and the  increase far exceeds the average extent of devaluation. During  the inflation of 1988, some people complained about various  things although their living standards were in fact much better  than before. If inflation has too great an impact on workers'  income, so much so that many workers are finding their real  income slashed, social stability and unity will also be  adversely affected.  <H3>  II. The Socialist Market Economy Has the Objective  Possibility of a Stable Currency </H3>   The reason for this is that most of the factors of inflation  can be eliminated after the establishment of the socialist  market economic structure.    As we all know, inflation has occurred a number of times  since China's reform and opening. We had inflation in 1985 and  1988. Inflationary pressure was also strong in 1993. In most  cases, inflation was the direct result of over-extended  investment in fixed assets, excessive growth of consumption  funds and huge financial deficits. On a deeper level, it was  because, in the current process of reform, the original  mechanisms which restrained inflation had been weakened but new  mechanisms of restraint suited to the socialist market economic  structure had not been established. Also, the macrocontrol  mechanism was in a situation where the old had been dismantled  while a new one had not yet been put in place. After entry into  the socialist market economy, internal mechanisms of restraint  against inflation will be developed and there will be objective  conditions for a stable currency.    1. Investment entities will have a self-restraint mechanism  in respect of their investment in fixed assets.    Prior to reform and opening up, all investments in fixed  assets were controlled by the state through mandatory plans and  funds were basically allocated by the state's financial  administration. Although this system was not conducive to  arousing the enthusiasm of different localities, departments,  and enterprises and needed to be reformed, it was a very  effective system of control. As long as suitable arrangements  were made by the state in respect of investment in fixed assets,  the scale of investment would never become over-extended.    Since the beginning of reform and opening up, investment  entities have become more diversified and the scope covered by  state investment plans has been narrowed. Although this has had  the effect of arousing the enthusiasm of all quarters for  economic development and invigorating the economy, it has also  weakened the state's control of the overall scale of investment  in fixed assets. Since the Chinese economy is still rather  backward, everyone hopes to speed up economic development and  put this backwardness behind us as quickly as possible. This,  coupled with the lack of clearly-defined responsibility for  decisions made in respect of investment in fixed assets, caused  leaders of some localities and departments and the directors and  managers of some enterprises to overlook the importance of  feasibility studies and to go after quick results. They blindly  increased investment in fixed assets and launched new projects,  such as embarking on 10 billion yuan projects when they only had  8 billion yuan. As a result, the overall scale of investment in  fixed assets has always been over-extended in recent years,  especially in years of inflation. Even if we do do not concern  ourselves with questions such as whether or not there are any  circulating funds and whether or not production can be well  coordinated after the completion of the projects, when all funds  are invested in fixed assets, the bank will have to issue more  bank notes and this will lead to inflation. Assuming that the  ratio of circulating funds to fixed capital is 3:7 for most  enterprises, and assuming that a locality has 100 billion yuan  available for economic development in a particular year,  theoretically speaking, they should set aside 70 billion yuan  for investment in fixed assets and 30 billion yuan for  circulating funds. If all of the 100 billion yuan is invested  in fixed assets and circulating funds amounting to 43 billion  yuan are needed for various support programs after the  completion of the project, it will mean that they have made  plans for 143 billion yuan when they only had 100 billion yuan.  This is an important reason why we have had an imbalance in  construction funds and have been hit by inflation time and again  in recent years.    Following the establishment of a socialist market economy,  the overwhelming majority of state-owned enterprises will become  limited shareholding companies or limited liability companies  and property relations will be straightened out. Collective  enterprises, private enterprises, and Sino-foreign joint  ventures will have a considerable weighting in the national  economy. Investment in fixed assets in society will mainly be  undertaken by different types of enterprises and returns on  investment will be closely tied to the personal interests of the  enterprise decisionmakers. The enterprise decisionmakers will  exercise great prudence in matters of investment. They will  carefully consider and study the feasibility of investment, the  product sales after the completion of the projects, as well as  the size of returns and generally will not act blindly. In this  way, the problem of the over-extension of investment in fixed  assets can basically be avoided.    2. Enterprises will also exercise self restraint in respect  of their consumption funds.    Prior to reform and opening up, China had a unified wage  system, where wage grades and levels were centrally fixed by the  state. Without arrangements and planning by the state, no  locality or unit had the power to change the wage levels of its  workers. At that time, bonuses and other expenditures in  respect of workers were scant and were fixed by the state.  Provided that appropriate arrangements were made by the state,  consumption funds would not inflate.    Since the beginning of reform and opening up, the original  mechanism of restraint on consumption funds has basically lost  its effect. Since a new mechanism of restraint has not yet been  fully developed, control over consumption funds has been  weakened. This makes it possible for desires cherished by  workers for higher wage and bonus levels to assert themselves.    At present, state-owned enterprises play a dominant role in  the economy. The operational mechanism of the majority of these  enterprises has yet to see a significant change. Directors and  managers not only have the same fundamental interests as their  staff and workers but also enjoy basically the same direct  economic benefits. This was the ideological foundation which  enabled directors and managers to unify all staff and workers  and work with one heart and one mind in making their respective  enterprises a success. This was the strong point enjoyed by  state-owned enterprises. However, the fact that directors and  managers enjoy the same economic benefits as their staff and  workers also deprived enterprises of the ability to control  their own consumption funds. Staff and workers hoped to have  higher wages and more bonuses. Out of personal interest,  directors and managers also wanted the same.    Moreover, there has been an increase in the number of  shareholding enterprises, private enterprises and  foreign-invested enterprises since reform and opening up and the  wage levels in these enterprises are much higher than those in  state-owned enterprises. In the wake of the invigoration of the  economy, some people made a fortune after quitting their jobs  for business. This set an example for others and strengthened  the desires of state-owned enterprises and institutions, state  organs, organizations, and military units to raise the wage  levels of their employees. This in turn encouraged these units  to raise the wage levels, bonuses, and other fringe benefits for  their staff and workers without authorization, thereby causing  the consumption funds to inflate.    Following the establishment of the socialist market economic  structure, not only will the interests of the decisionmakers in  collective enterprises, private enterprises, and Sino-foreign  joint ventures be tied to the profits or losses of their  respective enterprises but the income of the decisionmakers in  limited shareholding companies, limited liability companies, and  state-owned enterprises will also be tied to the performance of  their respective enterprises. This will separate the interests  of the enterprise decisionmakers from those of the staff and  workers. If an enterprise has a high wage level, its costs will  increase and its profits decrease, meaning that its  decisionmakers will earn less. Conversely, if the wage level is  reduced, costs will decrease and profits will increase, meaning  that its decisionmakers will earn more. If the income of the  decisionmakers is too high and the wage level of workers is too  low, the latter will find this intolerable. Similarly, the  decisionmakers will also find an unduly high wage level for  workers unacceptable. This will guard against a situation where  consumption funds expand faster than economic growth.    3. The government function will undergo a change but the  power of macrocontrol will still be in the hands of the central  government.    Prior to reform and opening up, economic operation was led  and managed completely by the government. Since reform and  opening up began, enterprises have been given increasingly  greater autonomy. Although the function of the government in  direct economic management has been weakened, local governments  still bear considerable responsibility for the development of  their local economies. Since local governments are elected by  the local people, they all hope to provide more tangible  benefits for their people. In particular, they hope to start  more projects to bring about faster economic development. Of  course, the local people will benefit from any new projects  launched. However, since the renminbi is a national currency  and the money market is unified, losses resulting from  devaluation due to over-development in one place are borne by  the whole nation. Thus, local governments often ignore the need  to strike a balance between total supply and total demand,  thinking that this is mainly the responsibility of the central  government. Instead, they vie with one another to launch more  projects and demand more construction funds. Even when total  supply and total demand fail to balance, some still say that  "other places have `overheated,' we have not even started  `heating up.'" They still hope that none of their projects will  be slashed and some even hope that they will be allowed to  launch more projects. We can understand why they all want to  speed up their own economic development. It provides the drive  for national economic development and is a good thing. However,  ignoring the need to strike a balance between total supply and  total demand and putting too much emphasis on speeding up local  economic development will adversely affect the sustained and  stable development of the national economy. This is precisely  what has happened. The successive rounds of inflation which  have hit our country in recent years had a lot to do with the  fact that local governments, oblivious to the need to strike a  balance between total supply and total demand on a national  level, blindly pooled funds, tried by all and every means to  secure bank loans, and vied to speed up their local economies,  with the result that money supply grew too fast.    After the establishment of the socialist market economy, the  government's economic function will mainly be to exercise  macroeconomic control, create a fine environment for economic  development, and properly manage state-owned assets. Meanwhile,  the government will rely mainly on economic and legal means,  supplemented by the necessary administrative means, to influence  and manage the microeconomy. The functions and powers of the  central and local governments in the management of the economy  will be clearly divided. The power of macroeconomic control  will be in the hands of the central authorities. The local  governments will only be able to give positive support to, and  will not be able to interfere with, the central government's  macrocontrol measures.    4. An effective macroeconomic control mechanism will be  established.    In order to ensure the smooth development of the national  economy, it is necessary to establish a macroeconomic control  mechanism that can ensure effective control of the macroeconomy  while invigorating the microeconomy. This means that we must  rely mainly on economic measures in effecting regulation and  control. However, in the process of economic structural reform,  because of the low percentage of business-oriented enterprises  in the overall economy, the use of economic measures to effect  regulation and control is still not able to achieve the desired  results. For example, the central bank tried to keep a lid on  loans by raising interest rates but this failed to get major  state-owned banks and enterprises to reduce their demands for  credit funds. The reason is that these state-owned banks and  enterprises did not attach the necessary importance to cost and  profits and would pay any amount of interest to get more funds.  By raising the deposit reserve rate, the central bank had  weakened the ability of major state-owned banks to generate more  deposits and expand loans. However, if they faced a shortage of  credit funds as a result and could not accomplish the prescribed  lending tasks, particularly policy-lending tasks, the central  bank would have to increase its loans to them to make up for  their shortage of funds. Thus, for the time being we can only  rely on administrative measures, that is, management by quota,  to control total credit and money supply. However, since  economic activities as a whole have been invigorated and the  concept of planning has been weakened, administrative measures  are no longer as effective as before. Many localities have  successfully bypassed the quota restraints in obtaining more  state credit funds. According to estimates by the departments  concerned, between 1992 and the first half of 1993, apart from  the more than 100 billion yuan obtained through inter-bank  borrowing and bank credit as mentioned above, an additional 100  billion yuan and more had been pooled through blind fundraising.  Although funds thus raised were directly borrowed by  enterprises or local governments from the masses, most of the  money still came from bank deposits or deposit sources (that is,  money which people intended to deposit into their bank  accounts). The issuing of shares and bonds by enterprises is an  important measure for transforming the operational mechanism of  enterprises and, as such, should be supported and promoted.  However, if overall arrangements are not properly carried out  and banks are not suitably relieved of some of their lending  tasks after enterprises have sucked up credit funds through  issuing shares and bonds, bloated credit and inflation will  occur.    After the establishment of the socialist market economy, the  People's Bank of China, as the central bank, will free itself of  various types of business activities and will take the  strengthening of macroeconomic control and the safeguarding of  the value of the renminbi as its most important tasks.  Policy-lending banks have now been established. They will take  over the general banking activities currently handled by the  central bank, as well as the policy-related banking business  which is currently handled by major state-owned banks and which  must be placed under the direct management and control of the  government. Various major state-owned banks have already been  turned into commercial banks. Meanwhile, a number of national  joint-stock banks have been established. In this way, there is  keen competition between financial institutions in the urban and  rural areas and in areas such as foreign exchange. The money  market has been further liberalized and standardized and  interest rates have also been liberalized in a controlled way.  Moreover, a modern enterprise system has been established and  the concepts of profit and interests have been strengthened in  the whole society. An effective mechanism of macroeconomic  control will soon take shape, after which it will be possible to  keep currency value and prices basically stable.  <H5>  III. Strengthen Control and Stabilize Currency Value </H5>   In the first half of this year, retail prices on a national  level were up by 10.5 percent, while savings deposits by urban  and rural residents between January and late June increased by  only 124.4 billion yuan, or 9 billion yuan less than in the same  period of last year. Faced with a new round of inflation, we  must conscientiously sum up historical experiences, unify our  understanding, and firmly uphold the idea of a stable currency.    1. It is necessary to further eliminate the influence of the  "theory that inflation is harmless." In the 1980's, some  economists preached the "theory that inflation is harmless,"  which is otherwise referred to as the idea that "inflation is  useful." Through the government's monetary policy, this theory  became one of the causes of inflation. However, as many  economists pointed out, the results precipitated by this theory,  in turn, ruthlessly refuted the theory itself.    A. People who uphold the "theory that inflation is harmless"  believe that inflation had the effect of "compulsory saving,"  thereby increasing state construction funds. This is  superficial reasoning which shows a mechanical copying of  Western economic theories without a thorough study of China's  national conditions.    Inflation produces little "compulsory saving" in our country  and, compared with the reduction in normal savings deposits, the  loss far outweighs the gain. In our country, a large part of  the nominal monetary funds obtained through issuing more bank  notes will inevitably be used to cover the increased expenditure  resulting from this. There are the following general types of  money holders in China. The first type is state-owned  enterprises. Other conditions being constant, the value of the  money in their possession lost as a result of currency  depreciation normally has to be made good through financial  appropriation or additional bank loans. If this is not done,  they will have to reduce the scale of their production and  operations. The second type is government organs and  organizations, armed forces units, and institutions that are  dependent on financial appropriations. When depreciation of  their currency holdings exceeds a given percentage, it is  necessary for the financial administration to increase  appropriation to them in order to maintain their normal  operations. The third type is residents. In capitalist  countries, the value of money depreciated may be regarded as  additional taxation on individuals by the state and has the  effect of "compulsory saving" but in China it does not have the  same effect. Reluctant to see the people's living standards  drop as a result, our party and government will, when price  levels go up, suitably increase price subsidies to make up for  losses sustained by staff and workers. The fourth type is  limited liability companies, joint-stock companies, private  enterprises, individual operations, and foreign-invested  enterprises. In joint-stock companies with state capital, when  inflation occurs, the value of that part corresponding to the  state's share and manifested as state funds will see a reduction  in value. But even so, the state will not on this basis issue  more bank notes to cover this loss, thereby increasing the value  of its holding and bringing about compulsory savings. The  private holding will also see a reduction in the value of  private capital. In times of inflation, the money held by  private enterprises, individual economies, and foreign-invested  enterprises will all see depreciation. However, viewed from the  organization of enterprises and the economy as a whole, the  situation is as follows: First, their funds mainly take the  form of raw and semiprocessed materials, fuel, goods in process,  and manufactured goods. They only have a small amount of cash.  Moreover, the stock of money held by most enterprises is far  smaller than their bank loans. In times of inflation, when the  value of money depreciates, the value of bank loans drops. With  the rise in commodity prices, most enterprises will find that  the value of their property has increased rather than decreased  in the final settlement of accounts. Second, enterprises may  pass on losses from devaluation of currency by raising the price  of their products. Third, when inflation occurs and the real  wages of staff and workers declines, it is possible to lower  costs and increase profits by not giving staff and workers  appropriate subsidies. In short, if we do not take into  consideration the disruption of the production order and the  losses inflicted upon production and operation and only concern  ourselves with the value inventory, enterprises will not have to  expend their "compulsory savings" and may obtain more wealth  from society.    B. Whether or not inflation is conducive to the utilization  of "idle resources" is also worth studying.    The utilization of "idle resources" is primarily a question  of how we should make use of idle resources. China is a  developing country. In our country, the principal contradiction  of the commodity market, particularly the capital goods market,  is that demand exceeds supply. When inflation occurs, some  enterprises are afraid that they will not be able to buy the  materials they need in time. In order to sustain production and  operation, they scramble to stock up on goods and materials at  the risk of losses in the form of credit interest and storage  fees, thereby making the distribution of goods in short supply  even more irrational and making it all the more difficult to  make full use of these materials.    Second, it is a question of utilizing idle labor. With the  huge number of people unemployed in capitalist countries, there  is a great waste of labor resources. If slow inflation can  stimulate economic development, it can also increase the number  of persons employed and utilize more of the idle labor.  However, our country's labor employment rate is very high, the  speed of economic development is very fast, and there is no need  to further boost the employment rate through inflation.  Further, as has been noted above, in our country inflation is  not advantageous to the full utilization of goods and materials,  it cannot accelerate the speed of economic development and,  speaking in overall national terms, it cannot increase the  number of persons employed.    The people who uphold the "theory that inflation is  harmless"  say that by using inflation and issuing a little more money, a  number of construction projects will very quickly be able to  raise funds and "go ahead." This is true. By using this method  it will be possible to complete a few more projects. However,  the price we will have to pay is really too great. Actually,  while the issuing of money can be carried out in a centralized  way, the devaluation of currency is generally manifested only  gradually. If the original money circulation is normal and  there is a basic balance between overall supply and demand, the  value of the currency will be stable. If a further 10 billion  yuan in currency is issued, it will be possible to carry out  some more projects. When this 10 billion yuan is put into the  market and the purchase of materials needed for construction  commences, it will be possible to buy the materials and the  price will not rise too much. This is because: First, the  tightness of materials and the decline in the value of the  currency will occur only gradually after the purchasing has  begun. Only after the entire amount of money has been used up  in purchases will the effects be fully manifested. The  purchasing occurs first and the tightness in materials and the  decline in value appear subsequently. When the tightness in  goods and materials, the currency devaluation, and the rise in  prices caused by this are fully manifested, the newly-commenced  projects have already obtained all the goods and materials they  need. Second, the losses resulting from the tightness in goods  and materials, the devaluation of currency, and the increase in  prices caused by this 10 billion yuan are jointly borne by all  sides throughout the country. For example, if this 10 billion  yuan eventually gives rise to a 1 percent rise in prices, then  all the money in the hands of every unit and every person  throughout the country will have lost 1 percent of its value.  Even during the process by which it is being used for purchases,  when prices have already begun to rise, it will still buy over  9.9 billion yuan of goods and materials. From this we can  clearly see that using the issuing of more money to fund new  projects is actually a method of using the devaluing of money to  take back some of the value represented by the funds already  supplied to all sides. This results in some enterprises and  construction units being unable to obtain the goods and  materials they had planned on using. Thereby, some enterprises  cannot complete their production plans and some construction  projects cannot be completed on time. Very clearly, using the  increased issuing of money to fund some more construction  projects is done at the cost of some other enterprises being  unable to complete their plans and the completion of some  construction projects being delayed. Using the issuing of money  to fund more new construction projects is, both from the overall  and long-term viewpoints, truly not worthwhile.    Second, in terms of monetary policies, we should negate the  theory of dual goals and establish the single goal of stable  currency. In our country's economic circles, some persons have  advocated implementing a dual-goal monetary policy. That is,  they advocate a stable currency value and stable prices together  with support for economic development as concurrent economic  policy goals. They hold that while formulating and adopting  monetary policies, it is necessary to consider both the  stability of the currency and also ensure that the policies are  beneficial to economic development. The people who uphold this  view say that while ensuring the stability of prices does  provide a necessary condition for economic growth, it is only  when there is economic development that there is a dependable  base for price stability. Of course, we cannot use inflation to  spur economic growth but, likewise, we cannot seek currency  stability just for the sake of currency stability. A stable  currency and the development of the economy should complement  each other.    If monetary policy could concurrently achieve these two  goals, naturally, it would be ideal in the extreme. However,  the experience of our country over many years indicates that the  result of implementing dual goals is not beneficial to currency  stability. Over the last 10 years and more, our country has seen  repeated bouts of inflation. This was related to the dual-goal  monetary policy we actually implemented. The governments of  socialist countries are the organizers and managers of economic  construction, the ones who require the funds for construction as  well as the controllers of money-issuing powers. This is like a  situation where when one hand needs money, the other hand  produces it. It is thus very easy for excessive issuing of  money to occur. In implementing a firm policy of currency  stability, it may sometimes happen that there is excessive money  supply. If we implement a dual-goal monetary policy, it will be  easier for there to be excessive supply of money on the pretext  of supporting economic development, thereby leading to inflation.    On the basis of experience over many years, we must firmly  negate the "theory that inflation is harmless" and the "theory  of dual goals," and take stable currency as the only goal of the  central bank's monetary policy. Only if the currency is stable  will it be possible for the economy to see sustained and smooth  development. A stable currency is a precondition for economic  development. If the central bank can maintain a stable currency  market for society, it will make the greatest contribution to  economic development. As compared with increasing the supply of  money to support more construction projects, the importance of  maintaining a stable currency market is far greater. This is  very obvious. The benefits of building projects in excess of  objective conditions are immediate and limited while the harm  this brings is overall and deep.    The reason we do not agree with the dual-goal theory,  instead stressing a stable currency as the sole goal of monetary  policies, and urge the implementation of stable money policies  is that a stable currency and stable prices as a goal is on a  different level to economic development. A stable currency  value and stable prices is a direct goal of monetary policies  while developing the economy is also one of the major goals of a  stable currency and stable prices. In other words, developing  the economy is a goal of the monetary policy but an indirect and  higher-level goal. Upholding a stable currency as the sole goal  of monetary policy does not mean ignoring economic development  but is aimed at putting in order the relationship between a  stable currency and economic development to support faster and  better economic development.    If we make economic development one of the direct goals of  monetary policy, the point of departure will be stressing  economic development but actually this will reduce the important  position of economic development. Developing the economy is the  overall goal of various types of economic policies. Of course,  this naturally includes monetary policies but it should not be  the direct goal of monetary policies. At the same time, this  causes a dispersal of the attention of monetary policies and  concentration cannot be centralized on maintaining a stable  currency. This is not beneficial to the stability of the  currency or of prices and eventually will be disadvantageous to  the development of the economy.    Believing that monetary policies should have dual goals is,  to a certain degree, putting economic development in opposition  to currency stability and suggests that stable currency is not  beneficial to economic development. However, we have noted  above that only with a stable currency can the economy see  smooth development.    In brief, only by taking a stable currency as the sole goal  of monetary policies can we implement firm and stable money  policies. In a situation where paper money is circulating, only  by implementing such a monetary policy will it be possible to  truly stabilize money and develop the economy more swiftly.    Third, strengthening macroeconomic regulation and control to  strive for the stability of currency and prices. In order to  truly stabilize currency value and prices at present, it is  necessary to fully understand the money market in a timely way  and use various sorts of relevant economic measures flexibly to  do well in macroeconomic regulation and control. The state  should clearly set down that the central bank must take as its  major tasks doing well macroeconomic regulation and control, and  guaranteeing the stability of currency value and of prices, and  require that it puts all of its efforts into this. At present,  the focus of macroeconomic regulation and control must continue  to be placed on controlling the money supply and, through this  on, achieving a balance between total supply and total demand  and the stability of currency and prices.    What is referred to as the total volume of money supply is  the amount of cash and transfer funds put into the market. This  is formed through the utilization of funds by banks. Of the  funds used by banks, 95 percent are credit funds and, thus,  basically these are formed by bank credit. The funds activities  by other sectors of the national economy can only affect the  speed of turnover in the distribution of money in society. That  is, they can transfer money from their sector to other sectors  and they can accelerate or slow down the the speed of turnover  of money but they cannot directly increase or reduce the supply  of money. The financial administration's receipts and  expenditure are also like this. In a situation where receipts  and expenditure are balanced, the finances are obtained from  society and used in society. They only increase the number of  times money in society is turned over and carry out the  redistribution of the volume of money in society. When surplus  or deficits occur, although the amount of social money which the  financial administration draws in from society may increase or  decline, this is realized through increasing or decreasing the  savings account which the financial administration has in the  banks or through borrowing or overdrawing from the bank. In the  end, it is still changes in bank credit influencing the total  volume of money supply in society. Of course, this is not to  say that the influence of the economic activities of nonbanking  sectors on total social demand is negligible. On the contrary,  the economic activities of these sectors are the basis which  determines whether or not the flow of money is normal and  whether or not the value of the currency is stable. That is to  say, the banks are the source of the social money supply and,  more precisely, the central bank.    Thus, the central bank should now continue to carry out  regulation and control of the total volume of credit in the  whole society and use this to regulate and control the total  volume of money supply in the whole society. As to regulation  and control measures, of course we cannot continue to use  management by quota. Rather, we should use mainly economic  measures, such as central bank credit rates, deposit reserve  rates, and open market business. Only by controlling the amount  of credit and the volume of money supply in the whole society  will it be possible to achieve a balance between total social  supply and demand and will it be possible to achieve stability  in currency value and in prices.</p>

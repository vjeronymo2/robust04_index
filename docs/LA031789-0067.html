			<p><P> March 17, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE BOMB ON FLIGHT 103: NEW CONTROVERSY ON ALERTS  </P> <P> Airline and regulatory officials on both sides of the Atlantic had much more  warning than previously known about the threat of a bomb like the one that blew  a Pan Am jumbo jet out of the skies over Scotland last December, it was  revealed here Thursday.  </P> <P> But whether through bad luck, as the regulators imply, or incompetence -- as  charged by relatives of the victims -- no one put the disparate omens together  until it was too late for all 259 persons aboard Flight 103 as well as 11  residents of the small Scottish village where the fiery wreckage fell to earth.  </P> <P> A bitter controversy over how much was known about the danger before the Pan Am  bombing, and by whom, was renewed here Thursday thanks to what later turned out  to be little more than a curious sidelight to the main developments.  </P> <P> Local press reports revealed that two days before the Dec. 21 tragedy, the  country's Transport Ministry had sent warnings and a photograph of an unusual  type of bomb to U.S. and British airlines as well as South African Airways,  Air-India and Israel's El Al.  </P> <P> The bomb, concealed inside a radio-cassette player, was the same type as is  suspected of having brought down the Pan American World Airways Boeing 747. But  because the warning was mailed, some recipients, including Pan Am, did not  receive it until mid-January.  </P> <P> While confirming the Dec. 19 advisory, however, Transport Minister Paul Channon  dismissed it Thursday as "of no importance whatsoever," because virtually the  same warning had been telexed to all British airlines on Nov. 22, nearly a  month before Flight 103 exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland.  </P> <P> In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said that "in late  October of 1988, West German authorities (in Frankfurt) arrested 14 suspected  members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine -- General  Command. In November, we learned that among the evidence seized during those  arrests was a bomb hidden in a Toshiba radio and which included a barometric  pressure triggering device. (The detonator, which would trigger the bomb at a  predetermined altitude, made it clear the bomb was meant to be smuggled on  board an aircraft.)  </P> <P> "As a result of the unusual number of suspected PFLP -- GC members arrested and  the discovery of such a bomb, the FAA issued, on Nov. 18, an Aviation Security  Bulletin Number 88-19 to U.S. carriers to warn them about the presence of  PFLP-GC members in Europe, the existence of this bomb, its characteristics, and  to advise that increased security measures should be introduced to counter this  threat. This bulletin remains in effect today."  </P> <P> Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon confirmed that the company received the  bulletin and said "appropriate action was taken."  </P> <P> There is no evidence that the German discovery is linked to the Pan Am attack,  but critics contend that combined with a second bit of intelligence, it should  have triggered an alert which might have prevented the Lockerbie disaster.  </P> <P> The second warning, previously disclosed, was telephoned anonymously to the  U.S. Embassy in Helsinki last Dec. 5. The caller said radical Palestinians  planned to smuggle a bomb onto a Pan Am flight originating in Frankfurt within  the following two weeks.  </P> <P> Flight 103 originated in Frankfurt on a smaller plane before stopping in London  to pick up additional passengers and change to the jumbo jet for the rest of  its scheduled journey to New York.  </P> <P> The FAA alerted American carriers and friendly governments to the Helsinki  warning on Dec. 9, but the British authorities decided not to pass it on.  American carriers serving London were already on a high state of alert,  officials explained, and the anonymous call itself was given little  credibility.  </P> <P> Channon repeated Thursday his contention that the Helsinki alert was "probably  a hoax" and has "no relevance whatsoever" to the Pan Am disaster.  </P> <P> The Labor Party opposition, meanwhile, mounted a strong attack on Channon and  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who defended her transport secretary. It may  have been coincidence, opposition officials argued, but the various warnings  described the threat to Pan Am Flight 103 very precisely. Yet the disaster was  not prevented. Labor called for a special investigation to find out why.  </P> <P> Channon rejected that idea.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, the Times of London reported today that police know the bomber's  identity and present location. The Times said Channon will disclose details  next week, but a spokeswoman for Channon said she knew of no plans for any  announcement.  </P> <P> Times staff writer David Savage, in Washington, contributed to this article.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Huang Wei (7806 1218)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 3 Feb (XINHUA) -- While inspecting the New  Technology Industrial Development and Experimental Zone in  Beijing today, Song Jian, state councillor and minister in  charge of the State Science and Technology Commission, said one  of the strategic tasks at present is to vigorously develop a  number of large, privately managed science and technology  enterprises with great research and development potential, large  production scale, and strong market-development capability, and  to rapidly bring this science and technology "field army" onto  the international market and take part in international  competition.    Today, accompanied by Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan, Song Jian  visited the work site of the Land Information Industry Base  inside the New Technology Industrial Development and  Experimental Zone in Beijing and discussed with entrepreneurs  from privately-run science and technology enterprises. Before  discussions got underway, Song Jian extended Spring Festival  greetings to the entrepreneurs on behalf of the State Council  and the State Science and Technology Commission. He said  management at the Beijing Experimental Zone, by taking advantage  of the state's preferential policy and by adopting an flexible  operating mechanism, has seen rapid development in the zone. In  it there were now a number of science and technology enterprises  including the Stone Group, Lianxiang, Fangzheng, Jinghai,  Huasheng, Huake which had attracted attention both inside and  outside China. The Beijing Experimental Zone was taking the  lead among the nation's 52 science and technology development  zones.    Song Jian said one of the results of China's reform of the  science and technology structure was the vigorous search for and  development of different types of privately run science and  technology enterprises. Privately run science and technology  enterprises, which had emerged in large numbers lately, had  become the driving force for developing the cause of science and  technology and for the science and technology industry, and had  become an important part of the socialist market economy.  Private operations would remain the main form of enterprise in  China's science and technology development zones in the future.  The state would continue to work toward the rapid development  of big, privately run enterprises engaged in the development of  new and high technology.    Song Jian also expressed the hope that operators of  privately  run enterprises, as commanders of the "field army" of China's  rising science and technology industry, would work out  strategies and be prepared to wage a major campaign. For  privately run enterprises to develop, it was necessary for them  to persist in developing high technology; to train their own  research and development personnel; to rely on science and  technology to get ahead of others in market competition; to  maintain and develop superiority; to rapidly expand production  and scale of operation and enhance economic strength; to develop  the international market and take part in international  competition through cooperation with financial institutions and  with domestic or foreign counterparts; to further improve  enterprise management; to study advanced foreign management  theories, systems, and methods; and to train professional  management personnel so that the production and operation of  enterprises would be adapted to the requirements of socialist  production.    In conclusion, Song Jian said that to promote the  development  of high technology industry, and to bring about the launch of  China's national economy mainly through reliance on the new and  high technology industry, the state would adopt measures to  create a more relaxed environment for the development of new and  high technology industry development zones and encourage more  scientists and technicians, scientific research institutes, and  institutes of higher education to run private high technology  enterprises.</p>

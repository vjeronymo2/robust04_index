			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- The idea of "believing  in the people as in heaven" of great innovative significance for  the development of the Korean and the world revolution is the  maxim and philosophy of the respected leader Comrade Kim Il-song  who began his revolutionary activities with mixing with the  people and has pushed through the rigorous storms of the  revolution.    It is the greatest happiness and fortune of the Korean  people  to have Comrade Kim Il-song who regards the people as heaven and  devotes everything to the noble cause for the people all his  life.    This is stressed in an editorial article of MINJU CHOSON  Tuesday.    The great leader Comrade Kim Il-song is quoted as saying:    "`To believe in the people as in heaven' is my maxim and  philosophy. Ever since I embarked on the road of revolution, I  have served the masses of people, regarding them as heaven and  made the revolution in reliance on their strength."    In the first part, the article says respected Comrade Kim  Il-song is the people's leader who has made the noble idea of  "believing in the people as in heaven" his maxim and philosophy.    This outstanding idea calls for regarding the people as the  most valuable and greatest beings in the world, absolutely  trusting them and relying on them at all times.    Proceeding from his unshakable viewpoint and position that  the masses of people are responsible for the revolution and  construction and in charge of them, the respected leader  propounded the great idea that when one believes in the people  as in heaven and relies on them, one gains everything and wins  victory every time.    Go to the people when difficulties crop up in the way of  revolution, when you are hungry, when you are thirsty and when  you are sad. This is the unshakable creed of our respected  leader. With this creed, he began his revolutionary struggle  with mixing with the people, and has always found himself among  the people, never neglecting his contact with them, and  triumphantly fought his way through the protracted trials of  revolution, sharing weal and woe with them.    His idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" is the  basic idea running through the immortal chuche idea, the guiding  idea of our party. This idea serves as an invariable guiding  compass which provides the revolutionaries and communists with a  scientific knowledge of the decisive role of the people, who  transform the world and shape their own destiny, and enables  them to resolve every problem in reliance on the inexhaustible  strength of the people.    In the second part, the article says Comrade Kim Il-song is  a  great leader who has brilliantly embodied in our revolutionary  practice the noble idea of "believing in the people as in  heaven," his maxim and philosophy.    He has mapped up lines and policies reflecting the will and  interests of the people and carried them into effect and  established the most popular mode of politics -- the work system  and order for service to the people.    He expounded that the revolutionary struggle and  constructive  work are chiefly aimed at realising the desire and demand of the  people for independence, and saw that the revolutionary lines  and strategy and tactics were worked out always our own way on  the basis of the people's desire and demand and every problem  was solved with their own efforts.    He regards the will and demand of the people as absolute,  respects them to the maximum and solves every problem to suit  their tastes, saying that the revolution is for the people and  what they say is good is always good. This fundamental idea  runs through the course of his shaping lines and policies.    He formed chuche-type political organisations whose noble  mission it is to serve the people and established within them a  well-regulated work system and order of looking after the  people's destiny in a responsible manner.    All the officials subordinate everything to the people and  do  anything in their interest as required by the party's slogan "We  serve the people" and a unique mode of politics suited to the  essential nature of Korean-style socialist society centred on  the masses has been established throughout society. This is a  patent proof of the sagacity of Comrade Kim Il-song's leadership.    In the third part, the article explains that the respected  leader's noble idea of "believing in the people as in heaven" is  a great idea which has been applied to our revolutionary  practice and displayed a great vitality.    Our people have boldly broken the established concepts,  common knowledge and all mysticism and established their new  tradition and new model with unprecedented heroism and  creativity and ushered in a new history of epoch-making changes  in this land. The source of the strength of this great creation  is the idea of "believing in the people as in heaven."    This noble idea of Comrade Kim Il-song is being unswervingly  carried forward and brought into fuller play by the dear leader  Comrade Kim Chong-il, an outstanding thinker and theoretician  and a tested statesman.    The dear leader enjoys deep respect and trust from the  Korean  people and the world revolutionary people and has the highest  authority among the state leaders in the world for his great  traits of always leading the revolution and construction  victoriously under the fast-changing situation, turning  adversity into favorable conditions with a firm belief in the  people and in reliance on them and for his imperishable exploits  for the party and the revolution, the country and the people.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS diplomatic correspondents Aleksandr Krulovich </F> and Vladimir Taranov]    [Text] Moscow, 12 May -- The Russian Foreign Ministry today  called on the Tajik opposition, military, and political  groupings in Afghanistan and the involved states to do  everything possible in order not to allow the situation on the  Tajik-Afghan border to aggravate. Mikhail Demurin, deputy  director of the Press and Information Directorate of the Russian  foreign policy department, said this addressing a briefing today.    He said that "one of the priorities in Russian foreign  policy" at present was to assist in settling the Tajik conflict  and to restore peace and calm in the country. In the diplomat's  words, great importance is being attached to the continuation of  the inter-Tajik talks that started with the Moscow round. The  world's response to its results shows that "great hopes are  being linked with the progress of the dialogue."    Demurin stated with regret that this approach was not being  shared by everyone--the recalcitrant part of the Tajik armed  opposition, supported by Afghan mojahedins, is concentrating its  forces on the border. This is increasing the danger of  "large-scale hostilities," the Russian Foreign Ministry  spokesman said.</p>

			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> JOSE CANSECO TO REMAIN IN TRACTION 'FEW MORE DAYS';  </P> <P> BASEBALL: ATHLETICS RIGHT FIELDER GETS TREATMENT INCLUDING REST, THERAPY AND  MEDICATION FOR BACK PAIN.  </P> <P> Jose Canseco will remain in traction for "at least a few more days," according  to a hospital spokeswoman who said today the Oakland Athletics' right fielder  was undergoing a treatment plan of rest, therapy and medication for back pain.  </P> <P> Canseco, who has a history of back problems, spent the weekend undergoing  physical therapy and taking oral anti-inflammatory drugs, said Children's  Hospital spokeswoman Ann Heglin, adding that Canseco also spent time in  traction to help reduce the inflammation of a bulging lower disc.  </P> <P> Canseco was admitted to Children's Hospital on Saturday. A CAT scan revealed a  bulging lower disc pressing against the sciatic nerve, causing pain in  Canseco's lower back and right leg.  </P> <P> Heglin said Canseco will remain in traction for "at least a few more days."  </P> <P> Despite earlier reports of possible surgery for Canseco, team orthopedist Rick  Bost said surgery "is not even being discussed."  </P> <P> "He shows some encouraging signs of improvement," Bost said. "It's hard to make  a prediction -- it's a day-to-day situation."  </P> <P> Bost said Canseco's injury is "in response to his activity -- swinging a bat."  </P> <P> Doctors remained uncertain when Canseco will play again and speculation varied  from a few days to a few weeks.  </P> <P> "With disc problems you are never entirely certain," said A's physician Dr.  Allan Pont. "You don't know if it's a one-hour problem or a one-year problem."  </P> <P> Canseco, who was able to continue playing baseball several years ago when he  suffered from back pain for about three months, started feeling increased pain  during last weekend's series at Oakland against Kansas City. He has not played  since last Thursday in Texas.  </P> <P> The injury disrupts what could be Canseco's best season. He started the A's  first 52 games and posted a .320 average with 20 home runs and 50 RBI's. He is  second to Detroit's Cecil Fielder in both categories.  </P></p>

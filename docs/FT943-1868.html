			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / Chemicals and metals lead export growth Exports of processed chemicals, metals and some engineering goods to non-European Union countries have been rising steadily in recent months, contributing to an overall reduction in the UK trade deficit. The Central Statistical Office yesterday said the UK trade deficit with countries outside the European Union fell to a seasonally adjusted Pounds 0.3bn last month, as the underlying trend in imports remained relatively flat and exports continued to rise. The value of exports to non-EU countries rose by 1 per cent while the volume of exports rose by 2.6 per cent on the month - a trend that indicates exporters are cutting their prices after raising them earlier this year. Import values, by contrast, fell 1 per cent last month compared with July, with a corresponding 1.1 per cent fall in volumes. The export growth was spread across all categories, the CSO said, suggesting that most business sectors in the UK were benefiting from the faster-than-expected growth in the world economy. However, the fastest growth excluding the energy sector occured in the semi-manufactures category  -which includes the processed chemical, paper, rubber and metals sectors - where export values rose by 9 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, and volumes grew by 8 per cent. Most of this growth, the CSO said, came from chemicals and metals producers. Exports of organic chemicals, for example, were 14 per cent higher in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, while exports of non-ferrous metals, excluding silver, grew by 48 per cent. The paper and textiles sector also showed steady export growth, while plastics grew by 11 per cent in this period. Exports in the basic materials category - which includes wood, metal ores and other crude materials - grew by 7.5 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months. Meanwhile exports of finished manufacturing products were 2.5 per cent higher in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, and 12 per cent higher than in the same period a year ago. Certain engineering sectors such as electronic goods and plant showed particularly fast growth, boosted by a broader pick-up in demand in the US and by growing demand for plant and machinery in eastern Europe and in Far Eastern countries including Thailand and Indonesia. Exports of mechanical engineering capital goods grew by 5.5 per cent in the three months to August compared with the previous three months, while exports of intermediate electrical engineering goods grew by 9.5 per cent.</p>

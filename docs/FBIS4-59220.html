			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by special correspondent in Qatar Dan Avidan] </F>   [Excerpt] Qatari Foreign Minister Shaykh Hamad Bin-Jasim  yesterday told DAVAR that his country would not sign a natural  gas supply deal with Israel as long as comprehensive peace is  not established in the region. He added, however, that his  government would pursue contacts with the Israeli Government to  discuss the terms of the deal that would be implemented after  peace is established. He asserted that his country would  continue welcoming Israeli delegates attending peace process  conferences that may be held in Qatar in the future.    In reply to a question on whether the Qatari Government  would  send military representatives to a joint naval rescue exercise  with Israel and take part in a joint regional communications  center on military issues, the Qatari foreign minister said his  government would soon decide whether to participate in these  projects and on what conditions. He said time was not ripe for  Qatar to send representatives to visit IDF [Israel Defense  Forces] training installations, and he refused to say whether  this may happen in the future.

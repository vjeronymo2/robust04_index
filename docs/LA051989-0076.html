Magnin chains -- feels its financial  footing is secure since it went private in 1986 and it doesn't intend to divest  any department store divisions. Edward S. Finkelstein said there have been  persistent rumors that Macy's might be planning to sell off some assets to  reduce its debt. There were also reports that Limited Inc., the nation's  leading specialty apparel retailer, had preliminary talks about an investment  in Macy.  </P></p>

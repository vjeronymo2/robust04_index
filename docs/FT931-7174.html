			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent sees mixed performances BOURSES saw mixed fortunes for carmakers, further weakness in chemicals and a recovery for Swiss pharmaceutical stocks, writes Our Markets Staff. In the meantime, Spanish dealers reflected further fears for the peseta, and a belated degree of speculation in the equity market. FRANKFURT registered falls in chemicals and carmakers in particular as the DAX index fell 17.34 to 1,644.24 in turnover up from DM5.8bn to DM7.4bn. Some professionals blamed weakness in the US dollar and its effect on export margins. However, Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt noted that Volkswagen was firmer, up DM2.30 at DM271.30. He said that other carmakers, like BMW, down DM13 to DM486, were extending their weakness of the last ten days or so on poor industry figures; VW may have gone up on higher market share figures but this, with the underlying trend still sharply down, was an excuse rather than a reason. Chemicals, he reckoned, were reflecting BASF's admission that its pharmaceutical sales were 40 to 50 per cent down in February, following Germany's strictures upon the ethical drugs market. Bayer and Hoechst, especially the former, have bigger drug operations, but the latter paid for a strong run of relative strength, leading the sector down with a fall of DM5.60 to DM259.30. AMSTERDAM was disappointed with Akzo's 1992 results, which came in at the lower end of forecasts. The shares closed down Fl 2.10 or 1.4 per cent at Fl 149.90, although off the day's low of Fl 147.80. However, there is a feeling among some analysts that although the group is expected to show a deterioration in first half earnings this year, given the depressed state of the European economy Akzo is still showing a better performance than many of its competitors. DSM shed Fl 1.90 to Fl 73.50. The CBS Tendency index eased 0.3 to 99.8. Royal Dutch weakened Fl 1.80 to Fl 154.00 ahead of today's results with some analysts forecasting an unchanged dividend. Rumours that Philips might have approached the state to lobby for financial support saw the shares slip 40 cents to Fl 22.20. PARIS came to life in the last few minutes of trading with a gain in the CAC-40 index of 9.26 to 1,953.39, after a day's low of 1,927. Turnover was FFr2.8bn. The financial sector remained active with reports that Comptoir des Entrepreneurs might be in financial difficulties depressing CFF, down FFr53 at FFr1,069 and AGF, off FFr11 at FFr545. STOCKHOLM took a further look at Handelsbanken following Tuesday's results, found some positive aspects and marked the B shares up SKr12 to SKr57.50. Some analysts suggested that the bank remained relatively strong compared with its competitors. The Affarsvarlden General index, however, lost 10.1 to 977.8 in turnover of some SKr1bn. Atlas Copco weighed on the market, the B losing SKr10 or 3 per cent to SKr318 on disappointment over its 1992 results and forecasts from the company that it did not expect an upturn this year. MILAN remained beset by worries over Prime Minister Guiliano Amato's government as it faces today's confidence vote, and the outlook for the economy as the lira dipped to a record low against the D-mark. The Comit index eased 0.19 at 502.75 in spite of strong rallies by Fiat and Montedison. The carmaker fixed L203 higher at L5,508 and rallied to L5,580 after hours, in largely domestic buying, amid expectations that the lira's weakness would have a positive effect on its prospects this year, and renewed rumours that a major disposal was planned. Montedison ended L48 higher at L1,230 after hours on expectations of an announcement shortly that it had agreed to sell its 51 per cent stake in Erbamont to Sweden's Procordia. ZURICH's SMI index rose 15.0 to 2065.4. Its drug companies reversed the trend of the previous two days in line with the overnight performance of the pharmaceutical sector on Wall Street and the view that the stocks' sharp declines had been overdone. Sandoz certificates rose SFr110 or 3.9 per cent to SFr2,880 while Ciba registered shares rose SFr5 to SFr600. MADRID dropped again at the outset, seeing heavy losses in the bond market and continued instability in the peseta, and equities slid by two per cent or more by mid-day. However, after lunch there were reports that the governor of the Bank of Spain, Mr Luis Angel Rojo, had told a parliamentary committee that the central bank will not adopt capital controls to support the sagging peseta. The corollary, a possible further devaluation, brought buyers back into the market, and the general index ended only 0.02 lower at 227.90. VIENNA's ATX index closed 11.1, or 1.3 per cent lower at 820.57 but ISTANBUL climbed to another record, closing 215.26, or 3.7 per cent higher.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        FT-SE ACTUARIES SHARE INDICES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- February 24                                        THE EUROPEAN SERIES  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes                Open      10.30      11.00      12.00  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1117.41    1115.58    1114.98    1114.57 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1175.50    1174.50    1172.81    1172.06  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes               13.00      14.00      15.00      Close  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100        1113.54    1113.81    1115.81    1116.05 FT-SE Eurotrack 200        1173.31    1170.41    1172.03    1172.14  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                        Feb 23    Feb 22    Feb 19    Feb 18    Feb 17  --------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE Eurotrack 100   1119.41   1132.76   1136.60   1132.95   1121.77 FT-SE Eurotrack 200   1178.69   1190.84   1191.09   1191.03   1173.51  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90)  --------------------------------------------------------------------- High/day: 100 - 1118.08; 200 - 1176.40 Low/day: 100 - 1112.54 200 - 1169.64.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

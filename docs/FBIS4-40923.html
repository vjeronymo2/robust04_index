			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [by Akira Furumoto] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 15 Jun -- On 15 June, Russian Deputy  Foreign Minister Aleksandr Panov (former ambassador to South  Korea), who is in charge of Russian policies toward the Korean  peninsula, granted an interview to YOMIURI SHIMBUN on the  situation on the peninsula, which has become tense over the  DPRK's (North Korea) suspected nuclear arms development. During  the interview, Panov stated that in recent phone talks (held on  13 June), both the U.S. and Russian Presidents shared the view  that the holding of an international conference of both North  and South Korea, the United States, Russia, China, Japan, and  others "could be the last chance" for riding out the current  crisis.    His remarks indicate the Russian Government has great  confidence in being able to realize the international meeting,  amid the unusual situation in which North Korea announced  withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).    Touching on the UN Security Council resolution expected to  be  adopted soon, Panov stated: "The holding of an international  meeting and sanctions against the DPRK would be incorporated  into the resolution as equal (options)." He also said both  Presidents share the common view that "the implementation of  sanctions are inevitable" if the international meeting does not  take place due to North Korea's refusal or other reasons.    In considering North Korea's menacing remark in its  statement  of withdrawal from the IAEA that it will view the exercise of  United Nations' sanctions "as a declaration of war," Panov  stated: "The possibility cannot be ruled out" that North Korean  special forces "will go into sporadic armed conflict and acts of  provocation" against nations participating sanctions, including  the United States, South Korea, as well as Japan. On the other  hand, he indicated that North Korea does not have the capability  to perform full-fledged advance operations to break through the  well-defended demilitarized zone (DMZ), in view of the country's  economic difficulties and the actual situation regarding its  military equipment.</p>

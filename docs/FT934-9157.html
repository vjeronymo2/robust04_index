			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / London Stock Exchange: Euro Disney shock The announcement of colossal losses at Euro Disney triggered a wave of selling in both the UK and French markets. Such was the rush to offload the shares that they were momentarily suspended in Paris. In London, share prices on trading screens were marked indicative only - where marketmakers are not obliged to trade at displayed prices. At their worst the shares were off more than Pounds 1, although they later improved to finish at 436p, down 72 on the day. The excitement followed the revelation of around Pounds 620m losses and the prospect of a large restructuring. Euro Disney has begun discussions with Walt Disney, its parent company, over a financial rescue package. However, Mr Nigel Reed at Paribas, an arch bear of the stock, believes the shares should still be sold with shareholders facing heavy dilution given the probability of a rights issue. 'We believe that after the write-offs today, the net asset value per share is now so low that shareholders are not in a strong position in any eventual restructuring,' he said. Hambros, the merchant bank, suffered the same fate as SG Warburg, the sector's leading stock, as the bank's shares tumbled in the face of a steep rise in profits and a good increase in the interim dividend. 'The figures were below the very best expectations and that is why the shares are down,' said one analyst. Market forecasts for Hambros' profits had topped the Pounds 45m mark and dividend expectations had ranged up to around the 4.6p level. In the event, the bank produced profits of Pounds 41.1m and a dividend of 4.5p. At the close, Hambros shares were 24 lower at 344p on good turnover of 1.8m. SG Warburg, the UK's premier merchant bank, and which produced scintillating interim figures on Tuesday, continued to run into bouts of profit-taking, ending 9 cheaper at 848p. Dealers said Warburg Securities was largely responsible for big gains in the banking issues and a bullish note on the sector was thought to be imminent. Barclays was the best performer in the leaders, closing 11 higher at 573p on good turnover of 5.4m shares, while National Westminster added 6 at 553p on 5.8m. Royal Insurance was the outstanding composite insurer, advancing 9 to 314p ahead of today's third-quarter numbers, which are forecast to show profits in excess of Pounds 115m against a loss of Pounds 83m during the same period last year. Commercial Union, aggressively bought by Hoare Govett, ran up 12 to 612p, while Sun Alliance, where Morgan Stanley was said to have been a substantial buyer of stock, firmed 4 to 370p. British Steel improved 1 3/4 to 123 1/2 p with turnover reaching 14m after a big bullish trade, said to have been executed by SG Warburg, in traded options. Meanwhile, the Bank of New York announced that the holding of British Steel shares in the US had reached 14.84 per cent. ICI retreated 12 to 698p after weakness in New York on Tuesday night. The company's ADR shares had fallen Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 41 5/8 on Wall Street. Amersham International, the health and scientific equipment group, slipped 11 to 927p in spite of a seemingly dramatic profits rise. Headline half-year profits increased by 71 per cent but were skewed by a Pounds 5.6m currency gain. Mr Paul Woodhouse of Smith New Court said: 'Growth is solid but I am not sure it supports a p/e of 17 times.' Hoare Govett remains a buyer, arguing that Amersham is an 'outstanding growth stock and still inexpensive'. Suggestions that one of the market's leading agency brokers had attempted and failed to place a large block of Burmah Castrol shares in the market late on Tuesday triggered a sharp marking down of the company's stock price at the outset of trading. It failed to stage any recovery thereafter, finishing 14 down at 753p after unremarkable turnover of 536,000 shares. 'With a supposed overhang of around Pounds 20m of stock, it is not surprising the shares have come under pressure,' said an oils specialist. Burmah shares have come under downside pressure since Nomura, the stockbroker, published a bearish note on the stock last week. Mirror Group Newspapers shrugged off concern over its publication of photos of Princess Diana and the shares recovered 3 to 154p. It was announced that Mr David Montgomery, MGN's chief executive, had bought an extra 25,000 shares in the company, taking his holding to 100,333. The company said he paid 151.5p a share. There was another upward move by Forte, dealers attributing the rise to a buyer of around 2m shares leaving the market short. The stock advanced 5 to 229p. Granada Group was lifted by News Corporation's figures on BSkyB, the shares climbing 6 to 473p. Among food issues, Cadbury-Schweppes was helped by a buy note from Smith New Court, one of the broker's few recommendations in a friendless sector. The shares added 8 1/2 at 465 1/2 p. Northern Foods was said to have suffered a downgrade at the hands of Hoare Govett. The shares came off 6 to 222p. Elsewhere, Unilever appreciated 3 to 1130p ahead of results due tomorrow. Food retailers were again under duress, dealers reporting no let-up in the downward buying pressure. Argyll Group lost 6 to 251p, Kwik Save 8 to 599p and Tesco 5 to 179p. Stores group Allders gained 14 on its debut, closing at 184p. Traffic figures from BAA saw the shares advance 10 to 899p. The airport operator reported a 7.9 per cent jump from its three London airports for October, well ahead of the forecast industry rate. This was said to have had some effect on the rise in Owners Abroad, 4 higher at 82p. However, the shares continued to be plagued yester-day with rumours of a rights issue and problems at its airline division. MARKET REPORTERS: Christopher Price, Peter John, Steve Thompson.

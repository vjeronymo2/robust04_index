			<p><P> October 9, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SHOOTING VICTIM HAD BEEN READY FOR NEW LIFE  </P> <P> After two decades of being an absentee father, Ronald Look was eager to be  permanently reunited with his son Darren, who recently visited him in Seattle.  </P> <P> But first the 21-year-old Darren had to return to his mother's Anaheim home to  gather up his belongings and clear up some outstanding traffic tickets, Ronald  Look recalled Sunday.  </P> <P> Before Darren could do all that, tragedy struck. Darren Look was shot and  killed Saturday at his mother's home by her ex-boyfriend, according to police.  </P> <P> "He wanted to get out of this particular area," Ronald Look said of his son.  "It just wasn't a good scene."  </P> <P> Look, who had been divorced from Darren's mother, Barbara Badgett, for 21  years, was among several relatives and friends who gathered at the Badgett home  Sunday to console the family in the wake of the fatal shooting.  </P> <P> Darren Look had been in a bedroom at his mother's home at 1337 Aetna St. at  about 10:30 a.m. on Saturday when her ex-boyfriend, George Burnside, 31, came  to the house, angry and threatening to kill the seven people inside, according  to witnesses.  </P> <P> Barbara Badgett had tried to break off her relationship with Burnside, but "he  wouldn't take no for an answer," family friend Don Carter said Sunday.  </P> <P> Burnside "busted in" the house and followed Barbara to her bedroom, Ronald Look  said. Darren Look "ran in the room, turned and bam!" -- was shot, the youth's  father said.  </P> <P> Barbara Badgett and others inside the house fled Saturday, but Burnside  remained inside holding the woman's 67 year-old mother, Jean Badgett, hostage  for more than five hours before he finally surrendered to police, authorities  said.  </P> <P> Ronald Look, an electronics installation manager, arrived in Orange County at  noon Sunday from Seattle, where he has lived for years since his divorce from  Barbara. The couple's oldest son, Craig, had joined his father in the Seattle  area several months ago.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Brother Got News  </P> <P> It was Craig who received a telephone call Saturday evening telling him that  his brother had been killed, Ronald Look said.  </P> <P> "He thought that maybe a couple of his friends were pulling a joke on him,"  Ronald Look said. "He called me.  </P> <P> "You are never prepared for something like this," Ronald Look said.  "Everybody's in deep shock."  </P> <P> Carter said Saturday was not the first time Burnside had wielded a weapon in  arguments with Barbara Badgett.  </P> <P> "He stuck a BB gun in his mouth and said he was going to blow his brains out,"  Carter recalled.  </P> <P> Carter said Barbara Badgett knew little of Burnside's background after meeting  him through mutual friends about eight months ago.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, a mile to the south, residents in the 2200 block of Colchester Drive  in Anaheim were shocked to learn Sunday that their neighbor had been arrested  for the killing.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Quiet Neighbor  </P> <P> Several neighbors, who asked that their names be withheld, described Burnside  as a quiet man who kept to himself, sold perfume at swap meets and lived in a  modest one-room apartment with his mother. Burnside did odd jobs but appeared  to have no permanent employment, neighbors said.  </P> <P> No one answered the door at the Burnsides' apartment Sunday, but neighbors said  police had visited Burnside's mother at the residence Saturday.  </P> <P> "He was the quiet type," one neighbor said. "You never can tell when they are  going to snap."  </P> <P> On Saturday some neighbors said they were not shocked at the shooting because  police had been called to the Badgett home several times to quell fights  between Badgett and Burnside. Although some neighbors said they also had called  police because they believed that drugs were used at the home, a Police  Department spokesman said Sunday that he was unaware of any police activity at  the residence other than for the domestic disturbances.  </P> <P> Mike Belknap, 21, a next-door-neighbor who attended Savanna High School with  Darren Look, said he has never seen drugs used at the Badgett home. Some  neighbors, Belknap said, may have stereotyped the family because of large  crowds of young people who often gather at the residence.  </P></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Dialogue between station reporters Kim Myong and Kim </F> Sang-ul: "The Civilian Warmongers are Dashing Along the Road of  War" -- live or recorded]    [Text] [Kim Myong] As you know, traitor Kim Yong-sam  recently revealed his true color as a civilian warmonger more  clearly than before. I would like to talk about this with you.    [Kim Sang-ul] The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique recently raved  that in the event the adventurous Team Spirit joint military  exercise is suspended, it will stage large scale exercises of a  northward nuclear war of aggression, including Ulchi-Focus Lens,  in August with the United States.    THE WASHINGTON TIMES referred to remarks of the South Korean  hard-liners against the North and of military experts and  reported that to fill the vacuum caused by suspending the Team  Spirit joint military exercise, other types of joint military  exercises may be conducted by South Korea and the United States.    This single fact alone shows that traitor Kim Yong-sam is  going to further intensify North-South confrontation and war  maneuvers this year.    [Kim Myong] Two years ago, the United States and the South  Korean puppets announced that they would suspend the Team Spirit  war exercise in a bid to help North-South dialogue. However,  they conducted exercises of a northward nuclear war of  aggression under a different name, claiming that they should  fill up the vacuum. Thus, they led the situation on the Korean  peninsula to the brink of war. The people still clearly remember  this.    Even before one year passed since he came to office under  the  veil of civilian politics, traitor Kim Yong-sam is going to  stage, on a larger scale, a northward nuclear aggressive war  exercise with the United States under a title other than Team  Spirit. This shows that traitor Kim Yong-sam is a warmonger more  vicious and vile than previous military dictators.    [Kim Sang-ul] Yes. You are right. While staging the 93-Ulchi  war exercise in July last year, traitor Kim Yong-sam directed  that this exercise should be conducted in the atmosphere of a  real war. The puppet prime minister also stressed that the  exercise should be conducted by stressing the importance of a  strong sense of national security, thus instigating war  hysterics.    Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of South Korean puppets  and U.S. Forces in South Korea, and tens of thousands of troops  from the U.S. mainland participated in the Ulchi-Focus Lens  joint military exercise, which was staged for as long as 15 days  last August. In addition, a number of lethal weapons, including  nuclear weapons, were mobilized in this exercise.    At that time, public opinion pointed out that this joint  military exercise is another version of the Team Spirit war  exercise -- only in different name. This is not an accident at  all.    If they conduct a large-scale South Korean-U.S. joint  military exercise this year, and even add the Ulchi war  exercise, people will doubt the significance of suspending Team  Spirit.    [Kim Myong] You are right. Facts illustrate that the Kim  Yong- sam puppet clique is a group of warmongers and national  traitors, who are dashing along the road of war, going against  the trend of the time, not toward peace. The facts also show  that the so-called Kim Yong-sam civilian government is deceptive  and that it is in actuality a more vicious and cunning bellicose  regime than previous military dictatorial regimes.    As this civilian regime emerged from the root of a military  fascist dictatorial regime, there cannot be any change.    [Kim Sang-ul] The whole world, not to mention fellow  countrymen, unanimously wish that the North and the South on the  Korean peninsula will advance toward detente and cooperation,  instead of confrontation and division as seen last year. This  year we are also making all sincere efforts to improve  North-South relations and open a new aspect for national  reunification in conformity with the desire of all fellow  countrymen. Nevertheless, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique,  turning its back on our patriotic proposals and magnanimous  efforts since the early stage of the year, is recklessly running  amok continuously with anticommunist confrontation maneuvers by  instigating the atmosphere of war. The Kim Yong-sam clique is  indeed a group of rash war maniacs.    [Kim Myong] It goes without saying that the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique is a group of war maniacs. This was proven by a  single fact that it increased 1994 military expenses --  so-called national defense expenditures -- to 10 trillion won.  As shown by this, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique increased the  scale of 1994 military expenses by 9.6% from last year, thus  amounting to more than 10 trillion won.    [Kim Sang-ul] I think it is the first time that the amount  of South Korean military expenses has exceeded 10 trillion won.  What do you think?    [Kim Myong] You are right. Even under the oppressive  military dictatorship of the Chon Tu-hwan and No Tae-u military  fascist clique, so-called military expenses were not increased  on such a drastic scale. This again proves clearly that traitor  Kim Yong-sam is a warmonger outshining former military  dictators. It is not difficult to imagine how frantically  traitor Kim Yong-sam will run amok with reckless war provocation  maneuvers against fellow countrymen this year by spending a  greater amount of money.    [Kim Sang-ul] That is right. From the beginning of this  year, the Kim Yong-sam puppet clique has been running wild with  military provocation maneuvers by making violent gun  powder-reeking remarks.    On 21 January, traitor Kim Yong-sam visited the puppet  Defense Ministry as part of his annual inspection tour and  handed out a so- called instruction. This rascal made violent  bellicose remarks there, such as establishment of a new national  defense policy, strengthening of quality-oriented military  power, and so forth. On the other hand, the Kim Yong-sam clique  staged frantic war exercises aimed at a northward invasion in  South Korean areas with outside forces and constantly  perpetrated grave military provocations along the demarcation  line area.    [Kim Myong] The civilian regime cannot be consistent with  war. The puppet regime, composed of bellicose elements who  pursue war, cannot be called a civilian government. The Kim  Yong-sam puppet regime is driving North-South relations into a  grave aspect by aggravating confrontation and tension. As long  as this regime remains intact, national interest will be  infringed upon more seriously, and the whole nation will suffer  nuclear disaster and will inevitably become the victim of big  powers.    Stressing that nothing can be hoped for and expected from  the  Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, the people from all walks of life in  South Korea courageously rose in an antigovernment struggle by  upholding the slogan calling for the overthrow of the Kim  Yong-sam regime. It is quite natural. The Kim Yong-sam puppet  regime, which betrayed the nation and turned its back on the  people, should be deservedly overthrown.    [Kim Sang-ul] You are right. Officers and men of the South  Korean Army should not blindly follow the order of the Kim  Yong-sam puppet clique, which has frantically run amok with war  maneuvers since the beginning of the year. They should precisely  look straight at the trend of the time and should join the  fierce step of the people to achieve peace and peaceful  reunification of the nation through great unity of the whole  country. They should no longer be driven into such war exercises  that go counter to the nation.</p>

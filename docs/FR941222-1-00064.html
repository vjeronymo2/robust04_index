			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Information relevant to this discussion is not included at  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the present time due to business confidentiality concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Process waters from the manufacture of triarylmethane dyes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pigments containing high levels of aniline or other raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials and solvents sometimes are sent to a distillation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> column for recovery of the material for reuse in the process. As  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expected, the bottoms generated from the distillation contain  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high concentrations of the material being recovered. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations of aniline present in two samples collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exemplify the concentrations of solvent contaminants anticipated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in these wastes. Information on the concentration of aniline  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> observed is not presented at his time due to business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Based on data from the RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> four facilities generated a total of 1700 metric tons of this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste in 1991.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA has summarized the risk projections associated with this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste in Table II&hyph;11. The data presented in this table represent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two samples from two facilities. These samples were collected  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the two largest generators of this wastestream, both of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which recover aniline from the wastewater. One of the remaining  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> two facilities recovers other aniline derivatives ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  N,N-  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dimethylaniline and N,N-diethylaniline) that are used as raw  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> materials and solvents in the production of triarylmethane dyes.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The second facility recovers chlorobenzene used as a solvent in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the production of triarylmethane dyes and generates a still  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> bottom waste that is reported to contain 50% chlorobenzene. This  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste is already listed as F002, based on the use of the solvent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> chlorobenzene. Based on an evaluation of the processes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> generating these wastes and the contaminants reported to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present by industry, the Agency believes the risks posed are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> similar to those assessed in Table II&hyph;11. The data used to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> characterize these wastestreams, assess the risks posed by these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastes, and make a proposed listing determination on the waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> grouping were obtained from the two samples collected by EPA and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the 1991 RCRA Section 3007 Questionnaire responses. Waste  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management information relevant to this discussion are not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> included at the present time due to business confidentiality  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As discussed earlier in Section II.D, Description of Health  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Risk Assessments, the Agency conducted the risk assessment on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these wastestreams using the two most widely used practices, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-site boiler and municipal landfill as the current management  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scenario, and an on-site boiler (for the air pathway) and on-site  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> monofill (for the ground-water pathway) as the plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management scenario.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The risk posed by the presence of aniline in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> concentrations found in the waste is estimated to be very high  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e.,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> greater than 9E&hyph;3 for the ground-water pathway, and HQ=6  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for the air pathway). Due to the imperfect nature of any  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recovery process, it is not unexpected that large quantities of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> aniline, or any other raw material or solvent being recovered,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would be present in these still bottoms. Aniline was found in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> very high concentrations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  the low concentration was 1.9%)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in both distillation bottom samples collected from triarylmethane  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigment production. Information on the high concentration value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is not included at the present time due to business  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> confidentiality concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to aniline, the two sets of coeluting  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents present in the wastewater treatment sludge and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastewaters from these operations ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> i.e., <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  1,2-diphenylhydrazine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and azobenzene, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also are present in the distillation bottoms (K166). These  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compounds are all likely by-products arising from the oxidation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of aniline. The MS curve representing 1,2-diphenylhydrazine and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> azobenzene was identified in both distillation bottom samples  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> collected from triarylmethane pigment operations. For the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons discussed in Section II.D, the Agency conducted the risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> assessment for these coeluting compounds independently. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this first  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set of coeluting compounds is greater than 9E&hyph;3. Likewise, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risk assessment for N-nitrosodiphenylamine and diphenylamine was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> conducted independently, as discussed in Section II.D. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resulting high-end individual cancer-risk level for this second  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> set of coeluting compounds is 6E&hyph;6.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to assessing the risks associated with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual constituents found in the waste, the Agency considers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the combined risks of constituents that co-exist in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream. In the case of still bottoms from the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> triarylmethane dyes and pigments, all of the constituents are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believed to co-exist in the wastestream. The distillation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> columns generating this residual process the same wastestream  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with each dye or pigment batch. As a result, the constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> detected are likely to be present simultaneously in the waste.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The risk of each individual constituent is high, and the combined  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> risks of these constituents are very high (greater than 9E&hyph;3 for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ground-water pathway and 6E&hyph;5 for the air pathway), both of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which were considered in making this listing determination.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the very high risks posed by the plausible  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practice (on-site boiler for the air pathway and on-site monofill for the ground-water pathway), the risks posed by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the baseline management practice (on-site boiler for the air  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathway and municipal landfill for the ground-water pathway) are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also very high. Specifically, the risks posed by the current  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> management practices are greater than 9E&hyph;3 for the ground-water  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pathway, and 6E&hyph;5 (carcinogens) and HQ=6 (non-carcinogens) for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the air pathway.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In summary, the calculated risks associated with managing  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these still bottoms in on-site boilers, municipal landfills, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on-site monofills are all very high, based on each of the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual hazardous constituents in the wastestream and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> combined risks due to carcinogens found in the wastestream as a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> whole. Therefore, based on the risks associated with both  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> current management and plausible management practices for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waste, EPA is proposing to list as hazardous still bottoms or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> heavy ends from the production of triarylmethane dyes or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pigments, designated EPA Hazardous Waste Number K166.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For the reasons stated above, the Agency is proposing to add  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the following constituents to Appendix VII to Part 261_Basis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for Listing: 1,2-diphenylhydrazine, azobenzene, aniline,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diphenylamine, and N-nitrosodiphenylamine.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition, azobenzene and N-nitrosodiphenylamine are  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposed to be added to Appendix VIII to Part 261_Hazardous  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Constituents.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5.Wastes from the production of anthraquinone dyes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a. Wastewater treatment sludge from the production of anthraquinone dyes and pigments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Summary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> EPA is proposing to defer the proposed listing determination  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for wastewater treatment sludges from the production of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anthraquinone dyes and pigments at this time. Based on analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the sludge samples collected by the Agency, no constituents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> attributable to anthraquinone processes were detected. However,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data supplied by industry indicate the presence of two  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> constituents on the target analyte list for which no health-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> levels and no adequate surrogates exist. Based on this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> discrepancy and the need to identify surrogates for risk  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> analysis, the Agency believes a deferral is appropriate for this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wastestream.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This sludge is generated from the treatment of wastewaters  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from anthraquinone dye and pigment manufacturing.

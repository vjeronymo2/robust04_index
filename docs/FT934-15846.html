			<p>931009 FT  09 OCT 93 / The Conservative Party Conference: Strained fireside chat delivers a glow of unity IT WAS probably the most stage-managed speech in British political history. To the detached observer, it looked strained, cynical, and deeply un-British. But it worked. After four days of synthetic platform unity, the party finally screwed up its courage and discovered the real thing, or at least a plausible imitation. The prime minister promised a fresh approach, and he delivered it. Gone was the autocue he has used in previous conferences, and with it the worst excesses of the Dalek delivery. Instead Mr Major relied on a mix of notes and memory. There wasn't much spontaneity, and when there was, he overdid it. It sounded more like a fireside chat than a rousing oration. If it was the speech of his life, that was only because of the poverty of his previous efforts. But none of that matters much. Mr Major wasn't trying to win an Oscar, or to impress the intelligentsia, which he knows will sneer at his back-to-the-future message. He set out to assuage the worries of the Conservative heartlands, and he succeeded by pressing the right buttons - rising crime, bad schools, national pride. Conservative leaders always promise a return to greatness. But Mr Major went further, specifically praising the values of the 1950s and ridiculing 'fashionable' theories on housing, crime and the family. The message was in the language, and it was perfectly tailored to his audience. His critics call him weak, so he warned the French to get their tractors off our lawn. They say he cuts a poor figure on the world stage, so he talked about his telephone call from Boris Yeltsin. There were some good jokes, courtesy of Sir Ronald Millar, playwright and former speechwriter for Lady Thatcher, for whom he penned the line 'the lady's not for turning'. For Mr Major, the best he could come up with was a joke about bookshops selling 'memoirs to the right of me, memoirs to the left of me'. If the speech lacked a big idea, blame Sarah Hogg and Nick True from the Downing Street policy unit. But it could have been worse. Mr True, an Oxford chum of Michael Portillo, was responsible for last year's impassioned call for more toilets on motorways. Saving post offices will play better than that. It all added up to a 12-minute ovation, triggered by a video clip of last year's ovation, and helped by the inevitable Elgar and a free red ensign for every representative, courtesy of the British Chamber of Shipping. The applause was passionate, and it was genuine. The party had found its voice, and it didn't want to stop. If it looked more like the Republicans in Boston than the Conservatives in Blackpool, they didn't care. But for those who were only watching, it left a bad taste in the mouth.</p>

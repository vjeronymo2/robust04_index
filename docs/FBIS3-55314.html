According to  Interfax sources, Dudayev believes that as Georgia's first  legally elected president, Gamsakhurdia must be buried with all  honors.    Groznyy's mayor's office told Interfax that requests were  being made for naming a street in Groznyy after Gamsakhurdia.  Groznyy's First Vice Mayor Sayid-Magomed Inorkayev said that  Gamsakhurdia's name would be given to one of the city's most  beautiful streets. He also said that the city administration  was ready to organize a funeral ceremony in Groznyy.    Earlier, Gamsakhurdia's wife Manana had told Interfax that  her husband must be buried in Tbilisi, in the courtyard of his  house, near his father's grave. She doubts, however, that the  Georgian officials will allow her to do so.</p>

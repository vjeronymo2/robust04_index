			<p>930324 FT  24 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM vulnerable to ambush by amendment - As the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty returns to the House of Commons, FT writers look at the remaining obstacles to its passage THE PATH to ratification is still strewn with pitfalls for Mr John Major's government. As the committee stage grinds on, the prime minister and his colleagues are vulnerable to ambush on virtually any non-wrecking proposal behind which the Labour front bench puts its weight. There are up to eight such amendments and new clauses which Labour insists it will press to a vote. In practice, the threat of further government defeats may be gravest on the two amendments where the Liberal Democrats are expected to side with Labour. Only one of the eight - Amendment 27, which would remove the protocol containing Britain's social chapter opt-out from the treaty - appears likely to inflict lasting damage to the Maastricht process. Unfortunately for Mr Major and his troops, this amendment does enjoy the unanimous backing of the 291 Labour and Lib Dem MPs. Following last month's much-derided legal U-turn, the amendment is technically non-wrecking, since the government believes it would not stop ratification of the treaty. But its passage would at the very least put the government in uncharted legal waters. That is because it would prevent the protocol to which it relates being incorporated into UK domestic law. Pressing on and ratifying the treaty, including Britain's opt-out - in defiance of parliament - would also leave Mr Major open to charges of resorting to undemocratic methods (the royal prerogative) to get his way. To defeat the government, Labour and the other opposition parties would have to be joined in the 'Aye' lobbies by at least a dozen Tory Euro-sceptics - an unlikely prospect on the face of it, since they profess to abhor the social chapter and all it stands for. But some Euro-sceptics are inclined to do just that. Ironically, they use the thrust of the government's own legal argument to justify their stance, insisting that passage of the amendment would not impose the chapter on British companies. It could accordingly be supported with a clear conscience. Ominously for the government, such views are not confined to the hard-core contingent of 20 to 25 Tories who are taking the unofficial Euro-sceptic whip. 'I will never vote for any amendment that will have the effect of taking us into the social chapter. Douglas Hurd (the foreign secretary) has said Amendment 27 will not have that effect, therefore I am minded to support Amendment 27,' said a senior Tory MP. The government could be rescued if a majority of Euro-sceptics decides on balance not to back the amendment and the group votes en bloc. Alternatively, it could improve its prospects of winning by coaxing some of the Ulster unionists or other minority parties not to side with Labour. The vote is expected immediately after MPs' detailed consideration of Clause one of the tiny three-clause Maastricht bill - conceivably as soon as next week. The government could live with defeat on any of the other seven divisions Labour may press for, although a string of reverses would have a debilitating effect on loyalists' morale. Labour and the Liberal Democrats are most likely to present a united front in opposition on Amendment 35, which would require parliament to vote on whether Britain should join the last stage of economic and monetary union if certain conditions were fulfilled. This vote is expected immediately after MPs have debated Clause two of the bill. Whether the Euro-sceptics will decide they can back such an amendment is not yet clear. The remainder of the amendments and new clauses Labour intends to push focus mainly on increasing the accountability to parliament of various European institutions and the Bank of England. But these are not being supported by the Liberal Democrats and have no guarantee of Euro-sceptic backing either. The Euro-sceptics are divided between those who favour voting against the government at virtually every juncture before the second Danish referendum in May, and others who think it right to keep their powder dry ahead of the Commons report stage to which the government is now resigned. The Liberal Democrats are worried that the accent on accountability risks distracting attention from making European institutions more democratic and may even impair their independence. MPs also still have to debate a string of new clauses calling for a British referendum on the treaty. The call will spark perhaps the largest rebellion of all among Euro-sceptics. But this is one issue where the government is assured of the Labour front bench's support. This should ensure that its stance in opposing a referendum will carry the day.</p>

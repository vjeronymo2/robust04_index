Dr. Berisha's visit, to reciprocate the one made to Albania  by Dr. Mahathir last July, was aimed at enhancing political,  economic, and technical ties between the two countries.    He is heading a 14-member delegation which includes the  Albanian minister of industry and commerce, Selim Betortaja, and  Deputy Foreign Minister Arian Starova.

While here, Dr. Berisha will hold discussions with Dr.  Mahathir, attend a briefing at the Economic Planning Unit (EPU)  of the Prime Minister's Department, and also visit several  projects, including the Proton Saga plant in Shah Alam. He will  also witness the signing of several agreements between Malaysia  and Albania.    Albania, in southeastern Europe, is bordered by Montenegro  on  the north, Macedonia on the east, Greece on the south, and the  Adriatic Sea on the west.    It occupies an area of 28,748 sq. kilometres and has a  population of 3.2 million, 70 percent of them Muslims.</p>

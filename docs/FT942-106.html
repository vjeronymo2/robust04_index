			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / UK Company News: Victory parade or a retreat . . . - The closing hours of the hostile bid for Lasmo At 1pm tomorrow Lasmo's defence committee of senior executives and directors should be able to discard the trappings of a company under siege. The 'secure' paper shredder, fax and photocopier - the main modern-day weapons of a company defending itself against a hostile takeover bid - can be unplugged after two months of steady frontline service. Down can come the notices dotted around the company's Broadgate headquarters warning staff not to ' . . .discuss any Lasmo business in lifts, lobbies or any public places'. Also due to depart will be a small army of City advisers, who will walk away in the best traditions of mercenary soldiers with Pounds 20m to Pounds 25m of shareholders' cash regardless of whether Lasmo is successful or not in defending against Enterprise Oil's Pounds 1.6bn all-paper bid. The only question is whether the departures will take the form of a victory parade or a retreat. And that will depend on the actions over the next 30 hours or so of a relatively small number of UK and US fund managers. Last night the Lasmo defence team was locked in a 'council of war' to assess the damage from Enterprise's stock market raid yesterday afternoon, in which it snapped up about 10 per cent of Lasmo shares - the maximum that Enterprise was allowed to buy in the market. The defence committee also had to decide on a course of action for today, when it makes its final presentations to institutions. The raid, in which Phillips and Drew Fund Management, Lasmo's biggest shareholder, sold about half its holding in the company, will be certain to influence many institutions which have found precious little guidance from the arguments put forward by the Lasmo and Enterprise camps during the contest. 'No side has hit home with the killer blow,' said one fund manager yesterday just before the raid on Lasmo shares. Enterprise has clung to its original position that there is a sound industrial case behind the takeover attempt. But it suffered badly from a clumsy start to the campaign and its initial reluctance to spell out the benefits in detail. Many analysts dismiss Enterprise claims that the asset mix of a combined company would be complementary. Some also challenge the claim that Lasmo will be unable, in spite of its recent rights issue, to fund all its promising development opportunities - especially in Algeria and Colombia where it has recently announced new discoveries. What is not disputed is the fact that Enterprise would benefit from the inclusion of Lasmo assets. In the medium term they would bolster cash flow, improve the balance sheet and add a safety margin to the company's ability to pay dividends. The broader asset base would also enhance Enterprise's well-regarded ability to swap and trade assets. That ability was cited yesterday by one of Lasmo's smaller institutional shareholders as one of the reasons for supporting the Enterprise bid. Lasmo has counter-attacked on a number of issues, ranging from Enterprise's accounting standards, dividend policy and record in international exploration. But none appears to have had a decisive effect on shareholders. One UK shareholder which decided yesterday to back Lasmo said it was not so much its defence that swayed them, as much as a failure on the part of Enterprise to 'make its case'. Lasmo's gearing to higher oil prices was another factor cited by some investors as a reason to stick with the company. The argument that Lasmo's restructured management team has begun to turn the company's fortunes around also found some favour with investors. 'It is difficult for the acquirer to convince investors that it will do something more than what the refurbished Lasmo management team can do,' said one institutional shareholder. Another, however, found little reason to support the continuing existence of two large exploration and production companies. 'Lasmo as a company has had its chance,' he said. But much of the talk among shareholders before yesterday's raid centred on cash, or the lack of it. Enterprise claimed that its carefully constructed all-paper final offer of 36 Enterprise A shares and 13 warrants for every 88 Lasmo shares took into account the concerns of large shareholders in both companies. A British investor, however, noted that the 'missing ingredient is cash . . .that would have led to a much clearer debate'. That view was shared among investors in the US who up until yesterday held more than 20 per cent of Lasmo shares. One US investor said before the raid: "We've told them from day one - cash talks. If they want to put some cash into the bid, fine. If not, we'll take our chances with Lasmo. Unless they want to pull a dawn raid, they're out of time.' It appears from yesterday's events that Enterprise took heed of that warning. But it remains to be seen whether the effects of the single foray they are allowed to make in the market will be enough to swing sentiment behind them. See Capital Markets</p>

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> WOODBRIDGE GIRLS WIN AT VALENCIA  </P> <P> Woodbridge High School dominated the ninth Valencia High School Track and Field  Invitational Saturday, finishing first in the girls' division and second in the  boys'.  </P> <P> The Woodbridge girls' team finished with 108 points, well ahead of second-place  Estancia (61) and third-place Gahr (49).  </P> <P> The Warrior boys came within a couple points of winner Valencia (49-47) and  Foothill finished third (38).  </P> <P> "We only brought six varsity girls today and we still won the meet," Woodbridge  Coach George Varvas said. "I'm really pleased with our performance, we're right  on schedule."  </P> <P> Woodbridge's Kaci Keffer won the 400 meters and the 300-meter hurdles and also  anchored the winning 1,600-meter relay team.  </P> <P> The Warriors also received a standout performance from Cathi Peck, who won the  800 meters and 3,200 meters. But Varvas held Peck out of a race that might have  proved the meet's most exciting, denying her a rematch with West Covina South  Hills' Karen Hecox in the 1,600 meters.  </P> <P> "We've faced her before and Cathi lost to Hecox on the kick," said Varvas, who  explained that the Southern Section, Masters and state meets are where Peck  will get her chance.  </P> <P> "Right now, we're going to have Cathi run more half-miles to work on her  sprinting," Varvas said.  </P> <P> Hecox, regarded as one of the top milers in the state, blew away the rest of  the field in the 1,600, clocking a meet-record time of 5 minutes 3.35 seconds.  </P> <P> She also anchored the 1,600 relay team, using her impressive kick to bring  South Hills from 30 meters back to win its heat.  </P> <P> Hecox earned girls' athlete of the meet honors, while La Habra's Mark Gonzales  took the boys' award for winning the 800 and 3,200 meters.  </P> <P> Gonzales' time of 9:32.68 in the 3,200 was only three seconds off the meet  record. Valencia's Jose Sandoval finished second at 9:50.73.  </P> <P> Sandoval's showing, coupled with a first-place finish by the 1,600 relay team,  gave the Valencia boys their edge over Woodbridge.  </P></p>

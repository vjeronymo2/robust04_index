			<p><P> February 21, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CURBS STAND ON UNPUBLISHED WRITINGS  </P> <P> The Supreme Court let stand Tuesday a controversial ruling that biographers and  historians may not use unpublished letters, manuscripts, diaries and other  works without the permission of the writers or their heirs.  </P> <P> Without comment, the high court dismissed an appeal by a company that had  published "Bare-Faced Messiah" by Russell Miller, a biography critical of the  late L. Ron Hubbard, founder of the church of Scientology (Holt vs. New Era  Publications, 89-869).  </P> <P> The original ruling, made last April by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals  in New York, allowed publication of "Bare-Faced Messiah" to proceed on a  technicality but declared that unpublished works "normally enjoy complete  protection" from being quoted by others.  </P> <P> That ruling was denounced by scholars, authors and free speech advocates. The  publisher, Henry Holt &amp; Co., said at the time that the ruling was "being  used to muzzle responsible biographers and historians." Moreover, Holt said,  the ruling forced publishers to engage in "self-censorship" and prevented the  examination of historical truth.  </P> <P> During his lifetime, Hubbard had written letters to the FBI, the White House  and the Veterans Administration, letters that biographer Miller obtained  through a Freedom of Information request. He planned to quote from the letters  in an effort to show that Hubbard was a fraud and a liar.  </P> <P> But lawyers for the church's publishing house filed a copyright infringement  suit against Holt and Miller, arguing that church officials had the exclusive  right to use the unpublished letters.  </P> <P> The appeals court, on a 2-1 vote, agreed, although it rejected the  Scientologists' effort to block the book because the suit was filed too late.  </P> <P> Three years ago, the New York-based court first aroused concern in the  publishing industry by blocking a planned biography of reclusive author J. D.  Salinger because the book contained excerpts from his private letters. Lawyers  for Salinger contended that the right to publish those letters was his alone.  </P> <P> In 1987, the Supreme Court refused to review that decision, but some publishing  lawyers said the ruling appeared to cover only the highly personal letters of a  still living author.  </P> <P> The ruling involving the Hubbard materials went further, and, in appeals to the  high court, the Assn. of American Publishers described the rulings in the  Salinger and Hubbard cases as "a one-two punch landed by the 2nd Circuit on  historical and scholarly publishing. In the wake of these decisions . . . no  prudent publisher can afford to risk even very limited quotation from  unpublished materials -- no matter the degree of their prior dissemination or  how compelling the purpose -- since to do so invites injunction of the entire  work."  </P></p>

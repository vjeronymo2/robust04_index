			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / UK Company News: MBO at Massey Ferguson offshoot MF INDUSTRIAL, the Manchester-based construction equipment company which is part of the Massey Ferguson Group, is to be acquired by a management buy-out team in a Dollars 18m (Pounds 9m) deal agreed in principle yesterday. The deal ends several months of uncertainty over the future of MF, a producer and distributor of backhoe loaders, light industrial tractor loaders and skid-steer loaders. MF, which has annual sales of about Pounds 50m and 440 employees, is a self-contained unit of Massey Ferguson, best known for its farm equipment and itself part of Varity, the US corporation which also produces vehicle components and diesel engines. Varity has said it would be interested in selling non-core businesses, but MF will retain links with its current parent after the deal is finalised. It will continue to use the MF trademark under license, and will use axles from Massey, diesel engines from Perkins and hydraulic cylinders from Pacoma, all Varity units. Mr Richard Robson, leader of the buy-out team and managing director of MF, said that, thanks to support from Varity and Massey, MF had been able to carry out a significant investment programme in new product development and manufacturing modernisation. MF is the third biggest company in the UK backhoe market, behind the dominant JCB and JI Case, and last year exported 82 per cent of production. Its headquarters and manufacturing plant is located at Stretford. Equity and loan financing for the acquisition and future working capital requirements is being arranged by Arthur Andersen Corporate Finance, and the management team is being supported by an international equity syndicate led by Granville Development Capital.</p>

			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Money Markets: European futures fall FRENCH FRANC futures were a touch weaker yesterday as the French currency failed to make much headway above the lows that were reached against the D-Mark last week, writes James Blitz. Trading was extremely quiet in European cash and futures markets at the start of the Christmas week. In the sterling market, short-dated futures were priced lower on rumours that there will be no further reductions in UK base rates for some time. In the French franc futures market, the March contract declined 3 basis points to close at 90.49 after the currency failed to make much progress on the foreign exchanges after an initial rally. At this level, the market is saying that three-month money in France will be at 9.51 per cent in the spring - substantially below the current figure of 12 1/4 per cent. The implication is that something will have to give in the battle of the French franc. Trading in German futures was quieter. The March contract moved up two basis points to finish at 92.06, pricing in three-month money in late spring at 7.94 per cent. In the cash market, German call money edged higher on Monday in line with the decline in bank reserve levels. Traders quoted call money at 8.80-8.90 per cent, slightly higher than Friday's 8.80 per cent, and said that banks were experiencing a drain of liquidity from this month's tax payments. Short-dated sterling futures fell sharply yesterday following Sunday newspaper reports that Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had indicated that he was averse to any more cuts in UK base rates for the time being. The March contract fell 10 basis points in light trading to close at 93.27, while the June contract dropped more sharply, by 11 basis points to end at 93.56. The FT survey of city forecasters showing greater pessimism than the government in forecasting inflation over the next two years also helped to dampen sentiment. The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 350m at the start of the day, and later revised that to a flat position. There was late assistance of Pounds 60m, suggesting that there were shortages somewhere in the banking system after all. Three-month money finished virtually unchanged at around 7 3/16 per cent.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikolay Podlipskiy: "Antimonopoly Committee </F> Rises Up Against the System"]    [Text] Members of the Government Commission on  Operational Matters reacted ambiguously to the view of the  Antimonopoly Committee on the need for substantive reform of  Russia's system of goods certification. But the State Committee  on Antimonopoly Policy (GKAP) was not seriously counting on  convincing all opponents right away--its aim was simply to  acquaint First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets with an  alternative point of view on this problem.    [Begin box] Over the period 1992-1993, more than 225,000  certificates were issued for Russian production output,  including about 180,000 for foodstuffs. In addition, about  108,000 certificates were issued for import production, of which  about 100,000 were for foodstuffs. More than 2,600 product items  failed to obtain a certificate due to lack of conformance with  safety requirements, including 2,000 food product items. [End  box]    Sergey Bezverkhiy, chairman of the Committee on  Standardization, Metrology, and Certification, presented his  view of the problems of the department under today's conditions.  In his words, Russia has presently subscribed to three  international certification systems and talks are already  nearing conclusion on the adoption of several others  (certification of metals, composites, and railroad  transportation). A number of unresolved problems exists in the  domestic system, however. These problems deal primarily with the  poor legislative base--Russia has only six legislative acts  "covering" this sphere, while Japan has 33, the United  States--160, and the European Community--over 300. In addition,  transition from the Soviet certification system to a purely  Russian one--GOST R [State Standards--Russia]--must be  accompanied by a simultaneous reworking of the "Soviet"  standards. However, the committee's capabilities do not permit  rapid improvement and perfection of 26,000 old state standards.    Oleg Soskovets concisely expressed his opinion of the  report:  "loud but incoherent." The first deputy prime minister devoted  far greater attention to the report of the Antimonopoly  Committee's expert who cast doubt overall upon the advisability  of maintaining the Russian system of certification in its  present form. In the opinion of GKAP, this system has at least  two flaws. The first--mandatory receipt of a certificate of  conformance with national state standards (which, incidentally,  is a purely Russian invention)--provides no advantage to the  Russian exporter from the practical point of view. In the West,  the quality of Russian (Soviet) standards themselves still  remains to be proved. Even on the domestic market, incidentally,  the system of total certification has failed to improve the  quality of goods. The second flaw lies in the fact that the  Certification Committee combines commercial and control  functions--the right to issue certificates of conformance is  delegated only to testing centers and laboratories under the  committee's jurisdiction. GKAP specialists presently have  information on "deals" (between the certification company  Rostest-Moscow and the Moscow Customs Office, for example),  leading to the formation of a monopoly for this variety of  service.    [Begin box] Russia Subscribes to the Following  International Certification Systems:    --system of certification of means of road transportation  (Geneva Convention of the European Economic Commission of the  United Nations);    --system of the International Electrical Engineering  Commission for testing electrical equipment with respect to  conformance with safety standards (accreditation of Russian  laboratories within this framework is scheduled for May 1994);    --the Brussels Convention on Reciprocal Recognition of  Control Markings for Firearms and Ammunition (accreditation of  Russian laboratories is scheduled for June 1994).

			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Poor third quarter at Thai telecoms group Shinawatra Computer &amp; Communications, Thailand's leading telecommunications company, has reported disappointing third-quarter net profits of Bt1.23bn (Dollars 49.2m), writes William Barnes in Bangkok. This lifts net profits for the first nine months 238 per cent to Bt2.44bn from Bt1.02bn last year. However, the latest figures have been lifted by a previously-announced extraordinary gain of Bt840m. Advanced Information Services, the cellular telephone subsidiary, reported third-quarter profits of Bt400m lifting nine-month profits to Bt1.18bn from Bt 628m. Another unit, United Communications, saw its third-quarter net profits rise to Bt576m from Bt62m by unexpectedly strong mobile phone subscriptions. Nine-month profits stand at Bt1.44bn.</p>

			<p>920718 FT  18 JUL 92 / Arts: Entertainment by judged and jury billed as the 'most senior' of Britain's international executant competitions and sponsored this year by British Gas - completed its 1992 course on three evenings of the past week. On Tuesday the six finalists took their pick of a Mozart concerto (in the Old Library of the Guildhall, with the Bournemouth Sinfonietta under Tamas Vasary); over Wednesday and Thursday were spread their choices from the Romantic or 20th-century concerto repertory (at the Barbican, with the Philharmonia under Andrew Litton). On the evidence of only the latter two evenings, it would be a rash commentator who risked any sort of hard-and-fast pronouncement about either the overall standard or the particular quality of the young violinists attracted to the Flesch this year. This is not going to stop me from hazarding a guess that the latest edition of the biennial competition will not come to be hallowed as the most bounteous promotion of violin talent in its history; indeed, of the six players whose concerto performances I heard, at least three raised worries on basic matters of technique. Also on the evidence of just a single performance, it was easy to pick the 1992 winner: the Viennese Benjamin Schmid (b1968), a dashing figure on the platform, who gave the Brahms concerto with the enviable assurance of a seasoned professional. On each movement were lavished tones of succulent lustre (coloured by a beautifully delicate, never mechanical use of vibrato) and sturdy, well-tuned solidity even in the highest reaches and trickiest cadenza flourishes. Schmid was the only one of the six whose phrasing sounded entirely unflecked by competition nerves. At no point, however, did I find his Brahms-playing particularly interesting or individual; the feelings that one hopes to have aroused on such occasions - the delighted discovery of a new artistic voice and simultaneous re-discovery through it of the music itself - were missing from the experience. In this respect I much preferred the Bartok Second Concerto as delivered by the American Steven Copes (b1971), with flashing, often exhilarating vigour and a real sense of how the whole piece works and unfolds, not just its dazzling effects and grateful passages. I also warmed considerably more to the Dutchman, Armand Gouder de Beauregard (b1972), who played the Tchaikovsky Concerto with a radiant singing sweetness (though this tended to thin out and go spotty in passages of virtuoso knitting). But Schmid was the judges' choice, not only as overall competition-winner but for three other smaller prizes; he was also the recipient of the Audience Prize. Gouder de Beauregard came third and Copes fifth; the ranking of the second and fourth prize-winners, both disturbingly flawed technicians and immature musicians, seemed quite incomprehensible on the evidence of their Brahms and Tchaikovsky concertos. Disagreement with an eminent competition jury (the 1992 Flesch jury contained such distinguished names as Ricci, Pauk, Lubotsky, Imai and Canino) is a time-honoured critical entertainment. In this sense above all, the finals of the 1992 Flesch competition proved hugely entertaining.</p>

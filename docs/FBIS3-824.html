			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Professor Carel Boshoff, head of the Afrikaner </F> Freedom Foundation]    [Text] The intention of the Freedom Front to take part in  the coming national election is based on the fact that the  Afrikaner needs more than one instrument in his struggle for  freedom in his own fatherland. The ultimate goal to obtain his  own volkstaat [homeland] is indispensable; it's just a question  of how to attain it.    From this point of departure participation in the election  has got nothing to do with the acceptance of the 1993  constitution, nor with the legitimacy of the new government.  Whoever the government may be, the presence of Afrikaners in  the elected structures will be to claim their volkstaat and to  make use of every means to achieve their goal.    More or less 2.8-million Afrikaners would not be wise to  rely  on power or numbers alone. Blacks in South Africa outnumber  them by more than 80 percent; unfortunately for both they  occupied the same regions in the country. For the Afrikaner, in  order to claim a volkstaat of their own, they should become the  indisputable majority in the region where they intend to  substantiate their claim.    That is not possible before April 27, the day of the  election, and, therefore, every opportunity should be taken and  all power and knowledge should be applied to bring it about.  During that time the Afrikaners should consolidate their  interests within the new South Africa, insist on their claim for  a volkstaat to be recognised and accommodated in the  constitution in an irreversible way.    But there is real doubt the transitional constitution does  not provide for that. Political scientists De Villiers and  Sindane say: "A unitary system of government has only one power  centre and all sub-national units exist at the behest of the  centre. The central government can delegate powers to the  sub-national units -- regions, states or provinces -- and can  take these back at will. It can dissolve the sub-national units  and create new boundaries or new units. Resource allocation as  well as budgeting is centrally done. The logic for the  establishment of a unitary system is different from that of a  federal system."    In a full page analysis of what is called "the final hurdle"  in BUSINESS DAY (March 3), a group of concerned business people  concentrates on the two real issues: the powers of the  provinces are inadequate; the central government can override  all provincial powers. It says: under the new constitution and  despite the most recent concessions, the central government can  override the social welfare policy of a province. The central  government can override a province that allows private  hospitals. Provinces cannot determine their own trading hours  for shops or regular street traders. Provinces have far less  regional powers than Punjab in India or Sarawk in Malaysia or  New South Wales in Australia or Ontario in Canada or Texas in  the United States.    On the other hand, the ANC [African National Congress] will  easily win the central election and will have all the central  power. In regions they win their regional policies can be  identical to their central polices. Therefore we appeal to the  ANC/National Party to agree to the following changes: increase  provincial powers meaningfully. Remove central control over  these powers, and safeguard these changes effectively.    For the Afrikaner that is what it is all about. To enter  into a new dispensation without such changes is a risk to our  national life. Therefore demands for the change of the  constitution is still hampering the election and it may even  cause a deadlock. The concession made by the Freedom Front to  register provincially for the election is a gesture of  willingness towards the government/ANC. This was in reaction to  a gesture by the ANC/government adding a new principle  authorising the constitutional assembly "to include in the new  constitutional text provision for communities sharing a common  cultural and language heritage to exercise a recognised form of  internal self-determination should it be proved that there is  substantial support in such a community for such  self-determination."    But even this addition does not guarantee a volkstaat  because  it is still possible for the winning party to practically  override all efforts of self-determination in the regions and  even declare the whole country as one province.    The deadlock between the parties has led to the request for  international mediation. It is my belief that we need the  mediation of a number of objective experts acceptable for the  different parties. The success of mediation has been proved in  a number of crucial situations all over the world and it must be  applied in our situation.    If all the obstacles are eliminated and the Afrikaners need  for a volkstaat is recognised, there should be no reason why  they, as members of the Freedom Alliance, would not take part in  the election. When that happens there is enough reason to  believe that the Freedom Alliance may become the second  strongest power in South African politics.    The Afrikaners can begin immediately to plan and develop  their volkstaat and other members of Freedom Alliance should be  accommodated in a real federation according to their will.</p>

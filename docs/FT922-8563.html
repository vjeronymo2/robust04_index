			<p>920513 FT  13 MAY 92 / Gonzalez adopts tough line over general strike THE POLITICAL atmosphere in Spain has sharply deteriorated ahead of a half day general strike planned for May 28, with Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez promising to 'guarantee' the right of people to work during the strike and the unions threatening action against the media. The unions, which called the strike - and a further full day stoppage in October - to protest at a government decree that cuts unemployment benefits, have also widened their protest to include an attack on government plans to introduce strike legislation and cuts in public sector industries. Mr Gonzalez, who intervened in the growing dispute for the first time yesterday, urged the unions to call off the strike. 'Whoever wants to work on the 28th will be able to do so,' he said. The unions are likely to mount pickets outside factories and offices to stop people breaking the strike. Mr Gonzalez also said the government would ensure minimum levels of public sector services would be maintained. The government's strike legislation, about to be put to parliament, is designed legally to enforce such services in the public and private sectors and attempts to impose them on May 28 are likely to be stiffly resisted. The prime minister said the benefit cuts had been made as part of Spain's plans to converge its economy to higher EC standards and to enable the country to enter economic and monetary union as a founder member of Emu in 1997 or, at the latest, 1999. Mr Gonzalez denied he had any differences of opinion with Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance minister, who drew up the convergence plan containing the benefits decree, and insisted that Spain had no alternative but to enter Emu with its more powerful EC partners. Some observers in Madrid believe that by widening their demands beyond the repeal of the benefits decree, the unions may be tacitly acknowledging that public support for strike action against the decree only may be hard to sustain. It seems likely, though, that the strike call will be adhered to on May 28 and that the action will effectively shut down the country. But this, experience suggests, will not necessarily imply support. During the last general strike on December 14, 1988, many people simply took the day off as a holiday. Newspapers have reacted angrily to demands they publish a message from the unions on their front pages on the day of the strike. The unions have also told radio stations only to play music during the strike, to be broken by news broadcasts. Television channels have been told to display their test cards. The unions have said if the media do not agree to these demands by tomorrow they will take action against them. In an angry editorial, El Pais, the country's most prestigious newspaper, described the demands as blackmail. The Spanish Senate is due to complete a debate today on the convergence plan drawn up by Mr Solchaga. The government has said it would admit small changes being asked for by two large regional parties but the plan is likely to become law without significant changes. It will then be submitted to a meeting of EC finance ministers before the Lisbon summit at the end of next month.</p>

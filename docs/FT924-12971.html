			<p>921017 FT  17 OCT 92 / Fishing: Hooked on modesty IT WAS suggested forcefully to me the other day that I was becoming prey to that most odious of indulgences, false modesty. No one could catch as few fish as you and stick at it, the thesis went. Ergo, you do catch fish but prefer to give us all that sackcloth and ashes humbug about failure and humiliation. My protests were brushed aside. What we want, I was told firmly, is a triumph. And, happily, while I was pondering the morality of inventing something, a triumph was delivered into my lap on such a scale as to render my impatient critic speechless. In all conscience, I cannot claim much credit for it, except that it was my idea that we should go to Ireland and to the Cork Blackwater, now blessed above all rivers. It was luck, pure luck. Even the least deserving of us come by a slice now and then. It was all the more marvellous for being so improbable. The weekend before we were to go, appalling news came. 'He says there's a 7 ft flood,' my wife informed me, as casually as if reporting that she had forgotten to buy bread for breakfast. I tottered, consumed by a vision of a brown torrent bearing smashed trees, Kerrygold cows and all our hopes out to sea. But then, perhaps in answer to fervent prayer, the deluge ceased. By the time we reached Careysville, the duke of Devonshire's lodge overlooking the Blackwater near Fermoy, the river had resumed a more orderly way of life. 'You'll get a fish,' was the matter-of-fact prediction from cheery, round-faced Paddy Egan, our ghillie. Hope struggled with disbelief. My campaign opened disastrously. I showed Paddy my spinning line and he said it was too light. I said it was all I had. He shrugged his shoulders. Second cast, I hooked a fresh-run fish of about 8 lb. The line broke. Oddly enough, it was the day Britain left the exchange rate mechanism - a matter of trifling importance compared with my loss although I fancy Norman Lamont, the chancellor, might have felt something of the same despair which overwhelmed me. Paddy was not wholly sympathetic as he marched me off to the tackle shop to replace my line. I caught nothing that first day, although I had the dubious pleasure of watching one of my companions pull out three within 20 minutes. Paddy beamed at him like a teacher with his prize pupil. Since this is supposed to be my triumph, though, I shall pass over those salmon, particularly as they inspired in their captor an unworthy display of gloating. Nor shall I dwell on the 12-pounder which another member of the party caught below Careysville weir next morning. My time came that afternoon. At almost the same spot where that gullible trio had given themselves up the previous day, I had two salmon, 11 lb and 8 lb. Now I basked in Paddy's approval. Thus far, all the fish had been caught spinning, with a deadly lure which was developed at Careysville and is now famous throughout Ireland. It is known as the Flying C - which stands, I am distressed to say, for condom. The resemblance is undeniable. Now, spinning is all very well but fly fishing is better - apart from which, no true angler would wish to acknowledge that he owed all his success to an airborne birth control device. So, the next morning I fished the fly down a gorgeous pool at the bottom of the Careysville fishery, which they call Corrineen. The sun shone, a soft breeze rustled the yellowing leaves and, halfway down, a fish took. I was transfixed and did nothing. It hooked itself and, after a tussle, I landed it. It was small, only 6 lb, but fresh from the sea and lovely to behold. It made me a happy man. In fact, the whole trip had the blissful quality of the best dreams. The house was like the nicest sort of small country hotel, without the inconvenience of other guests. They asked us if we liked lobster and served five between the four of us, fresh that morning from the market in Cork. We ate like men possessed - I can still savour the smell of the hot crab pie which preceded the apple crumble with which we were provided in the cricket pavilion which serves as Careysville's fishing hut. And - heaven be praised - there were fish. We had 19 salmon in 3 1/2 days, two-thirds of them from Careysville and the rest from another stretch upstream. Yes, it was a triumph. Now, I have gone back to being the angling non-achiever nature intended; but the memories will keep me warm through winter.</p>

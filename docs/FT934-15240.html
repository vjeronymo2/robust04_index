			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Councils shake-up 'will cost Pounds 1.1bn' THE CONFLICT between councils over the local government review intensified yesterday as counties claimed that transitional costs of restructuring would be Pounds 1.1bn. Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary, announced last month that he favoured replacing two-tier authorities with unitary authorities, even if this incurred extra cost. But Mr Dennis Pettitt, chairman of the Labour-controlled Association of County Councils, said that the government had already said that there is not likely to be more money for local government next year. The association's evidence came in a formal submission to the environment department. Using estimates which have been independently validated, it found that the costs of the restructuring had been underestimated, and predicted an average cost of Pounds 27.2m for each county. District councils, claimed that polls in three counties where plans for reform have been published - Durham, Derbyshire and Cleveland - showed that most voters wanted unitary authorities to replace the two-tier system. Voters in Durham and Derbyshire indicated that retaining the two-tier status quo was their favourite option. But the Labour-led Association of District Councils pointed out that a separate question yielded majorities for unitary authorities in Cleveland and Derbyshire.</p>

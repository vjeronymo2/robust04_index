			<p>920521 FT  21 MAY 92 / Survey of Turkey (7): Patience is a virtue - Relations with the European Community THE SAGA of Turkey's relationship with the European Community is now nearly 30 years old, but the final outcome is still unclear. The reasons behind the failure to consummate this long and often difficult courtship are anything but simple. A complex mixture of economic, political and even ideological factors continues to bar the Community's door to the entry of a country whose strategic value to the west was already indisputable during the cold war and whose geopolitical importance has, if anything, increased following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Communist system. Successive Turkish governments, basing themselves on the argument that the EC-Turkey Association agreement of 1963 specifically mentioned the possibility of Turkey's eventual accession to the Community after a 22-year transitional period, have never wavered in their ultimate objective. They have insisted that by virtue of its strategic geographical situation, its major contribution to western defence and the secular vocation bequeathed to it by the founder of the modern Turkish state, Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's fundamental eligibility for full membership could not be questioned. Most EC member states, however, have never adopted such a straightforward attitude. Though they have not said so frankly, it is an open secret that there have always been serious reservations in the Community about the desirability, or even feasibility, of integrating an Islamic state in the EC. For Turkish President Turgut Ozal, that is the real reason why his country has made so little headway in its attempts to join the Community and that all the other obstacles enumerated by the Community are no more than pretexts. President Ozal is doubtless as mistaken in his incomplete analysis as those who claim that Turkey's Moslem religion is a factor of no importance or relevance whatsoever. Turkey's chequered political history over the past three decades, including a military coup as recently as 1980, its poor human rights record over much of the period, its relative underdevelopment, its failure to implement some of the key provisions of the association agreement and its protectionist economy, all provided sufficient grounds for putting off any decision on its membership. All these considerations, together with others of a much wider nature arising out of the profound changes that had taken place in Europe following the collapse of communism and the desire to give priority in the EC's enlargement policy to the European Free Trade Association and eastern European countries, were set out in the European Commission's 'opinion' at the end of 1989 on Turkey's formal application for membership made two years earlier. Most of the points made are as valid now as they were two years ago. The Commission stressed that, since 1980, the Turkish economy had made 'a remarkable leap forward'. Its GDP had increased by an average of 5.2 per cent a year for the period 1981-88, compared with only 2 per cent for the Twelve. Indeed, it reached more than 9 per cent in 1990, before falling back to about 2 per cent last year. Exports, including notably manufactures, had increased very rapidly and their structure had been diversified. And in 1988 Turkey had managed for the first time since the war to register a current account surplus, a result which was to be reversed two years later, however. So much for the good news in the Commission's 'opinion'. The other side of the coin was that, with a fast-rising population which would eventually be greater than that of any Community member state - an estimated 68m in the year 2000 - Turkey's general development was substantially lower than the European average. Purchasing power was still only one-third of the Community average. Both its industry and agriculture were characterised by very major structural disparities, the level of industrial protectionism was very high, while social protection was much lower than in the EC. In addition, the rate of inflation was several times higher than in the Community - an understatement, given that it reached 70 per cent last year, and only marginally less the previous two years - and the rate of unemployment was extremely high. For good measure, the Commission threw in a number of political reasons why it would be inopportune for Turkey to be granted early membership. While conceding that Turkey now had a parliamentary democracy 'closer to Community models', and that it had made progress in the human rights field and the respect for minorities, 'these had not yet reached the level required in a democracy'. It also stressed that the various disputes with Greece, in particular over Cyprus, were additional obstacles to Turkish membership. In short, the Commission concluded that it was not convinced that the adjustments which would confront Turkey if it were to become a Community member could be overcome in the medium term, despite the positive features of recent developments in Turkey. Whereas it was difficult to argue with many of the Commission's economic arguments, the Turks were particularly irritated by the fact that the Commission was laying down a new set of ground rules for the opening of membership negotiations with Ankara. By stressing that it could not take any decision until after the implementation of the Single European Act in 1993 and until it had fully examined the implications of enlargement for the further development of the Community, taking into account all actual or potential applications for membership, the Commission appeared to have found a new reason for stalling. Indeed, Ankara rightly concluded it was being relegated in the list of applicants behind Efta and the Eastern European countries. If Mr Suleyman Demirel's government has recently adopted a more philosophical attitude towards EC membership, it is partly because the new administration is more realistic than its predecessors about the substantial macro-economic and structural adjustments that still need to be made before Turkey can participate in a European economic and monetary union and before its industry, except for the modern textile sector, can face the full blast of EC competition. Turkey's new status as a pole of attraction and role model for the new central Asian republics, with which it shares a common cultural, linguistic and religious tradition, has also given it a fresh regional political and economic vocation. While no Turkish politician or official seriously believes that there is any real long-term alternative to membership of the EC, which already provides a market for 53 per cent of Turkish exports and is the source of 48 per cent of its imports, it is now accepted in Ankara that Turkey is unlikely to become a full member of the Community until the early part of the next century. Its hopes, in the meantime, reside in the 'substantial measures' proposed by the European Commission to help Turkey's economic and political modernisation process and to prepare the path to its eventual membership. These include the completion by the beginning of 1996 of a customs union between the EC and Turkey, the activation of the Association Agreement's 4th Financial Protocol providing Turkey with Ecu600m (Pounds 420m) of financial aid, the full association of Turkey with the EC's Mediterranean programme and the stepping up of the Community's industrial and technological aid to Turkey. Most of the member countries are no longer prepared to tolerate the political veto of some of the most important of these measures by Greece, which has linked them to a settlement of the Cyprus problem. Though not denying the importance of a Cyprus solution for Turkey's long-term links with the Community, Britain, which takes over the EC presidency in the second half of this year, is particularly anxious to revitalise the EC's relationship with Turkey as quickly as possible. Indeed, there is a growing feeling in Community countries that Turkey has reaped a poor reward for its steadfast loyalty to the western alliance and that Ankara needs to be reassured that it has not been permanently rejected by the European partners it has wooed for so long.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] According to military sources, the U.S. imperialists  on 21 June perpetrated aerial espionage on the northern part of  the Republic by bringing an RC-135 tactical reconnaissance plane  from an overseas base into the sky of South Korea.    The reconnaissance plane that flew in from a base in  Okinawa,  Japan ran amok in taking aerial pictures and conducting  electronic air reconnaissance of the Northern Republic by flying  high on the skies above Kangnung, Yangpyong, and Tokchok Island  between 1100 and 1600.    In the meantime, pursuit-assault planes, vertical take-off  and landing attack planes, and early-warning planes that took  off from overseas bases ran madly about in a surprise bombing  exercise in the skies above Yongyol, Pyongchang, and Asan Bay as  operation theaters in cooperation with the flying corps of the  U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea.    The powder-reeking aerial war exercise, conducted under the  command of an E-3 early-warning plane known as an aerial flying  commander, was a reckless play with fire aimed at reviewing  actual warfare capabilities of a coordinated strike in times of  northward invasion between flying groups from overseas bases and  those belonging to the U.S. Air Force stationed in South Korea.    On the same day, a formation of KC-135 refueling planes took  off from a U.S. base in the Pacific region and was deployed at  the U.S. Air Force base located in South Korea.</p>

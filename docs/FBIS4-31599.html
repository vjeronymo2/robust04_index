			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Passages within quotation marks are recorded] </F>   [Text] The Democratic Left Alliance [SLD] has asked the  Sejm Presidium to postpone the debate on the ratification of the  concordat with the Vatican until after the new Constitution is  adopted. The discussion has been planned for 2 July. In this  situation, a vote will most probably be held during the nearest  Sejm session in order to reschedule this date.    [Unidentified correspondent] To justify its motion, the SLD  quotes the civil rights ombudsman who has written to the Sejm  Speaker saying that the ratification of the concordat before the  adoption of the new constitution will lead to discrepancies in  the regulations defining the relations between the state and the  church. In this situation, according to the SLD, the new  constitution should be adopted first, and the concordat should  be dealt with afterward.    [SLD Chairman Aleksander Kwasniewski] "This is a better  solution. It will avert the reservations that the concordat is  arousing today, and it will give priority to the basic law,  which the constitution is. At the same time, all of this may  happen according to realistic deadlines. In not more than a  year, we can have both the constitution and, later, a serious  debate on the concordat.    We do not want either a religious or an ideological war. We  simply want to dissuade doubts that the people in Poland have,  and we need time to do this. I think this procedure will be  better."    [Correspondent] The Polish Peasant Party [PSL] believes that  the issue of the ratification should be dealt with as soon as  possible, and it intends to vote against the proposal put  forward by its partner in the coalition.    [Janusz Dobrosz, chairman of the PSL parliamentary floor  group] "We are in favor of making a decision on the issue of the  concordat by the Sejm. This is a democratic choice: Either we  are for the ratification of the concordat, or we are against it.  However, delaying the matter--and this is how the motion put  forward by the SLD can be understood--will not benefit anything  but will arouse emotions and result in other important issues  being treated as secondary."    [Correspondent] The SLD's motion will most probably be  supported by the Union of Labor. One can expect that, apart  from the PSL, also the Confederation for an Independent Poland  and the Nonparty Bloc in Support of Reforms, as well as an  overwhelming majority of deputies from the Freedom Union, will  vote against the postponement of the debate on the concordat.  In the Sejm, the number of opponents of the concordat is almost  equal to the number of its supporters. Thus, it is difficult to  predict the outcome of the vote on the postponement of the  debate.</p>

			<p><P> June 1, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEW WEAPON IN GANG WARS;  </P> <P> COMPTON POLICE SERVE WRITTEN NOTICE OF STREET TERRORISM ACT  </P> <P> "Hey, Sleep!" Red Mason yelled out the window of the unmarked police car as it  rounded the corner onto Rose Avenue, a narrow street lined with big trees and  small houses that range from neatly kept to ravaged.  </P> <P> "He's already been served," said Mason, who sat in the front passenger's seat.  </P> <P> Edward (Red) Mason is a 19-year veteran of the Compton Police Department's gang  unit.  </P> <P> Sleep is an "O.G.," shorthand for original gang member, in this case the  Santana Block Crips, who control a narrow stretch of neighborhood squeezed  between Santa Fe Avenue and the Southern Pacific railroad tracks that cut  Compton in two.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Special Attention  </P> <P> Mason, Patrolman Mark Anderson and two officers in the car behind them were  serving special-delivery notices on the Santanas. The Santanas, one of the  city's oldest gangs, has been targeted for special attention under the state's  newest anti-gang weapon, the Street Terrorism Enforcement and Prevention Act.  </P> <P> Dubbed "Baby RICO," because it mimics the federal racketeering statute  (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act), the law says gang  membership can be a felony. Police and sheriff's deputies in Compton, Long  Beach, Los Angeles, Pomona and Pasadena are serving written notices about the  law on members of 11 gangs that Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has  identified so far through police and court records as engaging in criminal  activity.  </P> <P> "What's your name, man?" Mason asked out the window as Anderson, cruising south  on Spring Street, stopped the car.  </P> <P> "Charles," answered a handsome 18-year-old known as "Black."  </P> <P> Mason climbed out of the car, asking Black what gang he belonged to. Black,  trying to sound cooperative at the same time he was trying to back down the  sidewalk, said he used to belong to a gang. Doesn't anymore, he insisted, not  since he did time on a weapons charge. Looking for work now, he said. Has to  support his new baby daughter, he said.  </P> <P> "What set (gang) you from?" Mason asked again in an undemanding tone.  </P> <P> "No set," Black said.  </P> <P> "You want to go over to Lueders with me?" Mason asked casually, as if inviting  a neighbor to take a ride with him to the hardware store. Lueders, a city park  10 blocks away, is in Blood territory. Crips are not welcome.  </P> <P> Using the police car hood as a writing surface, Black signed the 4-by-5-inch  notice that is designed in triplicate like a credit card receipt. It said that  Black has been notified that Santana Block is a "criminal street gang" under  the provisions of the new law. The top copy went to Black, the second into  police files and the third to the district attorney.  </P> <P> Under the law, which has not yet been tested in court, Black could get up to  three years in prison for just being a Santana. Police say, however, what is  most likely to happen is that prosecutors will produce the notice if Black is  convicted of a felony and will argue that he should get more time in prison for  being in what he was warned was a criminal gang.  </P> <P> "Hey, come here, Snap," Anderson suddenly yelled at a young man who stepped out  the door of a house, spotted police and tried to duck back inside.  </P> <P> "You hear about these papers we're serving, the gang terrorism act?" asked  Anderson, a boyish-looking officer who has spent 12 years keeping tract of  Compton's 36 gangs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Wearing a Beeper  </P> <P> Short, and with a beeper clipped to the waist of his stone-washed blue jeans,  Snap grinned broadly. Twenty-one Santanas had already been served notices  before the gang unit spotted Black and Snap on a late afternoon cruise through  Santana turf.  </P> <P> Like most gang members, Snap refused to sign the notice, so Anderson wrote  "refused to sign" on the signature line before handing Snap his copy. Refusing  to sign does not alter the possibility of being prosecuted under the new law,  law enforcement officials say.  </P> <P> Mason and Anderson bantered awhile with Snap, talking about a rival gang and  asking about Potato Head (Paul Watson, a Santana being sought in connection  with the April 2 drive-by murder of a gang member and a bystander in Kelly  Park).  </P> <P> They asked Snap to pull up his shirt so they could see "SBC," the Santana Block  Crips' tattoo. Bullet scars decorated Snap's torso.  </P> <P> </P> <P> One Died  </P> <P> Back at the wheel of the car, Anderson said: "He and his brother and another  kid were shot standing in front of the liquor store down there."  </P> <P> The youth with Snap and his brother at the liquor store died in the June, 1988,  shooting.  </P> <P> Making a sharp left when he recognized the driver of an older model gold car,  Anderson pulled up behind the car and yelled out his window, "Pull over,  Spank!"  </P> <P> Spank, a pudgy, 19-year-old in blue shirt and pants, wore a beeper on his belt.  He was on his way home, he said, to take a nap before going to work. The police  asked where he works and what he does.  </P> <P> "I do all kinds of things, can't pinpoint no one thing," Spank said.  </P> <P> "You heard about this program, right?" Anderson said, sliding a notice across  the hood of the police car and asking, "You know how to read?"  </P> <P> "Yeah, I know how to read," Spank said defensively. He declined to sign the  notice.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 2 Carloads Approach  </P> <P> Cruising in the car again, Mason slouched in his seat until the sight of two  carloads of young men approaching from the opposite direction made him bolt  upright and signal the officers in the car following him and Anderson to stop  the approaching vehicles.  </P> <P> "Look who's in the back," Mason said, greeting old acquaintances as they piled  out of the cars. "Ced and Sag."  </P> <P> "They don't do any shooting. They're into dope," Mason said, prompting a chorus  of "Not me, not me," from the men, whom he identified as O.Gs.  </P> <P> Sag, in a white tank top and new-looking wide-whale corduroy pants and suede  shoes, is a celebrity in Santana territory. He has been on various network  television shows and been interviewed by reporters from newspapers across the  country. Making use of the unexpected meeting with the police, he complained  they were not doing enough to keep the Atlantic Drive Crips from "pressing" the  Santanas.  </P> <P> "Aw, that's bull," the police said in unison.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Supported by Drugs  </P> <P> Back in the gang unit's office, a basement room in which gang paraphernalia --  T-shirts, hats, snapshots and piles of funeral programs -- cover the walls and  the tops of desks, Mason recalled that he knew Sag and his friends when  Santanas were "doing drive-bys on a bicycle. Now they got AKs (semiautomatic  weapons) and cars."  </P> <P> Drugs, Mason said, gave the gangs an economic base that they did not have when  they first sprang up in Compton in the late 1960s and early '70s.  </P> <P> Mason and other members of the gang unit welcomed the new anti-gang law. By  itself, they say, the law will not eradicate gang violence but it is one more  tool, an enhancement to other laws, that may help take more gang members off  the streets.  </P> <P> "What it's for," Mason said, "is the guy who's been slipping through, the guy  who's been riding in the back seat on the drive-by."  </P></p>

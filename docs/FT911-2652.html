			<p>910429 FT  29 APR 91 / Arts: Complementary to historic sites - Architecture Cambridge University's announcement last week that it is to go ahead with its development plans for the new Judge Institute of Management Studies was accompanied by the naming of the architect for an historic site in the centre of Cambridge. John Outram Associates have been selected to design a major new building that has to incorporate elements of the listed Old Addenbrookes Hospital currently occupying the site between Trumpington Street and Tennis Court Road. Both the major donors, Mr and Mrs Paul Judge and Mr Simon Sainsbury as well as the university were involved in the selection procedures to find an architect. They have made a brave choice because John Outram is an original, hard to classify and yet highly appropriate because he understands and responds to the historical density of this site. But Outram is not in any way an historical pasticheur. His particular sort of architecture achieves what many modern architects had thought to be impossible. His buildings are both technically innovative and ornamental. He does not, like some architects, make the innovations of technology themselves into an artistic language. His own architectural language is strong enough to encompass the existence of the old hospital and to add to it in a manner that will be complementary without being imitative. The Old Addenbrookes Hospital goes back to the 1740s but the most visible part from Trumpington Street is the facade of the 1860s, designed by Matthew Digby Wyatt. It was described by Pevsner in his 'Buildings of England' as 'a depressing example of its date, with many rather dry, thin motifs, Italian as well as Tudor, assembled without any tension or accentation.' It has more friends today and its curious, round arched North Lombardic character is not without possibilities. As Outram says, the facade has lost little of its relevance to the problem of urban architecture and seems less of an artifice today than it probably was at the time of its original design. His solution to the problem of inserting a new and innovative centre for management studies on to this site is to create three buildings which will all be linked by a 16-metre high animated internal street where students and faculty will meet and mingle. There will undoubtedly be considerable architectural drama that will give the new faculty a colourful profile in the university. John Outram's name is strongly linked to an eclectic range of new buildings. His country house in Sussex with its five typologies for the column and richly colourful palette of materials is undoubtedly one of the most interesting country houses built in Britain this century. At some remove, but just as interesting, is the pumping station on the Isle of Dogs directly commissioned by the London Docklands Development Corporation. The earlier headquarters building for Harp Heating combined service columns with a considerable wit concerning the iconography of engineering. There are two as yet unbuilt schemes; the Milton Keynes based headquarters for the Consumer Association (Which?) and the large new office development for the Rosehaugh-Stanhope Holborn Viaduct/Blackfriars Station site. The Outram element of this scheme is at the Blackfriars end of the site and is a remarkable essay in prefabricated brick and concrete technology. This building - by far the most outstanding of the whole development - is at present on hold awaiting the upturn in the City property market. It will be a very positive addition to the City. Outram has been selected for the British Pavilion in this year's Venice Architectural Biennale. Architects were named for another important project last week: the sensitive and important Spitalfields Market site. The proposed redevelopment of this is a long saga. But minds will have to be focused in May when the fruit and vegetable market finally moves out to its new home in east London at Temple Mills. The Spitalfields Development Group announced their selection of the international firm of Benjamin Thompson and Associates as master planners for the whole 12-acre site of the market. Ben Thompson and his wife Jane pioneered, with the Rouse Company in the US, the rescue of redundant urban market sites or collapsed areas of major cities. They have made an enormously successful impact - particularly at Boston's Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, at New York City's South Street Seaport development and at the Bayside Marketplace, Baltimore. I recently admired their elegant rescue operation at Union Station, Washington DC Are they the right people to rescue this vital part of London that has been fought over by conservationists for years and lies on the brink of some of the most socially deprived parts of the capital? Spitalfields is important for the City too: it is a close neighbour to the monumental Broadgate development as well as the Georgian streets of the former Huguenot quarter around Hawksmoor's Christ Church. The Spitalfields Development Group have another scheme on the table at the moment which is due to be examined at a public inquiry in October. This scheme, by Swanke Hayden Connell, should surely be dropped at once and a groundswell of support ensured for the ideas of the Thompsons. I was shown their very early ideas for the site, but I liked their informality and I agreed with the wish to make the whole place 'walking scale'. It is surely right to have a wide selection of architects working on a whole range of buildings under the careful direction of a master planner to ensure a sense of harmony without uniformity. The track record of Ben Thompson Associates - currently also working in Dublin and Cardiff - shows that they have often achieved the impossible and made enjoyable places flower in the urban deserts. As long as they remember that Spitalfields has to be the key to the regeneration of east London as well as a link to the City, I feel that they have the sensitivity to rescue Spitalfields from squalor. They must not be hedged about with any more bureaucratic delay.</p>

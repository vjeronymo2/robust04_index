			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / Leading Article: Rail impasse The UK rail dispute has come to resemble the trench warfare of the first world war. Both sides have seemed willing to slug it out whatever the cost. Neither can deliver a knock-out blow. The losers have been non-combatants: the passengers and freight customers who have suffered disruption and delay; businesses with employees who are unable to get to work; and the train operating companies which must recompense their passengers and pay their staff's wages despite being unable to run full services. The most depressing aspect of the dispute has been the apparent paralysis at Railtrack, the state-owned company that runs British Rail's track and signalling operations. The mysterious withdrawal of an offer that might have avoided the whole dispute launched the strike action. The amount that Railtrack has been prepared to offer has crept up gradually, but the company has failed to convey the details to the signal staff. The board, including its chairman Mr Bob Horton, has failed to demonstrate control of events in a way that would reassure train passengers or freight customers. Yesterday's vote by the signalling supervisors not to join the strike, however, offers an opportunity to bring the dispute to a conclusion. Railtrack should seize the initiative to settle the dispute as soon as possible. A businesslike company would be prepared, if necessary, to offer more for a speedy settlement, moving quickly thereafter to recover the expense by a thorough-going reorganisation of the signalling staff. An essential element in such a package would be individual contracts of employment for signal staff. The idea that a union such as RMT should exercise a veto over necessary efficiency improvements is a relic of a bygone age. If extra money is politically impossible, then Railtrack must step up the pressure on the signal staff and RMT to accept the current offer. One option would be to ballot the striking staff on the offer, preferably after making it crystal clear just what is on the table. After eight weeks of strikes - and with the supervisors unwilling to join them - an increasing number of signalling staff will be realising that the cost of winning an extra per cent far outweighs the likely benefits. A tougher option would be an ultimatum to the signal staff to accept the offer or consider themselves to have resigned. This might produce enough acceptances to keep the network running - especially if linked to a symbolic concession to tempt the doubters. But it is a high-risk strategy: if it fails, British Rail could be shut down for months while replacements are trained. Whatever the option chosen, Railtrack must now act. One of the hoped-for benefits of privatising British Rail must be that both sides will in future take a more realistic view of what it is sensible to inflict on those who pay their wages.</p>

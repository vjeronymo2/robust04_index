			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Defense Minister Valentin Aleksandrov by </F> Georgi Kardanov in Sofia on 26 May: "Current Political  Situation Should Not Affect Subordination in the Army"]    [Text] Despite the heavy parliamentary program connected  with debating the vote of confidence requested by Professor  Berov and the tension surrounding some government ministers,  before the secret ballot began, Defense Minister Valentin  Aleksandrov found time to grant a brief interview to a BULGARSKA  ARMIYA reporter.    [Kardanov] Mr. Minister, if the government obtains a vote of  confidence, what will be the first matter that Minister Valentin  Aleksandrov will address?    [Aleksandrov] Along with these demands for the government to  resign and these numerous votes of confidence that have been  moved, a considerable number of problems have accumulated that  require solutions, so how can one decide which of them is the  most pressing? I have the feeling that some officers seem to  have forgotten that the most important thing in the army today  is to obey the orders of one's superiors. Regardless of the  current political situation, this subordination, as well as  order and discipline, must be strictly observed in the army and  the armed forces, otherwise we will have no army. During this  severe political crisis, it is clear that an extreme  psychological load is placed on the troops, which is especially  harmful for subordination.    [Kardanov] Certain parliamentary forces and political  circles have supported the view that your demand for certain  high-ranking officers to be retired has created tension in the  army. What is your counterargument?    [Aleksandrov] Look here, the General Staff has carefully  drafted a plan that completely conforms with my views, so that  the dismissal of the officers concerned is completely within the  order of things, and it will take place in the fall. I do not  see any grounds for tension as a result of this fact, or at  least cannot not accept the force of these grounds, even in the  event that the Defense and Armed Forces Act is not passed, and I  personally cannot undertake to affirm that parliament will  indeed pass it.    [Kardanov] You mentioned the words "in the event that the  Defense and the Armed Forces Act is not passed...." Prime  Minister Lyuben Berov's short-term program envisages passing the  law before the end of June, yet yesterday Ahmed Dogan, chairman  of the parliamentary group of the Rights and Freedoms Movement,  told a reporter that one should not be too hasty to pass the  law, that it is a very extensive piece of legislation, so that  there is hardly likely to be time to pass it. What is the true  situation?    [Aleksandrov] I cannot say which is best, but in any case  the The Defense and the Armed Forces Act should be carefully  examined from all angles. It is better for us to continue to  work with the existing law to give time to precisely formulate  the new legislative material. I do not want to commit myself to  making a personal assessment of the bill that has been  submitted, because I am the proposer. In any case, we cannot  influence the politicians and legislators regarding their  priorities. On the other hand, this issue has begun to be  interpreted too much on a personal level, and for this reason I  prefer to make no comment.    [Kardanov] The National Security Commission is doing  everything possible to speed up the ordering of all the  amendments and proposals connected with the defense and armed  forces bill, so they can be passed on to the Legislative  Commission and reach the parliament voting stage more quickly.    [Aleksandrov] Yes, it is true that the National Security  Commission is well advanced with preparing all the passages of  the bill, but nevertheless one should not be in too much of a  hurry, so as to avoid having to pass a new law in a year or two.    [Kardanov] Minister Aleksandrov, even if the defense and  armed forces bill, which is supposed to provide the legislative  basis for the democratic reform in the Armed Forces, is delayed,  at least the Law on the Consultative Council on National  Security was passed. Are you satisfied with the work of this  supreme body, which is supposed to coordinate the efforts of all  the country's institutions that are concerned with national  security?    [Aleksandrov] Yes, I have twice attended sessions of the  council and I can say that both times they debated important  issues of national security that had a positive effect. This  gives me good reason to hope that it will also continue to do  useful and constructive work in the future.</p>

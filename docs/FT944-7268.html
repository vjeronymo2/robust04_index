			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Letters to the Editor: EU confused on TV ownership Sir, Your Brussels correspondent's reminder that the UK government still has the power under clause 13 of the Industry Act to prevent foreign takeovers of UK manufacturers underlines the inconsistency of policies which have a European dimension ('Brussels tests Britain's power to block foreign takeovers', November 18). It is ironic that the European Commission should be concerned to remove what it regards as an anomaly - which, so far as I know, has never been invoked - while at the same time allowing an unbelievably confused pattern of media ownership rules to apply throughout the European Union. Manufacturing industry may be a theoretical no-go area for Britain's leading EU partners, though BMW and others seem to have been unaware of this. However, the broadcasting industry, one of Britain's growing international businesses, stands wide open to foreign takeovers. The 1990 Broadcasting Act permits 100 per cent ownership of an ITV company by any European organisation. That makes the current UK commercial television ownership rules unique in Europe. It is impossible for a British company to acquire 100 per cent of a television station in any other part of Europe. National regulations vary, but the thrust of them, particularly in main markets such as Germany, France and Italy, is to make it impossible for a UK company to gain total control. Media ownership rules should be consistent throughout the EU, and the Commission should concentrate on this issue rather than concerning itself with an unused clause of the Industry Act.

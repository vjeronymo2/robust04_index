			<p>940114 FT  14 JAN 94 / Yeltsin may speed up reform of economy The process of Russia's economic reform will continue unabated and might even be stepped up, President Boris Yeltsin promised President Bill Clinton in Moscow yesterday. Reporting on the first session between the Russian and US presidents, their third meeting in the past nine months, Mr Warren Christopher, the US secretary of state, said Mr Yeltsin was clearly 'undeterred' by the political turmoil in Russia. He said Mr Clinton had found his opposite number 'confident' and 'on top of his form'. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the treasury secretary, highlighted what he described as 'the real achievements' of the reform process - such as a reduction in the monthly rate of inflation from 30 per cent to 12 per cent, the trebling of real wages as measured in dollars, and the halving of the budget deficit as a percentage of national output. Mr Clinton, under the slogan 'more reform, more support', promised to press the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to release funds 'as rapidly as possible' to ensure that the reform momentum was maintained. He said he was willing to act as an advocate with international financial institutions for any subsequent Russian proposals to alleviate the social costs of reform. His advice to Mr Yeltsin was that there should be 'no turning back' in the fight against inflation, and no letting up in privatisation. He also announced a second US enterprise fund, capit - alised at Dollars 100m (Pounds 67m), to be directed by Mr Michael Blumenthal, former treasury secretary. In return, Mr Yeltsin disclosed that he intended to retain the privatisation minister, Mr Anatoly Chubais. That follows another threat by the reform group led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, first deputy prime minister, to pull out of the cabinet en masse if reformers did not get more government posts. Mr Yeltsin has agreed to expand the number of deputy prime ministers from four, as announced this week, to five. Mr Gaidar and Mr Oleg Soskovets, also a first deputy premier, are said to be certain to be confirmed in their present posts - with the two further deputy premiers still the focus of intense backroom struggles between the different political forces. The fate of Mr Boris Fyodorov, the reform-minded deputy prime minister for finance, remained in doubt. He has said he will not serve if conservatives such as Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, the central bank head, are retained, as seems likely. Both Mr Gaidar and Mr Chubais met the US delegation but no meeting with Mr Gerashchenko was scheduled. Also not invited to a reception at the US embassy last night was Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the ultra-nationalist leader, whom Mr Christopher described as 'unfit' to meet the US president. Mr Zhirinovsky said Russia had no need of help from the US. Most of Mr Clinton's first day in Moscow was devoted to economic matters. Russia clouds reform path, Page 2</p>

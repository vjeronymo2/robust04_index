			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POSITIVE NOTES COME FROM MUSIC CLASSES  </P> <P> The statistics in your article on music education horrified me ("Music in  Schools: A Sour Note," Part A, Jan. 17).  </P> <P> Plato said, "I would teach the children physics and philosophy and music -- and  of those, music is the most important, for the key to all learning lies in the  patterns of the arts."  </P> <P> The most important thing kids get from music education isn't music. It's the  realization that you can start out with no skills whatsoever and if you stick  to it without judging yourself, you can accomplish almost anything!  </P> <P> That knowledge -- that personal power cannot be acquired while sitting and  watching television.  </P> <P> All studies show that consistent music training improves reading ability, math  skills, attendance, attitude and even posture!  </P> <P> In many parts of the country, I find that our kids are musically illiterate,  but in the areas that treasure their bands and choruses (like Texas and  Minnesota), the youngsters consider their music to be the most exciting  experience of their lives.  </P> <P> Only parental interest and parental pressure on school boards make the  difference.  </P> <P> SHARI LEWIS  </P> <P> Beverly Hills  </P></p>

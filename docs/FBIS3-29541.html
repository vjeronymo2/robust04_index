			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Tokyo, Feb. 18 KYODO -- Japan will seek support on  its economic efforts and call for reaffirming an accord on  stable currency rates at a Group of Seven (G-7) industrial  nations' meeting in Germany February 26, Finance Minister  Hirohisa Fujii said Friday [18 February].    "I will explain the direction of tax reforms" at the G-7  meeting of finance ministers and central bankers, Fujii told  reporters after a morning cabinet meeting. He was referring to  reported U.S. dissatisfaction over Japan's income tax cuts  limited to a single year.    Fujii noted that Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa instructed  his ministers at the cabinet meeting to pin down efforts in  realizing tax reform by the end of the year, as agreed to by the  ruling coalition parties. "That (agreement) spells out a  balanced tax system on income and consumption," Fujii stressed,  indicating a direction for full-fledged income tax cuts.    He also said he would "strongly insist" that Japan's record  15.25 trillion yen stimulus package, including 6 trillion yen in  tax cuts, would contribute to lifting the economy.    On currency exchange rates, Fujii expressed his intention to  call for reaffirmation of a past G-7 accord that calls for  cooperation to stem speculative moves and keep rates stable  under economic fundamentals. "Wild volatility is bad not only  for a country but for the global economy," Fujii noted.    Fujii brushed aside speculation that U.S. monetary  authorities intend to tolerate the yen's rise, saying, "I don't  know about other U.S. officials but I haven't heard any such  remarks by the monetary authorities."    Regarding the Japan-U.S. "Framework" trade talks, the U.S.  side "seems to be misunderstanding" the insurance area, Fujii  said, noting that Japan must make further explanation. Japan  will continue to take deregulatory and other measures in the  insurance field, and they will be specified in a detailed  program to be launched at the G-7 meeting.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura on Thursday told  reporters that Hosokawa will hold a cabinet meeting to discuss  Japan's measures in reducing the trade imbalance.    On possible U.S. sanctions against Japan, Fujii said  although  Hosokawa and Clinton failed to reach agreement on the framework  talks during their February 11 meeting, they did agree to  maintain "basic friendship relations."    "This must not be destroyed," he said.</p>

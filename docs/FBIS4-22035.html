			<p>BFN     [Text] During the most recent National Security Council  [NSC] meeting, which was to be devoted to the economic package,  the latest political and military developments in Greece, South  Cyprus, Bosnia, and Macedonia were also discussed. It was  reported that the Balkan developments were discussed in  connection with the internal problems of Turkey. In particular,  it was concluded that Greece "is intensifying its policy of  exploiting the Kurdish problem to weaken Turkey." [passage  omitted]  <H5>  PKK Promised Government in Exile </H5>   In addition to the international developments, the NSC  meeting also discussed Greece's support for the PKK. It  reportedly examined allegations that the PKK's anti-tourism  bombings in Turkey are being planned in south Cyprus. A report  submitted to the NSC states that the PKK has been promised it  can open official missions in Athens and south Nicosia, and that  they will open soon. The report adds that the Greek government  has promised the PKK it can establish "a government in exile"  in Athens or Nicosia.    Reportedly Turkey will be making preparations to counter  these developments in the coming days.    The NSC feels that intervention in Greece would not elicit a  strong reaction from the West.    An NSC expert pointed out that a crisis with Greece would  promote national reconciliation inside Turkey.</p>

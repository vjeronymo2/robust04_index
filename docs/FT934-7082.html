			<p>931122 FT  22 NOV 93 / Hosokawa wins respite in battle on market access Japan's government has won a breathing space to press ahead with its political reforms before it faces more US pressure to open its markets and stimulate its economy. US officials are increasingly convinced that Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, Japan's prime minister, is bringing real change to his country's political system, and are willing to wait until he can win this battle in the Japanese parliament before pressing their demands for access to the Japanese market. President Bill Clinton, fresh from a bruising struggle to win congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement, sympathises with Mr Hosokawa's political difficulties. 'The president clearly sees political reform as Hosokawa's Nafta,' a senior administration official said, echoing Mr Hosokawa who said the next legislative hurdle, in the upper house, for his reform plans would be just as difficult as the Nafta debate was in the US. US officials insisted they were not disappointed that the bilateral meeting had yielded no specific progress either on opening the Japanese rice market or on the additional measures to stimulate economic growth that the US believes Japan should undertake. Mr Clinton said he hoped the two countries would over the coming months take action to boost the world economy. 'By next June or July, certainly by a year from now, I believe that the responsibilities of the United States and Japan to do more to promote global economic growth will have been in large measure advanced,' he said. Mr Hosokawa, however, said later that he had no idea what Mr Clinton was talking about. Senior US administration officials said they still believed further stimulus to demand in the Japanese economy would be timely, but said there could be no question of the US trying to dictate to Japan the size or timing of a tax cut or tax reform programme. Progress on bilateral trade issues is unlikely to materialise until the days before Mr Clinton and Mr Hosokawa next meet on February 11. 'The pattern historically is that change occurs at the eleventh hour. We will have to see if the three key areas of procurement, insurance and automobiles yield concrete results or not,' a senior administration official said. But Mr Hosokawa repeated Japan's opposition to setting numerical targets for foreign market shares, and insisted that the bilateral trade talks could not be a one-way street. 'We will do our best with regard to market access, but efforts will have to be made on the US side to improve its competitiveness,' Mr Hosokawa said.</p>

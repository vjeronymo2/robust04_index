			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [News conference by President Leonid Kravchuk with </F> unidentified reporters at Borispil Airport in Kiev on 14 January  -- recorded]    [Text] [Reporter] Can you say if the document that was  signed by the three presidents in the Kremlin today will have to  be ratified by the Ukrainian parliament? Will it help resolve  the issue of disarmament in general, both in Europe and on CIS  territory? Is this primarily a new step or not? Third, to what  extent will it help Ukraine's economy?    [Kravchuk] The document is a continuation of the Ukrainian  Supreme Council resolutions. If you recall, the reservations  that it put forth were about compensation for tactical and  strategic nuclear weapons, their technical maintenance,  financial and technical aid, and security guarantees. These,  approximately, were the main reservations of the Supreme  Council. When you read that document, and it will be published,  you will find that all of those demands were met. In other  words, we can positively state that the executive branch has not  been acting contrary to the Supreme Council resolutions but  acting toward fulfilling the reservations put forth by the  Supreme Council. I would like to emphasize this fact so that no  one thinks, as some try to imply, that the president and the  parliament were following their own separate courses. We did  satisfy the reservations. I said in the past -- and I am  confirming it now -- that we must join the Nuclear  Nonproliferation Treaty. This is my deep conviction, because  everyone has already joined it -- Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan,  and 131 countries. This is a normal step for Ukraine. This is  why I hope that when we inform our parliament about our actions  since December... [pauses] a very difficult time for Ukraine,  which had to withstand pressure from all over the world. Not  everyone understood our steps, not everyone understood our  actions and there were grounds for this. This, I think, is a  matter of principle. Now about your question as to who this  document will serve. Both the talks with the U.S. President in  Kiev and the trilateral talks have confirmed one irrefutable  truth -- problems can be resolved only on the path of  compromises and agreements. No reservations, no guarantees  expressed in documents or agreements or declarations or anything  else will be realized if one or another state follows the policy  of confrontation instead of compromise. If, for instance,  Ukraine... [pauses] now they say that Ukraine has been brought  to its knees. This is absurd. First, Ukraine has come out of  the situation with credit. We will be compensated and given  assistance; we will be respected politically and in other ways.  If we had opposed the adopted course and stood in the way of  nuclear disarmament -- and it was anticipated -- if Ukraine had  failed to fulfill its obligations, it would have blocked the  further development of nuclear disarmament. It would have  blocked it. START II depends on the resolution of the START I  issue. I hope that there will be START III as well, and the  final goal will be achieved in the total dismantling of nuclear  weapons on our planet. Thus, Ukraine, having resolved this  issue, unblocked nuclear disarmament for the whole world, for  all of humanity. By taking this step Ukraine testified to the  fact that there are no separate paths for Ukraine -- it follows  the path of civilization and all human interest. This is the  main issue for all the European and world community. By taking  this step we have raised Ukraine's political prestige and image,  we have confirmed that Ukraine's policies are predictable.    Finally, there is one more point. Whatever they might say,  there is an arrangement of forces in the world, an arrangement  along political lines. And today, great powers are standing as  the cornerstones of these forces and lines, including the United  States of America. Relations among states develop depending on  the influence made by these great powers. Whether one likes it  or not, that's the way it is. Ambitions are out of place here.  This is not a policy but just the basic way of thinking. If we  -- contrary to the world's civilized development -- failed to  accept compromises...[pauses] it does not mean that we have been  humiliated; we have compromised, but the other party has also  made compromises. Thus, we established normal relations.    Let us imagine that Ukraine opposes the good will of other  states, the good will of the world-wide development of nuclear  disarmament, and the interests of the world states. However,  not just their interests, but the common interests of mankind --  nuclear disarmament. This is important, because we can take  into account the interests of the state. However, it will not  coincide with the interests of mankind.    What will be the international opinion of Ukraine? We, three  presidents, of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia -- have  reached an agreement and solved the issue in a civilized manner,  in line with the reservations and the interests of the people of  Ukraine. There are also economic perspectives opening for us;  this was mentioned by President Clinton in Kiev. In other  words, Ukraine is seen as a state that took those brakes off,  enabling cooperation with the United States, with international  financial organizations, and with Russia. Our acting prime  minister, Yukhym Leonidovych Zvyahilskyy, and Defense Minister  Radetskyy met today with their Russian counterparts and resolved  a wide range of specific issues. Because, this [as heard] is the  main barrier. Why is it the main barrier? Take for example,  the military and technical side of the whole matter. We have  nuclear weapons that we inherited, but we do not produce.  Everyone, who understands at least something about this is  aware that we are not capable of servicing them, providing  maintenance. We just cannot keep them as a heavy burden on our  shoulders. We cannot maintain them with due responsibility for  our future and the future of our neighbors and all mankind.  This has been proven by specialists and by everyone. Those who  do not understand this are the ones who do not want to.    Who is servicing nuclear weapons today? Russia. Well, when  the president of Russia says: If you want to have nuclear  weapons, why should we service them? He is right, is he not?  This is a military and technical aspect. Further, look at the  aspect of the use of nuclear weapons. Everybody knows it, and  our minister said this, that some time in 1999 the service life  of the nuclear weapons would expire. Excuse me, I am telling  the entire nation that no reservations, no resolutions or edicts  will prevent [as heard] the president, the defense minister, or  the government when the service life of these horrible weapons  expires. We are obliged to remove them because they are more  dreadful than all the Chernobyl-type accidents taken together.  And those people who accuse the executive authority today --  they either do not understand this or take advantage so as to  confirm their particular policy, their particular course.    There is yet another aspect. Take, for example, most  superficial things. They say that recoding is possible, that  something can be done to retain the nuclear arsenal as a  deterrent. First, when it comes to the issue of recoding, it  cannot be an abstract code. A question arises: Who is to be  given the new code? Well, you ask those extreme forces -- they  will tell you who -- I do not want to repeat the words. But the  one who is to be given the new code -- will he wait until we  finish recoding? What if someone would like it to be done,  suddenly?    Second, nuclear weapons require a nuclear industry. Without  it these are not nuclear weapons. If all this is summed  up...[pauses] and also it is necessary to have testing grounds  to carry out tests. We do not have these. There is a whole  complex of problems facing Ukraine.    The situation can be assessed as follows: We have nuclear  weapons. You do not touch us because if you come and do  something suddenly, they can explode spontaneously, therefore  you risk dying, together with us. In other words, this is an  inhuman act. We have a dangerous thing in our hands which may  explode. If it explodes and an opponent dies, it is his  business, he himself makes his way to such an end. But he wants  millions of people to die, our neighbors included. Who can put  up with this? Who can regard this as normal? I cannot stop  wondering if this is a political game, if this is an election  game -- one can understand this somehow. But it is necessary to  sit down at a table, place facts here and facts there. If these  are facts they are facts. But if these are mere words and  appeals, and deception of the people who experienced the  Chernobyl catastrophe -- who knows what it is -- if these are  attempts to put our people in jeopardy, presenting the people of  the young state -- which is just in the making -- as a monster  to the whole world, so that they would not recognize it in  Europe and the world. This is not serious. This is why I think  that this is our political, economic, humanistic victory.    This is our victory. Not mine, not Ukraine's but our common  victory. The victory of Ukraine, Russia, the United States of  America, the victory of the entire world. If we all maintain  friendship and normal relations with Russia and the United  States and others, we will have our guarantees. But to oppose  this, and exhibiting our high ambitions and proceeding from  postulates having nothing to do with the understanding of the  situation may be dangerous.    I am happy with one matter: Those particularly vocal about  this are a minority and they demonstrate their total ignorance,  and second, presenting themselves as patriots they, as a matter  of fact, do not help Ukraine with their actions, to put it  mildly.    [Reporter, HOLOS UKRAYINY newspaper] Leonid Makarovych, I  have a question. The answer to it concerns many people: Will  our state's national security be consolidated after today's  signing [of the trilateral agreement]? If so, what changes for  the better can be expected?    [Kravchuk] It will be consolidated in the following aspect:  We have already experienced a completely different attitude  toward Ukraine--from Russia, for example. You have seen a  different attitude toward us by the United States during the  U.S. President's visit. I also have reports that NATO countries  have come to understand Ukraine after receiving the bit of  information which we still have to think over today. This way,  the international environment and our neighbors have accepted  Ukraine as a state that does not want evil but wants to live in  friendship, partnership, and cooperation with other countries.  This is the first point. Second, you understand that it is an  illusion to say that the weapons we have owned were a deterrent.  I have already told you about this deterrence; this is just a  danger of deterrence rather than the deterrent. Because we are  unable to produce, operate, restore, or service them--because we  have nothing: neither industry nor testing grounds--what kind of  deterrence can we talk about? This is an illusion of  deterrence, but it was hammered into people's heads. The  weapons have not been a guarantee of security, but a source of  threat--and not only to Ukraine. This way, having won support  from certain people and states, including powerful states, we  have obtained security. Security does not mean signed  documents. You know how many pacts have already been signed in  history, how many other documents have been signed. However,  they have been insufficient because a state policy has been  against what has been signed. We want our policy to be  implemented in real terms, in line with our civilized and  anticipated concept, which has been approved. I am convinced  that we have obtained security and opened the path to economic  cooperation. We have also achieved a state's image. We have  acted in line with our Supreme Council, and I am convinced that  the majority of the people of Ukraine want this.    [Reporter] At the recent news conference with Moldovan  President Snegur you said something like this: The danger  coming from the revanchist forces in Russia has increased. If  such factors in the policy of our neighbor dominate, how do you  think the signed agreement can be fulfilled and what mechanism  of ensuring our national security do you see as the head of  state?    [Kravchuk] Well, first, I said this a little differently. I  said I felt anxiety. [passage indistinct] However, the words  danger and anxiety have subtle differences in connotation.  Danger means that this is somewhere here... [pauses] As far as  anxiety is concerned, it is known to me, and every person must  feel it when complicated processes are under way. However, I  will repeat that this is not a state policy but a political  trend. Political trends have occurred in history, you know  about that. Let us take the last 300 years, and we will find  different trends in all spheres of social life: spiritual and  political spheres, and this is a normal democratic phenomenon.  However, such a tendency must not become a state policy. To  prevent this, we must cooperate first of all with Russia. There  are 205 million of us in Russia and Ukraine. Difficult processes  are under way in our country too. One should not attribute them  only to Russia. They are everywhere. Revanchists, nationalists,  national patriots reveal themselves everywhere; they are coming  out, because such is the time now. Let us prevent them from  standing in the way of progressive development. This is a  democratic way. However, to prevent this from becoming a state  policy is our responsibility and our common concern. When we  say that we have signed an agreement by three presidents today,  this speaks volumes. Normal cooperation begins from this point:  politically, economically, and spiritually. Those forces that  today are in opposition will remain there. Opposition must  exist, and there is nothing scary about this. However, one must  not allow aggressiveness, and antipeople, antihumanitarian  moods, hidden under patriotism, to dominate in society. We must  not allow this. That is to say, I feel anxiety but I also have  hope, because 14 January is a new page of understanding our  problems, and a page comprised of new steps. I believe that  these steps are aimed against what makes all of us apprehensive.    [Reporter] At a brief news conference today the President  of the United States of America noted that by signing the  documents Ukraine has acquired...[pauses] has become more  influential, has acquired more significance among countries of  the world, and that many states will now cooperate with Ukraine.  Moreover, Kostikov, press secretary of Russian President Boris  Yeltsin, informed journalists that Great Britain is supposedly  giving us security guarantees already. Is this true?    [Kravchuk] Great Britain has given us security guarantees  previously, but they were not formalized [ne oformleni]. You  remember when I visited Great Britain: In the treaty I signed  with the prime minister of Great Britain, it was noted that  Great Britain--I do not remember the exact formula [word  indistinct] -- grants Ukraine guarantees from the point of view  of national security. However, this was an abstract formula.  Now, the interpretation in the documents we signed is that both  Great Britain and France I hope, and others will join in with  this. But I want to repeat: Life is life. There are our  hopes, opinions, our philosophical understanding of life in this  world and society, but there are also practical actions. If we  act practically and in an understandable way, we will in the end  understand ourselves. I see that we take many steps that are  difficult to explain. I will frankly say that December was  possibly the most difficult time in our life for Ukraine,  because the issue was real, not ephemeral or illusionary. The  issue was the real international isolation of Ukraine, and this  meant... I do not even want to use these words. But, for  example, under a slogan of ultrapatriotism, all this is  forgotten and people are deceived that Ukraine can survive in  isolation or confrontation, or by conducting a policy aimed  against states [word indistinct] and the interests of mankind.  This is the truth, and everyone knows it. Excuse me, not  everyone. Those who want to know -- know this. Those who do  not want to know, or those who know but think differently, will  never understand anyone. Due to that, this is what I believe.    [Reporter] Mr. President, you used the words abstract  formula  to describe the agreement (?and so on). However, the statement  saying that we have gained friends such as the United States and  Russia also sounds abstract. Will you specify how those  agreements you signed in Moscow guarantee Ukraine's security.    [Kravchuk] First, let us put it this way. It is precisely  noted that Russia and Ukraine [as heard] respect territorial  integrity, the inviolability of borders, sovereignty, and  independence of Ukraine. They respect and support Ukraine's  independence, and this was stated by President Clinton. He  always begins his speeches with the statement that Ukraine's  independence is an important element of U.S. foreign policy.  This is the first point. The second one is: If we join the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, those guarantees will acquire a  more specific, I would say precise, nature, since today we are  an undefined state. We have inherited nuclear weapons. We can  neither use nor handle them, and I have talked about this, but  we have not joined the treaty. What do we really want? Do we  want to proliferate them or sell them? What do we want? The  treaty has been joined by 131 countries. We must join the  treaty. Then, the guarantees will acquire real meaning.  Because they might ask us: Why do you want guarantees if you  are a nuclear state? You can attack someone, not be attacked.  This is an illusion, a nonsense that has developed in  political... [pauses] I would say that this is political  dualism, of which everyone is sick and tired. Only one who  never wants to see anything does not see this. This is the  point. Therefore, it is noted there. Additionally, an entire  chapter was devoted to the economic situation, which gives  Ukraine a real opportunity to join Europe's economic structure,  including with Russia--(?no, not including)--but in the east  with Russia, and with other states. An economic space is  opening up, an international financial space. We are received  as a state that fulfills its obligations, which were announced,  by the way, during its independence. I would say that it is not  prestigious for a state to jump from one point to another, even  more so, in such a delicate and global sphere as nuclear  (?weapons).    [UNIAN correspondent] Do you think Ukraine, the United  States, and Russia put a different value, I mean material value,  on the nuclear weapons, which again will bring up the issue of  disarmament?    [Kravchuk] I do not think so. The United States, Ukraine,  and Russia will conduct a joint examination. In addition, we  already have international estimates on this. This is in no way  a new thing. Let us say, each kilogram of uranium, its quality,  there are evaluations, then, subtract the cost for enrichment of  uranium, and it will be all taken into account. Given the  mutual desire, I see no problems here. We said the following: We  fulfill our obligations and you fulfill your obligations. If  one party stops fulfilling its obligations, then the other party  automatically stops fulfilling its part. I said this plainly.  According to the agreement, we, for example, withdraw strategic  nuclear weapons, 200 warheads, then we automatically receive  compensation and the compensation for the tactical nuclear  weapons. If someone somewhere begins to manipulate, we will  publish a relevant statement that we are being deceived, let us  speak plainly. However, I hope that under the current consensus  of three presidents -- and what we achieved -- three presidents  have signed this agreement -- when I spoke with the U.S.  leadership they said: Mr. President, we put our honor at  stake; we put the authority of a great world power at stake.  For us, it was the most important thing -- exactly what we were  pressing for. Not because we do not trust Russia. Complex  processes are going on in Russia, both political and economic  ones, just like here. So we should reckon with the  possibilities of collisions and problems. But this is the state  today that can be a guarantor, both for us and Russia. We have  entered this system of thinking, this system of creating, this  system of understanding, which [word indistinct] for the benefit  of Ukraine.    [Correspondent] What is the term for the withdrawal of  nuclear weapons and what is the compensation for the strategic  and tactical nuclear weapons? In addition, are our debts for  oil and gas to be canceled?    [Kravchuk] There are two constituents of this issue. The  question of tactical nuclear weapons will soon be examined by  experts from the United States, Russia, and Ukraine; they will  evaluate the price, taking into account the (?weight) of what  was transferred by us in 1991-92, and afterward we will  determine the forms of compensation. Our debts will be taken  into account, too. Compensation for strategic nuclear weapons  has been determined long ago. The nuclear weapons will be  withdrawn, say, these 200 warheads, their weight taken into  account, and Ukraine will receive heat-generating elements for  nuclear power plants. That is, we agreed as follows: We  estimate that we will be secured... [pauses] for four or five  years, will we not? [Kravchuk asks some of his aides] Thus, we  will have free uranium for our power plants over a period of  seven years. You should understand how important our power  engineering is for us... [pauses] All this will be determined on  the basis of the strict evaluations which will take into account  our experience, as well as world experience. The term of the  withdrawal will be adjusted depending on our capabilities. I  have informed you that in 1999 the service life of all our  warheads will come to an end. Is that so? [one of Kravchuk's  aides replies "Yes"] [18 second passage indistinct] (?I would  not have signed it) if the Supreme Council, say, (?does not now)  ratify it [words indistinct]. I do not know. The service life  of warheads [words indistinct] is coming up in March. And I  know that the unforeseen could occur (?here) -- for Ukraine and  for the world. (?So am I) going to look at this document? If I  do not [word indistinct] it today, then I will be told tomorrow  -- you work it out yourself. What sort of a state will we be in  then? And who will understand us? What sort of civilized state  and country, which (?like a savage) [words indistinct]. It is a  terrible thing that our country brandishes its weapons and has  no idea what to do with them. I am terrified to listen to some  of our politicians who know nothing about politics, who do not  want to know anything and do not want to take heed of anyone,  and are driven only by their ambitions. Let me now read you a  verse written by one of the members of the Ukrainian delegation  wishing our country all the best. I will not name the author  (?until afterwards). [Words indistinct] has written this verse.  I want to speak about that [word indistinct], that spiritual,  about that climate, which existed here when people could see  that they had done something good for the state, for Ukraine.  They did not give in, nor (?bend down), nor get down on their  knees. When all were equal [words indistinct] it is obvious  when someone is telling the truth and when [words indistinct]  [Kravchuk reads the verse]    It is good. [words indistinct]. Normal people understand  what has happened now. A page has been turned. A page of new  thinking has been turned, a new attitude toward Ukraine. And if  we act consistently, this page will be filled with [word  indistinct] words. The main thing is that Ukraine has not [as  heard] started on the road of the great desire of mankind -- to  get rid of nuclear weapons. (?It was wanted all the time) that  it becomes a brake and enters history just in this way. And  those politicians, who are now shouting something different, let  them listen to those people. I wish you all the best.</p>

			<p><P> November 29, 1990, Thursday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA;  </P> <P> THEATER-RESTAURANT COMPLEX ADVANCES  </P> <P> The Planning Commission has approved construction of an eight-screen movie  theater and two restaurants on Beach Boulevard south of Imperial Highway.  </P> <P> Also included in the plan are several retail stores, bringing the total  development to nearly 140,000 square feet, said John C. Penz of Hughes  Investments, which is working with Chevron Land Development Co. on the project.  </P> <P> One restaurant will be of the "sit-down" variety, and the other will be a  3,500-square-foot drive-through restaurant, Penz said.  </P> <P> Resident Joseph Abbate, whose property is opposite the proposed theater, spoke  against the development. The Coyote Creek flood channel lies between the  proposed development and Abbate's back yard, Penz said. Abbate's home rests on  land that is about 30 feet higher than the Chevron property and 160 feet from  the proposed theater building.  </P> <P> Penz agreed with Abbate's complaint that the roof of the theater would be at  ground level for the homeowners, but he told the Planning Commission that the  company intends to build a quality development. Residents will have 10 days to  appeal the commission's decision.  </P> <P> The development is a scaled-down version of one approved by the commission last  year, Penz said. The new plan calls for one-third less square footage than the  one approved in January, 1989. DAVID F. BURKE  </P></p>

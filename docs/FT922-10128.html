			<p>920502 FT  02 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A hive of industry in a decaying urban landscape - Nick Garnett visits a mill where small companies have replaced the weavers THE late-morning, mid-week train chugs out of Leeds on its slow journey across the Pennines to Manchester. Linking a city of 500,000 with a conurbation of over 2m, the two-car rattler has no First Class. Maybe there is no need. Not one businessman seems to be riding it. Populated by locals on low incomes, Romanian running shoes, Korean windcheaters, children clutching cola and crisps, the train descends into the valley bowl which Bradford inhabits. The valley side is a landscape of urban blight, the occasional neat and healthy looking structure poking up from a mess of derelict mills, rotting house terraces and wide expanses of wasteland. A sign of a local economy too weak to support the city? Certainly. A slice of what is a national scandal of inner city decay? Probably. If it was in eastern Germany it would be number one on the reconstruction list. The rail bus reverses out of the bowl, bores its way through a long hill tunnel and trundles down into another hollow in which Halifax spreads out along the river Calder. Like Bradford, the town has endured the blows of industrial decline. But it has generated a response unique in Yorkshire. In a complex of once defunct industrial buildings, business life has been seeping back. The former Crossley carpet mill, with its italianate towers, was built in 1857 and was Europe's biggest carpet factory, several high blocks spread over 35 acres and encompassing 1.25m square feet of covered space. Dean Clough, as it is known, was finally closed in 1982. Now it houses 200 organisations including many small businesses. 'During the recession we've had no failures but there's a bit of luck in that,' says Ernest Hall, owner of the complex. Prince Charles has visited Dean Clough and thinks it is wonderful. So how have these little companies been doing and what is exercising their owners' minds? 'I've been a Conservative voter all my life but I would have voted for someone else in the general election if there had been anyone else worth voting for,' says Ian Jickells. 'They have done absolutely nothing for small businesses. It really annoys me.' Jickells' company, JI Electronics, designs and makes control equipment, used mainly in monitoring coal-fired boilers. Jickells is 38 and has no higher education training in electronics or engineering - a lack of formal qualifications seemingly prevalent among Dean Clough's businesses. Nevertheless, JI Electronics, started seven years ago, now employs seven. It turned over Pounds 160,000 in the year to April 1991 on which it made a pre-tax return of Pounds 40,000. Sales, though, slid by a third in the past year. The condition of British schools really upsets Jickells. 'We see the state of them. There is one in central Scotland where one boiler has literally burnt out and the other is just hanging on. Heaven knows what would happen if that went.' School buildings have been allowed to rot too far, he says. However, Jickells detects an upswing. 'It was like somebody switching on a light. It picked up about four or five months ago.' One reason he says is that local authorities are slipping back into the market for new equipment. Jickells is unimpressed with aid agencies. 'We've given up looking for outside help. You lose more in time and money looking for it than you would gain. There are too many agencies and too many people offering false promises.' For many small businesses, mark-ups on luxury goods and services can run from a 100 per cent to 300 per cent, partly because a lot of small scale garden designers, picture framers and frock sellers now seek a country cottage and Audi lifestyle. So the customer must pay. But some businesses operate in areas where the movement of prices is rapidly downwards, so they need to run faster just to stand still. Soft Options Computer Systems, set up in 1985, sells computer 'solutions' and hardware to a wide range of customers. 'Three years ago it would have been normal to pay perhaps Pounds 2,000 for a personal computer. Now such a machine is Pounds 900,' says Tony Capuano, general manager. 'So if you are working on a 20 per cent margin, profits are much less. You have to fight for every shilling. I keep saying things cannot get cheaper - and then someone will knock Pounds 200 off the price of a box (computer kit). It looks as if it will get tighter and tighter until something gives." Soft Options, with a yearly turnover of Pounds 900,000, is trying to meet this challenge by putting together its own computer kits from components brought from UK wholesalers of Taiwanese and US products, and by diversifying. Sales of systems for electronic point of sales have held up well. The company has low borrowings and an overdraft facility of just Pounds 25,000. 'If we can't afford it we don't buy it. We're in credit more than debit." Dramatic shifts in fortunes have swept over Tee Jay Workwear, which manufactures boiler suits, warehouse coats and other gear for the workplace. The company was set up in the late 1970s and moved to Dean Clough six years ago. Turnover fell from Pounds 400,000 in 1988 to Pounds 200,000 last year. The workforce slid from 35 to 11. 'We were scraping the bottom of the barrel,' says Jackie Dodd, co-owner of the company with her husband, Trevor. Since then trade has picked up remarkably, Trevor says, with turnover expected to be close to Pounds 400,000 again this year. Employment is back to between 20 and 25 machinists - the Dodds are not sure of the exact number. What has caused the comeback? 'I wish I knew. I don't,' Trevor says. However, companies such as Sketchley Overalls are buying more than they were a year ago. Since leaving his job as a materials cutter for a large workwear maker, in the mid-1970s, Trevor Dodd has never attended a business course. 'I haven't had the time.' Profits were Pounds 20,000 three years ago, but the company turned in losses for the past two years. Tee Jay workers are paid an hourly rate of Pounds 2.65. Trevor says the average (with bonuses) is Pounds 3.50. The thing that worries him most is the even lower wages paid in other countries. 'All I seem to see in the market in Halifax is clothing made in Yugoslavia or Poland.' Gordon Pinder, a former salesman for Unilever, set up a general artwork company in the mid-1980s: Design It now rolls up a yearly turnover of Pounds 170,000. On this it makes a return of about 30 per cent, including salaries for the company's two other employees, wife Betty and son Martin. The company runs a small Mercedes and a BMW. None of the family took formal training in design work. but customers include Carlsberg and Thomson Holidays. A lot of business comes from the entertainment industry, such as the Birmingham Hippodrome and Bradford's theatres. 'Work has come in just as normal through the recession,' Pinder says. 'One reason is, I think, that if business is bad some types of companies advertise more." Cashflow is a headache. 'People are delaying payments. It has got a lot worse in the past six months.' A culture of slow payments is taking root. 'We pay now in 60 days instead of 30. If you can't beat them, join them.' Pinder would like to see legislation on payments. 'If a company did not pay within 30 days you could add an automatic percentage on to the bill and that would be legally enforceable.' Design It does not plan to hire many, if any, staff. 'I wouldn't wish to employ people because I am not a good manager,' Martin Pinder says. Diane and Richard Benton, who run their own cleaning company for offices and factories, Benton Cleaners, faced stiffer competition last year. 'Halifax only had four cleaning companies, but there are now ten, together with the multinationals,' Richard says. 'People were getting redundancy money and thinking they could set up business with a mop and bucket. The market is cut-throat.' At the same time, demand slid. 'New enquiries from industrial sites fell to zero for six months last year,' Diane says. Things are looking better, though. 'It's beginning to pick up quite a bit and we're getting a lot more enquiries.' Benton Cleaners employs 42 part-timers and a managed turnover of Pounds 130,000 last year, on which the pair made a 15 per cent return. 'It makes us an average living. We drive secondhand cars,' Richard says. The Bentons moved from Peterborough and set up the cleaning company six years ago. The age and condition of factories in Halifax came as a shock. 'They were ropey,' Diane says. Offices have improved a lot but, apart from food factories, are there any Halifax production plants the Bentons rate as smart and clean? 'No,' Richard says. Andrew Bonnington, chartered building surveyor, has been delighted with business since starting on his own at Dean Clough two years ago. After leaving Burton's property division, Bonnington did Pounds 36,000 of work in his first year, and this year it will be Pounds 60,000, on which he says he makes a pre-tax return of 65 per cent. The company employs just him and his wife. Valuations for estate agents is the only kind of work he will not do. His main business is advising on building maintenance and refurbishment. A third of his work comes from Dean Clough itself. 'A lot of other surveyors' practices have been laying people off. For many of these, fees still come first and clients second.' Bonnington's hourly rate ranges from Pounds 30 to Pounds 70, plus expenses. Gill Wilson, who owns Manor Properties. found a way of protecting her house-building company by switching in 1990 from entirely speculative construction to custom-built houses. 'We acquire a site, gain planning permission and then start building only when we have a client - and he has a large say in the house's design. We move along like that plot by plot.' The company, which also converts older properties and whose homes sell from Pounds 40,000 to Pounds 500,000, has been given a leg up because other local builders have been wiped out. 'A lot of competitors have been eliminated.' Leslie Smith produces sofa-beds, 'inner tents' for caravans and dormobiles, cushion cases and wax coats. Leslie Smith has recently come back from retirement into the business of the same name, to help out his son, Graham. 'Sales of camping equipment are quite good, but for sofa-beds they're terrible,' Leslie says. The company has been failing to score a profit recently, and last year's sales slithered to Pounds 130,000 from Pounds 200,000 three years ago. Leslie thinks he can help pull the company back into shape. 'You can get despondent as things go on. This feeling comes to a lot of people - but I don't see the point of that.'</p>

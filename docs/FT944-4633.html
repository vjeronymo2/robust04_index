			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / International Company News: A&amp;P slashes payout, takes Dollars 165m charge Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea, the troubled US supermarket group better known as A&amp;P, yesterday slashed its quarterly dividend from 20 cents to 5 cents and announced that it would take an after-tax charge of Dollars 165m in its third quarter to December because of continuing problems with its Canadian operations. It also warned that these actions would make it necessary to seek a renegotiation of its covenants with bank lenders, but said it believed fresh agreements would be achieved on satisfactory terms. The shares closed Dollars 1 down at Dollars 22. A&amp;P, which is 52 per cent owned by Tengelmann, the German food retailer, made net profits of just Dollars 379,000 on sales of Dollars 2.3bn in last year's third quarter. One reason for the poor result was a 14-week strike in its Canadian operations that ended in February this year. Yesterday, the company said its US operating results had shown a strong improvement, but the Canadian operations were still showing substantial losses. As a result, it was taking a third-quarter charge of about Dollars 160m to include the write-off of goodwill, previously recognised tax benefits and certain long-lived assets of its Canadian subsidiary. A&amp;P said it was strengthening its efforts to turn round the Canadian operations.</p>

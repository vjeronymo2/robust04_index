			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Alarming instrument of financial change: A look at corporate concerns over derivatives It has been a disquieting few days for the thousands of corporate treasurers who buy the complex financial instruments called derivatives. Concern over derivatives - instruments that derive their value from that of an underlying asset or financial index - has been mounting after a series of losses involving them at companies and investment funds. This week, it emerged that Bankers Trust, the US bank that pioneered derivatives, has agreed with the supervisors of the New York Federal Reserve to tighten internal controls over its business. The supervisors say that this is not part of a wider crackdown, but want it to be seen as a warning to other banks not to be over-zealous in selling derivatives. Meanwhile, a study published on Monday found that few companies monitor their derivatives risks as expertly as they might. These events are already having an impact on treasurers, who increasingly use financial derivatives at least in a simple form. There can be few boards of directors, or chief executives, who have not sent urgent requests to their finance directors and treasurers to find out what arcane instruments they may have bought, and why. Regulators and politicians have fretted over the rapid growth in derivatives for the past two years; the banks that trade in them have tried to improve their internal risk management systems to avoid unexpected losses. But the burden of concern is now shifting to buyers of derivatives. There are two broad purposes for which companies and other investing funds use derivatives. First is to hedge risks, the reason given by banks in marketing the products. A company that has borrowed at variable interest rates can protect itself against rises in rates by swapping into fixed rate obligations. A similar approach can be adopted to minimise exchange rate risks. Second is the use that has received the most publicity this year, and the one to which derivatives have been put by many fund managers. This is to amplify the effect of bets on the future direction of bond and currency markets. Most well-known cases of derivatives losses this year  - such as those of the US companies Gibson Greetings and Procter &amp; Gamble - have involved such bets on future interest rates. Derivatives can be used to increase potential profits - and losses - of bets by leveraging the sum invested. Investors usually have to pay the full value of a conventional security when they buy it. But most derivative contracts allow them to pay money only when the contracts show a loss, and receive it when they show a profit. This allows a fund to take much bigger positions with the same amount of capital. However, investors do not have to use derivatives to leverage investments, as some recent cases have shown. The paper loss of Dollars 1.5bn on an Dollars 8bn investment fund reported last weekend by Orange County in California was initially suspected to have arisen from buying derivatives. The loss forced the resignation of Mr Robert Citron, its treasurer. In fact, Mr Citron used other forms of leverage, borrowing some Dollars 12bn through securities repurchase agreements, and then buying a type of security that paid a higher investment return as interest rates fell. The securities  -known as 'inverse floating rate notes' - share characteristics with derivatives, but are not in the same category. Mr Citron was taking leveraged investment risk without derivatives. Such cases are used by bankers to argue that derivatives have been unfairly blamed for losses, since they are only one of several ways of making leveraged bets. Some boards of directors have been more worried about their treasuries adopting high-risk investment strategies than whether they use derivatives to do so. A study by the Group of Thirty, a Washington-based group of senior bankers, this week found that managers are now trying to monitor their treasury operations more closely. More now review risk management policies than 18 months ago, when the public debate over the use of derivatives started to grow. Others plan to implement stricter internal controls within the next year, as well as introducing fresh risk management guidelines. But there is a second cause for unease, which applies strongly to derivatives: that even treasuries of companies may not fully understand the risks they are taking. The G30 study found that only 8 per cent of users said they had adopted the 'value at risk' method of calculating how much they stood to lose from market movements when buying derivatives - a method used by sophisticated traders to monitor their portfolios. This has disturbing implications, if companies that think they are using derivatives for hedging purposes find they are taking a much riskier leveraged bet on which the losses could be substantial. The issue will be at the heart of the legal action by Procter &amp; Gamble over a Dollars 200m leveraged interest rate swap it was sold by Bankers Trust. The company argues that it was not given enough information to understand fully the product or the true risks involved. If more users carried out complex tests on derivatives portfolios - such as 'stress tests' showing price movements in conditions of market volatility - it would make it easier to avoid unwanted risks. Not all companies buying derivatives need do so. Some only buy a few, quite simple, products, which means it is unlikely to be worth emulating the risk management models of the biggest banks. But an obstacle for big users that want to improve their risk management is that they cannot get access to banks' privately developed software for valuing derivatives. 'If multinationals are hesitant, it is not lack of goodwill,' says Mr Alexander von Ungern-Sternberg, an executive vice-president of Deutsche Bank. 'They clearly want these tools, and I think it is something that will develop next year.' More information is becoming public. The bank JP Morgan has recently published a database of market volatility that it uses in its own risk models. But few buyers can yet rival the sellers' expertise. Until they do, the latest rash of losses among fund managers and companies is likely to make them even more wary about trusting the word of derivatives dealers over whether they should buy the latest 'perfect hedge'.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Imre Szekeres, executive deputy chairman of </F> the Hungarian Socialist Party, by unidentified reporter in  Budapest -- live]    [Excerpts] [Reporter] [passage omitted] What is your  reaction to the election results so far?    [Szekeres] Naturally, we are pleased that our deputies were  so successful, for this expresses the trust of the voters and  shows that they support not only the general policies of our  party but also our candidates.    [Reporter] The result expected by the Alliance of Free  Democrats [SZDSZ] -- that they would gain enough votes to  counterbalance the Hungarian Socialist Party [MSZP] -- did not  come about.    [Szekeres] Yes, but I do not think this is an important  issue  now. Our stance is very clear: We said between the two rounds  -- and we are saying it now -- that in Hungary a broad-based  coalition government is needed and this does not depend on the  percentage of votes obtained by any one party. There is an  historic opportunity here for the country. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] When will the coalition talks begin?    [Szekeres] [passage omitted] Next week a preliminary  decisionmaking process will start within the MSZP in light of  the election results, which will end at the party's congress on  Saturday. We will decide two things: One, we will have to name  the parties which we envisage as participants in the coalition  talks. Two, we have to name our prime ministerial candidate.    After this, the coalition talks between the parties can  begin. Our goal is that the country should have a government as  soon as possible; by the beginning of July the new government  should be composed and voted in by parliament.    [Reporter] Would you specifically name some parties which  could be counted as coalition partners?    [Szekeres] [passage omitted] I think the SZDSZ and the  Federation of Young Democrats are the two political parties  whose programs are compatible with ours. [passage omitted]    [Reporter] Does the MSZP maintain that the winning party  should name the prime minister?    [Szekeres] I think that logically this is what the situation  dictates, and we will name our candidate at the coalition talks.  However, the government's program has to be settled first at the  talks. [passage omitted]</p>

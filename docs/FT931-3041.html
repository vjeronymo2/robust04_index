			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / The Budget (Government Statements): Interest payable to UK targeted - Tax for Multinationals This section contains details of the government's planned tax changes which were given in separate announcements from the Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and other government departments after the chancellor had made his publication of the Budget details in the Finance Bill. MEASURES will be introduced to charge to tax interest payable within multinational groups to UK companies by non-resident associated companies on certain loans and other forms of debt as it accrues rather than when it arises. The Inland Revenue said in a statement: 'The legislation will apply where the terms of the financial arrangement are such that, in any 12 month period, the amount of interest payable may be less than that accruing pro rata to the lender in the period. These measures will cover all interest accruing from midnight on March 311993, in relation to such debts. 'The chancellor's intention is to bring the charging to UK tax of such interest (or equivalent) more closely into line with that accorded by most of the UK's major trading partners. This will prevent the loss to the exchequer which results from multinational groups using the differences in national tax rules in order to defer UK tax liabilities. 'At present, interest is generally chargeable to tax in the UK when it arises, rather than when it accrues, unless interest is chargeable to tax as a receipt of a trade. Most of the UK's major trading partners tax all interest as it accrues to the lender. Since these countries also tend to give tax relief to a borrower as interest accrues, multinational groups can take advantage of this difference in tax treatment. Tax relief for the interest is obtained by the borrower on an accruals basis but the lender defers his liability to tax on the interest (often for long periods) by being taxed on an arising basis. 'The proposed legislation will apply only to loans or other relevant advances from a UK resident company directly or indirectly to a non-resident associated company. Where a lender can demonstrate both that a main purpose of the loan was not to obtain a tax advantage and that it would have been made by an unrelated party acting at arm's length, the legislation will not apply. 'The provisions will apply to loans and other forms of debt, including deep discount securities and deep gain securities , where all or part of the accruing interest or equivalent becomes payable at intervals in excess of 12 months by being compounded for periods of more than 12 months , rescheduled or otherwise deferred. 'Interest accruing to the lender in an accounting period in respect of loans or other forms of debt covered by this proposed legislation will be treated (to the extent that it is not otherwise already chargeable) as if it had arisen during that accounting period, rather than in the later accounting period in which it actually arises.</p>

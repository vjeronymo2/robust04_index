			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Spain's regional dilemma: OECD warning on high cost of decentralisation THE decentralisation of power to the Spanish regions is costing the country dear and hampering Madrid's efforts to cut the central budget deficit, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). In its report on the Spanish economy, the OECD also warns that the slowdown in economic activity will make it difficult to lower the deficit to a targeted 1.9 per cent of GDP this year as revenues fall and social spending rises. Spain recorded a deficit of 2.5 per cent of GDP last year after budgeting for less than 1 per cent. Spain's 17 autonomous regions were guaranteed new powers under the 1979 Constitution. But in the last four years, says the OECD, the transfer of powers has increased public sector employment in the regions by 31 per cent, or 100,000 people. Despite this, central government employment, which should have been falling, has risen. Rapidly increasing spending by the regions is easily outstripping the rate at which the central government deficit is shrinking. Regional government deficits, which accounted for 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1985, now account for 1.5 per cent. While much of this could be justified, the OECD says, 'there has also been considerable overspending on prestige projects, high salaries (often higher than central government packages), immoderate recruitment and spending to placate local lobbies' - the last referring to heavy spending on loss-making regional public television networks. The report says that growing social welfare commitments from the central budget, especially disability payment (temporary disability expenditure has risen 41 per cent in two years) are probably impossible to reverse in the short term but urges Madrid to make the system more cost-effective. It says there is widespread fraud in the system of invalid pensions and that tax evasion remains high. The declared average income of self-employed business people in 1990 was about 40 per cent lower than that of wage earners. The OECD report will prove useful to the finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, who this year is preparing to attack a wide range of structural rigidities - in the labour markets, the civil service and public sector industries. He is attempting to make the economy more responsive to policy decisions in the run-up to European Monetary Union.</p>

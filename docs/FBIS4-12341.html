			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Riyad Mansur] </F>   [Text] The PLO has called on the U.S. Administration and  the French Government to accurately monitor and control the  Jewish extremist groups in these two countries. The PLO has  also strongly rejected calls by Israeli Police Affairs Minister  Moshe Shahal and the so-called Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert not  to allow Palestinian president Yasir 'Arafat to pray at the  al-Aqsa Mosque. It said such calls are like throwing sand in  ones eyes.    Bassam Abu-Sharif, political adviser to the Palestinian  president, stressed to SAWT AL-SHA'B that the Jewish groups in  the United States and France maintain dangerous links with the  extremist groups in Israel. This, he said, poses a serious  threat to the entire peace process.    Although Abu-Sharif spoke about the Jewish extremists'  threats, he also hinted at the threats posed by the extremist  Palestinian groups which receive support from states opposing  the peace process, and which, openly, seek to foil and obstruct  the current political process.    In the first Palestinian reaction to calls by some Israelis  not to allow 'Arafat to enter al-Aqsa Mosque, the Palestinian  president's political adviser said: Entering Jerusalem and the  holy places is a right of every Palestinian. He pointed out  that no one can deprive them of this right. He noted that  President 'Arafat and the group which will accompany him to the  liberated lands will perform their religious duties in the holy  places.    He said that the occupation authorities have no right to  prevent any Palestinian from performing his religious duties  until the final status of Jerusalem is decided. He said that  this issue should be guaranteed and safeguarded because  Jerusalem is the city of the three religions and cannot be  Judaized. He said that its nature and heritage must be  maintained.    Abu-Sharif expected that matters will go in two directions;  the first toward entrenching the bases of a comprehensive peace,  and the second will be embodied by the extremist groups attempts  to foil, obstruct, and delay the peace process.    He called for reaching an understanding on merging some of  the clauses of the interim period and the final status stage.  He said that entrenching the peace process requires the  Palestinian and Israeli sides to work quickly to defuse any  chance of explosion. He said that any such chance is based in  the actions by the extremist Palestinians and Jews. He stressed  that past dreams are over and that a new era has started.    The Palestinian president's adviser pointed out that Israeli  Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who enjoys farsighted strategic  views, knows what he means, and that Yitzhaq Rabin, as a prime  minister and defense minister, who also has a lot of experience,  knows what he means.    He stressed that the events that have taken place have  bypassed the Oslo agreement, and so, the Israeli Government  should seriously think about synchronizing the settlers'  withdrawal with the withdrawal of its military forces, or,  otherwise, the settlers will turn into a party which will not  only attack the Palestinians, but the Israelis as well.    Abu-Sharif reiterated his call for setting up a  Jordanian-Syrian-Lebanese-Palestinian operations room, whose  task is to daily follow the peace negotiations affairs. He  emphasized that a true and effective Arab coordination can  attain Arab rights and foil Israel's attempts to deal separately  with each Arab side.</p>

			<p><P> November 28, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MIKE DOWNEY: THIS REALLY ISN'T A HIGH ENOUGH PRICE  </P> <P> Crime doesn't pay, but criminals do. They pay. They pay money. That's how some  of them pay for their sins. With money. That's how they buy their way out of  trouble. With money. That's how they avoid getting off scot-free. They pay  scot.  </P> <P> And this is the way sinners, too, pay for their sins. With money. A little  green paint covers everything.  </P> <P> Nobody from the New England Patriots got suspended Tuesday over the female  sportswriter incident. Nobody got hauled before a judge. Nobody got taken  downtown for questioning. Some Ivy Leaguer came around and asked them if they  had been good little boys or bad little boys, then told them to be good for  goodness' sake. Santa Claus is coming to town. OK, so they got away with it.  They beat the rap. The quality of mercy wasn't the teensiest bit strained.  </P> <P> You say $72,500 in fines is a pretty stiff price to pay for a non-criminal  offense? Fine. Fines are fine. Just be aware that these Patriot people are  laughing all the way to the bank. Just be aware that Zeke Mowatt's $12,500 tab  will be creatively accounted for in his next contract, or be covered by some  team emergency fund, or be raised by some citizens' committee that thinks the  poor Zekester got a raw deal. They'll rally like Amish farmers to help him  rebuild his barn.  </P> <P> As for the little shaver himself, Victor Kiam, he has to ante up $25,000 in  fines and $25,000 additional to supply material to NFL athletes instructing  them on how to behave like upright human beings instead of like prehistoric  cave people who walk on all fours.  </P> <P> They say this man who owns the Patriots and an electric-razor company has been  up to his stubble in financial problems lately, so maybe this $50,000 fine  couldn't come at a worse time for him.  </P> <P> Good.  </P> <P> This is the price Kiam and the Patriots must pay to accept fully the  realization that the bullying and physical, sexual and emotional harassment of  innocent bystanders cannot be tolerated . . . not by the NFL, NHL, NBA, NBC,  NCAA, NAACP, CPAs, CIA, TWA, PTA, PGA, FBI, IBM, IRS, NOW or USA.  </P> <P> For those who missed it -- and continue and continue and continue to miss the  point -- Lisa Olson of the Boston Herald was only doing her job. She was in  that Patriot locker room legally, properly and professionally. She wasn't a  trespasser. She wasn't off-limits. She was working. If what happened to her had  happened to a doctor, lawyer, waitress, homeless woman or any woman you happen  to know, it would not have been any more or less forgivable.  </P> <P> Lisa Olson got mind-raped. These men affronted her and emotionally manhandled  her, in an era and a setting wherein no woman should take even a man's vaguest  suggestions too lightly. Anybody who believes this behavior falls under the  category of locker-room "hijinks" is either a fool or a male, which is often  redundant.  </P> <P> What a world it is we live in when an adult woman doing her job, a trained  journalist taking notes after a football practice, can be subjected to a  frontal assault by amateur flashers and professional bullies and then become,  in some eyes, not the victim but the villain, thereafter the object of public  scorn and vile threats and hateful mail. How disgusting. How distressing. How  borderline horrifying.  </P> <P> The woman went to a basketball game and had a full cup of beer hurled at her.  For what? For being brutalized by football players? For having the audacity to  be standing in a room? For believing that she was entitled to make a living and  be treated with a little civilized common dignity?  </P> <P> All Olson wanted was two things: For the Patriots to acknowledge what they did,  and for the NFL to acknowledge that there would be hell to pay should it ever  happen again.  </P> <P> Well, there may not be that to pay, but there is money to pay. And that's  something, at least. Mowatt is $12,500 lighter today, and Michael Timpson and  Robert Perryman have five grand apiece to fork over, and then there's the  $25,000 that will go toward pamphlets and instructional videos that NFL players  will be obliged to watch like airline passengers being told how to buckle that  seat belt and use that foam cushion for flotation.  </P> <P> Good.  </P> <P> It's a start. Nobody is saying athletes should accommodate anyone and everyone  who ventures into their locker rooms. They can dress, undress, talk, balk,  yell, smell, scratch, spit, hurry, linger, heckle, howl or just sprinkle their  stinky armpits with baby powder, whatever they want. It's their room.  </P> <P> Just don't abuse anybody. Any time. Any place.  </P> <P> No amount of money in the world can buy you respect.  </P></p>

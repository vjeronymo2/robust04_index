The agency said that 'Arafat received this message when he  met this evening with Mr. Igor Ivanov, Russian President  Yeltsin's envoy, and that 'Arafat and Ivanov held extended and  detailed talks on the current stage of the Middle East peace  process after the al-Ibrahimi Mosque massacre in Hebron. They  discussed the results of that massacre when all Arab parties to  the talks suspended negotiations with Israel.    The news agency said that during his meeting, 'Arafat  concentrated on the basic Palestinian demands at this stage,  which are:    First, sending an international or multinational force to  the  occupied Palestinian territories, the West Bank and Gaza Strip,  by coordinating and consulting with the co-sponsors of the peace  process, the United States and Russia, and the UN secretary  general to guarantee the security and safety of the Palestinian  people there.    Second, disarming the settlers and preserving public peace.    Third, starting to dismantle the settlements that have  extremists in them.</p>

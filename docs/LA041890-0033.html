			<p><P> April 18, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LET 500,000,000 BOTTLES BE BROKEN ALL OVER CHINA;  </P> <P> CHINA: UNDERGROUND DISSIDENTS ARE HOPING THE SMALL GESTURE WILL BREATHE NEW  LIFE INTO THE PRO-DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT.  </P> <P> Last week, plainclothes police arrested and pummeled a young man in Tian An Men  Square until he bled. His crime? Dropping a soda bottle.  </P> <P> Xiaoping, as in Deng Xiaoping, means "little bottle" in Chinese. Since last  June's massacre in the square, thousands of Chinese have left bits of broken  bottle glass in public places to protest the government's crackdown.  </P> <P> Members of an underground network of Chinese dissidents, which spans five  continents and 20 countries, faxed messages throughout China calling for  similar gestures of resistance, including prearranged walks, whispers and  claps. Thousands of unsigned letters urged a silent stroll through Tian An Men  Square to honor those who died last spring. And an underground newspaper, Steel  Currents, called for the formation of a political opposition than could unite  and disperse on command. All this compelled the Chinese government to shut down  the area briefly and send in young scouts.  </P> <P> If breaking bottles and walking become subversive acts, the pro-democracy  movement will triumph. If Tian An Men Square remains heavily guarded, the  stroll will move to Shangdon Boulevard or to a host of other streets in Beijing  until the government closes the city down. When the Asian Games open in August,  foreign friends will chant "Tian An Men, Tian An Men, Tian An Men  (clap-clap-clap)" in the hopes of starting a chorus.  </P> <P> The Western media have already confirmed that such small gestures of resistance  in China provoke government brutality, the first step of its self-destruction.  Last Sunday in Beijing, police arrested a scientist from Southern China for the  crime of pinning white flowers on his shirt in mourning for pro-democracy  demonstrators. Such repression cannot quell the pro-democracy movement.  </P> <P> Fourteen years ago, on the traditional day for remembering the dead -- the  Qingming Festival -- the Chinese army brutally cracked down in Tian An Men.  Thousands of Chinese, including one of the above authors, Chengsheng Li, put on  black arm bands and placed gigantic wreathes and flowers at the Martyrs  Monument in Tian An Men Square in honor of Chou En-Lai, who had died a few  months earlier. The following evening, police moved in and clubbed people who  didn't obey orders to leave.  </P> <P> Outraged by this assault, people fought back, burning two police vehicles and a  police station bordering the square. The police returned the next night with  armed gangs and forceably ejected the remaining few thousand  "counterrevolutionaries." The square stayed closed until it was scrubbed clean  of the blood.  </P> <P> More than a year later, the government, ironically, revised its assessment of  the crackdown, calling it the auspicious beginning of the downfall of the Gang  of Four and the end of the dreaded Cultural Revolution.  </P> <P> In 1990, the Chinese government fears its own history when it fights the  momentum of demonstrations that began last April during Qingming. The death of  Chinese Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang ignited the largest show of resistance  to China's political system in the party's 40-year rule. Other anniversaries of  last spring's pro-democracy events are also slated for worldwide remembrances  by exiled dissidents. May 4 marks the 71st anniversary of the 1919 Movement; it  was also the day last year of the largest student march in China's history.  </P> <P> It took the People's Liberation Army weeks to clear Tian An Men Square, and  only after it imported and deployed young soldiers who could not speak the  language of the demonstrators. Since then, the military budget has grown 50%.  But an army of even 4 million cannot wipe out ideas shared by half-a-billion  persons, no matter how many it captures, tortures, "educates, self-criticizes"  and imprisons.  </P> <P> Many of last year's student leaders have escaped China; others remain active  despite being on most-wanted lists. Protected by thousands of Chinese citizens  and some sympathetic party officials, Zhai Min recently resurfaced in Beijing  to announce continuing plans for the democracy movement. His survival, after  having moved around the country undetected for nine months, highlights the  widespread support the movement retains. And after a dramatic appearance on  Hong Kong television last week, Chai Lin, the second-most-wanted fugitive in  all China, landed in Paris with her husband. This former "commander of Tian An  Men" recited a poem by Bei Dao:  </P> <P>  I am about to go!  </P> <P>  I have left no ripples  </P> <P>  But my pen to my mother.  </P> <P>  I am not a hero ...  </P> <P>  This is an era without heroes.  </P> <P>  But I would not fall  </P> <P>  So that those butchers  </P> <P>  Could show their loftiness  </P> <P>  To block that wind of freedom  </P> <P>  Through those deep, deep bullet wounds  </P> <P>  Bleeds the dawn of red blood.  </P> <P>  Even at a whisper, scary stuff.  </P></p>

			<p>930417 FT  17 APR 93 / Sport: A season at a slower pace - Cricket WELCOME to the new cricket season, to the rugs, hot drinks and music of ball on bat. It has been a long winter. There has been nothing to keep cricket fans going through the barren months since the end of last season, except newspaper descriptions of the English Test team failing in India and Sri Lanka, weary with too much cricket. There may be too much to play, but there is never enough to watch and such as there is depends on the weather. It always has done, of course, and bad weather has always led to what the editor of Wisden in 1974 attacked as 'the practice of contrived finishes on the third day.' Today these contrived finishes are used as an argument in support of the four-day game, which is with us on trial for the next three years. It will mean fewer county matches - 17 instead of 22 - but the hope is that these will be fuller and better than three-day matches. Even rain should leave time for both sides to bat and bowl their way through two innings and reach a genuine result. We shall see. I think the real question for English cricket is not how long its games should be but whether these games, be they three, four or five days long, can cash in on the popularity which the one-day game has brought back to cricket. One of the keys to success in longer games is balance. I write as one who has sat through countless hours of medium pace bowling leading nowhere, not challenging batsmen, not inspiring other bowlers and certainly not entertaining spectators. It is not strength in one-pace depth, but a balance between speeds: fast, medium and slow, and between types: seam, spin and drifter, which is most likely to cope with the varied demands of longer games. Uncovered wickets would probably boost an assorted range of bowling, including more slow and spin, but with batsmen skittled out on drying wickets like the 'sticky dogs' of Derek Underwood's great days, county games would be more likely to last two than three or four days. You cannot win. But you can have a go. Sussex's captain, Alan Wells, used Ian Salisbury's leg spin with increasing confidence last season and Salisbury took 79 wickets in the county championship, while Sussex strike bowler Franklyn Stephenson took 40. Bowling in the classic spinners' style of match-winning bursts, Salisbury took 23 wickets in Sussex's last two games, against Lancashire and Yorkshire, whom he mesmerised into ignominious defeat. Sussex have followed this up by signed off-spinner Eddie Hemmings. At 44, sacked by Nottinghamshire, Hemmings is nothing if not experienced and, most important, is a partner in spin for Salisbury. I am a believer in partnerships, with bat and with ball. They are pivots of strength, which the English Test team so sorely lacks. Northamptonshire's Alan Fordham and Nigel Felton, competent but not brilliant batsmen, opened their county's batting splendidly last season, working as a pair. Wasim and Waqar showed how devastating a bowling partnership can be. Somerset have shown enterprise in signing Mushtaq Ahmed to provide an element of the unfathomable and to work in harness with off-spinner Harvey Trump, backing up the pace attack of Andy Caddick and Mark Lathwell. I look forward to watching Somerset's double acts this summer. At Derbyshire, much will depend on the extent to which bowlers Ian Bishop and Dominic Cork can settle into a high-powered, high-speed opening partnership. Devon Malcolm is always fast, often wayward and usually lonely  -a true Derbyshire man. One reason Derbyshire have sometimes done well but never triumphantly well in recent years is the individual and erratic nature of its cricket. If captain Kim Barnett can work his talented players, not least the slow left-arm bowler Richard Sladdin, into a coherent team, then with John Morris starting to bat consistently as well as elegantly, the county could be a formidable proposition. Unlike Derbyshire, Essex are used to being a solid, well balanced team, thanks to years of astute management by Keith Fletcher, now departed for national service. Essex's confident steadiness is reflected in the way their overseas signings, such as Mark Waugh and Salim Malik, come back for more. Kent are pleased with themselves for achieving this with Carl Hooper, who is going to do another year of bowling as well as batting for them. They are also pleased with their wicket-keeper, Steve Marsh, latest of a long line of good Kentish keepers. There is something about Kent - wind? grass? cider? - that breeds good wicket-keepers. Marsh kept wicket happily last season to the off-spin of Hooper, the zippy fast medium of Martin McCague and the slow left-arm of Richard Davis. If only England would copy the many counties profiting from the services of a good keeper. The Test team needs a proper keeper. Batsmen who also keep wicket should not spill over from one-day into county and Test cricket, any more than bowlers who can throw the bat a bit should replace genuine all-rounders. A powerful all-rounder like Chris Lewis, who averaged 49.25 with the bat and took 40 wickets for Nottinghamshire last season, would have helped to lift Yorkshire, Worcestershire and Durham from their bottom three places in the county table last year. Of these, Worcestershire's next-to-bottom was the most humiliating, after their sixth place in 1991. Among other things, they were hurt by fast bowler Graham Dilley's continuing injuries. It seems rare for any player, certainly a fast bowler, to get through a season without an injury. Sometimes it looks as if injuries are an indication of a team's unhappiness. The answer is not concentrated fitness, which brings strains and stress fractures galore, but a confident captain knowing when to push his team and when to let its secret resources bear fruit for itself.</p>

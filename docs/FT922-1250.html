			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Survey of Indonesia (2): Parliament flexes its muscles - Politics AFTER a month of campaigning, more than 100m voters turned out on June 9 to elect a new parliament in what was officially termed 'a feast of democracy'. Provisional results give the ruling Golkar party 67.5 per cent of the vote - down from 73 per cent in 1987 - with the two opposition parties splitting the remainder. In 1987, the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), with its roots in the nationalist movement of former President Sukarno, took 11 per cent of the national vote, while the United Development Party (PPP), a loose coalition of Moslem groups, won 16 per cent. With little chance of assuming power, opposition leaders have taken to criticising Indonesia's style of democracy. Golkar is backed by the civil service and has a distinct advantage over its two opponents in terms of funding and organisation. At the last election it took 299 of the 400 seats on offer. The opposition parties also find themselves outnumbered by a further 100 members nominated by the armed forces (Abri). Parliament has proved to be an ineffective counterbalance to executive power. Since President Suharto took the helm of state in 1965, parliament has neither blocked, nor initiated, a single piece of legislation. But there are signs that the parliament is beginning to flex its muscles. Members have openly criticised the trade monopolies granted to companies led by Mr Suharto's children. A 1965 decree granting the president absolute powers is soon to be revoked. Nevertheless, the real balance of power lies outside the political parties and the elected parliament. Indonesia's political system is rooted in a national philosophy entitled entitled Pancasila. It consists of five principles: Belief in one God - this safeguards Indonesia from becoming an islamic state as it provides an umbrella for other religions; Justice and civility among peoples - government officials highlight this principle as an enshrinement of respect for human rights; The unity of Indonesia - political parties, and individuals, are not allowed to raise issues which might threaten disunity; Democracy through deliberation and consensus among representatives; and Social justice for all. The three main interacting and competing forces in Indonesian politics are: Mr Suharto and those who enjoy his patronage; the armed forces, whose dwi fungsi (dual military and political) role is enshrined in law; and Islam, the popular leaders of which are becoming increasingly politicised and vociferous in their demands for democratic reform. Senior Abri officers say privately that increased national wealth and better education are irresistible forces pushing political change. They also insist that the dual role of the armed forces is essential to Indonesia's future. Diplomats believe some officers, including General Benny Murdani, minister of defence, are concerned that Mr Suharto is not keeping a tight enough rein on his children's business interests. This has led some Abri officers, diplomats say, to cajole the PDI party into nominating a candidate to oppose Mr Suharto when, as is widely expected, he runs for a sixth term of office next March. This would be a significant embarrassment for Mr Suharto who has always attracted all-party support for his election. Names of alternative candidates include Mr Rudini, minister of home affairs, although his nomination by PDI would almost certainly be without his blessing. The process by which the president is elected, however, weighs heavily in Mr Suharto's favour if and when he should decide to stand. The 1,000-member electoral college is made up of all the MPs plus another 500 members approved by Mr Suharto. The focus of attention is more likely to be on who stands for the post of vice-president to replace Mr Sudharmono, who is not expected to seek a second term. The winner would be in a strong position to succeed 71-year-old Mr Suharto should he decide to call his sixth term the last. Likely candidates for the post are General Try Sutrisno, commander in chief of the armed forces, and Mr B. J. Habibie, the charismatic minister of research and technology, and a close associate of Mr Suharto. In the past, however, potential successors have fallen like autumn leaves and Mr Suharto may wish to groom someone to reflect the aspirations of a younger generation of Indonesians. One potential candidate is Lt-Col Prabowo Subianto, a divisional commander in the strategic reserve corps and married to Mrs Siti Hedjanti Herijadi, Mr Suharto's second daughter. Moslem leaders such as Mr Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of Nahdhatul Ulama (NU) with an estimated 35m members, are likely to be thorns in the sides of both Mr Suharto and Abri. Mr Wahid says the government is afraid of democracy and he believes that Islamic organisations, such as NU, should 'liberate the population from poverty through democratic means'. Mr Wahid, widely regarded as a moderating force in Islam, says he will accept Mr Suharto as president for a sixth term, but his argument for not setting a timetable for democratic reform carries with it an implicit demand for change. 'Vaclav Havel did not have a timetable,' he explains. 'The people in Tiananmen Square did not have a timetable, Aung San Suu Kyi (the Burmese opposition leader) does not have a timetable'.</p>

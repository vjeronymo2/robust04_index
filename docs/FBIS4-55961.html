			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic by Nigel </F> Rahimpour; place and date not given: "`Akashi Is Concluding  Deals With the Serbs'"]    [Text] [Rahimpour] Following Gorazde, will Brcko also  fall to the Serbs?    [Ganic] We will defend ourselves, but, because of the arms  embargo, we have only a limited number of armor-piercing  weapons. Serbia will continue fighting. The Serbian offensive  will continue, because they have received contradictory signals  from the international community. In Gorazde, the Serbs got  round the NATO ultimatum. NATO should have put the Serbs heavy  weapons out of action, but Mr. Akashi failed to give a green  light. He preferred to have 100 dead and 1,000 injured Bosnians  to the destruction of 30 Serbian tanks.    [Rahimpour] Do you believe that UN emissary Akashi has been  making deals with the Serbs?    [Ganic] Instead of respecting UN resolutions, Akashi has  been working closely with the Serbs. The high point came when  he allowed them to take their tanks from Sarajevo and position  them in places from where they can attack our positions. He is  responsible for the deaths of people in Gorazde. He could have  prevented the massacre.    [Rahimpour] How do you envisage the establishment of peace?    [Ganic] The Serbs should return land to the Croats and  Moslems. That means a withdrawal from those areas where Croats  and Moslems constitute a majority.    [Rahimpour] Are you satisfied with 51 percent of Bosnia's  territory?    [Ganic] The Serbs are talking about 51 percent, we want  more. We will begin by implementing the federation on the  territory that we control. We will continue with our efforts  using political means, but if necessary, we will also resort to  other means.    [Rahimpour] Military means?    [Ganic] The international community should tell us how we  are to recover our territory.    [Rahimpour] What do your territorial claims mean in  quantitative terms?    [Ganic] We are demanding about 66 percent of the Bosnian  territory that was held by Croats or Moslems before the war.  For the sake of peace, it could also be somewhat less than  that, but then that would have to be settled beforehand with  those private property owners who have been expelled. The best  thing would be a federation in which everyone could return to  where they come from. We are only calling for the restoration of  the situation that existed before the war.    [Rahimpour] What else do you want?    [Ganic] We want the war criminals to be identified and  sentenced. Only then can we live together once again. People  who left their sons or daughters in the genocide will be able to  direct their hatred away from those who carried out orders and  project it onto the responsible war criminals.    [Rahimpour] What are the limits to your readiness to reach a  compromise?    [Ganic] The Serbs will not, of course, receive any territory  from us that does not belong to them, unless the European Union  and the United States give them land.    [Rahimpour] Can the enclaves in eastern Bosnia survive?    [Ganic] Yes, people only need to be given back what belongs  to them, and the United Nations should protect the enclaves.    [Rahimpour] But who can guarantee that the corridors linking  the greater part of the country and the enclaves in eastern  Bosnia will not be severed by the Serbs at some point?    [Ganic] Any agreement must guarantee the security of the  enclaves. Not only our army, but the United Nations too should  protect them. In the end, the United Nations created the  enclaves. They should also defend them now.    [Rahimpour] But the United Nations cannot even defend  itself.    [Ganic] It can. After all, they have 300 NATO jets at their  disposal.    [Rahimpour] Would you be prepared to exchange the enclaves  in eastern Bosnia for more land in central Bosnia?    [Ganic] No! There can be no Bosnia without eastern Bosnia.  Land west of the Drina River has never belonged to the Serbs.    [Rahimpour] Does the Moslem-Croatian alliance have a future?    [Ganic] Yes, of course. It constitutes a renaissance of  part of Bosnia, a renaissance that should extend to the entire  country.    [Rahimpour] Have the peace negotiations in Geneva become  irrelevant?    [Ganic] Yes, unless the military balance between us and the  Serbs can be restored. That is the only way in which one can  make them give us more land.</p>

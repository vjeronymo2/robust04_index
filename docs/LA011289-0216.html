			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> PLESSEY PLC JOINT BID PUT ON HOLD  </P> <P> The government said today it will study further the $3-billion joint bid by  General Electric Co. PLC and Siemens AG for Plessey PLC to determine its  possible impact on competition in Britain's electronics industry.  </P> <P> The decision temporarily blocks the bid from proceeding but allows the two  bidders to hold under 15% of Plessey's stock. The bidders quickly increased  their stake in Plessey to 14.9%, from about 3%, following the government's  announcement.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, in Brussels the European Commission said today that it will  investigate the bid, which might break Common Market competition rules.  </P> <P> The developments came amid expectations that a new international consortium,  expected to include Plessey, was to make a bid for GEC.  </P></p>

			<p>941223 FT  23 DEC 94 / UK Company News: Greenwich wins tender for Czech gold Greenwich Resources, the metals and minerals exploration group, yesterday announced it had won the tender for the award of the Rozmital Exploration Area in the Czech Republic, writes Peter Franklin. The area includes the Hora gold deposit, which is reported to have a near-surface resource of more than 800,000 ounces. Greenwich also announced it was to raise Pounds 3.9m net of expenses through a placing and open offer. Of the new funds, Pounds 1.8m will be raised by way of a placing of 13.5m shares and Pounds 2.1m through an open offer of 14.7m shares, both at 15p. The shares dipped  1/2 p to 15 3/4 p yesterday. The open offer, which is not being underwritten, is on a 1-for-6 basis. Qualifying shareholders may make additional applications in respect of the open offer. Mr Colin Phipps, chairman, said a large part of the proceeds would be applied to maintaining the group's 49 per cent interest in the Sappes gold exploration joint venture in Greece. The nearby Pefka Concession, in which Greenwich has a 100 per cent interest, will also be evaluated, along with the Hora gold deposit. Greenwich also announced it had ended the year to September 30 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 185,000, against a profit of Pounds 106,000. Operating income fell to Pounds 109,000 (Pounds 374,000) and administrative expenses, after capitalisation of overheads of Pounds 149,000 (Pounds 145,000) rose slightly to Pounds 323,000 (Pounds 285,000). Losses per share were 0.2p (0.1p earnings).</p>

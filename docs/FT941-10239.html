			<p>940210 FT  10 FEB 94 / Impasse on trade issues may threaten US and Japan summit Japan's foreign minister Mr Tsutomu Hata flew to Washington yesterday in a last-minute attempt to resolve stalled trade talks, but US business urged the Clinton administration to maintain a tough stance. Mr Ron Brown, the US commerce secretary, said before Mr Hata's arrival that bilateral talks among trade officials had produced no breakthrough on improved access to the Japanese market for US automotive groups and other issues 'which have the most profound economic consequences'. But he added, without elaborating, that agreement had been reached on medical equipment, where US makers had complained about complex Japanese regulations and non-transparent bidding procedures. However, the absence of a wider accord threatens to bedevil a summit between Mr Morihiro Hosokawa, the Japanese prime minister, and President Bill Clinton at the White House tomorrow. Mr Hosokawa said in Tokyo yesterday: 'Everything has come to an impasse.' To buoy the administration's stand, the Economic Strategy Institute, a Washington think tank with close ties to the US car industry, released a letter to Mr Clinton signed by 81 business leaders, economists and academics, supporting 'a pragmatic results-oriented strategy' which includes numerically measured increases in Japan's imports. Signatories included companies that have long sought better market access in Japan - including Intel, Cray Research and National Semiconductor in the high technology sector, as well as other companies that have sought protection from Japanese imports, such as Chrysler. Memories of past highly-touted but ultimately ineffectual bilateral trade pacts with Japan will overlay the proceedings. The US has now endured 28 straight years of merchandise trade deficits with Japan. In Congress, the administration has support for a tough stand from both parties. However, a group of moderate House Republicans has issued a paper attacking results-oriented trade as 'trade by the numbers'. They want Tokyo to 'lay out a clear schedule for sweeping deregulation and economic structural harmonisation'. Mr Hosokawa will be able to brief Mr Clinton on a Y15,250bn (Pounds 95bn) economic stimulus package, and a draft budget for 1994 is due to be unveiled today.

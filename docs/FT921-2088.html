			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / Jobless total highest since September 1987 THE NEWS of a 40,200 jump in seasonally adjusted unemployment last month confirmed that there will be no early reduction in Britain's lengthening dole queues. Although the increase was lower than January's 55,900 rise, the latest figures have brought the UK jobless total to its highest since September 1987 and dashed last autumn's hopes that the monthly increases in unemployment were on a downward path. Instead, economists warned that recent redundancies in the manufacturing and service sectors would add further to unemployment. Mr Peter Spencer, UK economist of Shearson Lehman Brothers, the US-owned securities house, said: 'Company managers have obviously decided that the economy is not recovering at an early stage and have moved to cost-cutting.' According to the Department of Employment, the seasonally adjusted jobless total has risen 1.05m in 22 months to 2,647,300, or 9.4 per cent of the workforce. After rising by more than 500,000 in 12 months, the number of male unemployed topped 2m in February for the first time since May 1987. Official figures show that 12.8 per cent of the UK male workforce was unemployed last month, compared with an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent among women. The February increase in unemployment was slightly higher than expected by the City, where the consensus forecast was for an increase of 35,000. Average earnings and productivity figures released yesterday were disappointing while job-vacancy statistics showed a small improvement. Average weekly earnings in the year to January increased by 7.25 per cent - unchanged from the annual rate in December, but slightly higher than market expectations of a 7 per cent rise. Unit wage and salary costs in manufacturing also rose more steeply than expected - by 5.7 per cent in the year to January compared with 4.5 per cent in the year to December. In the three months ending in January, wages and salaries per unit of output in manufacturing were 4.7 per cent higher than 12 months earlier. Manufacturing output per head was 1.8 per cent higher in January than at the same time last year, having increased by 2.6 per cent in the year to December. Manufacturing productivity showed a year-on-year gain of 2.7 per cent in the three months to January. Unfilled job vacancies at Jobcentres rose by a seasonally adjusted 2,300 to 124,300 in the month to February, lifting vacancies by about 20,000 compared with last summer. One effect of the long recession has been to smooth out earlier regional variations in unemployment. From its low in early 1990, unemployment south of a line between the Wash and the Bristol Channel has more than doubled. In no region north of that line has unemployment risen by more than 80 per cent. Greater London, with 10 per cent of the workforce out of work, now has a higher jobless rate than the national average. According to Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, unemployment in Scotland is now lower than in the UK as a whole for the first time since records began. Since its 1990 low the jobless total has increased most sharply - by 184 per cent - in the south-east outside greater London. In the south-east as a whole and greater London itself, unemployment has increased by 137 per cent and 107 per cent respectively. Unemployment in the west Midlands has risen 76 per cent from its recent low point, while jobless totals in the north, Scotland and Northern Ireland have increased only by 28 per cent, 17 per cent and 8 per cent respectively. The sharp rise in unemployment since May 1990 means Britain now has the third-worst unemployment rate of the industrialised world. Internationally standardised data from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development put the UK rate at 10.6 per cent compared with a European Community average of 9.3 per cent. Only the Irish Republic and Spain have higher rates, with 16.8 per cent and 16.3 per cent respectively.</p>

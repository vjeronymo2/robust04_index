			<p>920116 FT  16 JAN 92 / Inflation falls further in France FRANCE'S inflation rate fell to a provisional 3.1 per cent last year, the first time in two decades it has sunk below the rate in western Germany, the main benchmark used by official economic planners, writes William Dawkins in Paris. The figure compares with 3.4 per cent in 1990 and this year's 2.8 per cent target, and puts France well below the 4.5 per cent average for its nine main trade partners. The German inflation rate rose by 4.2 per cent last year. The figures, released by the Insee state statistics institute, are the latest vindication of the long-standing anti-inflation policy supported by both government and opposition for almost 10 years.</p>

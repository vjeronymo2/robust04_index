			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SOME ADDITIONS TO 'LIST TO END ALL LISTS'  </P> <P> I'd like to add a couple of quotes to Bell's list ("Quote -- A List to End All  '89 Lists -- Unquote," Life, Jan. 6).  </P> <P> Most sanctimonious and hypocritical: Eric Lichtblau wrote last November  regarding mailers sent by the Irvine Values Coalition: "But a closer  examination of at least four repeated campaign claims shows them to be  distortions or outright misrepresentations of the facts."  </P> <P> Oh really? Isn't that the perfect epitome of the pot calling the kettle black?  Journalists do that all the time. Besides, The Times refused to wait until the  IVC was able to produce the documentation to support their claims.  </P> <P> Most absurd: This dubious honor goes to no other than The Times publisher,  David Laventhol, when commenting on the closure of the Herald: "The absence of  the Herald is going to place an even greater responsibility on The Times to be  fair, accurate and complete in its reporting and to provide a forum for  multiple voices on important issues." You have the right to print anything you  like in your newspaper, but please don't insult your readers' intelligence by  claiming to be fair, accurate, etc.  </P> <P> The above quotes were taken from The Times so there is no guarantee of  accuracy.  </P> <P> Brenda Hester,  </P> <P> Garden Grove  </P></p>

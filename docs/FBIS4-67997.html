			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by David Regev] </F>   [Excerpt] The wave of detentions against opponents of the  peace process in the Gaza Strip continues. Twenty-five Hamas  [Islamic Resistance Movement] and Islamic Jihad activists in the  Strip were arrested over the past 24 hours by the security  forces, Arab sources reported yesterday.    According to the sources, the activists were detained in  their homes and the security forces also visited the homes of 15  activists and fugitives who were not at home, and demanded their  relatives give them up. Among those detained were Shaykh Nafar  A'zam, 40, of Rafah, an Islamic Jihad leader who was put under  administrative detention for six months. A'zam was released  several weeks ago after a long period of imprisonment.    A senior activist of the Popular Front for the Liberation of  Palestine, Walid al-Rul, 40, of al-Shati', was put under  administrative detention for six months for the ninth time.  Arab sources said he has been under detention for 53 months  running.    Khalil Bal'awi, 24, a Hamas wanted man, was captured by  security forces in Gaza yesterday. Bal'awi is suspected of  terrorist activity against the security forces, including firing  at IDF [Israel Defense Forces] patrols. [passage omitted]</p>

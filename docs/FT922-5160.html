			<p>920602 FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hawthorn Leslie makes loss of Pounds 13.5m Hawthorn Leslie, the subject of a restructuring which entailed disposals and rationalisation to reduce debt, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.5m for 1991. The deficit, which compared with losses of Pounds 13.7m last time, included operating losses of Pounds 6.5m from businesses sold or closed. Earlier this year the USM-quoted group, which is now focusing on mobile communications, agreed terms with its bankers for restructuring its remaining debt. Directors said the actions taken had placed the group in a 'stable financial position, albeit with a continuing weak balance sheet' and had enabled them to request the restoration of dealings in the shares - up  1/2 p yesterday to 2p. Turnover of continuing businesses amounted to Pounds 49.6m and losses per share emerged at 6.84p.</p>

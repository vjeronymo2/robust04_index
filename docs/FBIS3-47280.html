			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN today  carries a by-lined article titled "Advancing Towards Socialism  is Tide of History."    It quotes the great leader President Kim Il-song as saying  in  his New Year address that now in the international arena the  imperialists are vaunting the "end" of socialism, but they  cannot arrest the people's aspiration to independence,  sovereignty and socialism, nor can they reverse the tide of  history.    The article says:    Though the imperialists and the reactionaries are leaving no  stone unturned in their attempt to stifle socialism, they can  never put down the people's aspiration to socialism and reverse  the tide of history.    Describing the frustration of socialism in some countries as  a change in the tide of history is nothing but an anti- popular,  unscientific sophism ignoring the social nature of man and the  law governing the development of history.    As long as the popular masses remain the makers of history  and mankind exists, socialism will surely advance and emerge  victorious. This is well illustrated by the fact that the  anti-socialist moves of the imperialists are now on the brink of  total bankruptcy and the struggle of the popular masses for  rebuilding socialism and vigorously advancing it is ever growing.    That advancing towards socialism is the main trend of our  time is also proven by the fact that the contradiction and  crisis of the imperialists are becoming all the more serious and  the people's struggle for independence is growing worldwide.    In the past the imperialist powers joined hands with each  other against socialism. Now, however, they are locked in a  fierce fight with each other to expand their sphere of influence  and capture markets by interfering in different regional  disputes.    It is a stark fact that the imperialists' contradiction and  crisis are growing more acute and imperialism is rushing  headlong to its destruction, finding itself on the deathbed in  face of the people's struggle for building a new independent  world.    Socialism has definitely turned into the demand of our age.  It is well illustrated also by the fact that the Pyongyang  declaration calling for defending and advancing the cause of  socialism has spread rapidly worldwide with a never diminishing  attraction. The declaration has been signed by 200 political  parties. This clearly proves its significance and vitality.    There is no shadow of doubt that when the revolutionary  parties and peoples across the world are closely united with  each other under the banner of independence and powerful makers  of history for a new world are prepared, the human cause of  independence, the cause of socialism, will win a final victory.</p>

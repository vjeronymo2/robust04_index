			<p>931111 FT  11 NOV 93 / Boost for Pacific forum JAPAN plans to upgrade the next meeting of the Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation forum, due in Tokyo in 1995, from a ministerial session to include a formal summit of heads of government. Mr Tsutomu Hata, Japan's foreign minister, suggested the idea yesterday, marking a fresh enthusiasm for regional consultation by the Tokyo government. Apec, grouping some of the world's fastest-growing economies among its 15 members, will stage a ministerial meeting headed by the US in Seattle next week, to be followed by an informal meeting of leaders at President Bill Clinton's invitation. 'We have to think what kind of management will be most beneficial to the world economy after the end of the cold war. Apec can be an extremely effective place to think about that,' said Mr Takeshi Isayama, director-general of economic co-operation at the ministry of international trade and industry. Apec should be a forum for consultation, not for negotiations, said Mr Isayama. Most of Apec's Asian members, especially Malaysia and Thailand, share Japan's view. They are suspicious of what they see as US eagerness to turn Apec into a free trade zone, economically dominated by the US.</p>

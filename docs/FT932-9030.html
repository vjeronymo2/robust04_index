			<p>930515 FT  15 MAY 93 / The Lex Column: Unilever The market has developed something of an allergy to branded consumer goods manufacturers due to the fuss surrounding Marlboro's swingeing price cuts. Having already sneezed, Unilever's shares fell a further 4 per cent yesterday following first-quarter results. Pre-tax profits of Pounds 420m were towards the bottom end of expectations. But increased competition, making life sticky for Unilever's Ragu pasta sources in the US, stirred up fresh anxieties about brand strengths. The market, though, is in danger of generalising from the particular. In Marlboro's case, Philip Morris allowed its prices to grow wildly out of line with discount brands. Ragu suffered as big competitors grew nasty trying to enter a market Unilever had largely created. The encroachments of private label will undoubtedly mean brand manufacturers are going to have to run fast to justify their premium prices. But Unilever's renewed emphasis on restrained price increases, marketing spend and product innovation suggest it can still sprint with the best of them. This makes its sub-market rating appear rather grudging. Even if worries over brands do fade, Unilever's shares may still struggle to reverse their recent underperformance. For many years, Unilever has been the natural home for international investors seeking exposure to the European food sector. The harmonisation of Nestle's share structure and its proposed listing in the US suggest yet another competitive front will open up between the two giants.</p>

			<p>920729 FT  29 JUL 92 / Allied and Carlsberg to link up: MMC attaches conditions to joint brewing venture in UK ALLIED-LYONS and Carlsberg indicated yesterday that the Pounds 510m merger of their UK brewing operations would go ahead after modifications to meet the demands of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Nine months after the UK drinks, food and retailing group and the Danish brewer announced their intention to create a joint force in the UK beer market, the MMC recommended by a four-to-one majority that the merger should only proceed if: Carlsberg-Tetley, the merged company, undertook not to worsen the terms of beer supplies to Carlsberg's existing customers among regional and local brewers and independent wholesalers during the next three years. The term of the supply agreement between Carlsberg-Tetley and Allied pubs was reduced from seven to five years. Allied amended its tenancy or lease agreements so that its tied pubs would be free after two years to buy up to half their annual lager requirements from suppliers of their own choice. The European Commission, which conducted a separate inquiry, set similar conditions for the merger. Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied's brewing division, and Mr Michael Iuul, Carlsberg International's managing director, said in a joint statement: 'We are firmly of the view that the proposed joint venture is the best strategy for both companies. 'When we have explored the practicalities of the conditions suggested in greater detail, we are confident that we will find a mutually acceptable way forward in the best interests of our shareholders, customers and employees.' The most onerous condition would appear to be the obligation on Allied to free its tenants to open their pubs to other lagers after two years. In practice, however, few pubs would be likely to change brands unless faced with extreme customer dissatisfaction. The MMC found the merger would have positive and detrimental effects on competition. Carlsberg-Tetley would be a more effective brewer, the MMC said, with a better balanced portfolio of brands than Allied and Carlsberg separately, and able to compete more vigorously with the two biggest brewers, Bass and Courage. Since Carlsberg owned no pubs, the merger would not increase the number nationally with tied beer supplies. Against this, the MMC concluded that the merger would increase concentration in lager production. Carlsberg-Tetley would have a 21 per cent share of the market and the three largest brewers would account for 67 per cent. Allied-Lyons and Carlsberg, Report on the proposed joint venture. HMSO.

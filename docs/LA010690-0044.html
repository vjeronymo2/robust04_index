			<p><P> January 6, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STORYTELLER SPINS WEB THAT CAPTURES THE LESSONS OF LIFE;  </P> <P> "THE WONDER IS THAT THE CHARACTERISTIC EFFICACY TO TOUCH AND INSPIRE DEEP  CREATIVE CENTERS DWELLS IN THE SMALLEST NURSERY FAIRY TALE -- AS THE FLAVOR OF  THE OCEAN IS CONTAINED IN A DROPLET OR THE WHOLE MYSTERY OF LIFE IN THE EGG OF  A FLEA." -- JOSEPH CAMPBELL, "THE HERO WITH A THOUSAND FACES"  </P> <P> The man struggling for life in the hospital's intensive-care unit made but one  request. He wanted his friend, David Novak, to tell him a story.  </P> <P> So Novak obliged, recounting the courage of a tiny spider who, against all  odds, scaled a water spout after nearly drowning in a rainstorm.  </P> <P> "Early one morning in Spider Town, before the sun came up, all was quiet and  still," Novak began. "The cool dew was clinging to the sleepy spider webs, and  not a web was stirring. . . . "  </P> <P> For his ailing friend, the tale of the spider "was like a warm cup of tea on a  cold night," said Novak, a professional storyteller. "It was an opportunity to  hold his hand and let him know someone cared for him."  </P> <P> His friend recovered, and, although Novak is reluctant to give himself credit,  the episode "taught me the greatest respect for the story."  </P> <P> Because his friend clung to life, the nursery rhyme "took on a great resonance  and meaning. It became a real heroic journey," said Novak, his voice becoming  hushed at the memory.  </P> <P> Novak shares this and other tales with students throughout San Diego County.  Through grants from the California Arts Council and the San Diego Institute for  Arts Education, he teaches both teachers and students the joys of storytelling.  </P> <P> Today and Sunday at 7:30 p.m., Novak will present his "Telling Experience" at  the Big Kitchen Cafe. And he will perform with other members of the San Diego  Storytellers on Jan. 10 at Drowsy Maggie's. Later this month, he will perform  in Steamboat Springs, Colo., and in February will do 3 dozen performances in  New York, New Jersey and Connecticut for the Lincoln Center Institute, the  educational arm of the arts center.  </P> <P> For audiences, his tales are "like a waking dream, a guided fantasy," said  Novak, a tall man with blue eyes and a resonant voice.  </P> <P> "Listening to myths and legends teaches us to think in metaphors and images and  to apprehend things not only in a strictly verbal way. It helps us understand  life on a larger scale. We can receive life and the lessons it has to offer."  </P> <P> Anne Chase, program director for the San Diego Institute, called Novak's  storytelling "exquisite. He's enormously popular with the children," she said,  indicating that it's unusual to hire an artist three years in a row.  </P> <P> Storytelling can also improve language skills.  </P> <P> "Before you read and write you have to speak," said Stephanie Ruin, a  fourth-grade teacher at Rose Elementary School in Escondido. "You can see the  beauty of it. It's not vocabulary and dry work sheets. It's an expression of  oneself."  </P> <P> During a recent performance at Rose, Novak demonstrated that theater's loss is  storytelling's gain. He transformed himself into an array of characters as he  related the story of Little Red Riding Hood -- from the cackling grandmother to  the growling wolf to Little Red herself. The transformations were accomplished  with the simple, clever use of a red bandanna tied around his head in various  ways: under his chin for the grandmother, around his ears for Little Red and  over his mouth for the wolf. At one dizzying point, he feverishly switched from  wolf to Red as he chased her in a circle.  </P> <P> Novak also created a cozy atmosphere by enlisting the students' help in  building a "storyteller's fire." First, he invited listeners to throw him  imaginary pieces of kindling, branches and logs. His arms sagged under the  weight of the wood as he "caught" the pieces. He "lit" the wood and he and his  audience began to snap their fingers as the fire sparked. Then Novak slapped  his fist and clapped loudly, and the sounds of a happy crackling campfire  filled the school auditorium.  </P> <P> Holmes Elementary School Principal Jeannie Steeg has noticed that students  become enthusiastic about reading once they hear Novak's tales.  </P> <P> "If he tells a story that is part of a book, kids all of a sudden want to go  out and get that book," she said. Said Rose Elementary fourth-grader Dan  Claytor: "If I tell the stories to my mom, she can tell them to another kid who  can tell his mom. It will spread around and keep going forever."  </P> <P> Novak's storytelling skills were honed during his childhood in Ft. Lauderdale,  Fla. One of four children, he began performing in a children's theater group in  second grade.  </P> <P> The play was "Aladdin's Wonderful Lamp." "I was a spear carrier, quite  literally," said Novak, relaxing with a cup of tea in his comfortably cluttered  home.  </P> <P> "My mother likes to tell the story of how we would visit friends and I wouldn't  want to play with the kids. I would sit with the grown-ups and play Mr. Smith.  It was just an alter ego."  </P> <P> Novak was also an avid reader of books by Kenneth Grahame, who writes about  "mythical childhood reminiscences."  </P> <P> In high school, Novak started a mime troupe that performed at other schools.  </P> <P> "We performed in a nudist colony once in nothing but white face," he said with  a laugh.  </P> <P> Novak attended Broward College in Ft. Lauderdale and transferred to Southern  Methodist University in Dallas. Because of his extensive theatrical experience,  he was permitted to take graduate seminars.  </P> <P> After his graduation in 1976 with a bachelor's degree in fine arts, he worked  briefly for theaters in Wisconsin and Rhode Island before joining the St. Louis  Theater Project Company. Among his roles was the lead in Hamlet. He also fell  in love with and married Courtney Flanagan, a director there whom he had met in  college.  </P> <P> Part of his duties with the company included dressing like Paul Bunyan and  spinning tall tales for schoolchildren. But Novak finally found his own voice  at a St. Louis storytelling festival in 1981.  </P> <P> There, he used an Ed Norton-like character to tell a Japanese story about a  stonecutter who was unhappy with his lot. The stonecutter used a magic potion  to transform himself into an emperor, the sun, a cloud and a mountain before he  realized he liked being himself best of all.  </P> <P> "I had an audience of 300 people and I made it up as I went along," Novak said.  "It was a real 'aha' experience. I suddenly discovered after all these years  that I had been involved in useless yet fervent productivity." Finally, he  said, "I felt a centered-ness, a harmony."  </P> <P> The story became a metaphor for his eventual realization that storytelling was  his true calling.  </P> <P> Novak moved here to attend graduate school and earned a master's degree in fine  arts from UC San Diego in 1986. For the next two years, he endured a dizzying  schedule of acting engagements from Alaska to Utah, fitting in storytelling  performances with the San Diego Institute for Arts Education and the Lincoln  Center Institute.  </P> <P> Novak flew to New York several times to audition for plays. His agent begged  him to move to the Big Apple and forget his storytelling aspirations. "You  should do theater and TV," he was told. "You should be doing soap commercials."  </P> <P> The uncertain life style was wearing him down. "You would be waiting by the  telephone to take a job at a moment's notice," he said.  </P> <P> The final straw was a six-month stint at the Berkeley Shakespeare Festival in  1988. Even after snaring such plum roles as Troilus in "Troilus and Cressida,"  he had "no notion of a future," Novak said. He also found separations from his  family difficult.  </P> <P> The lure of storytelling was beckoning. "I missed the autonomy, I missed the  creativity and I missed the pleasure of it."  </P> <P> Novak finally realized his true vocation. "With theater, I banged my head  against walls, but with storytelling, doors opened that shouldn't have. Double  locks were unlocked and people invited me in.  </P> <P> "I finally admitted to myself that performing for children was OK," he said.  "It's not second-best. It's a real legitimate community which needs someone to  address its interests."  </P> <P> Storytelling also affords him the luxury of planning a schedule, sometimes as  much as two years in advance.  </P> <P> Novak embroiders his stories from myth, fable and folklore. Stories also spring  from his own experiences. And sometimes headlines spark stories. "Waiting for  Recess" is a childs-eye retelling of the Stockton schoolyard massacre.  </P> <P> The best rehearsals are done in his mind. Sometimes, a story must percolate  through his brain for years before it is ready to be told, he said.  </P> <P> Often, he weaves his story from a series of images. In the spider tale, the  images were vivid. Novak described in an ominous voice how "the mouth of the  spout rose up before him like a great dark cave. He could hear the wind  whirring inside." He told of "dark thunderclouds swelling up like sponges,  getting ready to soak the land." And after the rain, "water from the puddles  began to steam up into the sky."  </P> <P> Even in conversation, his descriptions are often lyrical. He described a  theater in St. Louis as "an old ghostly edifice in the middle of a withering  downtown."  </P> <P> Novak likes to bring his only child, 2-year-old son, Jack, to performances. "I  want to have time with him and not have a separate work world," he said,  changing a diaper after a performance. "A child brings ecstasy, joy and an  unbearable promise of loss."  </P> <P> Recently, Novak began weaving string images to use as illustrations for his  stories.  </P> <P> The string once helped to unlock the memories of a timid Asian girl. Novak had  asked students in a fourth-grade classroom to create their own image from  string.  </P> <P> "She made the side of a boat and said, 'I'm feeling sick.' "  </P> <P> "Are there other people in the boat with you?" Novak asked, then invited other  students to join her.  </P> <P> "It turned out she was from Vietnam and she was one of the boat people. She was  rescued as the boat was sinking. It made a really deep impression on me," Novak  said.  </P> <P> Novak recently found his life taking on a story-like quality of its own when  his Australian shepherd, Gigi, bit a neighbor. The incident aroused his own  feelings that somehow he wasn't quite worthy of home ownership after leaving  behind a bohemian existence.  </P> <P> "It was a great embarrassment to me and a source of constant chagrin," Novak  said. "I imagined the other houses glaring at us and wondered whether they had  made up their minds to approve of us."  </P> <P> As for the dog bite: "If this were a story, then the hero would have to face  the music. So I prepared for the worst, I prepared to be humbled and make my  peace with it. It turned out they were the sweetest couple, and it turned into  a happy ending."  </P> <P> Novak was then reminded of a Pima legend about the first human, who placed his  hand over his heart and drew out a large stick.  </P> <P> "He used this stick from his heart to find his way in the dark, and, when he  was weary, he rested on it.  </P> <P> "For me," Novak said, "stories are sticks from the heart."  </P></p>

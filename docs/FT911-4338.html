			<p>910419 FT  19 APR 91 / Insurance assets down NON-LIFE insurance companies showed a net disposal of Pounds 53m of assets last year, compared with a net increase in assets in 1989 of Pounds 2.2bn, according to Bank of England figures published yesterday, writes Peter Marsh. The disposal was mainly effected through selling securities. It was caused largely by the need to meet claims arising from a variety of worldwide disasters. Unit trusts increased their assets last year by Pounds 621m, compared with an increase in 1989 of Pounds 4.9bn.</p>

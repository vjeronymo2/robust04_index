			<p>BFN     [Text] The opposition in the Lithuanian Seimas  [parliament] has circulated a statement on the registration of  the newly founded Socialist Party. According to its founders,  the new organization is a "party dedicated to working people"  seeking to restore communist ideas.    In the opposition's opinion, before the new party is  registered, it is necessary to establish the relations of its  members with the subunit of the USSR Communist Party, which  functioned illegally in Lithuania.    Representatives of the Lithuanian Ministry of Justice have  reported that the rules for registering political organizations  do not envision such a procedure. They have also said that thus  far they have not received any official application from the  Socialist Party requesting legalization.</p>

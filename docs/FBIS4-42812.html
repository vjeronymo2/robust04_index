			<p>BFN     [Text] Bill Clinton spent an extra hour at the prime  minister's office with Edouard Balladur. The U.S. President  talked about the major current issues, such as GATT, the G-7,  Bosnia, and Europe.    Clinton and Balladur also talked with journalists for a  while. The French prime minister seized this opportunity to say  how much he appreciated U.S. security policy in Europe:    [Begin Balladur recording] I still have confidence in the  U.S. Administration and in the actions of President Clinton. We  may not hold the same views on some issues -- the opposite would  be surprising -- but what is of the utmost importance is our  common desire to maintain peace and security in Europe.    I must say that I found President Clinton to be very  open-minded with regard to European issues and the need for  Europe to be better organized. This is what he repeated earlier  as we were finishing our lunch.    I think that most of the reasons why we may have  misunderstood each other have now disappeared. [end recording]</p>

			<p>940624 FT  24 JUN 94 / Pensions - The White Paper: Doubts over who pays for policing - Roland Rudd explains fears about factors which may undermine the effectiveness of the new regulator The government yesterday outlined a regulatory structure in its white paper which it said would prevent another Maxwell scandal. But by rejecting the Goode committee recommendation that it should be funded by the state it has raised questions about the effectiveness of the new regime. Ministers want the regulator to be funded by an increased levy on schemes, saying that those who benefit from the regulatory framework should pay for it. This has raised fears that ministers may have weakened the regulator's independence - and consequently its ability to prevent further pension fraud  -by making it dependent on the industry. Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, said: 'Does it really buttress the independence of the post to leave the regulator dependent on a levy of the industry? How will it be able to stop the next fraud from happening?' The government's decision to make the regulator's full-time board more than an advisory committee - by requiring a majority vote - also raises fears that the regulator might become too dependent on members close to employer organisations. Ministers are proposing a raft of changes such as giving scheme members the right to appoint at least one-third of trustees and a duty on some auditors and scheme actuaries to speak out against fraudulent practice. The most important proposal of the white paper, however, concerns the role of regulator since it will be responsible for enforcing the new regime. To a large extent it will depend on who Mr Peter Lilley, social services secretary, picks as the regulator and to what extent the regulator is responsible to parliament. This is why Mr Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour member of the social security committee, wanted the regulator to be appointed by parliament. Mr Lilley has reassured most backbenchers he has clamped down on the potential for pension fraud by advocating a regulator that will have most of the powers recommended by the Goode committee, but remains unencumbered by bureaucratic procedures. Concerns remain, however, both in parliament and the industry, that the regulator might still not be powerful enough to prevent further scandals. Auditors and actuaries will have a duty to 'blow the whistle' to the regulator that could be be hard to enforce. It is not clear what protection auditors and actuaries will have when reporting information to the regulator. Mr Tam Dalyell, Labour MP for Linlithgow, said: 'A whistle-blowing auditor wouldn't have remained the late Bob Maxwell's auditor for many moons.' Mr Lilley said the new regulator would have a pro-active role in preventing pensions fraud and would not have to wait for a whistle to be blown. He also said that while auditors would be duty bound by the legislation to pass on information to the regulator they would have a 'powerful defence' against legal action. But one company of auditors said such a powerful defence might not be enough to persuade all auditors to 'rat on their client' if it meant that they could lose the business. There are fears in the industry that the regulator will not be active enough in preventing fraud. While the regulator will be able to investigate suspicions and might develop a system of checks and investigations, the government has said it will not interfere into what it calls 'well-run schemes'. Mr Martin Miles, a consultant with the pension consultants Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said: 'There are still grey areas concerning the role of the regulator. It does not look like he will have the same power as Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, for example, to conduct spot checks.' Mr Lilley said the regulator would have the power to interfere if he thought something was wrong, such as a constant change in auditors. But while the regulator has the power to act at the first sign of trouble, he is not being invited to try to prevent fraud before it happens. Mr Lilley concluded his statement in parliament by saying that he was certain that the industry remained 'very aware and concerned in the wake of the Maxwell affair and is on its guard against fraud'. The test of the new regime will be whether the regulator manages to run a system independent of the industry that prevents fraud in the longer term, when the immediate memory of the Maxwell scandal has faded.</p>

			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Letters to the Editor: Buthelezi and the playing of an ethnic card Sir, Your March 30 editorial, 'The Zulu factor', correctly states: 'Chief Buthelezi has decided to play the ethnic card, and it is a dangerous one.' But did he decide, or was the decision made for him? For decades Buthelezi has consistently supported non-racial democracy, although his political beginnings, like those of Nelson Mandela, were in pan-Africanism. He entered negotiations advocating non-racial federalism. The Freedom Alliance, when it emerged, was a pioneering attempt at multi-racialism of the right. Surely the most chilling moment in negotiations came when the ANC, determined to break the Freedom Alliance, began to hint at an Afrikaaner homeland or special status for the Zulu king. The ANC, for short-term political gain, began to use the very weapon of ethnic divide-and-rule it has fought against for 80 years. Chris Jones, 20 Antonine Gate, St Albans, Herts</p>

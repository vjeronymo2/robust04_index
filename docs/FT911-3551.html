			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Poland to keep grip on money supply THE Polish government has committed itself to maintaining tight controls on money supply this year in return for credits of Dollars 1.6bn over three years, according to a letter of intent to the International Monetary Fund. The letter - accepted last week by the IMF's Board of Management - shows that Poles can expect an additional Dollars 325m loan to cover the increased costs of oil imports this year. A quarter of the Dollars 1.6bn IMF loan is to be used cover the costs of a debt reduction agreement Poland is seeking with 400 or so western banks, to which it owes Dollars 11bn. The upper limit on Poland's new foreign borrowing this year is set at Dollars 1.5bn and, despite an expected fall in the rate of growth of exports and higher import costs, foreign currency reserves are to grow by Dollars 700m. The letter also promises to keep Poland's present dollar/zloty exchange rate 'as one of the main points of' the government's anti-inflation strategy. Domestic money supply is to grow in nominal terms by 43 per cent this year against a 36 per cent forecast inflation rate. Wages in state owned industries are to be permitted to rise by no more than 60 per cent of the increase in prices. Should the inflation rate increase more than expected then these controls will be tightened. The budget deficit is to be no higher than Zl 6,000bn or 0.5 per cent of GDP, while the supply of credit to the rest of the economy is to grow in real terms by 19 per cent. Poland's stock exchange saw trading in shares from the Krosno glass works suspended yesterday when sellers exceeded buyers. Under the rules the price will be fixed 10 per cent below last week's to await the next session in seven days time.</p>

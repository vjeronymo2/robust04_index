			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Reporter Li Anding (2621 1344 1353)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, 30 May (XINHUA) -- The state will certify  the qualifications of engineering consulting units in China,  according to the second plenary council meeting of the Chinese  Engineering Consultation Association currently being held in  Beijing. Song Ping and Yao Zhenyan attended the meeting.    Engineering consultation is a newly emerging industry in the  course of reform and opening up. Through rapid development of  more than a decade, an independent industry with some 3,000  engineering consulting units of various kinds has taken shape in  China. To standardize the management of the new industry and to  provide better engineering consultation to economic construction  and the total process of engineering projects from policy-making  to management, the State Planning Commission recently  promulgated the "Interim Procedures for Managing the Engineering  Consulting Industry" and the "Interim Procedures for Certifying  Engineering Consulting Units." These two sets of procedures  prescribe the system for certifying qualifications of  engineering consulting units and their compensatory service, as  well as the principles for conducting engineering consultation  abroad. The Chinese Engineering Consultation Association will  certify various Chinese engineering consulting units in stages  and by groups, classifying them into grades A, B, and C and  issuing certificates according to their qualifications.    It is understood that with the approval of the State  Council's relevant department, the Chinese Engineering  Consultation Association will join the International Federation  of Consultative Engineering as a national organization of the  Chinese engineering consulting industry. The membership will  serve as an important channel for China's engineering consulting  industry to converge with international standards and to develop  foreign exchange and cooperation with other members.</p>

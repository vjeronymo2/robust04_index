			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Book Review: Poisonous legacy of central planning ECOCIDE IN THE USSR By Murray Feshbach and Alfred Friendly Jnr Basic Books, 376pp, dollars 29. To be published in the UK by Aurum Press pounds 19.95 At the end of a recent visit to the city of Cherepovets, 500km north of Moscow and the site of the largest functioning blast furnace in the world, a young businessman I had met took me out of town about 10km, through a wood to a good-sized lake. It was peaceful and still after the din of the vast steelworks, and fresh after the carbon and sulphur which pollute the town. A few hundred metres out in the lake, an object rose out of the water. I said: 'It looks to me like the top of a church.' 'It is,' replied my companion.' He pointed across the lake. 'There is another': and there was another tower with an onion dome, poking out of the placid surface. We were looking at what had been a valley, with villages, flooded in order to provide a transportation link in a chain of canals which led to the Baltic Sea. The villages which had been there had simply been covered over. It was an eerie and desolate spectacle. A few months before, in another industrial city - Novokuznetsk, in Siberia - I had felt myself grow nauseous within an hour or two of arrival. Water ran black from the taps and, by the evening, a thin film clung to my hands and face. The town was built near another huge steel plant and was itself surrounded by the slag heaps of coal mines. On these and other occasions, the question inevitably arises: how can people live like that; how can they let it happen? To these questions, Murray Feshbach, a US academic, and Alfred Friendly, a journalist and former Moscow bureau chief of Newsweek magazine, provide the answers in a well-researched and frightening book. The citizens of the former Soviet Union live like that because they have no choice. Cherepovets and Novokuznetsk are not the worst; and even if they were, a move to another town would not bring much relief. How did this environmental catastrophe arise? Feshbach and Friendly make the now familiar but more than usually well-documented case that it is largely the product of the idealism released by the Bolshevik revolution and turned loose upon nature by the grandiose projects of the Stalin period. 'For the environment the central planning system became Frankenstein's monster. The fatal flaw was not necessarily in the nature of planning but in the yardstick - gross output - that Soviet planners used to set their targets and measure their progress . . . 'Most damaging of all to nature, the planning system treated all natural resources - land, water, mineral deposits and forests - as state property, virtually as a free good, the cost of which to the user was either minimal or nil.' The results have been the sunken villages of Cherepovets and the nausea of Novokuznetsk; the ruin of Lake Baikal and of the Aral Sea; the high risk of respiratory illness which threatens some 70m city dwellers; an infant mortality rate of 33 per thousand, on a par with the third world; and the constant danger posed by a dozen operational Chernobyl-style reactors. Dr Grigory Barenboim, an environmental consultant, is quoted as saying: 'We have become an environmental testing ground for the whole world and an ecological threat for the entire planet.' The authors themselves say: 'In the last decade of the 20th century, there are no leading industrial cities in the Soviet Union where air pollution is not shortening the life expectancy of adults and undermining the health of their children. The growth that made the USSR a superpower has been so ill-managed, so greedy in its exploitation of natural resources and so indifferent to the health of its people, that ecocide is inevitable.' Such ecological violence is no longer a secret within the republics of the former Soviet Union - though it was until the late 1980s. Then a series of angry liberals - including the late physicist and human rights campaigner, Andrei Sakharov, and Russian nationalists like the writer Valentin Rasputin  -put the destruction of their environment in the vanguard of their campaigns. As Feshbach and Friendly show, a great many ordinary people, especially women with children, began to protest spontaneously in the late-1980s, and almost immediately forced a demoralised Communist party on to the defensive. It has had an effect. In Cherepovets, for example, the steelworks is switching to using less polluting coke dust - partly a result of government tax incentives. Some nuclear powerstations have been shut (contributing to a shortage of electricity), and Lake Baikal may be saved, due in part to a vigorous campaign by the Russian environment ministry. But more has remained unchanged. A 1985 decree which ordered the closure of ecologically dangerous metalworks in Chelyabinsk and Magnitogorsk has been rescinded. The metallurgical ministry sent a circular asking the inhabitants to 'understand the difficult situation in the country' and to 'demonstrate responsibility and provide help to the nation's economy'. But, as the authors say, 'demonstrating responsibility means accepting the prolongation of ecocide'.</p>

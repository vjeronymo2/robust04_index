			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Stoiber to become Bavarian PM After 10 days of negotiations, the leaders of Bavaria's Christian Social Union, junior partners in the Bonn coalition, decided yesterday that Mr Edmund Stoiber should become the new Bavarian prime minister, after Mr Max Streibl resigns in the summer, writes Quentin Peel. The decision means that Mr Theo Waigel, the party leader, will remain finance minister in the Bonn government - although it was clear that he would have preferred to come home to Bavaria. Mr Stoiber, now interior minister in Munich, has emerged as the strong man in the CSU, but has agreed to step down from his post as deputy party leader as part of the compromise.</p>

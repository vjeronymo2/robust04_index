			<p>930428 FT  28 APR 93 / Police reject criticism of blast prevention policy CITY of London Police mounted a robust defence yesterday of criticisms that it might have done more to prevent Saturday's bomb. Commander Hugh Moore, responsible for operational policing of the City, said: 'There is nowhere in the world that has more police officers in a square mile.' He said the force had been the first in the country to instigate armed road checks, which were were introduced after the Baltic Exchange bomb last year. The last check before the latest bombing had been carried out on Friday night. The force has been under increasing pressure from other police forces, politicians and anti-terrorist experts worried about whether the City's policing is adequate to counter the terrorist threat of the IRA. Cmdr Moore said: 'We have surveillance cameras everywhere. This lorry (containing the bomb) was seen on surveillance cameras but it doesn't help you. Of course it helps you afterwards but it's no use at the time. Your camera doesn't arrest people. 'The only way to prevent bombings is to stop the vehicle en route because once it gets into position with the bomb set you can't do much about it unless a bomb expert can get into it and defuse it.' He was speaking after Mr John Burrow, the president of the Association of Chief Constables, asked for authority to mount roadblocks if forces considered there was a security risk. At present police are allowed to carry out spot checks only if they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. Any extension would need to be approved by parliament. Details emerged yesterday of the extent to which the IRA had wrong-footed MI5 and police throughout the country. The IRA operation leading to the bomb was was well under way on March 20 when the tipper truck used in the attack was stolen. Ten hours before the bomb went off a message, based on MI5 intelligence and circulated by Special Branch to all 43 police forces around the country, could not be more specific than to request greater vigilance because of the 'heightened threat of terrorist attack'. Neither MI5 nor Special Branch was able to pinpoint a time, target, or city. It is thought that if the message had been able to do so the IRA would almost certainly have aborted its bombing operation. One police source said yesterday: 'We have had that sort of message many times before this year and it has not always led to a bomb going off.' Mr Barry Sheerman, Labour's frontbench spokesman on the disabled, who spent four years as the party's spokesman on home affairs, said that the bomb was further evidence that a national police force was needed on the lines of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation to tackle the IRA. Professor Paul Wilkinson, an anti-terrorist expert based at St Andrews University, said the weekend bomb had demonstrated a lack of co-ordinated police response. It had, he said, also showed that the City of London police did not have the resources to deal with the terrorist threat.</p>

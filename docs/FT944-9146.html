			<p>941116 FT  16 NOV 94 / International Company News: Lower tax bill helps Telefonica Telefonica de Espana, Spain's state-run telecommunications group, lifted consolidated net profit in the first nine months of 1994 by 17 per cent, to Pta86.61bn (Dollars 68.12m) from Pta73.72bn last time, AP-DJ reports from Madrid. Pre-tax profit climbed 11 per cent to Pta104.65bn from Pta94.68bn. The high growth in net profit is attributable to the declining corporate tax burden, which is now around 17 per cent of profit. However, with 7.6 per cent growth in operating expenses, group operating profits advanced 3.8 per cent to Pta289.7bn from Pta278.98bn. Telefonica said subsidiaries' contributions to group pre-tax profits jumped to 15.7 per cent in the first nine months, from 9.5 per cent in the first half. Iberdrola, Spain's largest private electric utility, pushed up consolidated net profit in the first nine months of 1994 by 43 per cent to Pta60.05bn from Pta41.96bn last time.</p>

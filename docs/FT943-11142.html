			<p>940801 FT  01 AUG 94 / Unilever fights soap war with environmental claims Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group, has opened a new front in its battle over washing powders with US rival Procter and Gamble by pointing to the environmental impact. It claims that its Persil Power powder is environmentally friendlier than predecessors and rivals. It maintains that the manufacture of the powder uses 80 per cent less energy, achieved by abandoning a process of blowing hot air through a slurry spray to make a dry powder. The new method involves only dry ingredients. The company says the powder's manganese-based catalyst allows consumers to wash clothes at a lower temperature. This could save about 5 per cent in electricity consumption, equivalent to 25p on a Pounds 5 box or about Pounds 3 a year, said Mr Rudy Bircher, head of the detergents environment group at the company. The company also claims the catalyst enables less powder to be used: 30 washes need 2.35kg of Persil Power compared with 2.8kg of Ariel Ultra, its P&amp;G-made rival. Unilever's counter-attack follows accusations from P&amp;G that the catalyst, called Accelerator, damages clothes. The allegations were reiterated in a media campaign by P&amp;G over the weekend. Unilever, which has cut the amount of the catalyst in the formula, denied the suggestion that clothes had been damaged significantly. It added that wearing clothes caused two-thirds of fabric damage, with a further 10-20 per cent caused by the mechanical action of washing machines. The Anglo-Dutch company is reluctant to attack its rivals' products directly in public, even though it acknowledges that P&amp;G has broken an unwritten code that prevents direct brand comparisons in UK advertising. It has prepared a list of claims to environmental superiority for Persil Power including a 30 per cent improvement in biodegradability and toxicity compared with other detergents. Companies have become more conscious of their products' environmental impact recently. Several countries in Europe have banned phosphates in washing powders because of water pollution from washing machines.</p>

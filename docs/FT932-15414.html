			<p>930414 FT  14 APR 93 / Japan unveils Pounds 76bn recovery plan: Tax and public spending package lifts share prices and wins cautious US approval JAPAN yesterday unveiled a Y13,200bn (Pounds 76bn) economic package aimed at reviving its troubled economy and combating protectionist pressures over the growing Japanese trade surplus with America and Europe. The package of public investment and tax concessions - the government's second large boost to the economy in nine months - was greeted by a 4.3 per cent surge in stock prices and a cautious welcome from US officials in Tokyo for a meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations. The Nikkei average closed above 20,000 for the first time in more than a year. It ended 858.15 higher at 20,740.29, or 44 per cent above its August low at the time of the previous package. Share prices were little changed in early trading this morning. Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the visiting US Treasury secretary, said yesterday Japan was in the 'very fortunate position' of having the financial resources to contribute to international growth. The ruling Liberal Democratic party said the stimulus would ensure that the country was set 'on the path to recovery'. Japanese economic growth slumped to post-war lows over the past two years, following the collapse in the Tokyo stock market in early 1990. Demand for imports from the rest of the world fell while troubled Japanese banks dogged by bad debts have cut international lending. Business organisations welcomed the spending proposals, which, in raw terms, exceeded the Y10,700bn announced in August. But retailers, looking to rekindle consumer demand, were disappointed an income tax cut was not included. Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, prime minister, said the package should enable the country to meet its official forecast of 3.3 per cent growth for the fiscal year, ending in March. But the plan is heavily weighted towards public works investment, prompting concern among private economists that it could create a spending bottleneck that will work against a balanced recovery. Apart from Y4,170bn in fresh public works spending and Y1,600bn in early purchases of land for public projects, the package includes a commitment to contract at least 75 per cent of public works funds already budgeted for this fiscal year by the end of the first half. Other measures include: Y1,150bn to be invested in 'social infrastructure'. The amount includes funds for the purchase of technology by universities and medical institutes. Y3,500bn in new investment by local governments. Y1,800bn in new funds for government housing loan companies, and lower interest rates for borrowers from those companies. Y1,910bn for government-affiliated financial institutions which provide funds to small and medium-sized companies. Mr Miyazawa plans to explain the details of the package to US President Bill Clinton in Washington during a meeting scheduled for Friday. The Japanese leader had insisted that the amount be decided before his departure for the US, where Japan has been criticised for not encouraging economic growth. But the US may raise questions about how much of the package is fresh money, and how much is a front-loading of existing plans. Mr Bentsen expressed 'hope' the package would cut the country's overall trade surplus, and 'create a better balance in trade between Japan and the US'.

			<p>930111 FT  11 JAN 93 / The Lex Column: A glut of gilts Despite the Bank of England's silence on Friday, the gilts market is braced for an auction announcement this week. Favoured is a further issue of 8.5 per cent paper due 2007 which will become deliverable into the gilt future later this year. A partly-paid structure would also increase demand and, coincidentally, allow the government to tuck away funds for 1993-94 when it has to borrow Pounds 1bn a week. But it will take more than a little stocking up to satisfy that need. Indeed, the authorities must already be examining a range of structures that might help tap particular pockets of cash. An obvious one is the convertible gilt. That would involve selling short term paper, convertible into long. Institutions with long-term investment horizons could then profit from any buoyancy at the short end of the market as European rates fall. Another candidate for revival is variable rate gilts - which might have special appeal to banks if the funding rules were changed. Or the Bank could borrow a Euromarket concept and issue gilts convertible into residual shares held by the government in privatised companies. To attract overseas investors it could issue gilts redeemable in D-Marks at a guaranteed exchange rate. Such innovations might give the impression of desperation. If they were tailored to satisfy genuine investor requirements, however, they might help at the margin. There is no single solution to the looming funding problem. The Bank may also have to act on the suggestion from Warburg Securities that it move to monthly auctions. Ultimately, however, meeting the borrowing requirement will depend on attracting overseas money. That will require a wider difference between gilt yields and German Bunds than the present 140 basis points. The question is whether this will be achieved through higher yields on gilts or lower ones on Bunds.</p>

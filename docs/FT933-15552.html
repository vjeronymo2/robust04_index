			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lawson urges independent Bank HANDING the Bank of England responsibility for monetary policy would lead to lower interest rates and strengthen the accountability of bank officials, Lord Lawson, the former chancellor, said yesterday. Giving evidence to the Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee, Lord Lawson said the present system under which which politicians controlled interest rates led to international investors demanding a 'risk premium' when buying sterling and threatened the UK's anti-inflation credentials. However Lord Lawson's views were opposed by Lord Healey, a former Labour chancellor, who told the committee he was 'an agnostic veering towards scepticism' on the need for an independent bank. He said Bank officials would not necessarily have a better success than government ministers in economic stewardship. Mr Kenneth Clarke is to make his first appearance as chancellor before the Treasury and Civil Service committee on July 21.</p>

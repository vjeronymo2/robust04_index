			<p>CSO     [Text] NEC has agreed with the China Academy of Science to  establish in Beijing a joint-venture company for research and  development of computer software. It will be inaugurated in the  middle of next month by joint financing with the Software  Research Institute under the Academy of Science umbrella. They  will deal in middleware used in open systems, software  development tools for the Chinese market, and changing basic  software (OS) [operating systems] into Chinese. The software  research and development company joint venture is a first in  China, and NEC will secure a foothold in the software business  in China, which is expected to be a computer growth market.    The new company will be "NEC-China Academy of Science  Software Research Institute Limited Corporation." It is  scheduled to be established on 15 June, the head office will be  in Beijing, and NEC manager Yasutsugu Kokubo has been appointed  president. The capital is 150 million yen; NEC will invest 90  percent and the China Academy of Science Software Research  Institute, which is the software division of the China Academy  of Science, will invest 10 percent. The period of the joint  venture is 12 years.    Initially, they will start with a staff of 50 people with  researchers at the Software Institute as the core, and will  expand to 200 people in the future. The main targets of research  and development will be middleware to open construction of  systems connecting different kinds of work stations and personal  computers and multimedia-related software. Moreover, they will  be in charge of development of CASE [computer-aided software  engineering] (software development using computers) tools for  the Chinese market and making UNIX and other OS Chinese.    Commissioned research and development from NEC will be at  the  center, but they aim to increase independent research gradually  and acquire orders other than from NEC. Sales are projected at  60 million yen in the first fiscal year and 200 million after  five years. NEC evaluates the Software Research Institute with  which they have had a cooperative relationship in software  development for five years as "a research agency where the  highest level of engineers are gathered in China" (Senior  director Makoto Kobayashi), and they decided to utilize it  further as a strategic NEC base for the Chinese market.</p>

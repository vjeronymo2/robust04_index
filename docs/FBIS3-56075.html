As  members of the commission stressed, the incident revealed  several shortcomings in the Latvian legislation and the defense  system. This action was to a great extent facilitated by the  ill-sorted legislation of the country.    Rucs formally acted in accordance with the law on local  government property, which provides for taking over the army  property situated on the territory of local governments, but  there are no rules as to how the takeover should proceed.    The chairman of the commission, Aleksandr Kirsteins, had  been  informed about the planned takeover of military installations  belonging to the Russian army in Vidzeme district of Riga, but  he did not know how it would proceed. In addition, the plan of  that action was not discussed by the foreign affairs commission,  as Rucs has claimed in an interview to the ATMODA ATPUTAI  newspaper.    Latvia's Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs for his part  expressed indignation that the government had not been informed  about such an action, because the Latvian Government has to take  all responsibility now.    Martins Virsis, head of the Latvian delegation for talks  with  Russia, admitted at the commission's session that Russia's  reaction to that incident was nevertheless much sharper than is  internationally accepted. According to Martins Virsis, Rucs'  actions were not serious enough to cause the mobilization of the  Pskov division near the Latvian border.</p>

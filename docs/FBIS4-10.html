			<p>SUMMARY                                  While El Salvador's leftist coalition is unlikely to win the  runoff elections for president next month, the former rebels in  the coalition are looking to become the main opposition force in  the legislature where the final vote remains undecided.                             END SUMMARY      The 20 March contest to elect a new president, deputies to the  Legislative Assembly and mayors--the first elections held since  the January 1992 Chapultepec peace accords ended El Salvador's  civil war--left the ruling party frontrunner just short of the  absolute majority needed to win the presidency.  Consequently, on  24 April, Armando Calderon Sol, candidate from the ruling right-  wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (ARENA) party--who won 49.03  percent of the vote according to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal  (TSE)--will face the second highest vote-getter, leftist  candidate Ruben Zamora.  Zamora, representing the Democratic  Convergence (CD), an electoral coaliton of leftist parties,  including the former rebels of the Farabundo Marti National  Liberation Front (FMLN), won 24.90 percent of the vote, according  to TSE figures (San Salvador Canal Doce Television, 31 March)  (See Note 1).      (Note 1) Beset by internal divisions, the former ruling party  during the mid-1980's, the Christian Democratic Party, took only  16.39 percent of the presidential vote (Canal Doce Television, 31  March).      Campaign rhetoric notwithstanding, Zamora is unlikely to boost  his percentage of the presidential vote in the April elections by  the nearly 26 percent required to win the presidency.  The CD  candidate's plans "to win the presidency in the runoff" by  reaching out to a broader "coalition of forces "--expressed by  Zamora on 22 March in a television interview--will unlikely  generate enough additional votes given the "decision" by the  centrist Christian Democratic Party (PDC) not to endorse the  leftist candidate (Panama City ACAN, 25 March) (See Note 2).      (Note 2) The PDC declined to endores the ARENA candidate, as  well.      Although Zamora also suggested that the elimination of  administrative obstacles facing voters during the March elections  would help the CD ticket win in April, prominent FMLN leader  Joaquin Villalobos indicated that "anomalies" in the voting  process would probably make little difference in the presidential  vote (See Note 3).  Thus, although Zamora asserted that it is to  the CD's "advantage" to have "another opportunity to correct. .  . the serious deficiencies of the first election," in a press  conference on 22 March, Villalobos noted that alleged incidents  of electoral fraud "may not affect the final outcome of the  presidential elections" (Canal Doce Television, 22 March).      (Note 3) According to the United Nations Observers for El  Salvador, some 25,000 Salvadorans--out of approximately 2.5  million eligible voters--were unable to vote on 20 March because  their names did not appear on voter registers (San Salvador Radio  Cadena YSKL, 22 March).      Focus on Legislature      On the other hand, Villalobos indicated that the FMLN viewed  voting irregularities as a much more significant issue in the  legislative--and mayoral--races and suggested that his party will  push to have votes it considers affected by "fraud" resolved in  the FMLN's favor.  In comparison to the presidential race,  Villalobos noted that electoral irregularities "did indeed  affect" the March legislative elections because local elections  can be "decided" by a relatively small number of votes.  Reflecting the FMLN's concern that irregularities in voting  results could deprive the FMLN of seats in the legislature--where  it stands to become the main political opposition--Villalobos  indicated that because the FMLN is "extremely worried" that  "anomalies" in the deputy vote count "are designed to establish a  PCN-ARENA majority in the Legislative Assembly," it is  "contesting" questionable vote counts through "legal means,"  presumably by appealing to the Supreme Electoral Tribunal (San  Salvador Radio Maya Vision, 23 March) (See Note 4).      (Note 4) "Unofficial" figures on the vote for deputies to the 84-  seat Legislative Assembly, indicate that, on the right, ARENA won  40 seats and the National Conciliation Party (PCN), 3.  Among the  opposition parties of the center and left, the PDC won 16; the  FMLN, 20; and the CD, 3.  A remaining seat was won by an  evangelical party (San Salvador Radio Cadena YSKL, 22 March).      Outlook      Although the Salvadoran left will continue to promote the  upcoming presidential runoff as an opportunity for victory over  the ruling ARENA party, at best the elections will enhance the  left's position as a viable political force if leftist candidate  Zamora manages to better last month's vote count.  A more  important indication of the left's performance in its first  meaningful participation in electoral politics will be the number  of seats it can gain in the Legislative Assembly, where the  former rebels stand to become the main opposition party.

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / Millions lost in securities affair The closure of an obscure investment company in the Philippines after some of its staff absconded with investor funds estimated at up to 900m pesos (Pounds 22m) has shaken the local banking community. Securities traders at Bancapital Development Corp, owned by a group of little-known investors in Manila and trading on the secondary market, apparently persuaded several financial institutions to buy government bonds through the investment company, but no actual delivery of the corresponding certificates were made. The traders are now missing, thought to have fled the country. Mr Gabriel Singson, governor of the central bank, yesterday identified one commercial bank in a rare statement about the scandal. Bank of Commerce, a medium-sized bank in which Bank of Boston has a minority stake, had sought emergency loans of 1bn pesos to cope with a run on deposits, he said. It and another bank he refused to identify had lost some 559m pesos worth of investments in Bancapital. The admission of the affair - and the resulting wave of withdrawals - was prompted by news yesterday that a Bank of Commerce senior executive had apparently committed suicide. Officials said the bank had been under quiet investigation for its losses. Mr Singson said assistance would be given to all banks that wanted it. The Bankers Association of the Philippines, which groups all the domestic private commercial banks, has also promised help for members to ensure that the banking system 'remains stable.' The runs on banks yesterday appeared limited only to a few suspected of having placed investments in Bancapital. The central bank investigation has so far been limited to banks that invested funds in Bancapital. The investment company itself was not under investigation because it was a 'non-accredited' institution, that is not licensed to trade in securities. This is the second big financial scandal in Manila this year. In January, a Chinese-Filipino businessman disappeared with unpaid debts to both banks and informal lenders in Manila's Chinatown of some 200m pesos.</p>

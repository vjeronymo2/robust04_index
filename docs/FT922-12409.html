			<p>920418 FT  18 APR 92 / Travel: Exile's end - Snapshot THE HEDGES look bruised, battered and skeletal from their annual encounter with the trimmer's flail. Rain falls from a slate-grey sky. The wind howls. 'On a clear day', says Peter Heard, cheerfully, 'you can see Ireland and Snowdonia.' On a clear day you can probably see the end of the lane from Heard's farmhouse hotel - but it was not a clear day. Conclusion: the Gwaun Valley in winter is no place for the weak in spirit. Less hardy souls must try it in spring or summer when it lacks its broody Welsh darkness and exudes a lighter quality. The area, on the edge of the Preseli hills, is so little travelled that grass grows up the middle of the many twisting tracks which criss-cross it. It is this isolation which has winkled away so many people from town and city to west Wales. When they arrive they find they have to earn a living. Many set up hotels, shops, craft galleries, potteries and other small businesses to serve the few determined tourists who do encroach on their seclusion. Heard is one such exile. An Essex man beavering away at the Bank of England, he did the classic career U-turn to set up every townie's dream - Tregynon, a stone-built country farmhouse hotel, complete with oak beams and inglenook fireplace. Preseli has that sort of effect on you. Once there you are in the grip of a strange atmosphere, a kind of have-I-been-here-before? enchantment which is hard to shake. The area's links with an ancient past would be evident even to a Millwall soccer fan. You cannot turn a corner in this part of Wales without falling over a standing stone, a cromlech or the remains of an ancient fort. Carn Ingli is one of those compelling piles of stone which you have to climb. At the top, legend has it, you can talk to the angels. Centuries ago, it is said, St Brynach used to do just that. The present meets the past in all sorts of curious ways in the Gwaun Valley. This tree-lined ice-age gorge keeps traditions alive that have vanished elsewhere. Every January, 13 children dash from cottage to cottage wishing their neighbours blwyddn newydd dda - a happy new year. They are a fortnight late because they still keep to the Roman calendar. My husband, a south Pembrokeshire man, swears that the hunting of the wren took place there within living memory . . . but I could not find anyone who could substantiate his claim. Badgers, buzzards, herons and ravens have found a home in the valley. Red kites, falcons, polecats and otters are occasionally spotted. So are candle-makers, wood-turners, weavers and the like . . . but rarely in the depths of winter. Spring finds all God's creatures stirring from their winter hibernation. Above the tall hedges, filled with flower and budded hawthorn, aching for the coming of spring, you can catch glimpses of the big Welsh world beyond. Tregynon Country Farmhouse Hotel, Gwaun Valley, near Fishguard, Pembrokeshire, is a good place to stay and, more importantly in an area not renowned for its cuisine, to eat. Tel: 0239-820531, fax: 0239-820808. Bed and breakfast from Pounds 19.90 per person. Three course dinner Pounds 12.25.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Pyongyang, March 31 (KCNA) -- Now that we have  undergone an inspection enough for the continuity of safeguards  as we had agreed with the IAEA, the United Nations Security  Council has no reason or justification to discuss our issue,  declared a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today.    The continued discussions of our issue at the U.N. Security  Council only give the impression that the international  organisation is courting the favor of a country and this may be  a living example that even international organisations are used  for the attainment of the U.S. egoistic aim, the spokesman said.    Answering questions put by KCNA about the attempt of the  United States to justify its campaign for pressure on the DPRK  with the allegation that the DPRK did not allow a proper  inspection for the continuity of safeguards, the spokesman went  on:    If the U.N. Security Council truly wants to discharge its  mission, it must not argue about the DPRK, the victim, but argue  about the acts of the United States, the assaulter, and put  pressure on it.    If the U.N. Security Council, departing from the principle  of  impartiality, defends the United States, the assaulter, for the  reason that it is a big power and puts unwarrantable pressure  upon the victim for the reason that it is a small country, the  small countries will no more trust the United Nations.    The U.N. Security Council must not be used as a rostrum for  putting unreasonable pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear  issue.    In order to pave the way for a solution to the nuclear  issue,  the United States must no more pursue a hostile policy toward  Korea, first of all.    Since the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused  by  the U.S. policy to stifle our system, if it is to be solved, the  United States must take measures first for removing the nuclear  threat to us and giving up the hostile policy.    It is nonsensical to urge us to accept an additional  inspection, the spokesman said, and went on:    If the United States continues to misuse our sincere efforts  to resolve the nuclear issue, we would no longer pin hope on the  DPRK-USA talks and will counter any pressure to the end.    But, if the United States put a stop to the international  pressure campaign against the DPRK and proceed with the  reestablishment of the foundation of the DPRK-USA talks, we  would not oppose a negotiated solution to the issue.</p>

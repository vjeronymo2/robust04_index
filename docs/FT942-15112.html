			<p>940416 FT  16 APR 94 / Outdoors: The workers bring out their dead - As the snow melts in the Pennines, Gerry Northam lifts the lid on his hive and finds signs of life / Bees in a cold climate When winter reaches the first of its false ends, with a day of unexpected mildness, beekeepers look for a sign that life in the hive goes on. A few pioneering worker bees appear at the hive entrance, toddle out from the warm cluster inside and take short flights. This is the first we have seen of them since early December, when they went into a protective huddle, meditating rather than hibernating in a mass state of reduced animation. In the bitter days and nights of winter, the only safe way to check that they are still alive is to get down on all fours, press your ear to the hive entrance and knock sharply on the side. If a small apian roar goes up like a football crowd then, for the while, all is well. But you still wait anxiously for the weather to turn, hoping to see bees venture out and begin exploring. It has been a particularly nervous winter for us waiting to learn if our two colonies could survive in a garden perched 1,200 feet up in the Pennines at the very margin of existence for honey bees. When we moved to this altitude the three hives we brought with us died out in a matter of weeks and it was only by catching a local swarm that we had any bees at all. We later divided it to make a second colony and began our winter vigil. The moment of reassurance arrived relatively early when both hives came alive in the second week of February. They began tentatively, not wanting to risk the lives of too many workers, but within half an hour they were flying out in great numbers and returning from the snowdrops and winter heather with tiny packs of pollen round their legs like thick woollen socks. This was good news because pollen feeds the brood and bees taking it into the hive raise hopes that the queen is in good health and about to begin laying eggs for the Spring. But this activity was soon brought to a halt by another of the familiar chill downpours which our neighbours in Buxton, Derbyshire, regard as light showers. It was two weeks before we saw the bees again, but it was worth the wait for what proved to be an extraordinary display. On the last Sunday in February the morning was once again mild and thick snow from the previous week was starting to melt as the elderly bees in both hives started the laborious ritual of bringing out their dead. One by one they dumped bodies outside their city wall and left them to rot. For a radius of 6 ft from the entrance-board dark corpses stood out against the snow, most of them motionless, some not quite dead and twitching pathetically for a few minutes on an old leg or a frayed wing until, like tiny Geralds in Women in Love, their hearts fell silent and froze. For the few hours the snow remained, they made a stark tableau as they lay scattered by the first of the hives' seasonal spectacles of death. It was a further three weeks before the continuing vigour of life was made equally apparent on opening up the hives and taking a look inside. Lifting the roof from a beehive is an act of Zen which requires alert stillness and a strong veil. I had both as I made my first inspection at the end of March. Just below the roof the upper box holds 10 frames of comb and was so full of bees that I had to take care not to crush any of them as I lifted the combs one at a time. Starting at the edge, two frames were still full of last season's honey which the bees are going to need for several weeks yet. Working inwards, a couple of frames had a crescent of white-capped honeycomb at the sides and top, and a dense block of bumpy brown cappings in the centre where the brood was laid, each hexagonal cell holding a growing grub. There were one or two cells where holes had been bitten in the capping from the inside and a little head was struggling to break through. Most of the comb on the next two frames had not yet been capped and when I gently shook the bees off there were hundreds of freshly-laid eggs, proof of an active and prolific queen. Some of the eggs were only hours old, looking like minute grains of rice pointing up from the bottom of their cells, while others had become curved and plump after sitting for a few days in royal jelly. It will take them less than three weeks to grow to full lifesize and emerge as worker bees themselves. Both hives had the ingredients of success - plenty of brood and good stores of honey. The coming months will show how well they actually succeed here at the edge of survival.</p>

			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HE'S BACK!;  </P> <P> BUST OF ELVIS RESURRECTED; BUYERS ALREADY BIDDING  </P> <P> That 1,400-pound bust of Elvis Presley -- used on Mississippi's float in the  Rose Parade a year ago and later sent to the scrap heap -- has been resurrected  for a bid equivalent to 5.4 cents per pound.  </P> <P> Los Angeles sculptor Ralph Eaton and his partner, Brett Waller, are willing to  pay $75 for the battered and crumbling bust and removing it from a Jackson  scrap yard where it has been moldering for about eight months.  </P> <P> But the singer's Graceland estate also wants the bust, as does a Los Angeles  radio station that trucked it to his Memphis, Tenn., mansion as a publicity  stunt in January.  </P> <P> Mississippi's Tournament of Roses float included busts of three other  Mississippi musicians: blues guitarist B. B. King, country star Tammy Wynette  and opera singer Leontyne Price.  </P> <P> Those three busts were dismantled in Pasadena after the parade. But two Los  Angeles morning disc jockeys, "Mark and Brian," salvaged the Presley bust for a  cross-country trip to Graceland.  </P> <P> Graceland Executive Director Jack Soden said the radio jokesters exploited the  Presley estate.  </P> <P> Soden wasn't any happier to learn Wednesday that the bust will be resurrected.  </P> <P> Soden said he hopes to make an offer on the bust as well, starting at a bid of  $76, a dollar higher than Eaton and Waller. "That's one way to make the problem  go away," Soden said.  </P> <P> But Soden will have to get in line with Los Angeles radio station KLOS-FM,  which wants it back in Los Angeles for Presley's birthday Jan. 8.  </P> <P> The scrap yard, Cash for Cans, bought the bust for $13.80 from the Mississippi  Tournament of Roses Assn., which raised $100,000 to build it.  </P> <P> Eaton, who builds floats for the Rose Parade as a sideline, plans to restore  the 10-foot-tall bust to its regal glory.  </P> <P> "We're great admirers of The King," Eaton said. "After discovering he'd been  sitting in a junkyard, we decided to give him a good home."  </P></p>

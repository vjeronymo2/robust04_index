			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Federation may unleash violence, say Serbs Serb leaders yesterday warned that the preliminary agreement to form a federation reached by Bosnia's Croats and Moslems in Washington could unleash a new wave of violence in former Yugoslavia. They suggested the US was restoring the Moslem-Croat coalition to step up pressure on the Serbs and stressed the key question of territorial division among the three sides remained unresolved. Bosnia's prime minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, said yesterday that he planned to meet Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, in Moscow this week to seek Russia's help in ending the fighting. 'We want the leadership of the US to continue but the Russian role is important when it comes to Serbs,' he said. Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb artillery pounded the Moslem enclave of Maglaj in northern Bosnia where 19,000 refugees have been under siege for most of the past year, and pressed an offensive against the north-western Bihac pocket. UN officials also said Serbs fired on the government town of Breza north of Sarajevo, while rocket-propelled grenades were aimed at Bosnian positions in the capital. In Moscow, Mr Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the Bosnian Serb assembly who is there with the Bosnian Serb leadership, said the Washington agreement was seen as 'an action against the Serbian people. It is incomprehensible to form such an artificial creation which cannot last. . . . (and) aims to isolate Serbs.' Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, told a news conference in Moscow: 'We welcome this agreement if America helps Moslems and Croats move towards peace. But if it helps them to put pressure on Serbs and to gain more territory from them we are against it.' But the leadership in Belgrade appeared more restrained. Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, Serbian foreign minister, said that Serbia supported 'every attempt to stop the war' but warned that the US initiative for Bosnian Croats and Moslems to form a federation and then join Croatia in a confederation could lead to a 'further escalation of crisis'. By contrast, President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia welcomed the agreement 'which paved the way for resolving Croatia's troubles, but most of all the UNPA zones' (Serb-held areas of Croatia under United Nations supervision). However, UN officials yesterday said Mr Tudjman had not given up his plans of creating a Greater Croatia incorporating large parts of northern, central and western Bosnia-Hercegovina. Croatian officials say that the US promised to back the return of the UN zones, part of the self-styled Serb state of Krajina, to Zagreb. But Serb leaders from Krajina, which covers one-third of Croatia, denounced the agreement as 'totally unacceptable'. Extra UK troops row, Page 8</p>

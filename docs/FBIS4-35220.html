			<p>BFN     [Text] Commenting on statements by Robert Pelletreau, U.S.  assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern and South Asian  affairs, on a rift within the Hamas Movement, Hamas official  Muhammad Nazzal said: I defy Pelletreau to name one Hamas  leader inside or outside the occupied territories who is working  to divide the movement, or who has deviated from its consensus  of rejecting participation in the Palestinian authority or in  the self-rule farce.    Nazzal said that the U.S. official's statements are sheer  fabrications and part of the false reports claiming that the  'Arafat leadership has succeeded in gaining the support of  several Hamas leaders in the occupied territories for the  Palestinian Authority, thus deviating from the movement's  constants of rejecting the capitulatory march and abiding by  armed struggle and protracted Jihad until all the Palestinian  national soil is liberated.    Pelletreau has claimed that a rift recently developed within  Hamas in the occupied territories over participation in the  Palestinian National Authority.</p>

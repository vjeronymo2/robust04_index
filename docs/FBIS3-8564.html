			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Sofia, March 10 (BTA) -- The central exchange rate  as of March 14, 1994 will stand at 62 percent and capitalized  interest at an annual 83 percent. Interest on overdrafts on  commercial bank current accounts with the central Bulgarian  National Bank [BNB] as well as overdrafts on obligatory reserves  will be calculated on a daily basis. The BNB yesterday raised  the latter rates more than two-fold to 150 percent and 120  percent, respectively.    The BNB decisions are intended to curb inflationary  expectations, which got an unjustifiably strong boost recently,  more specifically as a result of a sharp plunge of the national  currency, the impending electricity price hike and an upcoming  levy a value added tax, said central bank sources. A BNB  release sent to BTA says the Governing Board is debating and may  take other steps in the same direction.    "We are seeking to above all protect personal savings," said  BNB Governor Todor Vulchev. The BNB is trying to protect the  national currency and expects that necessary steps will be taken  to boost production and the structural reform. International  institutions are also expected to meet commitments to Bulgaria.  The present measures are intended to prevent the soaring dollar  exchange rate from reflecting on internal inflation, i.e. on the  prices of goods on the home market, Vulchev said. [passage  omitted]    In 1993 the central exchange rate was updated five times,  hitting a year high in November (52 percent) and a year low in  August (44 percent). This January it climbed to an all-time  record of 56 percent, with the BNB struggling to head off  speculative hyperinflation and encourage endangered personal  savings.</p>

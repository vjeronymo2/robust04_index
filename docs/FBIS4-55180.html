			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary: "Whose Waters Are Being Disturbed </F> by the Ethnic Albanian Census in Macedonia?"]    [Text] The ethnic Albanian census in The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia [FYROM] has been a topic of discussion for  some time. It was initially planned to begin in late April, but  thus far there have only been long meetings and endless debates.    The ethnic Albanians in Macedonia have demanded changes to  the draft census law, particularly those provisions that  encroach on the Albanians' right to declare themselves in their  own mother tongue, in other words to fill in the census forms in  the Albanian language. These requests have been supported also  by the European Community, which has conditioned its funding for  the census campaign upon their fulfillment. However, the  Macedonian side does not agree, arguing that this would infringe  Macedonia's constitution. It is actually the same constitution  that the Albanians previously refused to vote for because it did  not treat them as a nationality capable of statehood, as it does  the Macedonians. Aside from the language issue, there are a  number of other contentious clauses in the draft census law  described as discriminating. Among other things, there is a  fairly conspicuous attempt to classify Albanians into various  subdivisions. Thus, Albanians presently living outside their  native area for more than a year have to be registered in  separate forms. Obviously, this differentiation is impervious to  democratic logic and leaves room for falsification. Moreover,  how can the final census figures be reliable when there is only  one single Albanian working in the Macedonian Institute of  Statistics? A single-nation statistics institution in a  multinational state, can very easily issue whatever figures it  chooses, in accordance with the political interests it  represents.    The ethnic Albanian censuses carried out in Macedonia in the  past have more often than not turned into a heated issue, as  happened quite recently in the Skopje parliament.    The truth must come into the open without the slightest  doubt. It is said that Albanians account for more than 40  percent of the republic's entire population, although the  Macedonians say this figure should be halved. Only a census  carried out in accordance with international regulations will  reveal the real truth. Artificial hurdles placed in the way of  its realization serve neither the stability of the republic, nor  peace and good understanding in the region. At a time when  Macedonia has been put in a difficult position because of the  Greek blockade in the south and the Serbian aims in the north  (Milosevic ignores FYROM as a state to the point that he does  not even mention Macedonia in his "Balkan federation project"),  it would be suicidal for this country to incite artificial  conflicts with the Albanians, who undoubtedly are a basic factor  for stability in that country and in the region as a whole.    There is nothing that the ethnic Albanian census in  Macedonia  could disturb, aside from the chauvinistic waters whose sources  can be traced to somewhere in Belgrade. Let us hope that reason  will finally triumph, in the interests of the Macedonians,  Albanians, FYROM, and the interests of tranquility and peace in  the Balkan peninsula.</p>

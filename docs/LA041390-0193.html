			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> TV'S 'WORKING GIRL' UNRUFFLED BY PART  </P> <P> Sandra Bullock could be taking a risk by starring in the television series  "Working Girl," which premieres Monday night on NBC. After all, Melanie  Griffith received an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Tess McGill in the  hit film of the same name. But Bullock seems as philosophical as any working  girl about the possible pitfalls.  </P> <P> "Oh yeah, I knew as soon as I started in on this that I'd probably get some  criticism because of people being judgmental about the movie," Bullock said in  a telephone interview from Los Angeles. "People are going to have their  opinions. But within half of the first show, they'll see it's an ensemble piece  and they'll lighten up on me."  </P> <P> Bullock has finished 13 episodes of "Working Girl," and she says she has gained  a great deal of confidence as she has become comfortable in the role, sort of  the way Tess McGill managed to go from secretary to junior executive.  </P> <P> "I'm pretty sure (Melanie) had a lot of herself in the part. She's got one of  those really soft demeanors," Bullock said of the inevitable comparison. "I'm a  little harder on the outside."  </P> <P> Bullock got the role on short notice. The producers had looked at a lot of  actresses when she got a call from her agent. Bullock happened to be in Los  Angeles visiting her boyfriend and was about to return to her home in New York  City.  </P> <P> "I got the part on a Thursday and we started shooting on a Monday," Bullock  recalled. "I was one of the thousands of people they saw. I'm sure they were  looking for a name. I was very lucky. It was all so fast."  </P> <P> Bullock went into "Working Girl" with a short but recognized list of credits.  She had favorable reviews for her work in an off-Broadway play, "No Time Flat,"  and later had roles in the television movies, "The Preppie Murder" and "The  Bionic Showdown." She also will appear in two films set for release later this  year, "Who Shot Pat?" and "Religion, Inc."  </P></p>

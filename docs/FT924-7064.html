			<p>921118 FT  18 NOV 92 / International Company News: ANZ surprises market with ADollars 579m net losses for year AUSTRALIA and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) yesterday surprised the markets by announcing net losses of ADollars 579m (USDollars 399.3m) for the year ended September, after provisions of ADollars 1.9bn against bad debts. Mr John Gough, chairman, said the write-offs followed a rigorous review of the bank's provisioning policy by Mr Don Mercer, who took over as chief executive six weeks ago. The result was in contrast to the interim announcement in May, when the bank reported a net profit of ADollars 171m, and forecast an improvement in the second half. Last year the bank made net profits of ADollars 267.3m after bad debt provisions of ADollars 1.04bn. Mr Gough said the tougher approach to provisioning followed a reassesment of economic prospects by the new management, which was much less confident of the prospects for growth in the sluggish Australian economy. However, he said the high level of provisions had not been prompted by the tough action taken by Westpac Banking Corporation, which wrote off ADollars 2.7bn against bad debts at the half-way stage. Mr Gough said the write-offs had cleared the decks. He forecast 'a reasonable profit recovery in the current year, and a progressive improvement in ANZ's performance over the next two to three years'. ANZ shares, which traded at up to ADollars 2.63 before the announcement, closed unchanged at ADollars 2.53, partly in response to the final dividend of 10 cents, making an unchanged total of 20 cents. The shares were also supported by announcements from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agencies, which said the result would have no effect on the bank's credit ratings. However, the dividend was unfranked, compared with last year's fully franked payment, making it less attractive to many shareholders. Mr Gough said it would be up to five years before ANZ returned to fully franked dividends. ANZ said its international, New Zealand and Australian retail operations remained profitable. The Australian business banking division reported a net loss of ADollars 797m. Most of the division's problems are in the manufacturing state of Victoria, which has been hardest hit by recession and the effect on business profitability of reductions in protective tariffs. Mr Gough said provisions against bad debts in the current year would be high by historical standards, but much lower than the levels of the past two years. Further reductions were anticipated in the next year. He said the bank had changed its credit control procedures to prevent a re-emergence of the bad debt problem, and had set up an asset management group including outside property and receivership experts to manage non-accrual accounts.</p>

			<p>940729 FT  29 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Cyprus investment bank for Russia The Cyprus Development Bank is setting up an investment bank in the Krasnodar region of Russia, with backing from Greek and Russian banks and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, writes Kerin Hope in Athens. The new bank, to be called Investment Bank of Kuban, is due to start operating in Krasnodar early next year. It aims at channelling funds from private investors and international agencies into tourism and industry under a plan launched last year by the Cyprus and Russian governments to develop the region. The state-controlled CDB, together with Commercial Bank of Greece, will control and manage the new bank, which will have a capital base of Dollars 7m. In addition to the EBRD, two local banks, Kubinbank and Bank of Kuban, will also take equity stakes in the bank. A CDB official said the bank planned to participate in joint ventures in food-processing, timber and cement production, and tourism, identified in a recent UN-backed study of the region as promising sectors for investment.</p>

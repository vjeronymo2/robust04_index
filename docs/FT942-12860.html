			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (6): 'Beauty parade' blues  -A look at the controversy over consultants A handful of top-bracket firms have cornered a disproportionate share of the UK fund management market. This trend has caused tension between the fund management community and pension consultants in the UK. Fund managers complain, privately, that in spite of extensive 'beauty parades' - at great expense to the client and requiring great effort by the fund manager - it is always the same handful of firms which turn up on the short list. The Institutional Fund Managers Association (Ifma), recently wrote to the Society of Pension Consultants asking that its members simplify the extensive questionnaires which are sent to fund managers who are to be considered for a beauty parade. Mr Richard Weir, director-general of Ifma, said that some of these can run to 300 pages and simply seek information already duplicated in annual reports which fund managers make to consultants. For their part, consultants say that even when they try to suggest innovative choices to trustees, their audience, because of its inherently conservative nature, is unwilling to take a chance on a fund manager who bucks the trend either in asset allocation or in approach to investment. 'The concentration has occurred partly through business risk-aversion,' said Mr Bruce Pullman, a director at Quantec, a consultancy firm specialising in quantitative fund management techniques. 'You do not get fired recommending that you buy IBM stock.' This is in marked contrast to the US which, with its huge diversity of fund managers, has seen increasing dispersion of mandates. Yet, the process of manager selection in the US is also guided largely by consultants, who, like their UK counterparts, are usually actuaries. Indeed, in some cases, the UK and US consultants are members of the same firm. What is so puzzling is why supposedly similar advisers in two different countries, when advising roughly the same sorts of businesses should offer such strikingly different advice. The answer, both consultants and trustees say, is complex, but much of it has to do with the genesis of the relationship between pension funds and their investment advisers. Also, the growth of the performance measurement industry in both countries and regulatory differences between the US and the UK have tended to encourage US pension schemes to seek many managers while UK schemes seem content with only a few. While US pension schemes are likely to use numerous specialist managers, each with expertise in investing a particular asset class, UK pension schemes have until now overwhelmingly preferred balanced mandates in which one or two managers have discretion over both asset allocation and stock selection. According to a survey of the UK pension fund market in 1993 by US-based Greenwich Associates, UK corporations using balanced managers have remained roughly stable at 79 per cent of those surveyed for the previous five years. But among the UK subsidiaries of US companies, only 56 per cent seek balanced management, down from 79 per cent in 1989. Overall, both consultants and fund managers say, the trend towards specialist management in the UK could well end the trend to greater concentration of assets in the hands of fewer and fewer managers. Indeed, new research from Combined Actuarial Performance Services (Caps), the performance measurement service, suggests that for the first time, the use of specialist managers in the UK is growing. Meanwhile, performance measurement in both countries has helped shape the nature of manager selection. The fact that UK fund managers are measured against their 'balanced' peer group means it is dangerous to take a big bet on asset allocation. This means that managers are increasingly holding exactly the same asset mix regardless of the client's needs. For trustees, fund managers may look pretty much the same and there is little mileage in choosing one which is not a big name in the business. But in the US, such comprehensive benchmarks simply do not exist. Mr John Williams, researcher at WM Company, another UK performance measurement service, notes that while his service covers roughly 77 per cent of all UK pension assets, no US benchmark covers more than 20 per cent. Because benchmarks are less comprehensive, the concept of an industry norm does not exist in the same way and clients are more willing to consider a wider variety of fund managers. But the reasons for the divergence between the US and UK may be rooted in history. 'Historically in the US, the people who handled a company's commercial banking relationships also managed their pension funds,' said John Gillies, client executive at Frank Russell International, the London-based offshoot of a US consulting firm. But they did not do it well and by the 1970s US pension funds were looking for alternatives. By contrast, UK investment banks were also managing the pension assets of their clients as well, but because they did not see lending as their core function, they took investment management much more seriously. In the UK, for a very long time, pension funds have been largely satisfied with the performance of their fund managers. Research from Caps shows that, despite the accusation that UK pension fund trustees - or indeed, consultants - are too short term in their approach to manager selection, the average fund manager lasts 7.25 years with a single client. But by the early 1970s the science of performance measurement was being perfected in the US, and it became obvious to pension managers that their funds were not being invested well, Mr Gillies said. Then in 1974 the 'Erisa' legislation took effect in the US and companies were forced to pay more attention to investment returns, he said. And while a UK fund manager is typically reporting to a board of trustees of a pension fund client - typically containing human resources professionals and a few scheme members as well - the US fund manager is reporting to a pensions manager and a corporate finance director. 'For a finance director, there is a much sharper link between corporate needs and pension fund performance,' Mr Gillies said. At the same time, US academics were putting to use some of their newly developed theories about portfolio management, and these appealed to corporate finance directors who were also using them in other parts of the business. It was relatively easy, he said, to urge US pension schemes to consider a large number of specialist fund managers, each with expertise in different asset classes.</p>

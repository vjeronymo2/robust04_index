			<p>BFN     [Text] Bangkok, April 7 (1993) -- A Burmese dissident group  Thursday denounced the ongoing constitutional convention in  Rangoon and revealed a split among opposition delegates.    The 702 delegates to the convention, which first met in  January 1993, are drafting a document that will ensure continued  military rule, the All Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF)  said in a statement.    "Such a constitution is merely backbone for the continued  existence of military rule and the political system (being drawn  up) is no more than a military-dominated one," said the  statement by the ABSDF Central Committee.    It noted the 93 delegates from the main opposition National  League for Democracy (NLD) had submitted a 47-page proposal to  the convention on May 26, 1993, and it had been ignored. The  NLD camp is split between those who want to continue attending  the convention and those who want to pull out, it said. Last  December, the NLD leadership ruled its delegates should remain.    Since then, "there has been high tension between the NLD  delegates to the NC (national convention) who believe in  attending the NC and others ... who object to the NC," the  statement said.    The anti-convention group has since proposed standing by the  NLD's 47-page proposal and has said that if the pro-convention  group is not "courageous" enough to do so, the anti-convention  delegates will resign from the drafting body, it said.    The majority of NLD delegates have said that if the  convention does not adopt the party's proposal, they will send a  written objection to the international community, it said.    No NLD spokesman could be reached Thursday for comment, but  another dissident spokesman told AFP it was proper for the ABSDF  to comment on the NLD's actions because the two groups have  "many connections."    The NLD delegates essentially represent all dissident groups  at the constitutional convention. The other delegates represent  other sectors of Burmese society.    The NLD overwhelmingly won the May 1990 national elections  in  Burma, but the ruling junta [word indistinct] to turn over power  and instead cracked down on the opposition.</p>

The soldiers will now have to face legal proceedings in  connection with their participation in an attempted coup that  took place on 27 November 1992.    The coupists arrived on board a Venezuelan Air Force (FAV)  Hercules C-130 aircraft accompanied by Colonel Luis Betancourt  Infante, who accompanied them under orders from the Ministry of  Defense. Meanwhile, 16 soldiers still remain in Peru, including  General Francisco Visconti, one of the leading participants in  the attempt to overthrow former President Carlos Andres Perez.    The group of soldiers (24 officers and 10 subordinates)  arrived at a military base, were taken to the Air Force Academy  Headquarters, and will later be transferred by helicopter to the  Army General Command in Caracas. From there they will be driven  (later tonight) to the division in charge of military personnel  awaiting trial at the San Carlos Garrison, also located in  Caracas.    After appearing before a military court, the group of  soldiers will most likely be released under the authority of a  presidential pardon. This "pacification," as it has been  called, was one of the campaign promises of President Rafael  Caldera.    Yesterday, for example, Lt. Colonel Hugo Chavez, leader of  the 4 February 1992 coup was released along with 14 other  officers. Still pending is the situation surrounding those  military officers remaining in Lima, including Gen. Visconti,  who participated in the second 1992 coup attempt to topple  Perez, which took place on 27 November.</p>

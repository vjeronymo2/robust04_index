			<p><P> April 22, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> 'URBANOPOLIS' FERVOR NOT UNIVERSAL  </P> <P> Re: "Universal's 'Urbanopolis,' " I especially appreciate that local residents  were invited into the design process, that there will be housing planned  specifically for people who will work in the complex (I hope it will be  significantly affordable), and that the complex is pedestrian-oriented "with a  lively and varied communal environment."  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Whiteson's article leaves many critical issues unaddressed:  Where's the green space (beyond the few peek-a-boo palm trees)? Where are the  renewable energy systems? Solar or photovoltaic panels? Where are the pools of  water in various stages of purification for reuse? Where are the roof gardens  and parks on all that flat roof space?  </P> <P> All future development in this city must address how we can build without  diminishing the prospects of future generations.  </P> <P> If we're installing so much pavement that the rainwater goes into sewers and  into the ocean instead of percolating down to replenish the ground-water table,  we're diminishing those prospects! Building in balance with nature is essential  for our future as a city and our future as a species on the planet.  </P> <P> LOIS ARKIN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P> <P>  Arkin is executive director of the Cooperative Resources &amp; Services  Project.  </P> <P> </P></p>

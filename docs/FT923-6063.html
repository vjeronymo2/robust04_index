			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Yugoslavia - The Search for Peace: Disparate groups vie for attention A WORLD of infinite fragmentation along ethnic, religious or linguistic lines was the spectre raised by Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, in an opening speech to the conference on Yugoslavia yesterday, writes Anthony Robinson. Outside it looked as though the patchwork-quilt world was already a reality. The non-official, self-appointed spokesmen for former Yugoslavia's feuding ethnic groups vied for attention with Abkhazians and Ossetians swept up in similar conflicts by the Soviet Union's demise. Ethnic Albanians from Kosovo voiced fears of a similar fate to that of fellow Moslems in Bosnia. Across the square, a middle-aged Kosovan-Serb widow denounced the Kosovan-Albanians for expelling her family from their ancestral home in the former Serb heartland. Conspiracy theories and dubious histories were as thick on the ground outside the conference as inside. British Moslems attacked Bosnia's carve-up with a banner reading 'Inquisition in Spain 1492 - extermination of Bosnia, 1992.' They handed out pamphlets claiming 'the hidden agenda of western governments is to stop the creation of a Moslem state in Europe with a Moslem majority.' Maybe. But 1492 marked the expulsion of the Moors and Jews from Spain, not the Inquisition. Serb supporters of President Slobodan Milosevic rejected Moslem criticism and characterised Serbs as the victims of Moslem chicanery. When Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, walked out of the conference in protest at his observer status, fellow Serbs pointed angrily at the presence of a Saudi Arabian delegation. 'The Saudis are represented and the Bosnian Serbs not. That's crazy,' muttered one. However, some of those on the fringes were there to demonstrate that not all former Yugoslav citizens supported the ethnic divisiveness which has destroyed so much of their country. Ms Vesna Pesic, from the small reformist party, was one of a group of democrats from all Yugoslavia's ethnic groups who held a counter-conference at the National Liberal Club earlier this week. The war would never be stopped if the international community showed indulgence to the criminals who perpetrated it, she said.</p>

			<p>931120 FT  20 NOV 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Tax deductions and rental income I notice the booklet from the Inland Revenue 'Filling in your tax return, Form 11P (1993)' states: 'interest paid is not an allowable deduction from foreign rental income.' When was this change was introduced and on which date it became effective? This has always been the law - a fact which was confirmed in 1982 in Ockendon (Inspector of Taxes) v Mackley (56TC2). No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns. All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible.</p>

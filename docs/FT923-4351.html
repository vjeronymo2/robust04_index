			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Pretoria talks threatened after 24 killed in Ciskei TROOPS from the nominally independent black 'homeland' of Ciskei yesterday shot dead at least 24 demonstrators and wounded nearly 200, putting the future of South African constitutional negotiations into serious jeopardy. The shooting was condemned by the African National Congress as 'unprovoked killing of unarmed demonstrators', but the South African government accused the ANC of deliberately provoking the attack. Witnesses said Ciskei troops opened fire on some 50,000 ANC demonstrators who crossed the border from South Africa. The Pretoria government last night threatened to halt talks with the ANC about the country's future. 'They knew people would be shot, they wanted people to be shot,' said Mr Pik Botha, the foreign minister. 'It's impossible to negotiate with these people because they don't stick to agreements,' he said. 'We must study if we can continue negotiating with the ANC/SACP (South African Communist Party) alliance,' Mr Botha added. Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, the ANC secretary general, said the future of negotiations on a new constitution, suspended since June, was further threatened. 'We cannot just continue as if flies have died,' he said. 'We do not intend to respond meekly to this latest atrocity.' Pretoria said it would send troops to Ciskei at the request of the homeland's government to guard important installations against any retaliatory attacks. Although no South African government forces were involved in the shooting, the ANC blames Pretoria, which provides financial, security and political support to Ciskei. The ANC put the death toll at up to 28. The march, part of the ANC's strategy of mass action to force political concessions from Pretoria, was called to protest at restrictions on political activity in Ciskei. The ANC had legal permission to lead a march only as far as a sports stadium just inside the Ciskei border, but ANC leaders made clear that their aim was to occupy the capital, Bisho, in an attempt to topple Ciskei's military ruler, Brig Oupa Gqozo. The incident was part of a continuing struggle between the ANC and conservative homeland governments for political support in the 10 homelands created under apartheid. The ANC claimed the government of President FW de Klerk failed to restrain Brig Gqozo, who could not continue to rule without Pretoria's support. Mr de Klerk meanwhile was chairing a conference of other homeland leaders in Pretoria to discuss constitutional issues. While only Ciskei troops were involved in the shooting, there was a substantial South African security presence deployed near the Ciskei border. Mr Hernus Kriel, law and order minister, said the incident could have been avoided if conditions imposed on the marchers by a local magistrate had been respected.

			<p>931202 FT  02 DEC 93 / After The Budget: Tories unite to swallow Dr Clarke's bitter medicine - Philip Stephens finds a new mood of accord in the Conservative party as the chancellor's tax and spending measures are absorbed The Conservative party has now to make up its mind. After the first-night applause for Mr Kenneth Clarke's Budget came the inevitable second, more considered, thoughts. After waving their House of Commons papers in delight as the package was unveiled, Tory MPs began to look more closely at the implications. The broad judgment remained the same. Mr Clarke had produced as clever a political package as most could have hoped for to begin digging the government out of that dreadful hole. There have not been many occasions since the general election when MPs from the right and left of the party could appear together on television and say roughly the same thing. But it will not be painless. Higher income taxes, new levies on insurance and air travel, higher petrol prices, and cuts in mortgage interest relief are not the stuff of popularity in the Tory shires. Nor will deep cuts in defence spending, further erosion of the contributory principle behind the welfare state or cuts in student grants enhance the government's popularity. Defence cuts will be a problem and the rumblings were already apparent yesterday. The nasty implications of the overall squeeze for local authority spending and the level of the council tax will be obvious later today with the announcement of next year's grant for local authorities. All this is on top of the hefty tax increases already put in place by Mr Norman Lamont. The realisation is beginning to dawn. You cannot take another Pounds 18bn off public borrowing - as Mr Clarke intends to by 1997-98 - without causing political distress. It hardly provides an auspicious background for the local elections next May and the poll for the European Parliament a month later. Mr John Major's future may well still hinge on the results. But this is a take-it-or-leave-it Budget - as well as what Mr Clarke likes to call a commonsense Budget. His pitch yesterday was that it was the last dose of the bitter medicine that the Tory party must take to recover from the malaise it has suffered since the general election. If it is swallowed quickly, then the Pounds 50bn borrowing hole will begin to disappear. Then the government has a chance at least of political revival. Who knows, Mr Clarke's arithmetic might even allow for the odd 1p off the basic rate of income tax before the next general election. If on the other hand Tory MPs live up to their recent reputation as badly behaved schoolchildren and recoil from the taste, then, as Mr Clarke might put it, 'all bets are off'. The chancellor is in confident form. The virtue of his Budget was that it demonstrated grip and sense of purpose. He would not pretend that a ragbag of measures had added to the rationality of the tax system. Nor that the squeeze on public spending is risk-free. But he offered a plan with a reasonable chance of reducing borrowing to tolerable levels without offering too many targets for the disgruntled and rebellious on his own backbenches. He decided early on after arriving at the Treasury that borrowing would have to come down much faster. A public sector borrowing requirement of 8 per cent of national income seemed too much like an accident waiting to happen. The eventual balance between the Budget's spending cuts and tax increases, however, was fortuitous. Mr Clarke's cabinet colleagues behaved more responsibly than we have come to expect of them. The EDX cabinet committee, charged with sharing out the smaller public spending cake, ran smoothly. It left enough spare cash to defuse the threat of a backbench rebellion over value added tax on domestic fuel. Now the Clarke/Portillo double act - the One Nation chancellor and his Thatcherite chief secretary - will come into play to sell the package. Mr Clarke is dismissive of some of his deputy's more ambitious plans to reduce the size of the welfare state. For months now Mr Michael Portillo has been floating the possibility that people might opt out of the state pension scheme or other universal benefits. The chancellor brushes that ambition aside: 'A welfare state is a key part of the British tradition . . . I regard the state pension as a key part of the welfare state.' But Mr Clarke is smart enough to realise that Mr Portillo's credibility with the unreconstructed Thatcherites on the Tory back benches will be essential to maintain support for the Budget package. He will make the most of it. While the chancellor soothes his natural supporters on the left about his intentions towards the welfare state, Mr Portillo will try to persuade the right that the true path of virtue puts fiscal rectitude first and tax cuts second. The signs last night were that it will be a powerful combination. For at least 24 hours now the Conservative party has looked as if it has decided at last that it wishes to remain the party of government. The only problem is that the real world stretches beyond Westminster. Mr Lamont and Mr Clarke between them have imposed the biggest tax increases in modern history. The squeeze on spending will lead inevitably to a further deterioration in the quality of public services. When they queue for ever-less-frequent trains and see the hefty new deductions from pay packets next April, voters may not take much comfort from the fact that Tories judged it a clever package.</p>

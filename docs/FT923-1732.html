			<p>920922 FT  22 SEP 92 / Judge in BNL loans case rejects call for fresh trial THE judge presiding over the US court case involving Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of illegal Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) turned down last night a request from defence lawyers to order a fresh trial. Lawyers for Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta branch manager, filed a motion last week requesting that Mr Drogoul be allowed to withdraw his previous guilty plea and stand trial. At present Mr Drogoul is facing an unusual sentencing hearing that has been effectively transformed into a mini-trial. Judge Marvin Shoob said, however, he wished to hear a series of government and defence witnesses instead. Mr Drogoul's lawyers have cited declassified US documents and witnesses they say will be produced in court to argue that US intelligence agencies and BNL's Rome headquarters knew of the Iraqi loans, which Baghdad used to fund nuclear, chemical and missile projects. The US government's case is based on the premise that Mr Drogoul was the sole orchestrator of the Iraqi loans, without any knowledge on the part of the bank in Rome. Mr Jake Arbes, one of Mr Drogoul's lawyers, said last night he appreciated the judge's desire to hear evidence. He hinted, however, that a second motion for the guilty plea to be withdrawn could be filed when the sentencing hearing is concluded in a few days. Last weekend the Bush administration released a CIA letter that argued it only learned from press reports of the BNL Rome office's possible involvement with the Iraqi loans. The letter did not, however, address disclosures made in Congress last week that the CIA had subsequently confirmed the press reports of Rome's knowledge. Yesterday, other declassified documents were released in Congress by Mr Henry Gonzalez, House banking committee chairman, who has accused the Bush administration of covering up its own knowledge of the BNL affair. Mr Gonzalez disclosed a March 23, 1989 State Department memo to then Secretary of State James Baker which, Mr Gonzalez claimed, showed a rapid rise in US imports of Iraqi oil as a quid pro quo for the administration's approval of export licences for technology that helped Iraq's military projects. Although the memo stated that Iraq had asked Washington 'to push Congress' to delete sanctions legislation, it also told Mr Baker that Baghdad was 'working hard at chemical and biological weapons and new missiles'. The memo also said that Iraq had given 'favourable deals to US oil companies' and noted oil exports to the US had soared to about 500,000 b/d. Mr Gonzalez released documents showing that by the time Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 US purchases of Iraqi oil had jumped to more than 1.1m b/d. He said the US Department of Energy had purchased more than 3.4m barrels of Iraqi oil only months before the Gulf war started. The congressman also said that US intelligence reports dating back to the summer of 1989 showed the Bush administration knew that technology for Baghdad's nuclear and missile programmes was being procured by Matrix-Churchill, the Iraqi-owned and UK-based machine tools company financed by BNL Atlanta.</p>

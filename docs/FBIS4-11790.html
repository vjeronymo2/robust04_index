			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Video report by political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen] </F>   [Text] Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who until recently  opted for the Jordanian option, has recently changed his  position and decided to concentrate mainly on facilitating the  dialogue with Damascus. For this purpose, he even postponed a  visit abroad. Our political correspondent 'Imanu'el Rosen  reports about a new emphasis emerging in Jerusalem:    All those who have recently been closely following comments  made by Yitzhaq Rabin and Shim'on Peres regarding the price  Israel will have to pay on the Golan Heights, could not avoid  noticing that there was more in these remarks than a change in  nuance. The previous statement according to which the depth of  withdrawal will equal the depth of peace has now been replaced  by much more explicit remarks. Several days ago, appearing  before the Forum for Peace and Security, Rabin made explicit  remarks which were published in the press and have not been  denied so far. Rabin spoke about normalization of relations  before Israel completes the withdrawal from the Golan Heights,  rather than on the Golan Heights -- a withdrawal to which it  will commit itself in the framework of the negotiations. The  entire issue hinges on the difference in the preposition.    Jerusalem sources speak about a positive atmosphere  emanating  from Damascus nowadays, but Rabin is saying that he is still  awaiting a signal from al-Asad, after which the sky will be the  limit -- or perhaps the international border. What is Rabin  waiting for? Three things mainly: for the process to become  overt, that is, public meetings at a senior level; openness  toward Israel on the Syrian media; and pro-Israeli comments by  Syrian leaders.    The most recent developments, however, have occurred in  Jerusalem. Foreign Minister Shim'on Peres, who so far was the  one with most reservations regarding Syria and who supported the  Jordan option, has changed his position. Peres is extremely  annoyed with King Husayn for not making any progress in his  contacts with Israel, and has decided to invest all his efforts  in the contacts with Syria. Peres is thereby joining the Syrian  lobby, which includes IDF [Israel Defense Forces] Intelligence  Chief Uri Sagi, Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq, Ambassador Itamar  Rabinovich, and Deputy Foreign Minister Yosi Beilin. For this  reason he announced he is canceling a planned visit to Ethiopia  and Eritrea, this in order to focus his efforts on negotiations  with Syria.</p>

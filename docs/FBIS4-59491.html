			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] The Central Command of the anti-'Arafat  coalition of the 10 factions has decided to transfer its  operations to the occupied Palestinian territories to defeat the  Oslo accord and its offshoots. The 10 factions plan to achieve  this through mobilizing the masses in the territories to defeat,  expose, and isolate the accord.    This was decided at a meeting held by the Central Command  last Wednesday [11 May]. The five-hour meeting addressed the  latest developments, particularly the Cairo agreement, ways to  respond to the recent developments, activating confrontation  with the enemy, and the situation of the Palestinians in  Lebanon.

			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / Observer: Blacked out Call it chutzpah if you will, but the zeal displayed by South Africa's rugby officials can only befit a recent convert. They have decided that the Springboks won't play against the Maoris on their next New Zealand tour because the team is selected on a racial basis. This is all a bit rich. In 1967 an All Black tour to South Africa was cancelled when the South African government refused to allow Maoris to be included in the touring team. Only after the late Danie Craven took up cudgels did the government relent and allow Maoris to tour with the All Blacks three years later. When South Africa toured New Zealand in 1981, opposition to the tour divided opinion in the country. Opposition to apartheid also led to the cancellation of the planned 1985 All Blacks tour to South Africa. But now Nic Labuschagne, chairman of the tours committee of the newly-integrated South African Rugby Football Union, says: 'We are very sincere about the integration of our sport. We would not want to be a part of anything that smacks of discrimination.'</p>

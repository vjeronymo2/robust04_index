He went to  the Haitian parliament on 24 March to dispel any of the  deputies' suspicions about the quality of the food products  which will be distributed to 50,000 children. The following is a  report by Daly Valet.    [Begin recording] [Valet] "During this meeting with the  deputies, French Charge Philippe Seltz guaranteed that the food  products that will be transported by the French ship will meet  all humanitarian and sanitary regulations.  Seltz said he hopes the ship will be able to unload at the  Port-au-Prince wharf because, in his opinion, the French  Government wants to help the Haitian people through the crisis  they have been experiencing since 30 September 1991."    [Seltz] I spoke with the president of the Chamber of  Deputies  and several parliamentarians. We exchanged general views on  questions regarding, among other things, this ship. Obviously, I  hope that there will be no problem relating to its arrival.    [Unidentified journalist] Nevertheless, the ship will arrive  and will also be unloaded?    [Seltz] I hope so.    [Valet] "Seltz also discussed political issues with the  deputies. Concerning the parliamentary plan that was passed by  the Chamber of Deputies, the French diplomat did not say whether  the French Government supports the plan or not. He just said  that the French Government remains committed to the Governors  Island agreement. According to him, all points in this agreement  must be respected."    [Seltz] ...the traditional position of France and the rest  of  the international community.    [Journalist] What is it? What position?    [Seltz] The implementation of all points of the Governors  Island agreement and the New York pact.    [Journalist] You are against this plan? Are you against the  plan of the parliamentarians?    [Seltz] No, I have not said that at all. I tell you that I  favor the implementation [pauses] that France favors the  implementation of all the points of the Governors Island  agreement just like other countries have always said.    [Journalist] How do you interpret the American's position?    [Seltz] The same way.    [Journalist] And the Americans' position on the  parliamentarians' plan?    [Seltz] That can be a first step.    [Journalist] Toward what?    [Seltz] Toward the implementation of the Governors Island  agreement. [passage omitted]    [Valet] "Seltz visited the Chamber of Deputies diplomatic  lounge to explain about the French ship's arrival in Haiti, the  ship that is carrying humanitarian aid. Remember that Chamber of  Deputies President Frantz Robert Monde has already come out  against the arrival of this ship. According to the deputy,  France is a hypocrite, a deceiver.

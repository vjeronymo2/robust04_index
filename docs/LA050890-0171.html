			<p><P> May 8, 1990, Tuesday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: SANTA PAULA;  </P> <P> BED AND BREAKFAST DENIED BY COUNCIL  </P> <P> After two hours of debate, the Santa Paula City Council on Monday night denied  a homeowner's request to operate a bed and breakfast inn.  </P> <P> The council vote reversed an earlier Planning Commission decision to allow  Gilbert and Cheryl Eigenhuis to operate a bed and breakfast inn out of their  home at Ojai Road and Fern Oak Drive, a residential neighborhood on the  outskirts of Santa Paula.  </P> <P> Opponents, who earlier presented the Planning Commission with a 65-signature  petition, again objected and presented an additional 71 signatures. They said  it would bring in crowds and traffic.  </P> <P> "This is a residential area and they do need to consider the people in the  area," Vera Laan said. "We want to keep it a strictly family residential area."  </P> <P> Owners of the proposed bed and breakfast accused these residents of using scare  tactics to collect signatures.  </P> <P> The council voted 3 to 2 to deny the proposal, saying that although the  eight-guest house would not have a serious impact on the area, too many  residents objected to let it go ahead.  </P> <P> "If there is that much objection, I just don't think it is proper," said Carl  Barringer, a City Council member. He and other members raised concerns that the  proposed inn might violate city zoning ordinances.  </P> <P> Santa Paula has no bed and breakfast inns. The Lemon Tree Inn closed more than  two years ago. KEN McALPINE  </P></p>

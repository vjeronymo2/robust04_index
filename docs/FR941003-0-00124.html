HUD makes the final underwriting determination. The Delegated Processor must identify the staff or contract review appraiser(s) and consultant(s) and must submit their qualifications, based upon requirements as set forth in the contract between HUD and the Delegated Processor, for review and approval. The Delegated Processor may subcontract appraiser and consulting functions, but must identify, prior to performing the appraisal or consultation, the appraiser or consultant selected under the subcontract and must provide a resume or qualifications for review and approval by the HUD field office concerned. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) Under the Housing Finance Agency Risk-Sharing Program, HUD delegates to state and local housing finance agencies the authority to originate and service loans that are fully insured by FHA. Under this program, participating agencies share in the risk associated with monetary losses that may be incurred as a result of loan defaults. An HFA may use either in-house or contract appraisers who meet certification requirements. The Risk-Sharing Program requires compliance with USPAP and therefore requires that appraisals be performed by certified general appraisers accredited by the state in which the project is located. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Delegated Processor appraisers: conflicts of interests.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Delegated Processor or Consultant must avoid conflicts of interest and other relationships which affect, either in reality or in appearance, the credibility of the appraisal.

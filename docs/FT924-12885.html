			<p>921019 FT  19 OCT 92 / Warning of Russian coup: Liberal ministers see threat to Yeltsin and his reforms RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin's closest liberal colleagues have charged that an alliance of parliamentarians, industrial managers and nostalgic communists are plotting to overthrow his government and derail radical market reforms. The charges were presented to a group of foreign correspondents by Mr Gennady Burbulis, a top presidential adviser, Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the first deputy prime minister who heads the Information Ministry, Mr Anatoly Chubais, the first deputy premier responsible for privatisation, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister. 'We are seeing the ripening of not just serious opposition but of the open and strongest preparation of a coup d'etat,' Mr Poltoranin told the correspondents at a meeting initiated by him and his colleagues on Friday evening. He said preparations for what a parliamentary leader described as a 'coup by constitutional means' were being made under the aegis of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament. Although coup warnings are not new to Moscow, this one was notable for the seniority and number of ministers who made it, as well as for its specificity. A senior parliamentarian who declined to be identified said the plotters aimed to achieve their ends by constitutional means at a session of Russia's supreme legislative body, the Congress of People's Deputies, which is set for December 1 but which Mr Yeltsin wants postponed until next spring. Mr Burbulis said the co-ordinated interaction of forces opposing radical reforms was orchestrated from the Russian parliament building and involved extreme communist groups such as Edinstvo (Unity), as well as the support of conservative industrial managers and deputies. He also alleged the involvement of the Civic Union group, headed by Mr Arkady Volsky, leader of an industrialists' union, and Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi. Mr Poltoranin said Mr Khasbulatov had sanctioned the creation of shadowy armed groups, press conferences on parliamentary premises by former Soviet deputies who want a return to communism, and the establishment in parliament of an organising committee for salvation committees. Mr Chubais said the timing set by parliamentarians for the congress was not accidental, as it was designed to stop a mass privatisation of industrial enterprises due to start in January.</p>

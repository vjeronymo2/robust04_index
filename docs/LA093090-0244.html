			<p><P> September 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> AN INSIDE LOOK  </P> <P> Both Prime Ticket announcers for the Kings believe this could be a great season  for the team.  </P> <P> "There's no doubt in my mind that this is a put up or shut up year," said Jim  Fox, a former Kings right wing who is beginning his first season as an analyst.  "This is their third year with Wayne (Gretzky), so we're going to have to see  if they play up to their potential.  </P> <P> "With Wayne and the people they've brought in around him, the potential exists  to go all the way, there's no doubt about that. The big word everybody throws  around is chemistry, but in this instance it's right on the nose. If they can  find the proper chemistry, I think they can be battling with the best teams in  the league."  </P> <P> Coach Tom Webster is promising a more defense-oriented approach this season.  Last season the Kings allowed 337 goals, fourth most in the league, while  falling to fourth place in the Smythe Division and 15th overall among the 21  teams.  </P> <P> "The key is going to be if this team can play as well defensively as Tom  Webster wants them to play," said play-by-play announcer Bob Miller. "I've  heard for 17 years that we have to cut down on the goals against, and for most  of the 17 years, it never happened."  </P> <P> Both announcers consider the Edmonton Oilers, defending Stanley Cup champs, the  team to beat.  </P> <P> "I give Edmonton all the credit in the world," Miller said. "I don't know of  any other team that could have traded a player of Wayne Gretzky's stature and  win the Stanley Cup again two seasons later," Miller said. "That's a tremendous  feather in the hat of the management of that team.  </P> <P> "It's just unbelieveable that they came back and played as well as they did and  won the Stanley Cup. Of course, they'll miss Jari Kurri (the all-star right  wing who signed to play with a team in Italy) but they still have a great  nucleus of players up there.STEVEN HERBERT  </P></p>

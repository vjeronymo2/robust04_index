The opium produced in Afghanistan,  Pakistan, and Iran, which are known as the Golden Crescent  countries, is transported through Turkey to Europe, either  through highways or sea ports.    The production of narcotic substances significantly  increased  in the region after the Soviet Union collapsed. For example,  the production of narcotic drugs increased by 10 times in  Afghanistan. Meanwhile, the effort made to place the production  of narcotic substances under control in Uzbekistan,  Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan, which became independent republics  after the Soviet Union disintegrated, has not been successful.  Nearly three-quarters of the narcotic drugs used in West Europe  come from the Golden Crescent countries and Central Asia.    The narcotic substances produced in the Golden Crescent  countries and Central Asia are smuggled into Turkey in three  ways. The first is the route from southern Afghanistan, which  crosses through Iran and reaches Turkey. The drug traffickers  also use the authority vacuum in northern Iraq as an opportunity  to smuggle their narcotic substances into Turkey. The second  route is the sea ports. Narcotic drugs are transported from the  Golden Crescent countries to Karachi in Pakistan. They are then  loaded on ships that carry them to the Mediterranean Sea through  the Gulf of Aden, the Red Sea, and the Suez Canal. The vessel  Lucky-S was placed under custody in the Mediterranean Sea for  carrying narcotic drugs in 1993. The narcotic substances were  loaded on the vessel in Karachi. Officials impounded 14 tonnes  of narcotic drugs on the Lucky-S.    The vessel Kismetim-1 also picked up a cargo of narcotic  drugs in Pakistan in 1993. The crew members reportedly sank  that vessel to prevent the police from impounding its cargo.    The third route through Turkey is from the Caucasus, a  region  that has been troubled by internal unrest since the Soviet Union  collapsed. Narcotic substances are transported from the Golden  Crescent countries to the Caspian Sea through Turkmenistan.  From there, they are transported to Azerbaijan and Georgia  either in ships or in vehicles, which use the highways to the  north of the Caspian Sea. The internal confusion in Azerbaijan  and Georgia facilitates the activities of the drug traffickers  in that region. The narcotic drugs, which are smuggled into  Turkey in ships or TIR [Transit Highway International] trucks,  are later transported to West Europe either in similar trucks,  which cross through the Balkan countries, or in ships, which  call at several ports in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>

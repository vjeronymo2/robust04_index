			<p>930319 FT  19 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Australian equities gain as confidence returns - Kevin Brown tests the strength of a periodic rally Australia is in the middle of one of its periodic bull runs. But is this the beginning of a sustained rally, or will investors lose heart once again, as they have three times in the last 18 months? On Monday, it looked as though the bears were back with a vengeance, as the All Ordinaries index dropped 35 points to 1,626.4 in reaction to the unexpected re-election of Mr Paul Keating's Labor government. But heads have cooled in the last few days, and the signs are that the surge of confidence which has flowed through the market in the last few months is likely to continue to push prices up, at least for a while. Last night's close of 1,669.6 was above the pre-election level, and 21 per cent above the 1992 low in mid-November. The market, however, remains 27 per cent off its October 1987 peak of 2,300. Against the background of sustained underperformance in the last five years, there are plenty of other reasons why investors should be more optimistic about prospects for the coming year: The election result removes political uncertainty, and suggests that Australia is set for a period of consolidation, rather than the industrial and economic upheaval which might have followed a conservative victory. The recovery from the 1990/91 recession seems to be gathering pace. The economy grew by 0.7 per cent in the December quarter, and by 2.5 per cent over the year - one of the fastest growth rates in the OECD. Inflation is running at an annual level of 0.3 per cent, and the current account deficit, which at one stage looked likely to retard the recovery, has recently contracted in line with government forecasts. The Australian dollar has strengthened significantly in the last few weeks, and is no longer regarded as a constraint on a further cut in official interest rates, which the reserve bank is expected to announce shortly. The improving outlook suggests that the only significant black spot on the economic horizon is unemployment, which is likely to remain at near-record levels for some time. The sea of red ink which has flowed from the books of major Australian companies in the last two years is beginning to dry up, confirming forecasts that a recovery in corporate profits is under way. Some well-known names have continued to disappoint in the current interim profits season, including TNT and Brambles, the international transport groups, and resources concerns such as Western Mining and Renison Goldfields. But many companies have reported significant improvements, including miners such as North Broken Hill Peko and CRA, food companies such as Foster's Brewing, Arnotts biscuits ,and Goodman Fielder, and industrials such as BTR Nylex, Coca-Cola Amatil, and Burns Philp. The improved results have pushed up prices virtually across the board, so that 10 of the Australian equity market's 24 sectoral indices now show an improvement over the last 12 months, compared with three in December. But many remain only marginally ahead, and the only substantial gainer has been the media index, which is more than 50 per cent higher, mainly because of the recovery of Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. John Fairfax Holdings, the newspaper group controlled by Mr Conrad Black, Pacific Magazines and Printing, a spin-off from News Corp, and Mr Kerry Packer's Nine Network Australia television group have also performed well. The biggest test may come when the three major banks report their first-half results in mid-year. National Australia Bank and ANZ are believed to be over the worst of the bad debt problems which have plagued the sector, but a question mark still hangs over Westpac, which is restructuring after losing ADollars 1.5bn last year. The optimistic view is that all the necessary groundwork for a sustained rally has been done. However, wary investors will remember that Australian bulls have been saying that for years.</p>

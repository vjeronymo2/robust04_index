			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Arts: The siege of the Barbican - The plight of Detta O'Cathain as she retreats into her bunker If you arrive late, or leave early, from a concert or a play at the Barbican Centre in the City of London, you may well see a lone female figure surveying the empty foyers, checking out the bars, the cafes and the toilets, like a cross between a ghost and a night manager. It is Baroness Detta O'Cathain, the director of the centre, whose future, under intense speculation for two years now, seems increasingly parlous. Last week the centre started a search for a deputy director, but not just any old deputy. This new appointee will also be responsible for artistic programming and eventually will replace the Lady herself. It puts the Baroness in a virtually impossible position and she is resigned to not seeing out the remaining three years of her contract. 'I'm not going to walk out. Whether I will be here in a year's time I do not know. If the ideal person came in and bedded down rapidly it could be a matter of months'. O'Cathain's plight is the inevitable consequence of a culture clash. She arrived in 1990 to lick the Barbican into financial shape. Under her predecessor, Henry Wrong, it had been a happy, easy going place, where the bottom line lost out in the battle for artistic excellence. A committed Thatcherite, O'Cathain had the backing of the City Fathers, who bail out the Barbican with Pounds 13.5m a year in subsidy, to knock heads together. She has succeeded only too well. 'I have always stayed within budget' she boasts. But there has been more blood around the place that at the end of Hamlet. Around 50 of the 220 staff have left, and relations with those remaining, worried about their jobs and the centre's future, are not good. The situation has deteriorated rapidly since the summer when O'Cathain sacked her artistic director, Kenneth Richardson, a few months after appointing him. This has forced her to take a more active role in programming at the Barbican Hall, with some unhappy consequences. A series of three concerts designed to introduce a new audience to classical music attracted attendances of less than 30 per cent and lost money. Instead of the centre promoting just over 20 performances a year at the hall, with outside producers like Raymond Gubbay filling the gaps and taking the risk, it has had to find shows for almost 100 nights, a daunting task at a time when concert attendances around the country have fallen sharply. So strong had the murmurings become in recent weeks that Geoffrey Lawson, chairman of the Barbican Centre committee, and a firm champion of Detta O'Cathain, was forced to investigate. He asked the heads of the main users of the Barbican - Adrian Noble of the RSC, Clive Gillinson of the LSO, Raymond Gubbay, and the Guildhall School of Music  - for their views. They were not encouraging about O'Cathain's prospects. They spoke of a lack of direction in the Barbican, shortcomings in artistic vision and a lack of motivation and support among staff. There was also concern about the Baroness's part-time directorships and her involvement in the House of Lords. Lawson had no alternative but to launch the sudden hunt for a deputy-come-replacement. He has also reassured the staff by saying there will be no more job losses - a public indication that, for the first time, O'Cathain has lost the backing of the City. It is not surprising that she feels hard done by and has retreated into her bunker. She has discovered the tough way that practitioners in the arts are sensitive and self-regarding and have an exaggerated opinion of their creative contribution. In her world, the balance sheet rules; in theirs, it is the emotional experience. She was brought in to administer the centre - to improve the catering facilities, to make the place more agreeable to visitors, to raise its reputation and bring in sponsors - but she just could not keep her hands off the artistic planning when she discovered that at certain concerts each of the few attenders was being subsidised at the rate of Pounds 54 a head. Such interference has contributed to her current plight. In many ways the Barbican is a more attractive venue. Little can be done about its brutalist exterior and depressing approaches, but inside the ambiance, the catering and the free foyer entertainment make it quite jolly. O'Cathain laboured hard to improve the acoustic in the Barbican Hall. She has helped to attract millions in sponsorship - at last week's opening of the ambitious Everybody's Shakespeare Festival she could claim some credit for the Pounds 700,000 raised - and there are few corporate receptions at the centre where she is not on hand, pressing the flesh. But she had not been prepared to soften her abrasive style, to answer the criticisms that she came to the Barbican from the Milk Marketing Board knowing little about the arts and convinced that they could be managed and marketed like any other product. Her attempts to influence the artistic programming have not been successful, and, without an artistic director, the Barbican faces many dark nights and few major eye catching festivals. Ironically, it has worked against her that her two main tenants, the RSC and the LSO, are currently enjoying artistic and financial highs. Both had their problems settling in to the Barbican, but now they are happy and successful they expect the same from their landlady. It matters to them that their mutual home is populated by relaxed staff and contented visitors. An ill attended concert at the Barbican Hall rubs off on the theatre. In the old days the different audiences mingled together, sniffing out future treats in other parts of the centre. The tenants now think they are carrying the Barbican and want a better service. The Barbican Centre was a child of post-war planning. It took decades to complete and by thetime it opened in 1982 the worldhad moved on. It was anticipated that commercial rentals from the adjacent exhibition centre andfrom the hall would pay for the arts programme. It was a pious hope. Little has worked out as projected and Mammon and culture have been forced into a difficult marriage. When the arts flourished, and there were plenty of successful bookings for the hall, all the parties could live in reasonable harmony. The anomalous position of the centre's director, who was mainly responsible for run-of-the-mill support services but who also had to master mind an artistic programme alongside the work of the RSC and the LSO, was skated over. When times were harder, and money talked more loudly, there were bound to be rows. O'Cathain will not be the first business person to come unstuck when mixing it with the arts. Having badly wounded their prey they now hope for a quick kill. The feeling is that the Barbican will not attract the first class artistic (and tyro business) manager it needs if there is uncertainty about the future of the boss. Detta O'Cathain's fate seems to mirror uncannily that of the former prime minister whose views she so admired.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, June 25 (YONHAP) -- As the proposed  South-North summit meeting approaches realization, the South  Korean Government has prepared a draft agreement on the summit  for discussion during an inter-Korean preparatory contact slated  for Tuesday at Panmunjom.    An informed official source said Saturday the draft covers  the summit's date and place, the number of attendants and the  period of visits.    The source said the government believes the first summit  talks should occur by mid-July at the latest and that Seoul or  Pyongyang should be the site.    Panmunjom is not included in the Seoul side's list of  candidate venues for the summit talks, he said.    The government welcomed North Korea's selection of Kim  Yong-sun, chairman of the Unification Policy Committee of the  Supreme People's Assembly, as its chief delegate to the  South-North preparatory contact next Tuesday.    Noting that Kim belongs to the faction advocating more  openness, a Seoul official said his selection may well point to  Pyongyang's good intentions toward the proposed summit.    North Korea informed the South Saturday morning that it had  chosen Kim as chief delegate to next Tuesday's contact. The two  other delegates are An Pyong-su, vice chairman of the Committee  for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, and Paek Nam-chun,  a State Council member.</p>

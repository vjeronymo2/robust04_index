			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / International Company News: Mexican media group plans NYSE offering THE NEW owners of the privatised Mexican television stations and cinema chain have announced plans to take their media company public within 12 months in an offering on the New York Stock Exchange. Mr Ricardo Salinas Pliego, president of Radiotelevisora del Centro, said the offering would be up to 49 per cent, the maximum permitted under the privatisation. Mr Salinas also said he would be taking his family's Grupo Elektra public on the NYSE at the end of this year or beginning of next, probably offering about 20 per cent of the capital. Radiotelevisora bid 2bn pesos (Dollars 641m) for state-owned Channels 7 and 13, 126 cinemas, and a local television station. The bid was 30 per cent higher than the next best offer. The company offered about Dollars 500m for the television stations, and Dollars 140m for the cinemas, Mr Salinas said. Grupo Elektra is Mexico's largest electrical retailer, with about 275 stores throughout the country. Mr Salinas said he believed the company was worth at least 15 times earnings, or Dollars 600m. Mr Salinas will use the proceeds from the two offerings to pay off an 18-month bridge loan taken on to finance the purchase of the media package. Mr Salinas was confident his new company could survive alongside Televisa, which has about 90 per cent of the Mexican television market.</p>

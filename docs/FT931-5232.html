			<p>930306 FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: March of tasty extremes - Video CAN IT be that the video business is at last waking up to its own possibilities? Over recent months, we have seen ever more appetising extras packaged in with pre-recorded movie cassettes. Not just those trailers for other features that precede films-on-tape and that resemble a trayful of irrelevant canapes before the main meal. (Thank you, we do not want to see five minutes of speeding bulletins about the new Schwarzenegger, Stallone or Bruce Willis before settling down to Driving Miss Daisy). No, I refer to what in a study course would be called 'supplementary literature'. This includes mini-documentaries about the making of the film you have bought or rented, such as are incorporated in the videos of Fatal Attraction (CIC) and Hellraiser (Video Collection); original trailers of historic films, as in Warner's new 'Special Collectors' Editions' of The Searchers, Ben-Hur, Doctor Zhivago and The Alamo; and even boxed sets of a director's work which include a book of his latest prose fiction. This last startling package is available to Pedro Almodovar fans from Tartan Video. As with the invention of databanks or TV information channels, now that these ancillary attractions are on offer we wonder how we ever tolerated video life without them. I have long maintained that the big screen is where you should first see a feature film - shame on all you couch potatoes who act otherwise - and the small screen is where you should re-enjoy or re-study it. For that second experience, the more documentation and study aids that arrive with the video the better. Of course video is not all higher educative ground. Much of it is muck and mire, and what month would be complete without such wares as are offered this March? Delta Force 2 and Delta Force 3 (Chuck Norris saves the world from another brace of apocalypses); Maniac Cop 3 (friendly neighbourhood patrolman plus machete); Critters 4 (animated hairballs in space); and my personal barrel-scraping favourite, The Finest Hour (20: 20). This never-theatrically-released movie, which has Rob Lowe enlisting in Operation Desert Storm and singlehandedly defeating Sadam Hussein, qualifies as the mother of all zero-IQ action adventures. Thus stretching its dynamic range to encompass both the sublime and the ridiculous, video may be at last be an acquiring an interesting identity: just as network television's range has spread over the decades so that it now offers everything from Alpha to Omega, from Open University to Neighbours. For those not yet used to such tasty extremes, the middle-ground video market continues apace and is about to have a good month. The following films are accompanied by no 'mini-documentaries about the making of,' no historic trailers, no accompanying paperbacks. Nor do they have the Critters/Delta Force cachet of being harum-scarum potboilers hitherto deemed unfit for human release. But here are the March movies you might buy or hire for simple, uncluttered pleasure. Housesitter (CIC), bright Steve Martin/Goldie Hawn romp about the horrors of owner-occupation; 1492 (Guild), Ridley Scott's visually gleaming Columbus epic; White Men Can't Jump (Fox), sex, race 'n' basketball comedy from Ron 'Bull Durham' Shelton; The Crying Game (Polygram) - be your own Oscar judge before the Oscars; Celine And Julie Go Boating (Connoisseur), hypnotic French fable in which director Jacques Rivette goes Lewis Carrolling; La Belle Noiseuse (Artificial Eye), second Rivette masterwork with artist Michel Piccoli struggling with nude muse Emmanuelle Beart; The Rapture, antic Armageddon allegory from Michael 'The Player' Tolkin. Oh, and one other. Strictly Ballroom (Guild), the strictly hilarious, strictly wonderful dancing epic from Australia that crept into nearly everyone's Ten Best of last year and even into one colleague's Ten Best Of All Time.</p>

			<p>930506 FT  06 MAY 93 / Survey of Pension Fund Investment (4): Eyes are switching to overseas markets - US / Patrick Harverson discovers that horizons have widened considerably THE US can seem an extraordinarily parochial place at times. Despite the dominant role the country plays in global politics, economics and business, Americans' understanding of the world outside their borders can appear shallow. For many years there has been a similarly narrow approach to investing. A deep-seated reluctance among investors to consider putting their money anywhere other than the domestic equity and debt markets has ensured that billions of dollars in investment capital has never left US shores. Well, not any more. In the past decade, US investors have gradually awakened to the potential for gains in foreign markets. Even the pension funds, among the most conservative elements of the US investing community, have embraced the idea of opening their eyes to the world. According to various estimates, just over Dollars 150bn in US pension fund assets was invested outside the country at the end of 1992, say Connecticut consultant firms Greenwich Associates and InterSec Research. About three quarters of the total was in stocks and the rest in fixed-income securities. In comparison, in 1987 roughly Dollars 50bn of fund assets was invested overseas. While growth in non-US investments over the past five years has been impressive, industry observers expect it to accelerate during the rest of the 1990s. In its latest study of pension funds, published last month, Greenwich Associates forecasts that total US pension assets invested overseas will reach Dollars 280bn by 1995. InterSec is even more optimistic. It forecasts that by 1997 non-domestic pension fund investments will have almost tripled to Dollars 430bn. (It should be noted that this growth will not just come from new money flows, but potentially also from increased investment returns, which will inflate the value of funds' existing and new overseas assets.) While these numbers seem large, they still only represent a fraction of total assets held by US pension funds, which according to InterSec stood at Dollars 3,315bn last year. In other words, less than 5 per cent of assets are currently invested abroad. In contrast, pension funds in other countries are more global in their outlook. About 8 per cent of Japanese pension fund assets are invested outside Japan, while 26 per cent of UK assets are invested in non-UK markets. Analysts, however, anticipate that interest in non-domestic investments will grow fastest in the US. InterSec sees 10 per cent of fund assets invested abroad by 1997, while it expects overseas assets held by Japanese funds to grow to 10 per cent, and assets held by UK funds to grow to 28 per cent, in the same period. If there is an overriding reason why US funds are becoming more interested in international investing it is a desire for diversification - to find a new asset class that offers some kind of insurance against declining domestic markets and asset values. Before funds started investing overseas, the domestic markets fully satisfied their investment needs. Until the rise of the German, Japanese and other Far Eastern economies, US assets accounted for more than half of the world's capital markets. Today, that share has dropped to about a third. As Mr Arthur McCain, vice-president of InterSec, says: 'Pension funds have to ask themselves: Why should I turn my back on two-thirds of the world market?' The answer, he says, used to be: 'I'm too scared to invest abroad.' Not any more. Along with the realisation that they need to go overseas to diversify their portfolios and spread their risk, fund managers have become more sophisticated, and have learned to understand, not mistrust, foreign markets. 'The driving force (of overseas investing) is diversification, and an equal force is the reduction of fear,' explains Mr McCain. Diversification must be the key to the internationalisation of US funds because they are certainly not investing abroad because they have been impressed by the returns available outside the US. Over the past five years (1988-1992), on an annualised basis, the Standard &amp; Poors' 500 index has returned just under 16 per cent. In stark contrast, over the same period the dollar return on Morgan Stanley's Europe Australasia Far East (EAFE) index of 20 foreign stock markets was a meagre 1.6 per cent. Returns from overseas investments were no better in fixed-income markets. Merrill Lynch's US bond index returned 11.6 per cent between 1988-1992 on an annualised basis, while its non-North American bond index returned only 6.2 per cent. While past performance has been poor, some of the recent overseas investing by funds undoubtedly has been based on the assumption that foreign markets will do better than domestic markets in future years. In particular, there is a feeling that while US bonds yields have probably reached bottom and have only one way to go, overseas bond yields, which have been much higher than US yields in recent years, are heading down. Similarly, some investors see little room for growth in US equities, but plenty overseas if undervalued foreign stocks and fast-growth economies can be quickly identified. Although they are embracing globalisation, pension funds remain relatively conservative in where they put their money. The European and Japanese markets remain the biggest recipients of US money. The much-talked about 'emerging markets' of Latin America and Asia have been targeted more closely in the last year or so, but essentially they still remain more talked-about than targeted. Inevitably, the internationalisation of US pension funds assets has spawned interest among fund managers in currency hedging. The use of hedging techniques to manage foreign exchange risk can be a double-edged sword for funds - it can reduce currency risk, but it can also limit the returns on overseas assets. After all, the dollar's poor performance against foreign currencies since the mid-1970s has militated against the need for hedging. As one fund analyst, pointing out the recent record-breaking performance of the Japanese yen against the US dollar, explains: 'If you were in yen assets over the last couple of months, you would have done pretty well. But if you'd hedged those assets back into the dollar, you would have lost a lot of the benefits.' While the majority of the hedging by pension funds remains of the passive variety - where it is used as a tool of currency risk management - a growing number of players are viewing hedging as a potential profit-centre in its own right. A recent survey by Callan Associates and the magazine Pensions &amp; Investments found that while 24 per cent of fund executives said they were using or were interested in passive currency hedging, 45 per cent said the same about active currency hedging. The big Wall Street investment banks and securities houses are, understandably, extremely eager to win funds over to hedging as a means of exploiting currency volatility. For example, a number of US funds are participating in pools of managed derivatives that essentially speculate on currency movements.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                      CHANGE IN PROJECTED ASSET MIX  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Type of investment                   1992              1995                                   actual (%)       estimated (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Common stocks  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Active                               30.0             30.5 Passive                              13.9             14.8 Total                                43.9             45.2  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- International  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Active stocks                         4.0              6.0 Passive stocks                        1.4              1.9 Bonds                                 1.3              1.8 Total                                 6.7              9.7  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Bonds  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Active                               26.8             25.1 Immunised or dedicated                2.5              2.4 Other passive                         4.3              3.9 Total                                33.6             31.4 Guaranteed investment contracts       4.0              3.0 Equity real estate                    4.0              4.2 Cash and short-term securities        4.1              3.2 Other                                 3.7              3.3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Greenwich Associates  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

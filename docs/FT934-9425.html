			<p>931110 FT  10 NOV 93 / Survey of Mexico (17): Skilful political negotiator - Diego Fernandez de Cevallos DIEGO FERNANDEZ DE CEVALLOS looks more like an Old Testament prophet than the presidential candidate of Mexico's centre-right opposition party. He is tall and erect, sports a long and sometimes shaggy beard, and has a booming voice. He happily pontificates on religion, the spiritual renewal of Mexico and the moral responsibilities of a politician, but has few specific suggestions on what he would do were he elected. When arriving late for an interview, he explains that he has been legally recognising an illegitimate son he never knew about. A Jesuit-educated practising Catholic, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos had, by his own admission, a wild youth before discovering marriage. His messianic manner disguises a skilful political negotiator who has worked his way up the National Action Party to become the party's leader in the Chamber of Deputies. He is backed for presidential candidate by almost all the leading figures in the PAN. He owes his position partly to luck and some skilful political manoeuvring. All the well-known national leaders of the PAN, such as the governors of Baja California and Chihuahua, decided not to run some time ago. The other main contender, Mr Vicente Fox is the son of a Spanish-born parent, and thus inadmissible under Article 82 of constitution. As the party's top official in Congress, he has become leader of the PAN's conciliatory wing that supports close co-operation with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He almost single-handedly negotiated with the PRI the political reforms, which while approved by the PAN, were opposed by the Party of Democratic Revolution (PRD). His negotiations with PRI have been long criticised by those in the PAN who argue the party should be more confrontational in the fight for democracy. Last year several leading members of the PAN - including a former presidential candidate and head of the party - resigned, complaining that 'the party has not acted as the opposition but as one more sector of the system'. His candidacy is widely considered a boost to the fortunes of the much better known Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, of the PRD. While the PAN is better organised than the PRD, and electorally more successful, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos is hardly recognised outside political circles in Mexico City, and his public support for the government may put off those wanting to register a protest vote against the PRI. He has modest campaign experience, and his patrician, eccentric manner, might alienate some ordinary Mexicans. So far he has been inept at handling the press. Far from being defensive about his good relations with the government, Mr Fernandez de Cevallos cheerfully describes President Carlos Salinas de Gortari as the best president Mexico has had. He hangs in his office a signed photograph of Mexico's former interior minister Fernando Gutierrez de Barrios, a stalwart member of the ruling PRI. Mr Fernandez de Cevallos says that by negotiating with the PRI, the PAN has extracted important concessions. Under the recently passed electoral reform, the PRI agreed to long-standing PAN demands - namely, to open up the Senate to opposition parties, make electoral bodies more independent of the government, and cap campaign spending.</p>

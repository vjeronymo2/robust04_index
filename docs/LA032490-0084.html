			<p><P> March 24, 1990, Saturday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CSUN VOLLEYBALL TEAM FINDS NO ROOM AT TOP AGAINST USC  </P> <P> There was nothing to lose and a lot to gain for the Cal State Northridge men's  volleyball team against USC on Friday night in a Western Intercollegiate  Volleyball match at USC's Lyon Center.  </P> <P> But about all that Northridge gained was more respect for USC, which came into  the match as the nation's top-ranked team in the latest Tachikara coaches'  poll. The Trojans swept the Matadors, 15-13, 15-9, 15-7, in a match televised  live on cable television.  </P> <P> "They're a good team," Northridge middle blocker Coley Kyman said of USC. "They  played well. We couldn't get any breaks."  </P> <P> USC, which improved to 14-1 and 10-1 in conference play, maintained its  one-game advantage in the WIVA's Wilson Division over Long Beach State (9-2),  which beat Pepperdine.  </P> <P> For the sixth-ranked Matadors, positioned comfortably in second place in the  WIVA's DeGroot Division, the match wasn't as crucial. With five WIVA matches  remaining, Northridge (11-8, 6-5) cannot catch division-leading UCLA (12-2),  but is well ahead of third-place Pepperdine (4-9).  </P> <P> The top three teams in each division will advance to the conference tournament  and the tournament champion will receive the conference's automatic berth into  the NCAA tournament.  </P> <P> "(The match) really doesn't mean much in terms of standings," Northridge Coach  John Price said. "The most important thing to gain from this match was  experience. We're probably going to meet them again in the tournament. That's  when it counts."  </P> <P> USC dominated the match early, building a 6-0 lead before Kyman registered the  first Matador point. Northridge battled back, tied the game at 11-11, then went  ahead, 13-11, on Gary Reznick's dink shot before giving up four unanswered  points.  </P> <P> "After we went up 13-11, we just broke down," Kyman said. "I think that set the  tone for the rest of the match."  </P> <P> Price agreed.  </P> <P> "We were close," Price said, "but they just played unbelievable defense that  kept them in the game."  </P> <P> Northridge broke a 6-6 tie and held a 9-6 advantage in the second game before  USC reeled off nine points in a row, primarily on the hitting of Bryan Ivie and  the blocking of Dan Greenbaum.  </P> <P> Ivie had 21 kills while Greenbaum had seven blocks. Kevin Shepard and Jason  Perkins chipped in with 15 and 13 kills.  </P> <P> Neil Coffman led Northridge with 19 kills. Kyman and Raphael Tulino, who  recorded two service aces, had 17 and 14 each.  </P></p>

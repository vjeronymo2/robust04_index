			<p><P> July 8, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ALBUM REVIEWS;  </P> <P> *** BENNY GREEN "LINEAGE" BLUE NOTE  </P> <P> The young ex-Art Blakey pianist seems to want to touch all bases, at the cost  of a truly distinctive style: "See-See Rider" is an old time Ma Rainey blues;  others are works by Monk, Elmo Hope (the very boppish "Crazy") and Neal Hefti  (a long investigation of "Li'l Darlin' "). Green's four originals are  lightweight and pleasant, but his attempt to re-create Bud Powell's "Glass  Enclosure" lacks the dynamic articulation of the composer's own 1953  masterpiece. A promising though less than consistent major label solo debut.  LEONARD FEATHER  </P></p>

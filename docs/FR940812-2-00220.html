			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBDCs operate on the basis of a state plan to provide assistance within a state or designated geographical area. The initial plan must have the written approval of the Governor. As a condition to any financial award made to an applicant, non-Federal funds must be provided from sources other than the Federal Government. SBDCs operate under the provisions of P.L. 96&hyph;302, as amended by P.L. 98&hyph;395, a Notice of Award (Cooperative Agreement) issued by SBA, and the provisions of this Program Announcement. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Purpose and Scope <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SBDC Program is designed to provide quality assistance to small businesses in order to promote growth, expansion, innovation, increased productivity and management improvement. To accomplish these objectives, SBDCs link resources of the Federal, State, and local governments with the resources of the educational system and the private sector to meet the specialized and complex needs of the small business community. SBDCs also coordinate with other SBA programs of business development and utilize the expertise of these affiliated resources to expand services and avoid duplication of effort. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Program Objectives <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The overall objective of the SBDC Program is to leverage Federal dollars and resources with those of the state, academic community and private sector to: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) strengthen the small business community; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) contribute to the economic growth of the communities served; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) make assistance available to more small businesses than is now possible with present Federal resources; <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) create a broader based delivery system to the small business community. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> SBDC Program Organization <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> SBDCs are organized to provide maximum services to the local small business community. The lead SBDC receives financial assistance from the SBA to operate a statewide SBDC Program. In states where more than one organization receives SBA financial assistance to operate an SBDC, each lead SBDC is responsible for Program operations throughout a specific regional area to be served by the SBDC. The lead SBDC is responsible for establishing a network of SBDC subcenters to offer service coverage to the small business community. The SBDC network is managed and directed by a full-time Director. SBDCs must ensure that at least 80 percent of Federal funds provided are used to provide services to small businesses. To the extent possible, SBDCs provide services by enlisting volunteer and other low cost resources on a statewide basis. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> SBDC Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The specific types of services to be offered are developed in coordination with the SBA district office which has jurisdiction over a given SBDC. SBDCs emphasize the provision of indepth, high-quality assistance to small business owners or prospective small business owners in complex areas that require specialized expertise. These areas may include, but are not limited to: management, marketing, financing, accounting, strategic planning, regulation and taxation, capital formation, procurement assistance, human resource management, production, operations, economic and business data analysis, engineering, technology transfer, innovation and research, new product development, product analysis, plant layout and design, agri-business, computer application, business law information, and referral (any legal services beyond basic legal information, and referral require the endorsement of the State Bar Association,) exporting, office automation, site selection, or any other areas of assistance required to promote small business growth, expansion, and productivity within the State. The SBDC shall also ensure that a full range of business development and technical assistance services are made available to small businesses located in rural areas. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The degree to which SBDC resources are directed towards specific areas of assistance is determined by local community needs, SBA priorities and SBDC Program objectives, and agreed upon by the SBA district office and the SBDC. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The SBDC must offer quality training to improve the skills and knowledge of existing and prospective small business owners. As a general guideline, SBDCs should emphasize the provision of training in specialized areas other than basic small business management subjects. SBDCs should also emphasize training designed to reach particular audiences such as members of SBA priority and special emphasis groups. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> SBDC Program Requirements <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The SBDC is responsible to the SBA for ensuring that all programmatic and financial requirements imposed upon them by statute or agreement are met. The SBDC must assure that quality assistance and training in management and technical areas are provided to the State small business community through the State SBDC network. As a condition of this agreement, the SBDC must perform, but not be limited to, the following activities: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) the SBDC ensures that services are provided as close as possible to small business population centers. This is accomplished through the establishment of SBDC subcenters. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) the SBDC ensures that lists of local and regional private consultants are maintained at the lead SBDC and each SBDC subcenter. The SBDC utilizes and provides compensation to qualified small business vendors such as private management consultants, private consulting engineers, and private testing laboratories. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>920727 FT  27 JUL 92 / People: Electronic switches Dennis Grice has been appointed finance director of AT&amp;T CAPITAL; he joins from AT&amp;T Systems Leasing, US. Kim Dicks has been appointed director of AT&amp;T Leasing, a division of AT&amp;T Capital. John Burris has been appointed md of AT&amp;T Business Communications Europe; he moves from AT&amp;T Business Communications Systems in the US. Jim Wilkinson (above left), formerly sales and support director of Ungermann-Bass's UK subsidiary, has been appointed md of AT&amp;T EASYLINK SERVICES' UK business. ***** Ian Craig (above right) has been appointed group md UK and Richard Reid deputy md private switching in the UK for NORTHERN TELECOM EUROPE. ***** Stuart Walsh, formerly vice-president European operations for Marcam, has been appointed UK chief executive officer of ROSS SYSTEMS; he succeeds Larry Smart who becomes president, North American operations. ***** Chris Rogal, a consultant with KPMG, has been appointed marketing director of the UK operations of CSC EUROPE. ***** Ed Hough, formerly md - Europe for Johnson Matthey, has been appointed chief executive of SECURICOR's communications division. ***** The chairmen of Manganese Bronze, maker of London's famous black taxi cabs, have a tendency to die in harness. Hence the company has decided to pick a relatively youthful Hugh Lang (above), the former chairman of management consultants P-E International, to fill the chair which has been vacant since Rocky Stone died in April. Lang, 59, trained as a metallurgist, but joined P-E as a management consultant in 1961. In 1980 he was made executive chairman and brought the company to market in 1986. Before he stepped down last month, he had been specialising in the fields of board structure, top organisation and business development. His skills in this last area could come in useful at Manganese Bronze, which has been hit hard by the recession. Although Manganese Bronze is capitalised at just Pounds 13m on the stock market, it always seems to have been able to recruit high profile figures as chairman. Lang's predecessor, 77-year-old Rocky Stone was a leading light in the Industrial &amp; Commercial Finance Corporation and sat on the boards of Smith New Court and Babcock International. Meanwhile Stone's predecessor, Dennis Poore, headed the company for 21 years, and was a driving force in trying to save Britain's motor cycle industry. He was 70 when he died in office.</p>

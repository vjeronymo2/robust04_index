			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Bekker: "For Whom Is Oleg Soskovets </F> Working?"]    [Text] Negotiations of the leading aluminum  producers--delegations of the United States, Russia, the  European Union, Australia, Canada, and Norway--will be held this  week in Ottawa. If successful, agreements on the amounts of  supplies of the product to the world market will be ratified.  And in Moscow light will be shed, finally, on the fate of  Anatoliy Dyakov, chairman of the Unified Power System of Russia  stock company, whose removal is being spoken of in the Council  of Ministers as a done deal. These two formally unconnected  events have common roots. The initiator of Mr. Dyakov's  dismissal and the key figure for presentation in Canada of  Russia's "aluminum" position is Oleg Soskovets, first deputy  chairman of the government.    The aluminum industry has become the most expressive  example,  perhaps, of Russia's "Asiatic" move onto Europe's metal markets.  From 300,000 tonnes in 1990, our exports have jumped to 1.6  million tonnes. Prices have collapsed almost twofold, and  Western producers initially began to toss and turn and then,  having instituted against Russia an anti-dumping inquiry, forced  it into a civilized discussion, into consent to hold back its  aluminum expansion included.    Having plucked the "foreign currency primrose," our  enterprises have now encountered a very unpleasant situation:  Exports have been compulsorily restricted, and the domestic  prices of primary aluminum and rolled products have gone beyond  world prices. In addition, the release price of the aluminum  combines (2 million rubles [R] per tonne) is almost double the  price of the independent dealers on the Moscow Metal Exchange.  It is not surprising that demand for the enterprises' product  has fallen. But the sector is in a mood neither to cut back on  production nor to lose its dividends. And the only way it can  preserve the status quo is to freeze the price of electric  power, the consumption of which constitutes up to 30 percent of  the prime costs of the output of the group of enterprises.    It has to be said that electric power is a natural monopoly,  and the cost of a kilowatt-hour is, in any case, regulated, at  three levels, what is more: The government determines the  tariffs for the public and agriculture, the Federal Energy  Commission establishes them for the Unified Power System of  Russia regional stock company, which supplies the giants of  industry, and the regional commissions impose tariffs for the  local industrial enterprises.    In accordance with regulations approved last year for the  Ministry of Economics, the electricity tariffs shall be revised  "with a change in external conditions." The external conditions,  that is, the prices of each and every thing, are growing by the  month, and the electricity tariffs are raised administratively  not more often than once a quarter. For the Unified Power System  of Russia regional stock company, they have not been revised  since September 1993. Rising up on each occasion as a wall has  been Oleg Soskovets, who stated in February in the Council of  Ministers Commission for Operational Matters that the power  engineers had "established communism for one sector." Waves of  indignation at the price policy of the fuel and energy complex,  which is allegedly to blame for the endless inflation, have been  rolling through the press in parallel with this. Clearly  referring to the regional stock company's Mr. Dyakov, a  representative of the industrial directors said that "one stock  company is, in fact, directing the whole country."    The reasons for Oleg Soskovets' decisions, which are  synchronous with the "public indignation," are, generally, there  on the surface. On the one hand, the state's share of the  exports of rolled aluminum constitutes 91 percent, and it does  not, understandably, want such a channel of foreign currency to  dry up. On the other, the prices of the extensive product list  of the iron and steel complex have already scaled world heights,  and the price of a kilowatt-hour is five times lower--and a  further rise would confront a large sector of the economy with a  dilemma: either bankruptcy or a difficult rearrangement of the  groups of enterprises. "Power engineering is literally  oppressing the entire economy. Prices in the regions are being  established chaotically, essentially, and managers are not being  held responsible or to account," Oleg Soskovets declared.    This position precisely reflects the group interests of  market outsiders and has nothing in common with public  interests. The first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers  knows full well that it was the wild move "into the light" of  Russia's metallurgists that knocked down world prices and that  the energy consumption of aluminum industry considerably exceeds  Western standards and is a consequence of the technological  backwardness of the groups of enterprises. The abundance on the  domestic market of imported commodities in aluminum wrapping  against the drastic reduction in rolled products of this metal  in Russia is clear evidence that the country is pumping cheap  electricity to the West via aluminum. As far as the alleged  arbitrary price action of the power engineers is concerned, this  is, perhaps, the sole sector counting tariffs "the old  way"--strictly according to the formulas from 21 supplements to  the computation procedure, which can always easily be checked.    None of this is any secret for Mr. Soskovets. He could take  on a task of truly state dimensions--gradually invert the  pyramid of energy consumption in the country, whereby heavy  industry bears the main price burden, and agriculture and the  public get electricity for a pittance, virtually (5-6 percent of  the cost). He could set about a leveling of the 20-fold price  spread by region (threefold in the United States), for which he  would win the industrial consumers' gratitude. But Oleg  Soskovets, former chairman of the State Committee for  Metallurgy, has opted for a path more in keeping, evidently,  with the scale of his personality--he has begun to lobby  Soviet-style for sectoral interests. When, in February, at a  meeting of the board of the Ministry of Fuel and Energy, the  power engineers presented him with evidence that the  metallurgists, who were in debt to them, had money in their  accounts, he told the meeting hall with irritation that "such  shadowing is impermissible." He, however, beleaguered the power  engineers who had shown him documents demonstrating how great  was the prime cost of the product of the Bratsk and Krasnoyarsk  aluminum combines. And then Mr. Soskovets decided radically to  "investigate" energy prices, instructing Anatoliy Chubays to  study the question of the "expediency" of Anatoliy Dyakov  continuing in office as chairman of the Unified Power System of  Russia regional stock company.    Removing Mr. Dyakov as a warning is, generally,  uncomplicated. As is, in principle, holding back energy prices.  This would turn out badly for the whole economy, it is true.  With the 46 percent wear and tear of power engineering  equipment, a shortage of investments would very quickly result  in a growth of the breakdown rate and a reduction in scheduled  maintenance. The sector is, as a whole, inertial. You might not  build here for a couple of years, and this hits three or four  years later. At the start of the 1980's the introduction of  capacity in power engineering constituted 10 million-12 million  kilowatt-hours, incidentally; now, it is roughly 10 times less.    Oleg Soskovets has been "on the political Olympus" just  under  a year. Everyone has come in for it in this time--monetarists  and "moderates"--and the press has hit at Gaydar and  Chernomyrdin, Fedorov and Zaveryukha, Chubays and Glukhikh. The  first deputy prime minister has, surprisingly, emerged from the  battles totally "unscathed." He has remained beyond criticism,  although industrial policy has failed completely, and the  concept of financial and industrial groups sponsored by Mr.  Soskovets is decaying at root. There have been no breakthroughs  in the field of ideas, except for curatorship of the work of  academicians Shatalin and Abalkin "on a correction of the course  of the reforms."    Despite the lack of achievements, the first "vice" remains  under a charm and continues to gain more and more political  authority. According to a recent order of the prime minister,  Oleg Soskovets will coordinate key spheres of economic policy  and direct 14 ministries and departments, and the composition  and structure of the federal executive authorities and the  federal civil service are in his hands. He is head of the  government's Commission for Operational Matters, to which the  function of distribution of centrally allocated credit to  industry was recently transferred. And this same commission,  judging by documents of the Council of Ministers, will shortly  win distribution of the Western credit received by Russia and  the centrally allocated foreign exchange resources of the  government.    In a short space of time the 44-year-old Oleg Soskovets has  made a dizzying career from deputy chairman of the Council of  Ministers of Kazakhstan to first deputy chairman of the Council  of Ministers of Russia. He has concentrated an enormous amount  of power in his hands. Both this surge and his being off limits  for criticism on the part of the president and the prime  minister compel doubts as to the authenticity of the original  version of his elevation: Boris Yeltsin had brought into the  government "his man" Lobov, and Viktor Chernomyrdin, in  response, made a move with the little-known Soskovets. It would  seem, however, that people had gambled on Oleg Soskovets  somewhat earlier and had pushed him persistently and recommended  him just as persistently to the prime minister.    Indicating who is "pushing" Oleg Soskovets is not that easy.  One thing is for certain: Among the persons with an interest in  him are the industrial directors who have not joined in the  reforms.</p>

			<p>920724 FT  24 JUL 92 / Barclays move on MCC attacked AN ATTEMPT by Barclays Bank to stop the administrators of Maxwell Communication Corporation suing it in the US for the return of Dollars 30m was an unjustified interference with the US court, the High Court was told yesterday. Mr John Higham QC, for the administrators, said Barclays wanted the English court to help prevent the US court granting remedies in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in New York involving MCC for the benefit of the company's creditors. He told Mr Justice Hoffmann that the US court should be left to decide whether it should deal with the dispute. The firm of administrators, Price Waterhouse, claims that the Dollars 30m payment in November 1991 - three weeks after the death of Robert Maxwell - was an unlawful preference. Price Waterhouse contends that it is for it to choose where to sue for its return to MCC. The payment had been demanded by Barclays under the terms of an overdraft facility granted to MCC. The bank remains a creditor of MCC for Pounds 32.3m, about Pounds 7m of which relates to that facility. Barclays has argued that the English court is the natural forum for trial of the dispute because the overdraft facility was an English commercial transaction, governed by English law, to provide working capital for an English company and its UK subsidiaries. Mr Higham argued that there were substantial facts supporting the view that the US court was the natural and appropriate forum. Barclays had a substantial trading presence in the US and the Dollars 30m had been paid in New York at Barclays' request. Judgment will be given on Tuesday.</p>

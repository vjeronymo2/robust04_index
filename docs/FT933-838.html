			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Liffe to restart talks on joining Globex LIFFE is to resume talks on joining Globex, the round-the-clock futures trading system, after the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) yielded to pressure from its Globex partners to give up its claim to a key Liffe product. Reuters and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which developed the project with the the CBOT, urged it to relinquish its right to trade bund futures, the most heavily-traded contract on Liffe. Globex, developed by Reuters, the CBOT and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, urgently needs to attract other exchanges to list their futures contracts on the electronic system, to boost trading volume. The system is designed to allow futures trading to continue outside exchange hours, but volume has consistently fallen short of targets since its launch more than a year ago. Liffe, the London International Financial Futures &amp; Options Exchange, pulled out of negotiations last month, when the CBOT laid claim to bund futures. Reuters has played a pivotal role in getting the negotiations going again. While publicly declaring its long-term commitment to the project, Reuters has been dissatisfied with the CBOT's handling of its talks with Liffe. 'We believe the position on bund contracts you have taken with Liffe is inconsistent with the Globex agreement,' a Reuters executive wrote in a letter to CBOT chairman Mr Pat Arbor a week before Liffe discussions ended.</p>

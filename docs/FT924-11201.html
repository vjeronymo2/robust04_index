			<p>921027 FT  27 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Storehouse Hats off to Storehouse for some pretty impressive dealing. To get Pounds 78m for a problem-child like Habitat, which the Storehouse management does not have time to fix, must be satisfying. Finding someone to buy the surplus-to-requirements Richards chain for an equally full Pounds 30m is all the more so. Of course both Sears, the proud new owners of Richards, and the Stichting Ingka Foundation, which has bought Habitat, have reasons for their purchases. Sears can argue that Richards fills a gap in its coverage of the womenswear market, while the SIF wants to develop a furniture brand to complement its Ikea stores. Both will have to work hard to justify the price they have paid, but SIF has the more difficult task. True, the foundation is not publicly quoted and so perhaps can afford to take a relaxed view, but sorting out Habitat's troubles is a rather different proposition from that of exporting the successful Ikea idea. With much apparently expected of the current Habitat management, they will have to come up with better ideas than the failed move into edge-of-town sheds. Storehouse is left with some cash, and two businesses which it argues fit logically together. Both BhS and Mothercare sell to families with young children and aim to buy on advantageous terms because of the group's size. Storehouse must make those backstage savings work if it is to avoid the notion that once Mothercare has been sorted out it should go the way of Habitat and Richards.</p>

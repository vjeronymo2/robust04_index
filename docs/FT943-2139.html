			<p>940921 FT  21 SEP 94 / US armed forces sink their differences When US Army troops took off in helicopters from the deck of the aircraft Eisenhower this week to land in Haiti, they were taking part in the first full-scale experiment in getting the different branches of the armed forces to work together more flexibly. Although the landing was not opposed, it provided an operational test for the Pentagon's new concept of Adaptive Joint Force Packages, intended to break down the traditional demarcations between the various services' roles. Amphibious assaults have in the past been the province of the marines, who operate under the navy's flag. Yesterday the marines took over the city of Cap Haitien, on Haiti's north coast, in a traditional amphibious landing from the assault ship Wasp. But the main landing in Port-au-Prince came from the 1st Brigade of the army's 10th Mountain Division, using the Eisenhower as a 'lily pad', in the words of Captain Alan Gemmill, the carrier's commander, for their Blackhawk and Cobra helicopters. This is believed to have been the first time that aircraft carriers have deployed for hostilities without their air wings. Service rivalries have been a pervasive problem for the US armed forces, which still maintain separate air forces for the navy, marines and army, quite apart from the air force itself. Each service's insistence on developing its own equipment has greatly increased procurement costs, and co-operation on joint operations has sometimes broken down. But budget constraints have made each branch eager to demonstrate its flexibility. The navy has a stake in showing its 12 aircraft carriers can be adapted, as this is an area where the Pentagon is most often suggested to be overweight. The Adaptive Joint Force Packages concept is credited in particular to Admiral Paul Miller, who as commander-in-chief of the US Atlantic Command is the overall commander for the Haiti operation. All services seemed happy with the first army/navy co-ordinated landing of its kind. Officers from the Eisenhower showed a touch of pride in having carried 51 army helicopters and the full array of surveillance aircraft. Army Private Mazur, now landed in Haiti, said he had a new respect for his colleagues on the water, who not only ferried him there but also built new parts for army machinery on demand. They also showed him the way round the aircraft carrier when he got lost. By Monday evening, along with Pte Mazur, most of the 2,000 light infantrymen on board had been lifted into Port-au-Prince.</p>

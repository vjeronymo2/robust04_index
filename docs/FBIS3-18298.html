Parliamentary sources said that despite Thursday's [24  February] recess decision, members of the True Path Party (DYP)  and main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) groups had decided  such a recess was wrong "in a period in which important  developments are taking place."    Although there was no reference to coup rumors in the  postponement decision, sources said both the ongoing crisis with  regard to the Kurdish based Democracy Party [DEP] and the debate  on a possible military takeover had called for the decision.    The DEP started is party assembly meeting on Wednesday to  decide on whether it would participate in the upcoming March 27  local elections.</p>

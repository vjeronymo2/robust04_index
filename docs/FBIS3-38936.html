			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] Defense Minister David  Collenette says that despite the horror of the mortar attack on  Sarajevo the Canadian Government is still opposed to air strikes.    [Begin Collenette recording] We haven't changed our position  since the prime minister announced it last month, which was that  we believe that air strikes were not the way to deal with the  problem at this time, until all other courses of action fail.  As Mr. Ouellet said yesterday, we still believe that a  negotiated settlement can be arrived at. [end recording]    Defense Minister David Collenette: A primary consideration  for Ottawa is the safety of Canada's 2,400 peacekeepers in  former Yugoslavia.</p>

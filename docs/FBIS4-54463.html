			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by D.N.: "Turkish `Blue Helmets' Are Coming"] </F>   [Text] Skopje -- The representatives of the Democratic  Party of Macedonian Serbs have claimed in Skopje today that  2,000 Turkish "Blue Helmets" are being brought to Macedonia [The  Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia -- FYROM]. They did not  want to disclose where they obtained this information, saying  only that it came "from well-informed sources." In their  opinion the arrival of the Turks in Macedonia will be decisively  opposed by both the Serbian and the Macedonian population. They  assessed this deployment as an attempt to destabilize this area,  adding that the only guarantee of peace and stability in this  part of the Balkans was the arrival of Russian "Blue Helmets" as  part of the UN Protection Forces.</p>

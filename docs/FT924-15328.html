			<p>921005 FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (6): Back to the future - Fax Machines ALMOST 30 years ago, in 1964, Xerox unveiled the Long Distance Xerography terminal, the world's first facsimile machine for business use. The LDX system, which consisted of a separate scanner and printer each the size of a four-drawer filing cabinet, transmitted typed, written or drawn images and printed them on plain paper. Since then the business fax machine has shrunk considerably in size and has become an integral part of most offices. In Britain alone there will be an estimated 1m fax machines in use by year-end - almost treble the number just three years ago. Fax machines today are becoming faster, cheaper and more sophisticated with some new models even boasting colour transmission. Equipment sales grew rapidly in the 1980s and although growth in established markets has been slowed by the recession, office sales have been buoyed in recent years by the emergence of plain paper, laser, and ink-jet fax machines which are gradually replacing machines which use thermal paper. Today there are an estimated 15m-20m fax machines worldwide, a number which is expected to grow to more than 30m by the end of next year. Most are of the Group 3 industry standard and can send an A4 sheet across the world in seconds for the price of a telephone call. By far the biggest installed base is in the US, but according to Datamonitor's 1992 European Customer Premises Equipment study, annual facsimile machine sales in Europe have grown from 350,000 five years ago to more than 1.7m last year. These figures hide some other striking trends. In particular the structure of the European market has been changing. Germany has overtaken the UK in terms of sales volume and rapidly-falling prices have begun to put a break on market value growth in recent years. Furthermore, mature markets such as the UK tend to polarise into two segments; cheap low-end machines manufactured by companies such as Amstrad and a host of Far Eastern suppliers, and expensive, high-quality devices such as plain paper faxes which are often purchased as an upgrade. The range of machines available has expanded dramatically. Currently there are more than 200 different types of fax machine on offer from 35 suppliers in the UK market. Many of these are small, cheap, desktop machines, ideal for the growing personal or small office market. Often they combine the functions of telephone, answering machine, photocopier and fax and can switch between voice and fax automatically therefore requiring only a single telephone line. But almost 30 per cent of the machines currently on sale in the UK are plain paper fax machines. Although plain paper faxes are generally more expensive than thermal machines, the price difference is narrowing and the shift towards plain paper faxes reflects some of the problems associated with their thermal counterparts. These include high paper cost, the tendency of text on thermal paper to fade making it unsuitable for filing or storage, the difficulty of writing on thermal fax paper and problems re-sending thermal faxes. Despite the recession, fax-usage is also increasing. The UK market will be worth about Pounds 750m this year and is growing by about 30 per cent a year compared to 5 per cent for voice traffic. A recent Gallup survey conducted for Pitney Bowes Facsimile Systems Division revealed that 31 per cent of the top 500 companies in the UK increased fax usage over the past 12 months despite the recession and 91 per cent believe fax machines helped increase their productivity. Faster fax transmission speeds cut labour, time and phone costs. Some Group 3 machines already operate at 14.4 kilobits per second (kbps) over the public switched telephone network and can receive or send an A4 page in about six seconds. There are also a few Group 4 faxes which were designed to operate on ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) circuits at 64kbps, transmitting an A4 page in three to four seconds. But although Group 4 faxes have been around since the mid-1980s the introduction of ISDN has been slower than expected. In the meantime, the transmission speed of Group 3 machines has been further enhanced and an alternative 64kbps standard has emerged called either Group 3bis or G364. To overcome some of the problems identified by fax users, telecommunications groups have seized the opportunity to generate additional income by offering value-added services to customers. For example in the US American Telephone and Telegraph offers a subscription service called EnhancedFAX which enables customers to broadcast a fax, virtually simultaneously, to as many as 10,000 fax machines worldwide. In the UK, Mercury's managed fax service, called Surefax, provides a particularly sophisticated set of value-added services aimed at multinational customers and launched by the Cable and Wireless group subsidiary last October. One significant growth area targeted by the Surefax service is PC-generated faxes. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of all faxes begin life as a word-processor file on a PC. But the document is usually printed out before being loaded into a fax machine for delivery. Only 2 per cent of fax traffic is currently sent directly from PCs. But plug-in cards, external fax-modems and LAN Fax servers are already providing portable computers, desktop PCs and, most significantly, networked PCs with the power to send and receive faxes. Prices for PC fax cards are already lower than those for a cheap fax and fax cards sales are expected to grow quickly. Indeed, the distinctions between fax machines and other office equipment are becoming increasingly blurred. Equipment manufacturers such as Panasonic are already selling fax machines with computer interfaces which allow PCs to control the operation of the fax. Anything received on the fax can be printed out or saved on the PC. Other devices such as the JetFax produced by Fujitsu connect to laser printers and enable them to print incoming faxes or send anything generated on-screen as a fax. More generally, office equipment suppliers say they have recently detected increased interest in 'multifunctional digital devices' such as the Xerox 3010 which combines a plain paper fax with a photocopier. So the fax machine of the future may bear more than a passing resemblance to the LDX. Not only is it likely to use plain paper, it will probably also combine a range of functions including document scanner, photocopier and printer.</p>

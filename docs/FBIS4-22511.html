			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Nikita Vaynonen: "The Soap Is from the Wrong </F> Opera, But the Broom Is Valuable"]    [Text] What will become of our TV? Will it remain in the  form the viewer is used to, or will it ultimately come under the  power of commerce and bad taste? Is the state prepared to  continue in the future to pay for its maintenance, or will these  payments gradually decrease to zero over the next couple of  years? Do we need state TV at all, or should it become  exclusively private?    Questions, questions, questions...they are being discussed  at  many levels, from the communal kitchen to the parliament. And  with all the diversity of opinions the disputing parties, as a  rule, agree on two points: The spiritual health of the nation  depends largely on television, and television itself is  seriously ill.    In the most general form the condition of our TV screen  reflects the condition of the economy, culture,  statehood--society as a whole, with all the pains of the  transition period when the old structures are rotting and  collapsing and the new ones are being born into torment and  filth. Perhaps the only difference with TV is that it is more on  view for the country than anything else: What is beyond the  mirror (excuse me, beyond the screen) directly affects the  "picture," what television workers call the result of their  labor--everything we see on the screen.    A good deal has been said about the corruption that has been  eating away at state TV, including by the leading masters of  state television itself. We shall not repeat this. But if the  discussion were only about who is putting the most money in his  pocket, the subject of corruption in TV would hardly be worth a  separate discussion. The more so since television journalists,  like the rank-and-file television workers in our country in  general, have never been paid as much for their labor as their  intellectual property is actually worth. So is it such a great  sin for them to be paid more now, actually in keeping with their  labor and their talent?    The problem (or blame) lies not with large amounts of money,  and frequently not even with the means of obtaining it, which,  as a rule, you cannot figure out. It is impossible to judge what  is legal here and what is not as long as there is no law on  television. Is it legal, for example, to split up the  advertising service of that same Ostankino when the  business--and the money!--is handled not by a helpless single  owner but by a multitude of real owners of individual programs?  The desire to earn money in and of itself can only be laudable.  The blame (and the problem!) of those who are earning it lies in  that labor and talent have nothing to do with earning money  anywhere. Mr. Sheldon Markoff, our guest from American  television circles, recently noted in the company of his Russian  colleagues:    "I have devoted half my life to television and let me assure  you that our federal television broadcasting company defends  only the interests of the public, the audience, and by no means  those of the state and the broadcasters. Our license to  broadcast is something like an oath of fidelity to the  television viewers. It would be better for you to come and see  for yourself than to see the monstrous American television  product which I see in your country every day."    And there you have it! Only the Third World has the good  fortune to tirelessly watch a stern-looking man tastefully  lighting a cigarette against an exotic mountain Indian  background. Americans would simply not understand it if somebody  tried to prove to them that Lucky Strike is real America. It  seems that under Kennedy the first machine for computer  translation from one language to another was tested in the  United States. They asked the president to suggest some phrase  in English and assured him that he would immediately hear how it  would sound in Russian. "All right," said the president, "here  is a phrase for you: The spirit is strong but the flesh is  weak." The machine grunted and spit out: "Vodka keeps well, but  the meat has spoiled." It must be that the creators of the  machine had automatically put into it ideas about Russians that  are typical of the "mentality" of the average American: Where  there is Russia there is vodka. And regarding meat, it was a  real prophecy. Our own rots, but on the screen there is  "Knorr"....    Advertising tobacco and alcohol on television is prohibited  in our country by the law on protection of the health of Russian  citizens. But neither the law nor the corresponding order from  Ostankino chief A. Yakovlev is being obeyed. The money is more  valuable!    But what is more valuable than money? It is thought that  inducement is. And the main national "inducement" is that the  new Constitution guarantees to citizens (Article 44): "Everyone  has the right to...access to cultural values." If one keeps in  mind that the lion's share of these values are concentrated in  the two Russian capitals and several other large cities, it  becomes clear that the right to access to them can actually be  provided only with the help of television. But sociologists  attest that never before has the percentage of programs that are  called serious been as low as it is today. Air time has been  clogged with a flow of "soap operas," simple-minded competitions  and quiz shows, and concerts of pop and rock music. It would be  all right if it were good "soap," but our television bureaucrats  have given preference to low-grade Latin American "operas." And  the main place among the game shows and competitions has been  taken by those in which the viewers' imagination is struck not  by the creative devices of their authors but by the amounts of  the prizes. It is no wonder that on one of these programs,  instead of toys on the Christmas tree there were $100 bills.  There is no need to even talk about the tasteless and noisy  television concerts: The lyrical songs of Soviet composers which  we criticized mercilessly in the past for the banality of the  text and music seem like true treasures by comparison.    World experience shows that TV inevitably becomes a vehicle  for mass culture. But some examples of it are better and some  are worse. On our television, preference is given to the worst.  The reason is simple: We select whatever is cheaper and can  produce a rapid and the largest possible gain. Here, as distinct  from food products, the food of the screen does not undergo even  a selective expert evaluation. The only guarantee against a  poor-quality product, both foreign and domestic, are the taste  and honor of the television journalists themselves. But these  remarkable qualities are always being subjected to a great deal  of pressure. The main concern is how to survive.    With a 40-fold increase in the cost of television programs,  the cost of services of the Ministry of Communications, which  puts out the signal, has increased 100-fold. According to the  testimony of such authorities as the general director of VGTRK  [All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company],  A. Lysenko, and the chief of the fund for protection of  glasnost, A. Simonov, today it is more advantageous to use  foreign land transmitters and communications satellites than to  apply for the services of the corresponding domestic  departments. And there is no hope that these services will  become any less expensive in the foreseeable future. The price  of a kilowatt-hour, for example, is still less than the world  price, and when they become equal (and this is apparently  inevitable), it is difficult even to imagine how much the energy  workers will be asking from the communications workers, and the  latter--from the television workers. Radio broadcasting,  naturally, is in a similar position. In the budget not only did  they not account for this inevitable growth of prices but even  the costs at the current rates were to be financed only  partially (according to information from the deputy minister of  finance, I. Molchanov, subsidies are being cut by half, and in  the draft budget submitted to the Duma there is even less  money). In the upper echelons of the television business they  are quite seriously talking about cutting broadcasting by a  factor of two, three, or even four. According to the prediction  of Anatoliy Lysenko, then "Russian television viewers would be  able to see only films from video rental stores slightly diluted  with news excerpts."    Unfortunately, searches for a way out of the impasse for a  long time have amounted exclusively for searches for someone to  blame. In turn and altogether they have been the energy workers  who are raising prices, the communications workers who are  threatening to strike, the government which is not providing  money and is breaking its firmest promises to provide at least  some...of course, it is absurd when one state structure, in this  case, communications, gets something from another one that is  equally a part of the state by striking. That is like the story  where the right arm says: I will not cut hay until the left one  gives me a scythe, and the left one answers: I will not give it  up until you put a sleeve on me, and the right one says: I will  not put it on until...and so forth. It is pointless to look for  a scapegoat. And even if after digging you manage to find  unjustified rate increases in some stage, this will not save us.  Everyone involved in the problem, regardless of whether they  have economic or political views, seems to agree on a simple  idea: The state is incapable of carrying such an immense monster  as the present state television and radio. The state is unable  not only to feed this monster, but even to provide the minimum  necessary control of this structure.    Today state broadcasting includes 93 television and radio  companies (three federal, one in Moscow, and 89 regional ones).  In terms of the volume of broadcasting and the audience reached,  it is still the predominant one. But in terms of potential  energy, both human and material, state TV is clearly falling  behind independent TV. There are already 321 private companies  in operation, and this is not counting the cable studios that  are sprouting up like mushrooms. On the Ostankino channel, which  is still the most powerful, 80 percent of the programs are made  by independent producer services (ViD, NTV, Eksperiment, ATV,  etc.) and only 20 percent are made by state television employees  and journalists, of whom, according to estimates of experts,  there are clearly too many. (Here, true, it is necessary to make  a significant reservation: The word "independent" which is used  to designate nonstate companies is, to put it mildly,  imprecise--they are even very dependent on their supporters,  frequently more so than state companies are on the state, which,  as Aleksandr Yakovlev correctly noted in an interview on Radio  Liberty, no longer interferes in the work of television  journalists.)    But destatization of television and radio is only one of the  paths to economic support for broadcasting. Moreover, it  involves costs. At a recent meeting of the television community  in the House of the Journalist where this problem was discussed,  one of the representatives of the regional companies told how  the creation of a joint-stock company out of the broadcasting  center was proceeding in his city. He asked not to give his name  because "I have to live there." The lion's share of the stocks  went to the local administration of the State Committee for  Administration of State Property and also local communications  workers--who are now in charge of the center. All the  journalists could do was scrape together enough to buy thousands  of vouchers, which gave them the right to...3 percent of the  stocks.    This kind of "privatization" of air time can lead to only  one  thing: The monopoly of the center will be replaced by a much  more destructive and selfish monopoly of local authorities.    The situation was exacerbated especially after the Ministry  of the Press was transformed into the Russian Committee on the  Press and the Federal Television and Radio Service was created:  Licensing of air time, which for better or worse was still  handled by the corresponding administration of the Ministry of  the Press and Information, was actually terminated. It is not  included in the functions of the state committee, and the  federal television and radio service was created only de jure.  Moreover, its specific authority was not prescribed in the  presidential edict on its creation. It must be concretized in  the Statute on the Radio and Television Service, a draft of  which was recently made known to the journalistic community.  Information on the "parents" of the draft is going about, but,  judging from its content, the "parents" have little in common  with the authors of the president's edict: The draft interprets  the federal service as an institution in charge of domestic air  time even more strictly than the former Soviet State Committee  for Television and Radio.    The colleagues who gathered a couple of days ago in the  House  of the Journalist (and they were representatives of state and  private television and radio companies, journalistic legal  protection organizations, the Union of Journalists of Russia,  and the judicial chamber for information disputes) think that  the state (or, more precisely, social-legal) television and  radio broadcasting is necessary--it can consist of one or at  most two channels which exist at the expense of the budget or by  direct payment made in some form by the viewers and listeners  themselves and therefore do not depend on commercial interests.  In order for nonstate broadcasting to develop on a healthy basis  it is necessary, first, to destatize television and radio  companies, and especially broadcasting centers, and this should  be done in such a way that the people actually in charge of air  time are the professional journalists themselves, who know how  to work in the interests of the audience and not broadcasting  bureaucrats; second--as soon as possible it is necessary to have  a law on television and radio broadcasting which would place the  commercial, political, and other aspects of TV work on a firm  legal foundation.    But until there is a law, the Federal Television and Radio  Service should be assigned strictly limited functions, and in no  case should it be made into a supervisor of air time. Its work  is to carry out licensing and to check as strictly as possible  on the observance of its conditions (so that poison is not  advertised, there is not too much porn, stolen goods are not  circulated, etc.), for which it should have a data base of  license holders and the quality of their work. A new broom  should sweep things clean. But no censorship! No "ministry of  truth"! Only the law! As for money, society will be able to pay  for its own public television if it becomes the kind the  cultural, civilized majority of the nation want to see.</p>

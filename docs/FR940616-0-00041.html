			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5. Public Safety Services <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 22. We have received no comments opposing our proposal to exempt all licensees in the Special Emergency Radio and Public Safety Radio services from regulatory fees even where the licensee does not qualify for an exemption as a governmental or nonprofit entity. In the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we noted that the legislative history states that Congress intended to exempt public safety licensees from regulatory fees. APCO, in supporting our proposal, urges that we limit the public safety exemption to entities eligible for Public Safety Radio Service licenses pursuant to the provisions of part 90, subpart B, and not exempt licensees merely because they are authorized to operate on a public safety channel. We agree with APCO that only entities eligible to operate as public safety licensees should be entitled to an exemption. Therefore, we will restrict the public safety exemption to entities eligible to operate in the Special Emergency Radio or Public Safety Radio Services. <FOOTCITE>11</FOOTCITE>  Under this definition, the fact that a licensee is authorized to use a frequency allocated to these services is insufficient to gain an exemption as a public safety entity. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, we will not assess a regulatory fee upon Emergency Broadcast Service (EBS) licenses for auxiliary service facilities that use government-provided equipment because these stations are dedicated for EBS and are used solely for public safety purposes. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 6. Certification of Exempt Status <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 23. In order to implement our congressional mandate concerning exemptions, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  asked the parties to comment on the appropriate method for establishing exemptions from regulatory fees. Our goal is to minimize the burden on applicants and licensees seeking exemption from the regulatory fees. See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  at &para;&para;13, 16, and 21. The commenters supported our efforts and urged reporting and exemption certifications designed to minimize their paperwork burdens. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 24. Forest Industries Telecommunications (FIT) proposed that the Commission allow nonprofit entities to establish their exempt status by submitting a Determination Letter issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) stating that the applicant has qualified for tax exempt status under Section 501 of the Internal Revenue Act. The Utilities Telecommunications Council (UTC) urges that we reduce the burden on entities seeking to obtain a nonprofit exemption by requiring only that they file their employer identification numbers (EINs). UCC asserts that EINs are sufficient to permit verification of an entity's nonprofit status. The National Telephone Cooperative Association (NTCA) urges that we also exempt entities that have applied for IRS Determination Letters so that IRS administrative delays do not result in the denial of exemption from the regulatory fee requirement. NTCA requests that our determination of nonprofit status remain effective until a change in such status is determined by the IRS. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 25. PRTC urges us to rely upon existing exemptions from application fee payments held by governmental entities rather than require these entities to provide additional certifications to obtain exemptions from the regulatory fee requirement. Similarly, UCC contends that no additional certification of exempt status should be required from governmental applicants in the Private Radio services since applications for these services require information disclosing their exempt status. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 26. We agree with PRTC and UCC that we can rely on the data in private radio service applications and in the Commission's files to determine a regulatee's exempt status. Further, licensees and other regulatees for whom we have such data will not be required to file documentation to support their exempt status. If, after reviewing the information already on file, we are unable to determine a regulatee's exempt status we will issue a request that an applicant or licensee further document its claim of exempt status. With respect to amateur, noncommercial educational broadcast stations and public safety licensees, we do not anticipate any problem in establishing their eligibility for exempt status because their exempt status is based on the nature of their licenses. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 27. When our records contain no evidence of a governmental entity's exempt status, we will accept a certification of its governmental status. Nonprofit licensees may submit section 501 Determination Letters. Because these documents are readily available in the files of nonprofit entities, we decline at this time to establish a mechanism to verify nonprofit status through EINs. We will also require that an entity with a pending request for an IRS Determination Letter submit a regulatory fee because the IRS may deny the request for tax exempt status. However, we will refund the fee for the period covered by a subsequently issued Determination Letter. <FOOTCITE>12</FOOTCITE>  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> To obtain a refund a regulatee must demonstrate that the period covered by the Determination Letter's finding of tax exempt status includes the date that we established for the calculation of its fee in the fiscal year for which the refund is requested. Further, an entity will be subject to a regulatory fee for the fiscal year that the IRS terminates its tax exempt status if the termination is made prior to the date for calculating its fees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 28. We caution that we expect regulatees to act in good faith. In any instance in which payment is overdue, and the licensee or permittee cannot establish its entitlement to an exemption, we will assess a 25 percent penalty for late payment as authorized by Congress. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C. Waivers, Reductions and Deferments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 29. Section 9(d) provides that ``[t]he Commission may waive, reduce, or defer payment of a fee in any specific instance for good cause shown, where such action would promote the public interest.'' 47 U.S.C. 159(d). Section 9(d) is similar to, if not identical with section 8(d)(2) of the Act related to waivers and deferments of application fees. 47 U.S.C. 158(d)(2). Pursuant to section 8(d)(2), we have permitted waivers only on a case-by-case basis following a demonstration that the public interest clearly overrides the private interest of the requester. Thus, in our  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> NPRM, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  we proposed to restrict similarly waivers to encompass only those requests unambiguously articulating ``extraordinary and compelling circumstances'' outweighing the public interest in recouping the cost of the Commission's regulatory services from a particular regulatee. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

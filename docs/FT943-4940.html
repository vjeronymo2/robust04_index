			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Economic data help share prices move ahead - Market report Favourable data on UK money supply and consumer credit, both indicating reduced pressures for a rise in base rates, enabled the London stock market to move ahead yesterday. Share prices opened lower against a background of weakness in bond markets and nervousness ahead of this week's meeting between the UK chancellor of the exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of England. However, an early decline of 16 points on the FT-SE 100-share Index was recovered following the news that MO money supply had risen by an annualised rate of only 6.2 per cent in August, below market predictions. By the close the FT-SE 100 was a net 18.8 up at 3,241.5, with the UK market brushing off weakness in the US dollar and in other European bourses. But in the absence of a lead from Wall Street, closed for Labor Day, trading volume in London was unconvincing and the market was dominated by the placing of stock in WPP, the advertising group, and by activity in a handful of small company shares. London's performance, which reflected an easing of worries that the meeting of the UK chancellor and the Governor of the Bank of England might focus on arguments for a pre-emptive increase in base rates, ran counter to the general mood in other markets. Nervousness over the outlook for European interest rates increased following wider publication of the bearish views on German rates expressed by a leading US investment bank. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index, which incorporates a wide range of second line issues, gained 7.4 at 3,788.7. But traders admitted that yesterday's market was not fully tested and that London could yet follow the trend seen elsewhere in Europe. Seaq volume of 765.5m shares was higher than Friday's total but was swollen by the placing of 120m shares in WPP, double counted as they were passed through the market. Non-Footsie business, which included the WPP placing, made up 75 per cent of the day's total, well above the normal average. On Friday, 715.8m shares through the Seaq electronic network were worth Pounds 1.49bn in terms of genuine retail business in equities, comfortably towards the higher end of this year's daily averages. At least two trading programmes were reported yesterday, and the market was often led from the stock index futures sector. A fairly strong list of company profits due this week opened yesterday with trading news from Burmah Castrol, which disappointed some market specialists, and Coats Viyella, which responded more favourably to good half-time figures. There was demand for UK bank shares yesterday and oil stocks looked firm in spite of a more sluggish trend in crude prices. Retail and consumer shares joined in the general improvement, although the July consumer lending total fell well short of market expectations. Analysts said that the unexpectedly low lending figure of Pounds 296m reduced the dangers of early action on base rates - a factor favourable to retail stocks. Later this week the market will take in profits reports from a number of leading blue chip companies, including Glaxo, RTZ, Sun Alliance and British Gas. While good figures are widely expected from Glaxo, the market is likely to show more interest in any comments on the progress of Zantac, Glaxo's anti-ulcer drug, which still provides nearly half of group profits but now faces the prospect of competition from generic rivals. There will also be news this week from the building and construction sectors, which are areas seen as sensitive to the pace of economic recovery. While some market analysts have recently recommended UK housebuilding stocks as due for recovery, the news from the industry remains somewhat mixed.</p>

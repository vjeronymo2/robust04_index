			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Announcer-read report over video] </F>   [Text] Rauf Denktas, president of the Turkish Republic of  Northern Cyprus, has proposed to Greek Cypriot leader Glavkos  Kliridhis the signing of a mutual nonaggression pact, adding  that the island can be demilitarized within an atmosphere of  trust to be created by such a pact.    Denktas headed today's Council of Ministers meeting in which  the recent developments on the Cyprus issue and various domestic  issues were assessed. In a statement [issued] prior to the  cabinet meeting, Denktas said that the Cyprus question can be  solved only by Turkish and Greek Cypriots and called on the  Greek Cypriot side to abandon the arms race. He said: Let us  sign a nonaggression pact. Let us move toward disarmament  within an atmosphere of trust to be created by such a pact, on  condition that we preserve the guarantee agreement. Let us  create a new atmosphere. Recalling that the Cyprus Republic was  a partnership republic established by the Turkish and Greek  Cypriots, Denktas said:    [Begin Denktas recording] For the past 30 years, we have  been unable to form a government in Cyprus that represents the  entire community on the island just because one of the sides  claims to be the Cyprus Government, and because the Security  Council has accepted this claim to suit the interests of certain  Council member countries. This is the problem. The problem is  that, for the past 30 years, the Greek Cypriot side, through the  use of arms, has been occupying the position that is said to  represent Cyprus. The problem is that the Greek Cypriot side  believes it can continue this occupation and is obstinate about  it. As long as this obstinacy continues, and as long as the two  communities on the island do not find the opportunity to get  together to discuss and solve their problems, this problem  cannot be solved. We have seen that for the past 30 years, the  Security Council and the United Nations have been unable to  solve this problem. The sole reason for this failure is  recognition of the Greek Cypriot Administration as the  legitimate Cyprus Government. There is no other reason  whatsoever. [end recording]    Denktas stated that the current negotiating process is a  waste of time and called on the sides involved in the Cyprus  conflict to make a new assessment and reach an agreement.</p>

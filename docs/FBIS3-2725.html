			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 11 (XINHUA) -- Chen Jinhua, minister  in charge of the State Planning Commission, said here today that  China's 1993 plan for national economic and social development  was carried out satisfactorily.    "Various reforms designed for the establishment of a  socialist market economy were proceeding in a planned way and  have achieved substantial progress," Chen said.    The past year has seen the nation opening wider to the rest  of the world and the national economy developing in a sustained,  rapid and sound way with all-round social progress achieved, he  said.    In a report he delivered at the ongoing session of the  National People's Congress (NPC), or parliament, Chen reviewed  China's implementation of last year's economic plan and set  forth this year's growth targets.    The minister said the country's national economy developed  at  a rapid pace in 1993.    The country's gross domestic product (GDP) last year reached  3,138 billion yuan, up 13.4 percent over the previous year and  eight percent higher than the planned growth rate.    The year's GDP growth rate breaks down into four percent for  the primary industry, 20.4 percent for the secondary industry,  and 9.3 percent for the tertiary industry.    The rural economy saw overall growth last year, with the  output of grain and oil bearing crops hitting an all-time high.    Last year, grain output reached 456.4 million tons, 13.8  million tons more than in 1992 and 103.1 percent of the planned  figure; and the output of oil bearing crops amounted to 17.61  million tons, 1.2 million tons more than in 1992 and 106.7  percent of the planned figure.    Township and village enterprises reported continued vigorous  growth, and their development accelerated in the central and  western regions of the country, he said.    The nation's industry produced a total added value of 1,414  billion yuan, up 21.1 percent over the previous year. This  growth rate breaks down into 22.2 percent for heavy industry and  19.9 percent for light industry.    The output of major products continued to grow last year.  During the year China produced 1.141 billion tons of coal, 144  million tons of crude oil, 820 billion kwh of electricity, and  88.68 million tons of steel.    In 1993 total investment in fixed assets nationwide was  1182.9 billion yuan, 147.9 percent of the planned figure and up  50.6 percent over the previous year. Allowing for price rises,  the growth rate was 22 percent, he said.    There were big increases in investment for transport and  telecommunications sectors, he said.    Economic, trade and technological exchanges with foreign  countries continued to expand last year, he said.    The country's imports and exports reached 195.8 billion U.S.  dollars in value, up 18.2 percent over 1992. Exports were worth  91.8 billion U.S. dollars, up eight percent, and imports 104  billion U.S. dollars, up 29 percent.    Use of foreign funds increased substantially last year, Chen  said. The amount of foreign capital actually used during the  year reached 36.77 billion U.S. dollars, up 91.5 percent over  the previous year. Of this amount, 25.76 billion U.S. dollars  was in the form of direct investment from foreign businesses,  1.3 times the previous year's. Foreign loans actually used  amounted to 10.8 billion U.S. dollars, up 36.5 percent.    "The pattern of investment by foreign businesses improved,  with increased investment in long- and medium-term projects," he  said.    "Investment from big overseas companies and financial groups  increased. And the focus of investment is gradually shifting  towards infrastructure and basic industries, and more  investments are flowing to central and western China," Chen said.    In 1993 the total value of retail sales amounted to 1,223.7  billion yuan, up 26.1 percent over the previous year, or 11.6  percent after allowing for price rises.    Supplies of goods were "ample with a wide variety  available."  supplies of more than 90 percent of goods "match or exceed  demand," he said.    He described the lives of the people as continually  improving. During the year, per-capita income of urban residents  averaged 2,337 yuan, up 10.2 percent over the previous year  after taking inflation into account. Rural residents received a  per-capita income of 921 yuan, up 3.2 percent over 1992 with  inflation taken into account.</p>

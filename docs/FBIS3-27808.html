Umyong  in Seoul. Because of war exercise commotions, residents in  Socho-ku and Kwanak-ku in Seoul, and in Kwachon City, were  terror-stricken all day.    On 21 January, troops from the puppet Capital Defense  Command  also staged a war exercise by blindly firing rifles in areas  around Socho-ku, Seoul, thus arousing a protest from the  residents.    The war exercise commotions staged every day by the South  Korean puppet clique, which is advertising itself as a civilian  government, outdistances the war frenzy of successive military  fascist dictators. Such commotions are part of desperate  maneuvers designed to divert the attention of the people, who  are filled with complaints against the incumbent regime.    The South Korean people will never tolerate the maneuvers of  the civilian warmongers who are attempting to evade the crisis  in their rule by war exercise commotions.</p>

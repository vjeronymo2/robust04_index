			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Report: "Statistical Communique by Jiangsu Satistical </F> Bureau on Jiangsu's National Economic and Social Developments in  1993"]    [Text] In 1993, the people of Jiangsu Province, under the  correct leadership of the Jiangsu party committee and  government, conscientiously acted in the spirit of Deng  Xiaoping's important speeches on his inspection of southern  China and of the 14th CPC Congress, by freeing up our thinking,  seizing opportunities, and pushing forward resolutely with  reform and opening. We tightened and improved our  macroeconomic regulation and control, explored boldly, and  worked genuinely and solidly, continuing to maintain our rapid  national economic growth momentum, and achieving new successes  in all causes. Our preliminary estimates for Jiangsu in 1993 are  that our GDP reached 255 billion yuan, up 18.5 percent from  1992, including value added in tertiary industries of 62.3  billion yuan, up 20.3 percent, to make up 24.4 percent of our  GDP. We doubled our GNP for the second time seven years ahead  of schedule, laying a solid foundation for tripling Jiangsu's  GNP by the end of the century. But certain noteworthy problems  and conflicts still exist in our economic development, with  market prices up considerably, our economic structure still not  rational enough, our rural foundation remaining relatively weak,  and some state enterprises experiencing more production and  operating problems.  <H5>  I. Agriculture </H5>   In 1993, governments at all levels throughout Jiangsu  vigorously implemented all Party Central Committee and State  Council policy measures on strengthening agriculture and  protecting peasant production initiative by paying attention to  more investment in agriculture, which brought quite evident  results. We conquered severe natural disasters in agricultural  production throughout Jiangsu to reap better harvests. Our  value added in agriculture for 1993 was 42.184 billion yuan, up  4.2 percent from 1992, to make up 16.6 percent of our GDP. This  included value added in farming of 27.927 billion yuan, down 2.9  percent from 1992, in forestry of 809 million yuan, up 13.3  percent from 1992, in livestock raising of 7.64 billion yuan, up  1.9 percent from 1992, and in fishery of 5.809 billion yuan, up  29.7 percent from 1992.    Our agricultural output grew steadily, with considerable  growth in specialty cultivation and breeding. As to staple farm  products, we basically maintained our grain and edible oil  output at about the level of our 1992 bumper harvests, with  cotton output down nearly 20 percent due to less cultivated area  and considerable disaster damage, but output of cash crops, such  as sugar, hemp, fruit, and vegetables, all up to varying degrees  from 1992.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Staple Farm-Product Output                                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Product                  |1993                     |Percent Growth from 1992 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Grain                    |32.797 Million Tons      |-1.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Including:               |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cereal Grain             |30.8011 Million Tons     |-2.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Soybeans                 |559,200 Tons             |45.1                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Potatoes (Fresh)         |5.048 Million Tons       |9.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cotton                   |429,000 Tons             |-18.7                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Edible Oils              |1.2571 Million Tons      |-1.3                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Including: Rapeseed      |870,400 Tons             |-9.2                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Sugar                    |331,700 Tons             |33.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tobacco                  |4,200 Tons               |-60.0                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Hemp                     |16,700 Tons              |25.6                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Silkworm Cocoons         |172,300 Tons             |18.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tea                      |15,100 Tons              |7.1                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Fruit                    |712,600 Tons             |25.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      We continued to optimize our cultivation structure.  Impacted by market demand and the law of value, our crop  structure throughout Jiangsu developed in the direction of high  quality and efficiency. Our soybeans, potatoes, and food grains  other than wheat and rice (including corn) area reached 22.0434  million mu, up 1.5345 million mu from 1992.    We achieved new successes in forestry production and  development and in greening work. In 1993, Jiangsu's  afforested area reached 379,900 mu, up 81,800 mu, or 27.4  percent, from 1992.    Our livestock industry output continued to grow.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Staple Livestock-Product Output and Livestock-Onhand Headcount               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Product                  |1993                     |Percent Growth from 1992 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pork, Beef, and Mutton   |1.7923 Million Tons      |4.0                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Including: Beef and Mutt-|135,500 Tons             |17.9                     |  |on                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Milk                     |112,100 Tons             |-2.9                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Meat-Hog Out-of-Pen Count|23.5464 Million Head     |4.8                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year-End Hog Count       |19.4694 Million Head     |-1.1                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year-End Sheep Count     |9.7855 Million           |12.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year-End Large-Livestock |1.004 Million Head       |3.8                      |  |Count                    |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Eggs                     |1.3238 Million Tons      |18.5                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      We set a new fishery-production record; our aquatic product  output for the year was 1.5726 million tons, up 16.8 percent  from 1992. This included freshwater product output of 1.1052  million tons, up 19.6 percent, and saltwater product output of  467,400 tons, up 10.5 percent.    We continued to adjust our agricultural structure. Our ratio  of value added in forestry, livestock raising, fishery, and  commodities produced by mixed peasant-household industrial  operations throughout Jiangsu to our value added in agriculture  reached 39.5 percent, up again from 1992's 36.6 percent.    We continued to improve our agricultural-production  conditions. By the end of 1993, our overall farm-machinery  power had reached 20.8175 million KW, up 3.3 percent from the  end of 1992; we had 21,300 large and midsize tractors, up 2.9  percent; 735,200 small and hand tractors, up 1.5 percent; 18,100  trucks, up 11.7 percent; our agricultural irrigation and  drainage machinery power had reached 5.0135 million KW, up 1.4  percent; our 1993 chemical-fertilizer usage (converted pure) had  reached 2.4971 million tons, up 1.2 percent; our rural power  usage had reached 16.92 billion KWh, up 15.5 percent. And we  completed our annual plans for water-conservancy projects, such  as Tai Hu and Huai He.    We continued to develop our rural economy. In 1993,  township enterprises throughout Jiangsu emphasized size, level,  and quality, raising economic efficiency, and continuing to grow  quickly while adjusting, with gross output value and all taxes  and profits both up more than 50 percent from 1992. Jiangsu's  nonfarm industrial economy in sectors, such as rural industry,  construction, transportation, wholesale and retail trade, and  food and drink, grew 65.5 percent from 1992, with its ratio of  our rural economy up from 1992's 80.8 percent to 84.6 percent.  <H5>  II. Industry and Building Construction </H5>   In 1993, all of Jiangsu pushed ahead actively with reform,  by  continuing to intensify our implementation of the "Regulations  on Converting the Operating Forces of State-Owned Industrial  Enterprises," further invigorating large- and medium-sized state  enterprises, speeding up our pace of operating-force conversion  and organizational-structure adjustment, and working to sustain  our fast growth of industrial output based on an optimized  structure and improved efficiency. Our 1993 value added in  industry was 136.535 billion yuan, up 23.1 percent from 1992, to  make up 53.5 percent of our GDP.    Our heavy industry grew faster than our light industry.  Jiangsu's 1993 value added in light industry reached 62.615  billion yuan, up 20.9 percent from 1992; in heavy industry it  reached 73.92 billion yuan, up 25 percent. Our outputs of key  manufactured goods all grew to varying degrees.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Key Manufactured-Goods Output

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------      We clearly improved our industrial economic efficiency. In  1993, our composite index of economic efficiency for  independently accounted industrial enterprises at the township  level and above throughout Jiangsu was up from 1992's 89.30 to  99.34. This included a rate of profit and tax on capital fund  of 10.58 percent; a working-capital turnover frequency up from  1992's 2.04 to 2.21; an overall labor productivity rate  (calculated at value added) up 43 percent from 1992. Our gross  profits and taxes from industrial enterprises at the township  level and above reached 32.55 billion yuan, up 31 percent from  1992. We better dovetailed production with sales, with our  production-sales rate for industry above the township level up  from 1992's 93.67 percent to 95.3 percent. But while we  further raised our power use efficiency, with our overall power  usage per 10,000 yuan output value for urban industrial  enterprises down 14.71 percent, too many funds remained tied up  in finished products, leaving the losses of some enterprises  still needing improvement.    Production in our building construction industry grew  quickly. In 1993, building trades throughout Jiangsu steadily  intensified reform, with building construction enterprises  maintaining rapid production growth. Our 1993 value added in the  construction industry reached 13.989 billion yuan, up 23.6  percent from 1992, to make up 5.5 percent of our GDP. Our  state-owned construction enterprises raised their overall  labor productivity rate 30.7 percent from 1992; our housing  construction completed area reached 3.912 million sq m, up 6.1  percent. We also improved our building-product quality  somewhat.  <H5>  III. Fixed Assets Investment </H5>   In 1993, in our fixed assets investment throughout Jiangsu,  we paid attention to improving our structure, emphasizing and  ensuring priorities, and increasing our stamina for sustained  economic growth. Our fixed assets investment throughout Jiangsu  was 107.488 billion yuan, up 51 percent from 1992, including a  state-unit investment of 45.869 billion yuan, up 59.3 percent,  an urban collective-unit investment of 10.028 billion yuan, up  81.6 percent, a rural collective investment of 33.2 billion  yuan, up 50.3 percent, and an urban and rural individual  investment of 18.391 billion yuan, up 24.7 percent. In 1993, we  had 7,591 projects inprocess by state units in capital  construction and upgrading, down 841 from 1992.    As to our state-unit investment, our capital-construction  investment was 20.949 billion yuan, up 34.4 percent from 1992,  our upgrading investment was 14.139 billion yuan, up 50.8  percent, and our commercial-housing-construction investment was  9.909 billion yuan, up 230 percent. Our central-project  investment was 8.418 billion yuan, up 20.1 percent from 1992,  and our local-project investment was 37.452 billion yuan, up  71.9 percent.    As to our upgrading investment, in adding product varieties,  raising product quality, conserving energy, and controlling the  three wastes, we invested 4.209 billion yuan, up 31.1 percent  from 1992.    We further optimized our investment structure. As to  state-unit investment, our tertiary-industry investment was  26.223 billion yuan, up nearly 100 percent, with its proportion  up from 1992's 46.1 percent to 57.1 percent, including  investment in communications, transportation, and post and  telecommunications of 6.773 billion yuan, up 59.3 percent; and  in culture, education, public health, and broadcasting of 1.629  billion yuan, up 35.1 percent. Our power-industry investment was  4.516 billion yuan, up 8.3 percent. Our raw-materials-industry  investment was 4.018 billion yuan, up 23 percent, and our  agricultural investment was 649 million yuan, up 47.4 percent  from 1992.    We made great progress in building priority-infrastructure  and basic-industry projects. Work is fully underway on the  Shanghai-Nanjing expressway, the Nanjing-Lianyungang and  Nanjing-Nantong primary highway construction, and along the  Grand Canal in southern Jiangsu, with the early-stage  construction in smooth progress on priority projects, such as  the new Nanjing airport and the highway bridge over the Chang  Jiang at Jiangyin, and the upgrading and expansion of the  Yancheng-Nantong section of National Highway $204, the  construction of the Nantong and the Gaoliangjian (ship) locks,  and the first and second stages of the upgrading of the southern  Jiangsu highway network all completed on schedule. Our  investment in 84 inprocess large and midsize capital  construction and above-quota upgrading projects throughout  Jiangsu was 6.6 billion yuan, just about our annual plan. We  completed and put into operation in 1993 10 large- and  medium-sized capital-construction projects, as well as four  above-quota upgrading ones.    The priority projects or units that we wholly or partially  completed and put into operation were mainly ones, such as the  Wuxi Ligang Power Corporation, the Wuxi Enzyme Preparation  Plant, the Changzhou Qishuyan Power Plant, the Zhangjiagang  Harbor Construction, the Changshu Power Plant, the Nantong  Airport Construction Project, the Nantong Port Authority Harbor  Construction, the Huaneng Huaiyin Power Plant, the Zhenjiang  Port Construction, the Nanjing Gu'nandu Hotel, the second stage  of the Suzhou Gas Project, the Suzhou Sulun Plant, and the  Nantong Composite Materials Plant.    Our newly added key production capacity was generators with  an installed capacity of 1.7 million KW and ports with an annual  handling capacity of 9.64 million tons. Meanwhile, we built  new service facilities, such as civil aviation facilities and  tourist hotels, giving us complete sets of facilities to develop  an externally oriented economy, and increasing our service  capability.  <H5>  IV. Transportation, and Post and Telecommunications </H5>   In 1993, Jiangsu maintained overall production growth in  communications, transportation, and post and telecommunications,  completing a value added in 1993 of 11.98 billion yuan, up 17.7  percent from 1992, to make up 4.7 percent of our GDP. But  conflicts remained between our transportation and post and  telecommunications and our overall economic and social  development needs.    Our communications and transportation production grew  steadily. We completed a value added in 1993 of 10.223 billion  yuan, up 12.2 percent from 1992, to make up 4 percent of our  GDP. Both our cargo and passenger turnover for 1993 through  all means of transportation were up somewhat from 1992.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |All Transport Volume                                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Category                 |1993                     |Percent Growth from 1992 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Cargo Turnover           |130.547 Billion Ton Km   |23.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Railway                  |34.649 Billion Ton Km    |3.8                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Highway                  |23.507 Billion Ton Km    |30.7                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Water Transport          |68.963 Billion Ton Km    |37.3                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Pipeline                 |3.428 Billion Ton Km     |-9.0                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Passenger Turnover       |59.785 Billion Passenger-|16.0                     |  |                         |Km                       |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Rail                     |16.136 Billion P-Km      |9.4                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Road                     |42.93 Billion P-Km       |18.8                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Water                    |719 Million P-Km         |14.4                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Port Cargo Handling Capa-|195.48 Million Tons      |2.2                      |  |city                     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------      We speeded up our post and telecommunications industry  growth. Our value added for 1993 was 1.757 billion yuan, up  63.9 percent from 1992, with a post and telecommunications gross  business turnover of 3.443 billion yuan, up 68.8 percent, and a  business income of 2.315 billion yuan, up 54.58 percent. We  added in 1993 a new computerized-telephone installed-capacity of  843,000 urban phones and 445,100 rural phones, ranking us second  to Guangdong in having an urban and rural telephone exchange  capacity of over 2 million phones. All of our county seats have  computerized phones. We completed ahead of schedule the  Beijing-Jinan-Nanjing fiberoptic cable transmission artery and  the Shanghai-Nanjing electric cable capacity-expansion projects.  Our services, such as telephone fax and express transmission,  also grew very quickly, with wireless search-and-call customers  reaching 289,800, more than triple that of 1992, with mobile  communications spreading throughout Jiangsu.  <H5>  V. Domestic Commerce and Market Prices </H5>   In 1993, we brought the role of market forces into full play  at all levels throughout Jiangsu, stimulating circulation  sharply, giving us abundant market goods supplies and brisk  buying and selling, and maintaining a basic overall stable  consumer goods market order. Our 1993 retail commodity sales  were 107.427 billion yuan, up 33.9 percent from 1992, (for real  growth of 16 percent corrected for inflation). This included  retail sales of consumer goods to residents at 85.078 billion  yuan, up 36.1 percent, retail sales of consumer goods to social  groups at 11.699 billion yuan, up 47.4 percent, and retail sales  of agricultural capital goods at 10.65 billion yuan, up 8.6  percent.    In our retail consumer-goods sales, urban retail sales were  54.019 billion yuan, up 48.2 percent from 1992, with retail  sales at the county level and below at 42.758 billion yuan, up  25.7 percent.    All retail sales of consumer goods for industries in all  economic categories grew. This included retail sales for the  state-owned economy of 33.251 billion yuan, up 28.7 percent, for  the collective economy of 34.172 billion yuan, up 31.2 percent,  and for the individual economy of 15.804 billion yuan, up 41.5  percent.    Of all key consumer goods, retail commercial sales were up  7.3 percent for edible vegetable oils, 23.4 percent for sugar,  2.1 percent for woolen goods, 26 percent for silk and satin,  14.5 percent for all clothing, 64.3 percent for color TVs, 61.3  percent for VCRs, 44.7 percent for washing machines, and 55  percent for household refrigerators, with varying degrees of  growth also for all other durable consumer goods, such as home  air conditioners. Buying and selling were brisk for capital  goods markets. In 1993, commodity circulation enterprises  throughout Jiangsu bought capital goods worth 108.15 billion  yuan, up 47.9 percent from 1992, with sales of 109.18 billion  yuan, up 43.7 percent. This included sales of 43.72 million  tons of coal, 10.3 million tons of rolled steel, 3.48 million  tons of cement, and 75,000 motor vehicles.    In 1993, we took larger price-reform steps, smoothly  deregulating grain and edible oil buying and selling prices,  raising cotton-purchasing prices, and deregulating and adjusting  the prices of a group of basic products, such as coal, power,  and oil, to increase their market-regulation ratio. Retail  prices rose 15.4 percent in 1993, quite a lot, including retail  price rises of 16.6 percent in the cities and 14 percent in the  countryside.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |All Price Indexes (Compared to 1992)                                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1.

External Economy </H5>   In 1993, Jiangsu further opened up new development space,  continuing to open up further to the outside world, maintaining  the vigorous growth momentum of our externally-oriented economy,  and actively advancing it from south to north.    Our foreign trade grew steadily. Our 1993 foreign trade  turnover reached $8.7 billion, up 39.2 percent from 1992,  including exports of $5.959 billion, up 27.6 percent, and  imports of $2.741 billion, up 73.4 percent. We further  optimized our export structure, with exports of finished  manufactured goods up somewhat. FIE exports were $2.269  billion, up 73.6 percent from 1992, with their percentage of  Jiangsu exports up to 38.1 percent.    We further increased our use of foreign investment. In 1993,  10,289 new agreements on the use of foreign investment were  signed throughout Jiangsu, for an agreed foreign investment of  $10.11 billion, up respectively 24.3 percent and 29.7 percent  from 1992. We approved 10,032 new FIEs in 1993, for a  contracted foreign investment of $10.056 billion, up  respectively 22.4 percent and 30.8 percent from 1992. Jiangsu  actually used $3.287 billion in foreign investment in 1993, up  90.9 percent from 1992, including an actual foreign investment  of $3.002 billion, up 114 percent. Foreign investment in  Jiangsu increased in size, at a higher level, with more large  projects, and beginning to involve fields, such as energy,  communications, basic industry, high technology, and tertiary  industries.    Our foreign economic and technical exchanges and cooperation  expanded rapidly. In 1993, Jiangsu signed 418 new foreign  contracting and service cooperation projects, 155 more than in  1992, for a contracted amount of $332 million, up 52.9 percent,  and our actual business volume was $259 million, up 76.5  percent. We approved 210 new overseas nontrade enterprises,  with 368 having been approved by the end of 1993.    Our international tourism was increasingly prosperous. In  1993, Jiangsu received 792,200 visits by overseas travellers for  tourism, sightseeing, interviews, and other activities,  including 455,200 visits by foreigners, up 22 percent from 1992.  Our tourism foreign exchange earnings were 741 million yuan (in  foreign-exchange certificates [FECs]), up 21.5 percent from 1992.  <H5>  VII. Finance, Banking, and Insurance </H5>   In 1993, Jiangsu's revenues were better. Our 1993 revenue  was 22.13 billion yuan, up 45.3 percent from 1992, for a record  increase. This included industrial and commercial tax revenue  of 21.273 billion yuan, up 54.4 percent from 1992, with our tax  revenue involving foreigners up 125.8 percent. Our spending was  16.258 billion yuan, up 29.2 percent.    Our banking situation stabilized gradually. In 1993,  financial institutions throughout Jiangsu vigorously organized  all deposits, so that by year's end, we had a deposit balance of  179.733 billion yuan, up 36.934 billion yuan from the beginning  of the year, and a loan balance of 177.78 billion yuan, up  28.916 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. We  continued to maintain our deposit increase higher than our loan  increase, with net currency put into circulation in 1993 at  11.601 billion yuan, up 2.285 billion yuan from 1992.    Our insurance business grew rapidly. In 1993, the People's  Insurance Company system throughout Jiangsu insured 525.76  billion yuan in domestic assets, up 39.1 percent from 1992.  Jiangsu had 64,000 enterprises covered by enterprise property  insurance, 10.25 million residents covered by family property  insurance, and 18.497 million people covered by personal  insurance. Our insurance companies handled 345,000 domestic  property insurance settlements, paying out compensation of 720  million yuan, and paying out 320 million yuan in personal  insurance compensation to 103,000 people.  <H5>  VIII. Science, Education, Culture, Public Health, and Sports </H5>   We achieved new S&amp;T successes. In 1993, we won 368  provincial-level S&amp;T-progress awards, including three #1  awards,  28 #2 awards, 126 #3 awards, and 211 #4 awards. At the national  level, we won one invention-award, three S&amp;T-progress awards,  and six Spark awards.    We authorized more patents. In 1993, Jiangsu had 4,170  patent applications, with 3,757 being authorized, up 80.1  percent from 1992.    We expanded our S&amp;T ranks. Local state enterprises and  institutions throughout Jiangsu had 1.2133 million specialized  technicians of all types, up 5.1 percent from 1992.    We continued to increase our average education. In 1993,  Jiangsu enrolled 3,000 graduate students, up 600 from 1992.  Our general institutions of higher learning enrolled 68,500  undergraduates, with 180,200 students in school, up 27,500 from  1992. Our intermediate specialized technical schools of all  types had 191,800 students in attendance, up 42,400 from 1992.  Our vocational senior high schools had 220,800 students, or  52.1 percent of Jiangsu's general senior high school students.  We had 2.9398 million general high school students, and 5.9494  million grade school students, with an entrance rate for  grade-school-age children of 99.5 percent. In 1993, another 28  counties (cities, districts) and 420 townships throughout  Jiangsu fully implemented 9-year compulsory education. By the  end of 1993, 59 counties (cities, districts) and 1,227 townships  throughout Jiangsu were fully practicing nine-year compulsory  education, for a population coverage rate of 56.8 percent, up 20  points from 1992. Meanwhile, we also made some developments in  preschool education and in special-ed for low-intelligence and  disabled children.    We continued to reinforce our adult education. In 1993, we  enrolled 38,900 adults as college undergraduates, with 84,800 in  college, up 18,000 from 1992, and had 135,200 adults in  intermediate vocational schools, up 31,800 from 1992, and  762,100 adults in intermediate and primary schools. We  eliminated illiteracy in 1993 for 565,000 youths and adults in  the prime of life (ages 30-50).    We continued to expand our cultural enterprise. By the end  of 1993, Jiangsu had 136 arts performance troupes, 110 cultural  centers, 93 public libraries, 66 museums, 20 radio stations, one  short-wave broadcast and relay station, and 38 TV stations. We  had 147 TV broadcast and relay stations, and 4,358  film-projection units. In 1993, we printed 1.177 billion  newspapers, published 59.83 million magazines of all types, and  published 3,722 books.    We further developed our public health enterprise. By the  end of 1993, Jiangsu had 12,074 public health organs of all  types, 207 less than in 1992, with 173,300 sickbeds, including  152,900 hospital beds, up 2,200 from 1992. We had 234,400  specialized health technicians, up 2.4 percent from 1992,  including 106,300 doctors, up 1.9 percent, and 59,900 nurses and  nursing teachers, up 4 percent. Jiangsu had 261 sanitation and  antiepidemic stations and professional prevention and treatment  organs, with 8,749 personnel, up 5.4 percent from 1992.    We achieved new sports successes. In the Seventh National  Games, Jiangsu athletes won 20 gold medals, 16 silvers, and 17  bronzes, with seven breaking 15 Asian records 26 times, nine  breaking 17 national records 28 times, and the Jiangsu team  ranking sixth in the nation. In major international  competitions, seven Jiangsu athletes won nine world  championships, with five setting six Asian records and breaking  three world records 18 times. It is estimated that 95.02  percent of our school-age students in schools of all types at  all levels throughout Jiangsu reached international  physical-education training standards.  <H5>  IX. Population and Living Standards </H5>   We continued to control our population-growth rate. Based on  a sampling of 1993 population changes, Jiangsu's birthrate was  down from 1992's 1.571 percent to 1.397 percent, with our  deathrate down from 0.676 percent to 0.661 percent, and our  natural growth rate down from 0.895 percent to 0.736 percent.  Projecting from this, by the end of 1993, Jiangsu's permanent  population was 69.6727 million, up 560,700 from the end of 1992.    Our urban and rural incomes continued to grow. Based on a  sampling for 1993, our urban cost-of-living income averaged  2,526 yuan, up 30.4 percent from 1992 or, corrected for  inflation, up a real 10.2 percent. Our rural net income  averaged 1,267 yuan, up 19.4 percent or, corrected for  inflation, up a real 3 percent.    We steadily intensified our labor reforms. In 1993, we had  206,400 new urban jobs throughout Jiangsu, with a year-end urban  unemployment rate of 2 percent. Our contract-system employees  reached 2.6 million, or 28.4 percent of all urban employees.  Jiangsu had 5.9308 million employees and 1.2406 million  retirees covered by overall old-age insurance. By year's end,  our urban workers numbered 9.113 million, up 72,100 from the end  of 1992, with urban private-enterprise and self-employed workers  numbering 359,600, up more than 120,000.    Our employee wages also increased. In 1993, Jiangsu's  payroll was 32.15 billion yuan, up 27.8 percent from 1992, with  employee wages averaging 3,544 yuan, up 26.6 percent or,  corrected for inflation, up a real 6.6 percent.    Our urban and rural savings continued to grow. In 1993, our  residents' savings deposit balance reached 96.422 billion yuan,  up 19.175 billion yuan from the end of 1992, or 25.7 percent.  Purchases of all types of securities also increased clearly.    We further improved our urban and rural housing conditions.  By the end of 1993, our housing space for urban residents  (including living and auxiliary space) averaged 14.63 sq m, up  0.27 sq m from the end of 1992, and our peasant housing space  averaged 24.53 sq m, up 0.96 sq m from the end of 1992.    We further intensified our environmental protection cause.  In 1993, Jiangsu had 4,530 employees in our environmental  protection system, 101 environmental monitoring stations of all  types, 16 national and provincial nature-protection zones, three  national-forest parks, and 379 environmental-pollution control  projects completed in 1993 with an investment of 125 million  yuan. By the end of 1993, we had established 867.27 sq km of  smoke and dust control zones, and 264.91 sq km with  environmental noise standards.  Notes:    1. This communique's GDPs and all industrial value-added  indexes were calculated at prevailing prices, with growth rates  calculated at comparable prices.    2. GDPs and all industrial value-addeds include mainly  worker  remuneration, profits, taxes, and depreciation, not various  intermediate consumption values, such as energy, raw materials,  or the sum of material-product and service value that show the  year's production that can be used for final consumption. The  difference between GDP and GNP is mainly that the former does  not include overseas net factor income, while the latter does.    3. The national S&amp;T awards won by Jiangsu do not include  those won by enterprises and institutions of state ministries  and commissions in Jiangsu.</p>

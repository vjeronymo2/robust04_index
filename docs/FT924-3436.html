			<p>921208 FT  08 DEC 92 / Observer: Basket cases Back in 1981 the FT floated the idea of designating the Mars Bar as an alternative currency. Observer has heard no whisperings in Treasury corridors about resurrecting the idea, but now the ubiquitous market research organisation Mintel has come up with a variation on the theme, by looking at the prices of 22 everyday consumer products across 13 countries. Bargain-hunters need to travel to Mexico where the basket of goods - including rice, coffee, tea, shampoo, detergents and cigarettes - can be had for just over Pounds 20. India is next cheapest, at Pounds 24.01. But steer clear of Iceland, most expensive of the lot, where the basket costs Pounds 76.81. Britain proved fifth most pricey (after Belgium, France and Italy) at Pounds 42. However, though India seems a relative bargain, those who wish to get stuck into a Mars Bar should do so in the UK; it costs twice as much in New Delhi as in London.</p>

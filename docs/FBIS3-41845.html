			<p>Language: <F P=105>Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Chong Pong-kil: ``The Criminal Act of Even </F> Inflicting the Disaster of Chemical Weapons'']    [Text] According to the 19 December issue of the Nigerian  paper SUNDAY CHAMPION, the United States and South Korean  puppets are accelerating the chemical war preparations. The  paper exposed that the United States used germ and chemical  weapons in the Korean and Vietnam wars, and even brought in a  large amount of chemical weapons to South Korea after the Korean  war, and that the South Korean puppets are preparing for a  chemical war by reserving a large amount of chemical weapons  under the protection of the United States.    The paper pointed out that recently the South Korean puppets  decided to produce chemical weapons in a meeting of so-called  related authorities and to submit it to the National Assembly.  The paper also exposed that the South Korean puppets presently  possess some 12 chemical weapons plants and have a deposit of  over 25,000 chemical weapons.    This means that the South Korean puppets have secretly  accelerated the preparations for chemical war and is now trying  to push for such preparations legally and openly. It is an  intolerable criminal act to drive fellow country men into the  disaster of chemical weapons in addition to nuclear weapons.    As everyone knows, the world's peace-loving people today  strongly demand the complete abolition of chemical weapons,  together with nuclear weapons, which are mass lethal weapons.  Chemical weapons which kill and injure people with toxic  chemicals have been branded as the cruelest massacre weapon and  their use and development are banned by international agreement.    Nevertheless, the South Korean puppets have produced and  stored chemical weapons for a long time. There are some 40  underground nuclear and chemical weapons storage facilities in  the areas near Mt. Kyeryong in South Chungchong Province and  Suwon in Kyonggi Province. Even numerous ion chemical weapons,  which are known as the most vicious and cruelest of mass lethal  weapons, are stored there.    Prattling about the possession of independent chemical  warfare capabilities, the former South Korean dictators built  more than 10 toxic gas plants in South Korea and produced  numerous chemical weapons.    The rascals brought in from the United States numerous  military aircraft capable of dropping chemical bombs, and 155mm  and 203mm guns which are capable of using them. The puppet army  units have been operating chemical, biological, and radiological  warfare schools for a long time to train chemical warfare  specialists.    The South Korean puppets also staged systematic chemical war  exercises in collaboration with foreign forces. The fact that  new chemical warfare equipment was deployed in the Team Spirit  joint military exercise and that units specialized in chemical  warfare training participated is one of the examples.    Reporting on the true aspects of chemical war exercise  staged  during the Team Spirit joint military exercise, a South Korean  broadcast revealed that in a chemical war exercise, a stimulated  North area was wiped out by attacks by aircraft and by dropping  smoke bombs, chemical bombs, germ bombs, and even drumming bombs  so that no creature could survive.    These facts prove that the South Korean puppets have  accelerated chemical war preparations for a long time. What  cannot be overlooked is that the South Korean puppets are  bragging about someone's development of biological weapons while  scheming a chemical war against fellow countrymen. This is a  scheme designed to legalize the chemical war maneuvers, which  the rascals pushed for in such a manner as to lay blame on us,  and to openly accelerate such maneuvers.    By spreading groundless rumors about us, the Kim Yong-sam  puppet clique openly announced that it decided to possess  chemical weapons. This clearly shows how intentionally it is  maneuvering to possess chemical weapons legally, not in a  concealed manner, and to openly accelerate chemical war  preparations.    The puppet clique's past criminal acts were so enormous that  it is impossible to conceal its chemical war maneuvers in such a  manner as to reverse black and white. Kim Yong-sam, the puppet  traitor who bragged that any foreign force could not be better  than fellow countrymen in the beginning of his regime, is openly  talking gibberish about possession of chemical weapons while  stressing that one should foster strength.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which put out the signboard  of civilian government, is attempting to inflict disaster of  chemical weapons in addition to nuclear calamities on fellow  countrymen together with outside forces. Thus, its filthy shape  as ugly national traitor, murderer, and warmonger, has been  exposed once again.    The Kim Yong-sam puppet clique, which turned down fellow  countrymen's peace proposal and is dreaming of nuclear and  chemical war, cannot avoid stern punishment by the nation. The  Kim Yong-sam clique should look straight at the rushing flow of  all fellow countrymen toward peace and reunification and should  act with discretion. It should stop reckless war maneuvers and  step down from power without delay.</p>

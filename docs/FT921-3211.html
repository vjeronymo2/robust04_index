			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / The economic questions IF THEY were to consider only their bank accounts, many FT readers would quickly decide how to cast their ballots. Large numbers would, after all, suffer from Labour's announced fiscal proposals. But there is more to life than one's wealth. Many readers are, for example, concerned with how the outcome might affect both the economy and their businesses. Yet identifying what difference the election might make to either is not quite so simple as a quick glance at our poll of business leaders today might appear to suggest. If, for example, voters examine monetary policies, they will find they can have any they like, so long as it is the Bundesbank's. Even over the extent of government borrowing, few differences stand out. In last week's Budget, the Treasury forecast a public sector borrowing requirement of some 6 per cent of gross domestic product, before privatisation receipts, over the next two years. A Labour party wanting to borrow for investment is, therefore, unlikely to get away with a larger fiscal deficit than Conservatives committed to balancing the budget over the cycle. It is on levels of taxation that likely differences emerge. If Labour is to match the higher public expenditure it desires with 'prudent' borrowing and no more extra taxation than already announced it must have a rapid economic recovery. But, barring a large devaluation, Mr Smith would have no more control over that than hapless Mr Lamont. Fallible forecasts The Treasury's latest forecast would console the shadow chancellor, had its forecasts not proved so fallible. Average growth is put at just over 3 per cent a year between 1991-92 and 1996-97, which is no faster than the recovery from the last recession. But conditions then were more favourable. What would happen if such a recovery were not to materialise? If Labour had to choose between higher taxes and cuts in public provision, would it choose the latter? If not, would the UK's advantage of a relatively low burden of taxation by European standards disappear? Yet it is over policy towards the supply side of the economy that differences are most clear. Which of the potential governing parties is most likely to ensure effective provision of public services? And which will get right the balance between promotion and regulation of competition? That the UK needs better education and training and more investment in infrastructure, there can be little dispute. With public spending likely to be tightly constrained, however, the question is how additional resources are to be found. And which party can arrange the most effective delivery? The Conservatives may have demoralised the providers of public services, but Labour's pandering to producer groups might well throttle what limited market pressure the government has managed to introduce. French camp For those concerned with the relation between the government and the market, Brussels is the first port of call. It is via European Community decisions on trade, competition, industrial and labour market policies that a British government's influence on the domestic economy is increasingly channelled. Where the Conservatives stand is known, but what of Labour? Will it fight for a competitive and outward-looking EC, or will it join the French camp? Even more broadly, can a party that has condemned almost every major industrial change - from the downsizing of the steel industry in the early 1980s, to that of the coal industry in the early 1990s - abide by the market's verdict? Can it, for example, turn its doubts about take-over fever into anything more than a way of upholding the managerial status quo? If the known weaknesses of the Conservatives and the obvious doubts about Labour are too disturbing, the economically-concerned voter can always choose the thoroughly European and market-oriented Liberal Democrats; that is if he is prepared to vote for a third force rather than a potential winner. But mostly, voters to whom these issues are of paramount concern will want to scrutinise the rhetoric of Mr Kinnock's economics team.</p>

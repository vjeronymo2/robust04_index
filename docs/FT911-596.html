			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / International Company News: India's drug-makers mix a cocktail - A shift of emphasis to other product lines FACED with declining profits, a growing number of Indian pharmaceutical companies is considering drastic diversification, entailing switches from antibiotics to washing machines and from tranquillisers to sunglasses. The main driving force behind these changes is draconian government price controls which, according to the pharmaceuticals industry, have bitten sharply into profit margins. The controls have not only resulted in companies moving to different product ranges, but to a shift to the more lucrative export markets. As a result, there is concern over supplies of drugs to the domestic market, where demand is said to be set to rise rapidly. The moves being considered by the industry are many and various. Burroughs Wellcome (India) is planning Rs240m (Dollars 11.9m) worth of fresh capital investment over the next few years. Instead of drugs, it will concentrate on basic chemicals for the rubber and dyestuff industry. Cadila, a highly innovative Gujarat-based pharmaceutical group offering a wide range of formulations, has invested heavily in the production of mopeds, televisions, microprocessors and computers. The Tata group is gradually pulling out of the pharmaceutical industry. Rallis India has reportedly surrendered its drug licence and is concentrating instead on marketing washing machines and shoes. Another Tata company, Merind, is in the auction ring. Other companies are moving away from pharmaceuticals in a less drastic fashion. 'Agrochemicals, medical equipment, cosmetics and packaging are natural extensions,' said Mr C. Hattangdi, managing director of Nicholas Laboratories, which is in the process of merging with Gujarat Glass, a bottle manufacturer. Many companies, such as Wockhardt, and Procter &amp; Gamble India, are focusing on formulations which can be sold over-the-counter and fall outside the jurisdiction of the Drugs Prices Control Order (DPCO). Other Indian drug companies are gradually shifting production away from the domestic market towards exports. Not only do companies obtain better prices for their bulk drugs from exports, but they can also apply for export incentives and claim income tax exemptions for bringing in scarce foreign exchange. These companies report sturdy bottom lines, tempting others to adopt their strategy. Government price controls have ensured that drug prices in India are among the lowest in the world - an important consideration given that almost half India's 840m people are below the poverty line. A packet of 10 aspirins, for example, costs a little over Rs2. The pharmaceutical industry feels that such rigorous controls leave no margin for profits. According to the Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (Oppi), average profit margins as a percentage of sales have skidded from 15.47 per cent in 1970 to 4.5 per cent in 1988, though the DPCO permits a profit level of 8.13 per cent. 'If a middle-class man can pay Rs12 for a litre of milk and Rs50 for a kilo of edible oil, why does the government assume that he cannot pay slightly more for medicines?' said Mr Arvind Nair, Oppi's secretary. Moreover, prices have remained static over the past two years, though input costs such as labour, raw materials and power have escalated sharply. 'When investment in further production translates into slimmer margins at the end of the year, it doesn't make sense to expand - with the consequence that we are not keeping pace with population growth,' said Mr Jasjit Singh, director of Associated Capsules. According to industry experts, overall demand for pharmaceutical products will shortly triple from the current Rs40bn. 'The demand is astronomical. It is a pity that politicians do not realise that their blatantly perverted policies are killing the industry and are not in the public interest,' said Mr D. Bose, managing director of Burroughs Wellcome (India). Unless both industrialists and politicians hammer out a compromise, serious shortages of essential medicines are bound to emerge in the near future, and in some areas that shortage is already apparent - paracetamol production, for example, cannot keep pace with demand.</p>

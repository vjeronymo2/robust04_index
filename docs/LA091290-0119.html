			<p><P> September 12, 1990, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CRITIC AT LARGE: PIERSON'S TOUGH LOOK AT DEATH ROW;  </P> <P> TELEVISION: THE DIRECTOR OF HBO'S 'SOMEBODY HAS TO SHOOT THE PICTURE' ASKS HARD  QUESTIONS OF SOCIETY.  </P> <P> Frank Pierson, who directed HBO's tough drama about capital punishment,  "Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture," which airs again tonight on HBO, was a  magazine journalist, working in Life magazine's Beverly Hills office, when he  decided in the mid-'50s to try his hand at script-writing. It was the family  trade; his mother had been a writer at Warner Bros.  </P> <P> Pierson took his $7,000 in profit-sharing and made it last two years. He grew a  beard and sold nary a word. "On a Friday, the money was all gone and I shaved  my beard so I could go job-hunting on Monday. You couldn't wear a beard and get  a job in those days."  </P> <P> But that Friday afternoon his agent called to report first that he had sold one  of Pierson's teleplays and second that he'd found Pierson a job as a story  editor on "Have Gun Will Travel."  </P> <P> Pierson broke into directing doing episodes of "Have Gun." Later he directed  "The Looking Glass War" as his first feature, and then the Barbra Streisand  remake of "A Star Is Born" and "King of the Gypsies." As a screenwriter, he  adapted "Cool Hand Luke," won an Oscar for his script of "Dog Day Afternoon"  and recently co-authored "Presumed Innocent."  </P> <P> "Somebody Has to Shoot the Picture" was an original screenplay by Doug Magee,  who as a Newsweek reporter-photographer had published a book in 1980 called  "Slow Coming Dark" about a dozen Death Row inmates. The script had been  optioned and dropped before Robert Cooper, a senior vice president of HBO, took  it.  </P> <P> The project became viable when Roy Scheider agreed to play the burnt-out  photographer -- for Time magazine -- who agrees to photograph the execution of  a condemned man, at the condemned man's request.  </P> <P> "I've had strong feelings against capital punishment," Pierson said at lunch a  few days ago, "ever since I read Arthur Koestler's very convincing arguments on  the moral issues involved. Does society have the right at all to take a life?  And isn't the chance of an error too great for execution to be accepted by a  society that thinks of itself as moral?"  </P> <P> Magee's plot is highly melodramatic, a thickly plotted and suspenseful crime  thriller; but, within Death Row itself, the film has the feeling of a  docudrama, and the detailings -- including the mad mumblings and shoutings in  the background -- were thoroughly researched, Pierson says.  </P> <P> Florida's Starke Prison near Gainesville was used for some establishing shots.  The execution chamber itself was a set at Universal's new sound stages in  Orlando.  </P> <P> "The witnesses are very close to the electric chair, no further than the next  table," Pierson said, gesturing perhaps eight feet away. In an eerily touching  moment, the warden kisses the condemned man on the forehead and whispers to  him. The incident is based on a report from a witness at an actual execution.  </P> <P> "The idea," Pierson says, "is that the Death Row guards and the prison  officials try to make the prisoner feel like a member of a team, as if they all  have this thing to do well and they're all in it together. They're very afraid  of violence at that last minute, and they try to brainwash the prisoners into  thinking that violence would be a betrayal of the team, of their trust. But  they've also got some control devices you don't see and they can break a man's  arm very quickly if he starts to struggle."  </P> <P> The film's ending goes against conventional expectations and is the stronger  for it. An alternative ending was written and shot and will be used in a  European theatrical version, which Universal will distribute.  </P> <P> "The networks like to pick challenging subjects for their films," Pierson says.  "But in the end they often trivialize them. This one follows through on the  premise that is set up. It's a powerful experience for the audience whether you  think Ray (played by Arliss Howard) is guilty or not. You're still faced with  what it means to execute a man."  </P> <P> HBO's Cooper, who also OKd the recent production called "Seductions," short  stories by Hemingway, Dorothy Parker and Mary McCarthy, may be helping to point  the way, Pierson feels, toward a newly attractive boldness and innovation in  cable programming.  </P> <P> "You have the potential," he says, "of a nurturing, encouraging creative  environment that would make possible here what exists in London. I mean those  crossovers in which actors, writers, directors, producers can move freely and  easily between the stage and television, or the stage and television."  </P> <P> Pierson, a former president of the Writers Guild, has become so active in the  Sundance Institute in Utah that he's bought a place of his own near by. There  he and such colleagues as Larry Kasdan, Walter Bernstein and Sydney Pollack  help young writers and directors develop new projects.  </P> <P> "You read about those astronomical prices being paid for scripts that don't  sound that wonderful. But the good news is that the studios are more aware than  ever that stories are important, scripts are everything."  </P> <P> Pierson is wearing a beard again.  </P> <P> The film airs on Tuesday and on Sept. 22, 24, 27 and 30.  </P></p>

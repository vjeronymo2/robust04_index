			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CONFUSION COULD BE WINNER OF ELECTION;  </P> <P> POLITICS: EVEN POLITICAL EXPERTS ARE BEMUSED BY THE POTENTIAL FOR COMPLICATIONS  IN BALLOTING TO FILL LUCY KILLEA'S FORMER ASSEMBLY SEAT.  </P> <P> Setting the stage for a potentially confusing June ballot that could include  two races for the same seat, Gov. George Deukmejian on Wednesday scheduled  April 10 as the date for a special primary to fill the former Assembly seat of  newly elected state Sen. Lucy Killea.  </P> <P> If no candidate achieves the 50%-plus victory needed to win election outright  in April, the top Democratic and Republican vote-getters would compete in a  special June 5 runoff for the remaining seven months in Killea's unexpired term  in the 78th District.  </P> <P> On the same June ballot, the same candidates also could compete in the normal  state legislative primary for their parties' nomination for the two-year term  that will be contested in November.  </P> <P> Consequently, not only could there be two 78th-District elections on the June  ballot, but it also is possible -- though politically unlikely -- that the  winner of the special runoff could be defeated in the normal primary.  </P> <P> If that sounds confusing, you're not the only one scratching your head. As an  election supervisor in the registrar of voters office aptly put it: "This thing  could be a real zoo."  </P> <P> While consolidation of the special race's runoff with the June primary would  save the county an estimated $200,000, it also creates the prospect of a rare  double election that is as intriguing as it is perplexing. Indeed, county  Registrar of Voters Conny McCormack conceded Wednesday that the juxtaposition  of a special runoff and a routine primary for the same seat on the same ballot  could befuddle many voters in June, adding wryly: "We're still trying to figure  it out ourselves."  </P> <P> "When people see the same names twice on the ballot, there's naturally going to  be some confusion," McCormack said. "We've got a lot of education to do --  including with our own poll workers. Whatever happens, this probably is going  to be one for the election books."  </P> <P> The Assembly vacancy was created by Democrat Killea's upset victory in last  month's special 39th state Senate District election, a race that drew national  attention as a referendum on abortion and how far Catholic Church leaders may  go in opposing it. Bishop Leo T. Maher had denied Killea Communion because of  her pro-choice stand. The district stretches along the coast from Ocean Beach  to Pacific Beach, extending inland to the Miramar Naval Air Station in the  north, south to downtown San Diego and east to East San Diego.  </P> <P> A conclusive primary victory in April would preclude much of the potential for  confusion in June by eliminating the need for a runoff, meaning that only the  normal GOP and Democratic primaries would be on the ballot.  </P> <P> However, with at least four major candidates -- Democrats Byron Georgiou, Mike  Gotch and Howard Wayne, and Republican Jeff Marston -- expected to compete in  the primary, the chance of any surpassing the 50% margin needed to avoid a  runoff is unlikely. Hence the likelihood of June's "double election."  </P> <P> One particularly fascinating potential posed by the unusual electoral schedule  involves the possibility of a split decision, with one candidate winning the  special election but losing the normal primary.  </P> <P> The fact that the two contests will be waged before markedly different  constituencies -- all voters would cast ballots in the special runoff, while  partisan electorates will decide the primaries -- increases the slim chance  that the two races will have different victors.  </P> <P> "That's a bizarre possibility, but a conceivable one," McCormack said.  </P> <P> Democratic candidate Wayne, however, already has taken steps to try to ensure  that that unusual happenstance does not occur. In a letter sent this week to  Gotch and Georgiou, Wayne proposed that the Democrats who lose in April unite  behind the primary victor in order that he "not be forced to fight a war on two  fronts."  </P> <P> "It is essential that the Democrat who wins in the (special) primary . . . not  be required to beat the Republican in the runoff and to refight the Democratic  field for the primary nomination," said Wayne, a deputy state attorney general.  "Any other course of action means that the judgment of those who vote in April  can be ignored by an intransigent candidate. . . Furthermore, such divisiveness  would play directly into the hands of the Republicans."  </P> <P> Georgiou on Wednesday endorsed Wayne's proposal, saying that it "makes good  political sense." Gotch, a former two-term San Diego City Council member  regarded as the early front-runner because of his superior name recognition,  could not be reached for comment Wednesday night.  </P> <P> "It's technically possible that you might have two different winners, but not  very likely," said Georgiou, the former legal affairs secretary to then-Gov.  Edmund G. Brown Jr. "If we can all agree that the winner in April will get the  others' support in June, it's even less likely. Besides, if you can't win in  April, why would you be the party's best choice for the next two years?"  </P> <P> Times staff writer Ralph Frammolino in Sacramento contributed to this report.  </P></p>

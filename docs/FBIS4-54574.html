			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Corneliu Coposu, chairman of the National </F> Peasant Christian-Democratic Party, by Irinel Radulescu and Ralu  Filip; place and date not given: "The Solution to Our Overcoming  the Crisis Is a Cooperation Government"]    [Text] [CURIERUL NATIONAL] For a start we would like to  ask you to make an assessment of the current political situation.    [Coposu] Currently our country is facing an economic crisis  that is close to a catastrophe. One could say that it has  entered the phase of economic collapse. In my opinion, however,  the principal crisis is the moral one. Besides the political  and social crisis, besides the economic one, which everyone  perceives, I believe that the gravest crisis currently facing  Romania is the moral one. That crisis has been caused by the  postrevolutionary governments' obvious inability to direct the  country toward the restructuring of its democratic institutions  and the establishment of a free economy. All the attempts made  by the governments that have been ruling the country since  December 1989 -- which all lacked a program and which tried to  compensate for their failure in administering public affairs by  supplying economic-social program strategies, that is, in  practical terms, merely a listing of goals -- have failed to  yield any positive results. On top of that, it was all followed  by a series of bills of a Marxist-Leninist nature that made the  government look like a new hardline communist  nomenklatura. All the bills there have been have  loopholes and present a series of deficiencies that became  obvious after those bills became effective. For instance, in  1990 they refused to elaborate a bill on the restitution of  land. Now they are refusing to elaborate the bill on the  restitution of urban real estate. I mean, they promoted  imperfect laws, beginning with the Constitution. This situation,  interwoven with their lack of political will to implement  democratic reform and the transition toward market economy has  generated this crisis....    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You asserted that all post-December  bills have loopholes. This takes us by surprise, considering  that some of them were sanctioned by the representatives of the  PNTCD [National Peasant Christian-Democratic Party] and,  generally, by those of the CDR [Democratic Convention of  Romania] as well....    [Coposu] That is right, the opposition representatives have  not always adopted negative-oriented stances. Among the  hundreds of negative things it has done, the government has also  managed to accomplish certain good things that enjoyed the  opposition's support. Ours is a firm stance, as we already  asserted when the current government took office. We promised  that we would support all democratic initiatives, everything  that stands for progress and is directed toward establishing  democracy. This is why we have always reacted positively to all  signals that indicate a tendency toward democratization and  privatization. We have opposed, however, all attempts -- which,  as a matter of fact, eventually succeeded owing to their  majority in parliament, which is ensured by the extremist  parties -- that oppose democracy and the rules of the market  economy. One such example would be the taxes foreseen for the  farmers' incomes. Such taxes represent a tremendous gaffe, and  will have serious consequences upon the government. It is a  gaffe in which we played no part, but rather walked out of  parliament hall so that we could not be connected, even  indirectly, with that abhorrent law.    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Let us return to the crisis. In your  estimation, how could it be overcome?    [Coposu] There is no way out of this crisis other than by  altering the structure of the majority in parliament and by the  government's expressing and also implementing its will to  accomplish reform. Currently no such will is available, and we  are turning about and about in a vicious circle of positive  affirmations and praiseworthy intentions regarding reform, but  which, however, are never applied in practice or followed by  concrete steps intended to achieve transition. How can we  overcome this crisis? In my opinion, considering the lack of  will on the part of the executive bodies and, especially, of  President Iliescu to renounce his monopoly over the authority he  very firmly holds in state matters, all negotiations with the  opposition are useless. They are merely a waste of time.    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Today quite a number of political  analysts consider that the opposition made a mistake after the  elections held in the fall of 1992, when it rejected the PDSR's  [Social Democracy Party of Romania] offer to jointly set up a  coalition government. Similarly, now they are also criticizing  the then intention of the CDR to push the PDSR into the arms of  the left wing and the nationalist-extremist parties. What is  your opinion on this?    [Coposu] The reason for our refusal was different.  Accepting the responsibility of ruling means to have access to  the levers of power and to be able to implement one's own  program. The experience of the PNL [National Liberal Party] was  eloquent in this sense, as they participated in the Stolojan  cabinet without being allowed to appoint any of its members as  public servants. I mean, if they put at the opposition's  disposal the office of interior minister, for instance, and give  that person a ministerial salary, a chauffeured limousine, and a  villa in the Primaverii district, the problem will still remain  unresolved. Such a minister should be given full authority to  reorganize its ministry down to the lowest level. Otherwise the  supporters of neo-communism in his ministry might resort to  sabotage.    What we asked for could easily have been fulfilled. We  asked for full authority to implement their programs for all  portfolio holders of the ministries entrusted to the opposition.  They, however, refused. We said: "If you do not wish to share  power with us, you cannot share responsibility either, so why  don't you keep it for yourselves alone. As long as you behave  democratically, we will support you. The moment you come up  with law-making initiatives that endanger democracy, we will  stop supporting you." Thus, they denied us access to the levers  of power. Under such circumstances, we could not cooperate with  them. My party cannot participate in a government with three  ministers while power is actually held by Mr. Iliescu.    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Are you really convinced that Mr.  Iliescu has full control over PDSR?    [Coposu] No, I am not. But he is inclined to wish to  control the progress of life in all domains of activity down to  the minutest detail. Such is his tendency, but I have no way of  knowing the extent to which he is also being sabotaged by his  own party, the former Securitate, and the current SRI [Romanian  Intelligence Service].    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You said that the solution to overcome  the crisis would be to alter the majority in parliament. How  could that be achieved?    [Coposu] There are two angles to this issue. First, I  believe it will be very difficult for them to continue ruling  with the current parliament. I consider it similarly difficult  to achieve a different majority with the political spectrum  currently existing in parliament. And yet, how could a  different majority still be achieved? By means of a future  cooperation, rather than an alliance government. Cooperation is  something that could be done even by political groupings with  contradicting programs and diametrically opposed ideologies.  What does cooperation mean? It means the temporary cessation  of the parties' own initiatives, on the basis of a minimal  program, accepted by everyone, and intended to overcome a  difficult moment that has emerged in the ruling of the country.  Therefore, theoretically speaking, such cooperation could be  achieved by the PDSR's appointing a number of its own delegates,  which should be in accordance with the people's  updated option, while, on the other hand,  representatives of the opposition parties should be appointed,  similarly, in accordance with the proportion held by each of  those parties in the people's updated option, all those  representatives ensuring the functioning of a department each.  All departments should be left entirely to the care of their  leaders, without any meddling on the part of any of the other  factors. After having attempted to overcome the crisis  situation, a balance is to be drawn up to single out all those  who have not complied with their duties and to make them assume  responsibility for their inability to govern. This is what  cooperation means. And it could be achieved if the group of the  moderates within the PDSR were stronger and could impose its  point of view on the group of radicals. However, currently the  radicals are terrorizing the moderates and compelling them to  submit to the measures they dictate. The best proof of this is  the fact that persons who were considered moderates, under the  terror of the radicals, meanwhile changed their stance and have  swung to the other extreme. Mr. Adrian Nastase [executive  chairman of the PDSR] has become more radical than the radicals  themselves, because he knows that the majority of the party  tolerates him merely because of Mr. Iliescu's insistence. If the  group of moderates could impose its own views, then they,  together with the opposition and perhaps with the PD-FSN  [Democratic Party-National Salvation Front], of which I do not  know whether they would participate or rather merely support  such a government, the alteration of the parliamentary majority  could be achieved.    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Lately you have frequently mentioned the  idea of holding early elections. On what grounds do you venture  to make such assertions?    [Coposu] I see no way in which the current parliament could  go on functioning until the mandate entrusted to it by the  nation expires. And it is my belief that if no early elections  are to be held this fall, they will certainly have to take place  next spring. Early elections are always determined by the  inability to overcome crisis situations. Well, our current  government does not even have a program to overcome the crisis.  Look at their [1994] draft budget.... It is full of nonsense  and illusory provisions. It hopes for state spending to be  covered by borrowing 800 billion lei from the nation. I wonder,  will anyone in Romania be ready to credit the Vacaroiu  government with such an amount?    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] You mentioned the moderates and the  radicals within the PDSR. Would a rift between those two wings  be beneficial for our political life, or rather not?    [Coposu] That rift will occur and it will doubtlessly  strengthen the left. If one were to examine the political  concept of the parliamentary majority, one would find that they  are former communists who have now declared themselves  democrats. There is no difference whatsoever between Mr.  Verdet's [chairman of the Socialist Party of Labor -- PSM]  chamber of deputy members and those of the majority in  parliament. They have the same type of mentality and they are  similarly unable to break through the shell of their  Marxist-Leninist way of thinking. Such a rift within the PDSR  would be welcome to clear things up once and for all. However,  it is important that the wing that breaks off should not be a  majority one, because this would come to prove the label we have  given to the PDSR, namely that it is a crypto-communist party.    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Judging by your reasoning you seem to  be more interested in the rift itself than in anything else.  Have you ever considered the risks it would imply? On the one  hand, the minority of the moderates could be absorbed by the  opposition, while, on the other hand, the left wing would be  strengthened by helping itself to the PDSR structures.    [Coposu] In this phase of confusion we are currently going  through, one needs to get one thing straight. The important  thing in any multiparty system is that there should be a  powerful opposition, even if it is a left-wing one. Who is  stopping us from having the current opposition run the country  with the left wing in the opposition? In the current phase, in  our transition toward a market economy, it might even prove to  be beneficial to have a left-wing opposition throttle tendencies  to wild capitalism. There has to be a crystallization of the  situation regardless of the sacrifice and I believe that it  would be better if the radical half of the PDSR joined the  communists, so that at least one would know who one has to deal  with. But of course, such crystallization implies perils....    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Do you think that the opposition is able  to handle such perils?    [Coposu] The opposition is structured upon certain persons  who left their prison cells with their pockets empty and their  assets confiscated. They had no access to radio, or television,  and could not have their programs circulated by the press. If  you want to have the press, you need money. Only I know what  hardships we have to put up with to keep the daily DREPTATEA  afloat, considering its 7-8 million lei monthly deficit. The  opposition is poor, but I limit that to the CDR, because the  others, such as the PD-FSN have already been in power, so they  were able to make some money. They have their own press.    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] In connection with the crystallization  needed within the PDSR, do you think that this process should be  extended over the CDR, as well?    [Coposu] It would be childish if I asserted that there are  no divergences within the CDR. However, our democratic  conception compels us to the unanimous acceptance of the ideas  supported by the majority. The CDR consists of eight parties  and 10 political groupings that do not have a party character.  This means 18 determining factors, each with its own identity  and political ideology. The criteria at the basis of the  setting up of this alliance is a minimal program, a platform  containing certain very restricted points.    [CURIERUL NATIONAL] Even with that minimum program, the CDR  member parties have disagreed, at crucial moments, in  parliament....    [Coposu] They did, doubtlessly. A common denominator is  inconceivable. It is right to have divergent points. And there  is divergence among the CDR members and among the parliamentary  factions of the opposition. However, each of those parties  realizes that if it were to leave the CDR, it would immediately  be annihilated and doomed to disappear from our political life.  The fate of Mr. Campeanu [former chairman of the National  Liberal Party] and his party can prove it.</p>

			<p>930604 FT  04 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Norcros drops 26% and calls for Pounds 49.7m NORCROS, the building products manufacturer, yesterday announced a 2-for-7 rights issue raising Pounds 49.7m net to take advantage of the property upturn, as it unveiled a 26 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March 31. The shares are being offered at 132p - a substantial discount to the existing share price which slipped 3p to 165p on a day the market also fell. Pre-tax profits declined from Pounds 15.6m to Pounds 11.5m after an exceptional charge of Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 100,000) to cover the cost of restructuring. The workforce was reduced by a further 700 to about 7,000. The group plans to use the rights proceeds to reduce borrowings and to make bolt-on acquisitions to its core business of building products. Debt fell by Pounds 7.9m to Pounds 120.2m resulting in a lower interest charge of Pounds 6.3m (Pounds 8.6m). Mr Michael Doherty, chairman, said the group was well placed to take advantage of any upturn in the UK. While it remained committed to disposing of its property portfolio, recently valued at Pounds 45m, Mr Doherty said the rights proceeds would enable it to sell at a more leisurely pace. Property disposals during the year amounted to Pounds 16.9m. A provision for the fall in value of the disposed property was mainly responsible for an extraordinary charge of Pounds 7.9m. Operating profits fell from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 22.3m on reduced sales of Pounds 389.7m (Pounds 394m). Those from building products increased from Pounds 3.56m to Pounds 7.76m; ceramics saw a reduction from Pounds 11.3m to Pounds 7.4m and printing and packaging reported Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 12m). The final dividend is held at 3.5p making an unchanged total of 7p. Earnings per share fell from 7.5p to 5p. COMMENT Given the history of false dawns in the building sector it would be surprising if investors did not treat the latest optimistic soundings from Norcros with more than a dollop of scepticism. The UK recovery already appears to be faltering and borrowings, notwithstanding the rights issue, will remain quite high. However, the results of the restructuring, resulting in the loss of a further 700 jobs, puts the company on a better footing should the UK experience a sustained upturn. Analysts estimate that every pound in sales should yield 33p in operating profits. Faced with a choice of either selling property or tapping shareholders for cash the latter was preferable. With forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.5m the shares are on a prospective multiple of 17.6, and shareholders should probably give the company the benefit of the doubt one more time.</p>

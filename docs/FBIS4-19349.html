			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["gb" report: "Markets Hardly React to Prime Rate </F> Reduction"]    [Text] Frankfurt/Main, 14 Apr -- On Thursday [14 April]  the Central Bank Council of the German Bundesbank lowered the  discount rate from 5.25 to 5 percent and the Lombard rate from  6.75 to 6.5 percent. The financial markets briefly reacted to  this slight loosening of monetary policy with higher rates, but  they quickly calmed down. While the lowering of the Lombard  rate was no surprise for most dealers on the market, only a few  observers had predicted a lower discount rate. In the afternoon  the central banks of other European countries -- including  Austria, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Denmark --  reduced their prime rates. Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer  expects the interest rates for customers of banks and savings  banks also to go down, depending on the market situation.    Tietmeyer justified the reduction of the prime rate above  all  with the declining inflation rate. In the course of the year  the Bundesbank expects another decline, so that during the  second half there might indeed be a "two in front of the decimal  point." As an important reason for easing tensions on prices,  he cited the latest wage agreements. In addition, by continuing  its policy of slow interest-rate reductions, the Bundesbank  wants to make a contribution to stabilizing the financial  markets and thus also to consolidating the trust of foreign  investors in the long-term stability of the German mark [DM].  In contrast, the policy of rapid interest-rate reductions, as  recommended by critics of the Bundesbank, could revive fears of  inflation, which would damage confidence in the German mark    Tietmeyer announced that in the future, too, the Bundesbank  will stick to a policy that is, above all, oriented toward the  development of the money supply. In the long term, the  connection between the growth of the money supply and the  acceleration of inflation remains unchanged. He said that the  high growth rates at the beginning of the year had been  distorted by special factors. In the course of the year a  decline of the growth rate of the M3 money supply is expected.  Vice President Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said it is possible that  the increase in the money supply will be between 4 and 6 percent  during the fourth quarter of the year, as intended by the  Bundesbank.    In addition, the Central Bank Council decided to pass on  DM18.26 billion of the Bundesbank's net profit of DM18.83  billion, after allocation to the reserves, for the past business  year to the Federal Government, as the Bundesbank's owner. In  the afternoon, FRG Finance Minister Theo Waigel announced that  DM11 billion of this sum would be used to repay state debt.</p>

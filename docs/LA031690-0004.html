			<p><P> March 16, 1990, Friday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> WORKER INDICTED OVER KICKBACKS AT NAVAL STATION  </P> <P> A civilian Navy employee at the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu was indicted  Thursday in federal court in Los Angeles on suspicion of soliciting and  accepting up to $2,000 in kickbacks in exchange for a government painting  contract, authorities said.  </P> <P> Jammie Lee Nash, 38, was arrested early Thursday by agents of the FBI and the  Naval Investigative Service, said Assistant U.S. Atty. David A. Sklansky, who  is handling the case.  </P> <P> Nash was released on a $10,000 signature bond after appearing before U.S.  Magistrate Joseph Reichmann in Los Angeles. He is scheduled to be arraigned  March 19.  </P> <P> Daniel Lynn Becraft, 43, of Lovelock, Nev., and Eugene Baxter, 43, of Long  Beach, both former contractors at the Naval Air Station, were also charged  Thursday with providing Nash with kickbacks, Sklansky said. Becraft and Baxter  have not been arrested.  </P> <P> The arrest followed a three-year joint investigation by the FBI and the Naval  Investigative Service, said Lt. Cmdr. Gene Okamoto, a Naval Air Station  spokesman.  </P> <P> He said that although Nash is still employed at the base, he was reassigned  from his job as a contract inspector to another post when the investigation  began. He said he does not know what Nash's present job is.  </P> <P> The indictment alleges that in 1987, Nash, while a contract inspector at the  base, solicited and accepted from Baxter and Becraft 10% to 20% of a $17,262  government contract to paint 15 housing units, Sklansky said.  </P> <P> If convicted, Nash faces a maximum sentence of seven years in federal prison  and a $350,000 fine. Baxter and Becraft each face a maximum sentence of one  year and a $100,000 fine.  </P> <P> Over the last three years, the U.S. attorney's office has prosecuted more than  100 defendants, including corporations and individuals, in a variety of defense  fraud cases, including bribery, false representation and overbilling, said  William Fahey, chief of the government fraud division of the U.S. attorney's  office.  </P> <P> Last month, Northrop Corp. pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud charges and  agreed to pay the government $17 million to end a massive criminal case, Fahey  said. A year ago, a $5.5-million fine was imposed on Rockwell International  Corp. for fraudulently overbilling the Air Force on a satellite navigation  system.  </P> <P> Fahey said more than $70 billion in defense contracts are awarded to  contractors in Southern California every year.  </P> <P> "It's very big business," Fahey said. "We take all bribery and fraud cases  seriously because protecting the integrity of the process is important to us."  </P> <P> Fahey said his office has 20 investigators and 12 prosecutors who spend a  majority of their time on fraud cases.  </P></p>

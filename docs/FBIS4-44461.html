			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ho Kang-hua (0149 1660 5478)] </F>   [Text] Since China initiated reforms and opened up to the  outside world, she has attracted a large volume of foreign  investment. This has had a great effect on China in the way she  has changed. However, official circles are also aware how this  foreign capital, in a covert way, is changing the face of  Chinese society. It can be said that the feeling in official  circles toward foreign business is a mixed one of love and hate,  much like lovers who do not know when they will have another  quarrel.    Recently, the Ministry of International Trade and Economics  of the State Council conducted a large scale survey focusing on  some of the solely foreign-funded enterprises in Dalian,  Shenzhen, Zhuhai, and Xiamen to further understand the influence  of such businesses after their appearance in China. The results  show several problems that warrant attention.  <H5>  Negotiated Foreign Funding in Tens of Billions (U.S. Dollars) </H5>   Up to the end of September 1933, about 10,000 solely  foreign-funded enterprises had been approved, for a total  investment close to US$20 billion U.S. They comprised 16 percent  of the three kinds of foreign trade enterprises, and 25.3  percent of the total foreign capital investment agreed upon. The  rapid rise and development of solely foreign-funded enterprises  took place after 1988. From the beginning of 1988 to September  1993, 10,000 of solely foreign-funded enterprises had been  approved, with an agreed upon investment totalling more than $20  billion (actual amount invested was $3 billion), comprising 98  percent and 92 percent respectively, of the aforementioned  totals. At present, enterprises already established and started  on production, and those in process of construction make up more  than two-thirds of the solely foreign-funded enterprises  approved. These enterprises are located mostly in special  economic zones and opened coastal ports. For example, in the  Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, approval had been granted to  about 1,500 solely foreign-funded enterprises by the end of  September 1993. These enterprises were engaged primarily in  electronics manufacture, mechanical processing, industrial  chemicals, light industry, construction materials, textiles and  clothing, real estate etc. Investors were primarily from Taiwan,  Hong Kong, Macau, Japan, the United States and Germany.  <H5>  Rapid Growth on a Large Scale </H5>   In studying the tendencies of these solely foreign-funded  enterprises, official circles discovered that since 1988,  development of these enterprises exhibit two outstanding  characteristics:    1) The speed of growth and the continually increasing scope  of capital investment.    In 1988, only 410 solely foreign-funded enterprises were  approved for all of China, with an agreed upon capital  investment totalling $480 million U.S. By 1989, this figure had  increased to 931 enterprises, with an agreed upon capital  investment totaling $1.654 billion; by 1990, to 1,860  enterprises with investment totaling $2.444 billion; by 1991, to  2,793 enterprises with investment totalling $3.667 billion; by  1992, to 3,607 enterprises with investment totalling $5.210  billion; and by 1993, to 4,100 enterprises with the investment  total in excess of $6 billion.    2) Increases in project size and in volume of capital  investment from Taiwan.    Solely foreign-funded enterprises everywhere usually start  on a small scale. In the beginning, they were usually small and  of an exploratory nature, but grew as time went on. Take the  situation in Dalian as an example. Before 1986, capital  investment in a solely foreign-funded enterprise averaged  $1,458,800. Since 1988, the average capital investment had been  on the rise--up to $1,573,800 for that year. By 1993, the  average capital investment had increased to $3.5 million.  <H5>  Increases in Taiwan Investment and in Large Scale Projects </H5>   In recent years, following continued improvement in the  investment environment, the number of solely foreign-funded  enterprises has been on the rise. At present, of such  enterprises with a capital investment in excess of $10 million,  25 are located in Xiamen, nine in Zhuhai, and six in Shenzhen.  In Dalian, there is only the "Jieneng Dalian Office Equipment  Co., Ltd.," a solely Japanese-owned enterprise in which more  than $100 million has been invested.    The growth of solely foreign-funded enterprises owned by  Taiwan business is most marked along the coast of Fujian  Province. For example, among the 840 solely foreign-funded  enterprises located in the city of Xiamen, 625 are owned by  Taiwan business. Among 756 already approved enterprises funded  by Taiwan investors, 76 percent of them are sole-proprietor  enterprises owned by Taiwan business.    However, we cannot have it both ways. At the same time that  foreign investment benefits China in many ways, it is also  accompanied by many problems, of which the following two are  quite serious.    1) Serious tax evasion accompanying outstanding economic  benefits.    Solely foreign-funded enterprises usually adopt up-to-date  techniques and equipment. Enterprise management is strict, and  their products are strongly competitive on the international  market, while reaping good economic benefits and great profit.  According to followup analysis by the Xiamen Committee on  Foreign Investment of economic benefits received by some  important enterprises among 680 solely foreign-funded  enterprises that are in production, 94.1 percent are making a  profit, while only 79 percent of joint venture enterprises are  doing the same. Statistics compiled by the Zhuhai Committee on  Economics and Trade for 1991 also showed that among 210 solely  foreign-funded enterprises already engaged in production, 173  were making profits that totalled more than 100 million yuan.  The 88 enterprises that did not show a profit incurred losses  totalling 52 million yuan, 54.7 percentage points of the deficit  covered. However, among the 530 solely foreign-funded  enterprises (including those already in production) granted  approval, close to 200 of them had their investment capital  increased in recent years to more than 200 million yuan, which  comprised 32 percent of the agreed upon quota.    How the solely foreign-funded enterprises frequently use a  high-cost import and low-priced export technique to transfer  their profits out of China, or use a branch company to do so is  reflected wherever these enterprises operate. This is done to  achieve their goal of paying as little tax as possible.  According to statistics compiled by the port of Xiamen, the  value of output from solely foreign-funded enterprises in Xiamen  for 1992 was 41.2 percent of that from all foreign ventures in  Xiamen, but the enterprise income tax from the solely foreign  funded operations was only 11.4 percent of that paid by all  foreign ventures.    2) Tense internal labor-management relationships.    Because solely foreign-funded enterprises do not have a  middleman, and the "Law on Foreign Ventures" does not clearly  define such a management slot for these enterprises,  labor-management relationships within such enterprises are not  easy to handle. Moreover, certain solely foreign-funded  enterprises, especially owners of smaller operations at certain  ports, will cut costs wherever possible, in pursuit of maximum  profit. To do so, they will prolong normal working hours at  will, and overlook improvement of working conditions on one  hand, and on the other, adopt an arbitrary parental approach  that uses physical punishment, bag and body searches, so that  the conflicting relationship between workers not used to such  treatment and the enterprise owner worsens, leading to work  strikes and resistance. This phenomenon has been noted in places  such as Dalian, Zhuhai and Xiamen. Take Xiamen for example. More  than 30 strikes have taken place during the last few years, the  largest strikes being one where more than 700 workers  collectively "walked off" for one day, and another where 250  workers stayed off work for 3 days.    Because solely foreign-funded enterprises are expanding so  fast and coming on so strong, and China has yet to have a  corresponding policy, regulations and supervisory mechanism to  keep up with them, such enterprises have urgent management  problems that need to be resolved. They are:    1) The state's lack of measures to implement effective tax  oversight on profits of solely foreign-funded enterprises. At  present, some of these enterprises have yet to seriously  implement an independent accounting system, as they regard their  enterprises only as subsidiaries of foreign companies, through  which they can avoid inspection and oversight by taxing  agencies. Even as some of them have yet to set up a strict  finance accounting system, they have not set up independent  financial records either, or they may keep several sets of books  instead. The accounts between quite a number of enterprises and  their parent companies are often unclear, for they regularly use  the "high-cost import" and "low-price export" technique to  transfer their profits to avoid taxes.    2) Clarification of rules and regulations dealing with  foreign ventures. This problem was noted from evaluation of  solely foreign-funded enterprises, one of considerate concern to  all local agencies of economics and foreign trade. Even as the  "Regulations on Implementing the Law on Foreign Ventures" have  been announced, some problems still remain to be clarified,  making it difficult for those responsible for granting approval  to make a decision. For example, with respect to an item of sole  ownership involving plant and facility construction that does  not require a petition for land use, does it still require the  planning committee to establish an item? Does an enterprise  funded solely by an individual need to establish a board of  trustees, and if so, how shall it go about it? What about the  legal basis for changes, dissolution, exchanges between  shareholders, and share classification? What about the legal  basis for the way capital is invested in a solely foreign-funded  enterprise, time limits on capital payments, termination  conditions etc.?    3) Important management problems. This includes inadequate  capital payments into a solely foreign-funded enterprise,  striking a proper ratio between production and marketing as  determined, resolving long-time resistant deadlocks, setting up  a legal person as an enterprise item, unwillingness to provide  statistical reports etc. People on the Chinese mainland do not  know how to deal with such problems.    4) Other problems. Most important is the pressure for  medical care, housing, family planning, public safety and other  services needed by the large labor force imported from outside  the immediate area to work in solely foreign-funded enterprises.  Once these enterprise operations have been fulfilled or  completed ahead of time, these workers become surplus baggage.  As many of these enterprises are labor-intensive operations,  their expansion frequently leads to fighting with local  enterprises for water, electricity, materials, markets etc. By  taking away space that could be used for development of a new  hi-tech industry, they hinder development and progress for the  local industry as a whole. Furthermore, how to make timely duty  refunds on indirect export of products from these enterprises,  in accordance with related regulations (such a problem with duty  refunds occurred in Xiamen where several solely foreign-funded  enterprises owned by Taiwan business made a joint petition), how  to resolve the labor management problems that frequently occur,  ands how to protect the enterprise workers' welfare and other  legal benefits are all very knotty problems.</p>

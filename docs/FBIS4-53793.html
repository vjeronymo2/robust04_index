			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by North Korean affairs desk reporter Kim Hyon-ho, </F> entitled "`You Are Indeed Ignorant'" from the Reporter's  Memobook]    [Text] "You reporters are indeed ignorant." This is a  rebuke often made by the wife of Mr. Yo Man-chol [former North  Korean worker who recently defected to the ROK with his family]  to reporters. We met with Mrs. Yi Ok-kum, Mr. Yo Man-chol's  wife, for a total of 15 hours over four times in order to cover  the story about her life in North Korea. Mrs. Yi, who merely  answered reporters' questions at first, gradually took a more  positive attitude. This was partly because we became intimate  with each other as time passed. However, it is more likely that  she was impatient at reporters "ignorance" on the North Korean  situation.    Her story was that she eked out a living only with boiled  bean and gruel, and that no other clothes but uniforms were  supplied to children only once every three years. Moreover,  they wear the same trousers during summer and winter. They must  continue wearing socks even after holes are made and by darning  the holes. She noted that the price of a pair of nylon socks is  as much as the amount of her husband's monthly salary. Toilets  even in a large city were made by burying a drum can  underground, and women dig up night soil from it and carry it to  farms on a handcart.    She made this remarks with a sigh one time and in an angry  voice the other. Thus, the life of ordinary North Korean people  is hard to believe for ordinary South Korean people.    Not only one or two pieces of "material evidence" proved her  statement true. This evidence includes her fingernails that are  growing again after being taken out due to malnutrition; traces  of pellagra (a disease known to be caused by malnutrition which  is often seen among the native Mexican people who live on corn)  that was still left in her arm; and her monologue that the  mothers of Pok-hwa and Kum-sil, who were her children's  classmates, showed the same symptoms.    What makes it an issue is how the "compatriots" in the South  accept this enormous "tragic drama" that the North Korean  residents are suffering. Some people even think that providing  information on the real miserable situation in North Korea  itself is an outdated anticommunist education program, or that  "North Korea is poor. We all know this. How come this is worthy  of news?" However, in most cases, those who make such remarks  have less concrete knowledge on the real situation in North  Korea. Their true intention is indifference. What is even more  fearful is that some people feel "concealed pleasure" by looking  at the pains of North Korean residents. In other words, there  certainly are some people who feel strange pleasure, stating  that "look at what the communists and Kim Il-song have done!  This is exactly an outcome of what they did." The extreme  situation that the North Korean residents are suffering today  should not be subject to ignorance, indifference, and personal  pleasure. This problem will come to us as our own problem one  day, and this cannot be resolved without the will to share their  pains.</p>

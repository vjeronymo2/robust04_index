			<p><P> October 7, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> PICKING A PLANNER  </P> <P> Re "New Planner Picked After Investigation" (Sept. 21): In The Times'  continuing quest to prove that half a story is better than none, your reporter  missed a few critical points in the story about the newest appointee to the  Planning Commission in Orange.  </P> <P> Since I applied for this opening on the commission and since my name was  mentioned in the article, I would like to clarify my reasons for appearing  before the City Council on two occasions to question the appointment and the  process by which it was made.  </P> <P> As the Times reported, I did question whether my qualifications were better  than Mark Murphy's because I work in the field of land planning; he works in  marketing. But the council let me know that they were looking for a "fresh  perspective." (So much for all my education and 10 years' experience in the  field.)  </P> <P> Another salient point that I did not see mentioned in the article is that Mark  Murphy is serving as Mayor Pro Tem Gene Beyer's campaign manager in his current  campaign for mayor.  </P> <P> I do not know Mark Murphy, and I wish him no ill will, but an appointment to  the Planning Commission does not a planner make, and at least one council  member has told me that he relies heavily upon the commission's recommendations  to make his own decision. This public appointment should not be based on  politics.  </P> <P> TERRI H. SARGEANT, Orange  </P></p>

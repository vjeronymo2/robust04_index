			<p><P> October 5, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCRAMBLING FOR SCRAPPLE  </P> <P> Carol S. Osterhage, in the Sept. 29 "Letters in View" column, bemoans the fact  she cannot find real Eastern scrapple. I buy Habbersett (only the country's  best) at Ralphs. It's in the frozen meat case in the meat department. Yes, it's  the same great scrapple we used to buy back East. I'm glad to be able to help  another scrapple lover. One of the world's greatest foods.  </P> <P> BRINTON GOLD, Indian Wells  </P></p>

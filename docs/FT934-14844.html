			<p>931014 FT  14 OCT 93 / International Company News: GM in Dollars 32m test plan for electric vehicles GENERAL Motors said it would begin testing the everyday use of its Impact electric vehicles in a Dollars 32m nationwide programme in the US scheduled for early 1994, Reuter reports from Los Angeles. A total of 30 Impacts will be rotated on a two- to four-week basis among 1,000 participants in 12 regions. Drivers will use the cars in real-life situations so that the company can gather data for the vehicle's eventual sale, set for some time in the late 1990s. Of the 1,000 participants, 300 will be in four California regions: Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay area, GM said. California has the toughest car emission control standards in the US. Beginning in 1998, 2 per cent of cars sold in the state must be zero-emission vehicles. That figure will rise to 5 per cent by 2001 and 10 per cent by 2003. The Impact has a range of 70 miles in the city and 90 miles on the open road at 55mph. According to GM studies, 68 per cent of people drive less than 50 miles a day. The car uses lead-powered batteries, which take between two and three hours to recharge if they are below 80 per cent of capacity. The batteries have to be replaced every two to three years at an estimated cost of between Dollars 2,000 and Dollars 5,000, which is comparable to the maintenance costs of a petrol-powered car over the same period, GM said.</p>

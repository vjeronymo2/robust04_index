			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Markets: Exchange switches strategy - The Bottom Line BRITISH Telecommunications' shareholders will be relieved by the price the company negotiated this week for the sale of its minority stake in McCaw Cellular Communications, the US mobile phone group, to American Telephone &amp; Telegraph. The price of Dollars 49 a share is almost double the market price before the deal was done and will bring about Dollars 1.8bn into the BT's coffers when it is completed next year. It has saved shareholders from what was, only last year, beginning to look like a costly error. But the disposal is hardly a triumph. The most Barry Romeril, BT's group finance director, could say was that, once the funding costs of the investment were taken into account, 'there was certainly no loss and probably a slight profit.' The disposal has also raised doubts about whether BT's management has yet developed a clear international strategy beyond stating its vision of becoming 'the world's most successful telecommunications company'. At the time of the McCaw purchase three years ago, commentators questioned whether it fitted into any broader strategic vision. BT's chairman, Iain Vallance, replied that McCaw was a piece in a strategic jigsaw, the other bits of which could not be seen by outsiders. One way of linking it to the jigsaw would have been to build a long-distance network in the US and integrate this with McCaw's local operations - the strategy now being pursued by AT&amp;T. But BT never attempted to build such a long-distance network, while US regulatory restrictions prevented it from increasing its stake. With no synergies in prospect and AT&amp;T keen to buy into McCaw, this bit of the jigsaw has now been abandoned. Romeril denied, however, that the original purchase had been a mistake. He said BT had 'learnt an awful lot about the US telecommunications market'. Yet it is still far from clear where BT is heading. Since the company's privatisation in 1984, its international strategy has undergone many changes of which the McCaw sale is only the latest. Other retreats include the disposals of Mitel, the Canadian equipment manufacturer, IAL, the airport and hospital management company, and CTG, the north American distributor of information technology products. BT has also closed down Metrocast, a US paging company. The remains of BT's international strategy is a plan to provide global telecommunications services to multinational companies. This has three main elements: Syncordia, its Atlanta based network management subsidiary; GNS, its data communications company; and 'Operation Cyclone', a plan to invest Dollars 1bn over the next decade in infrastructure outside the UK. This strategy received something of a blow earlier this year when Vallance was unable to attract other large international telephone companies as shareholders in Syncordia. But, even if it proves successful, it is unlikely to consume the vast amounts of cash which BT's UK operations are currently generating. Romeril refused to be drawn on how this cash would be used. But the management is likely to face increasing pressure from shareholders for an answer. The main options are: To buy out the 40 per cent minority stake in Cellnet, its UK cellular subsidiary, from Securicor. This might cost about Pounds 1bn. To acquire a major foreign telephone company, such as MCI, the second largest US long distance carrier. To hand back the cash to shareholders through dividends or by buying back its own shares. As set out in a report published this week by stockbrokers Robert Fleming Securities, the scope for such distributions to shareholders runs into many billions of pounds. Such a move would have substantial tax advantages for many investors as well as allowing them to redirect their cash to more productive investments. It would also produce a clearer jigsaw puzzle, but very different from the one BT was previously assembling.</p>

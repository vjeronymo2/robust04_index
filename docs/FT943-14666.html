			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / International Company News: Dutch group in talks with Campari BolsWessanen, the Dutch drinks and foods group, is in talks about 'far-reaching co-operation' with the family-owned Italian company Davide Campari-Milano, the maker of Campari. Neither company would be drawn on detail, but the plans are understood to involve Campari taking over the Dutch group's substantial Italian activities. In return, Bols-Wessanen would acquire a stake in the Italian company, and distribute its drinks products through Campari's extensive sales network. BolsWessanen's interests in Italy range from mineral water and soft drinks to wines, distilled spirits and aperitifs such as Cynar, the artichoke-based drink. The company employs 570 people in Italy. Its Crodino non-alcoholic aperitif leads the Italian market. In April, Mr Marco Perelli Cippo, Campari managing director, said the company was seeking to align its traditional products - Bitter, Campari soda and Cordial - with new brands. Such is the Italian company's interest in the deal that it may be prepared to cede a stake of more than 20 per cent to BolsWessanen. If it did, it would be the first time in the company's 130-year history that shares have been owned by investors without close links to the Campari dynasty.</p>

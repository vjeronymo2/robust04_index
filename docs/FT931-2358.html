			<p>930320 FT  20 MAR 93 / Virgin weighs up legal options in fight against BA: US battle could be a courtroom 'World War Three' - Government pressure to end fight / Fear of 5-10 year timescale VIRGIN Atlantic yesterday said it was considering three courses of legal action against British Airways after the breakdown of the negotiations designed to compensate Virgin after BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign: In Europe under the competition rules of the Treaty of Rome. In North America under US anti-trust legislation. In the UK under the Data Protection Act and the Computer Misuse Act. Of the three courses of action a complaint to the European Commission under article 86 of the Treaty of Rome seems the least attractive. The article prohibits a dominant position in a substantial part of the common market if the position affects trade between EC states. Virgin's first step would be to lodge a complaint with the European Commission backed by evidence of BA's anti-competitive behaviour. The commission would then launch an investigation and has extensive powers to request information and carry out on-site inspections of business records. But the investigation could take a long time. The commission is unlikely to pursue the matter with any urgency if the complaints against BA are limited to past conduct. If the commission eventually found BA guilty of an infringement it could impose a fine on BA of up to 10 per cent of its worldwide turnover. However Mr Richard Branson, Virgin's chairman, would not recover any damages. To recover damages for a breach of article 86 he would have to bring a private action in the British courts. The courts have little experience of trying such cases, however, and it could turn out to be a very time-consuming and costly exercise for little reward. Damages awarded by British courts are tiny when compared with the sums awarded in the US. So, if Mr Branson is determined to press ahead against BA he would do better to sue BA in the US. There, the courts have the option of tripling the damages awarded. Virgin's lawyers have already looked at suing BA in the US. When gathering evidence of alleged BA dirty tricks in the US in advance of the UK high court libel action, lawyers from London firm Harbottle &amp; Lewis met Mr Robert Beckman, the US anti-trust lawyer. Mr Beckman handled the anti-trust lawsuit brought by Sir Freddie Laker, owner of the defunct Laker Airways, against BA over Skytrain which was concluded in 1984. Mr Beckman will have warned Virgin of the risks of suing in the US. The Laker case became bogged down over the issue of whether the US courts had jurisdiction to hear the case. The federal circuit Court of Appeals eventually ruled that the courts did have the jurisdiction, but the two parties settled out of court and no legal decision was ever reached on the merits of Mr Laker's claim. Virgin might avoid such a fight provided it limits its claim to the dirty tricks which allegedly took place in the US. Nevertheless, US anti-trust lawyers warn such an action is fraught with danger. Virgin would almost certainly be limited to bringing the US equivalent of an article 86 action under section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging abuse of a monopoly position. 'If BA fights it would be the equivalent of World War Three litigation. It's a very unclear area of the law,' one US anti-trust lawyer said. He warned there would be problems in defining in which markets there was dominance and in deciding whether the complaint amounted to anti-competitive conduct under the Sherman Act. There would be also any number of appeals on points of law. 'It could take anywhere between five and 10 years to litigate,' the lawyer added. Even if Mr Branson were awarded triple damages it would still be open to BA to sue Virgin in the UK courts under the clawback provisions of the Protection of Trade Act, which is designed to restrict the impact of the jurisdiction of foreign courts over UK companies. Although this legislation has never been invoked in Britain, it allows for the clawback of up to two-thirds of a US triple damages award. Mr Branson also faces problems with using the Data Protection Act and Computer Misuse Act. While the British courts could provide a forum for the revelation of further potentially embarrassing information on BA, the acts are rarely used and involve limited penalties. Virgin refused to be drawn yesterday on which course of legal action it would follow against BA and when. A decision is promised within a few weeks. Whatever his final choice, Mr Branson will be aware that he will need a very deep pocket if he is eventually to recoup more than the Pounds 9m he was reputedly offered during the settlement negotiations.</p>

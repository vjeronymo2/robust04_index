			<p>940531 FT  31 MAY 94 / Survey of German Banking and Finance (6): Old family houses return / Examining the efforts to rebuild the banking system in the east Nearly four years since German unification, the banking system and a range of financial services are taking root in eastern Germany. But it is not only the savings banks and Landesbanken, or state banks, which are being re-established. The country's old family banking houses are returning, too. But rebuilding a banking system has proved far from easy, says Mr Rudolf von Sandersleben who represents the eastern states for Sal. Oppenheim, one of Germany's oldest private banking houses which was founded in 1789. Unlike western Germany after the second world war, which was still in a position to lean on the mittelstand, the small and medium-sized enterprises which formed the backbone to Germany's economic success over the past 40 years, no such sector existed in former communist eastern Germany. Moreover, as Mr von Sandersleben points out, when Sal. Oppenheim opened its office in Leipzig in 1990, the bank could not even lean on an entrepreneurial class. 'The entire memory of private enterprise had not been entirely wiped out, largely because the last of the privately-run, very small businesses were not banned until the early 1970s,' explained Mr von Sandersleben. 'But many of these managers are now very old. Some of them have, however, tried again to set up their businesses and revive that entrepreneurial spirit. But they are few in number. We have to start from scratch.' The absence of the mittelstand sector, therefore, poses a set of different challenges for the private banking houses. Moreover, the absence of an industrial base, which spawned west Germany's mittelstand, means that private bankers have to look elsewhere for business or, more importantly, take considerable risk to finance young entrepreneurs anxious to set up a business in the eastern states. Even in this context there are problems. 'These small businesses have no capital,' said Mr von Sandersleben. 'They have no reserves, unlike the west German mittelstand which have had 20 or 30 years to build up reserves which can be used to invest, market, and make use of their capital.' What, then, is the strategy the private banking houses have adopted in eastern Germany? Sal. Oppenheim, for the moment, is 'going for the big fish'  -those enterprises with a turnover of at least DM100m. These include the utilities, for example, which are already largely dominated by west German companies. Sal. Oppenheim is also more intent on finding ways to finance their surplus liquidity than homing in on very small companies. At the same time, the bank is playing a considerable role in consulting and financial engineering. Yet the private bankers admit that many of the companies in eastern Germany are not yet ready for such sophisticated instruments of financing. 'What they still lack are the tools which are vital for surviving: marketing expertise, risk capital, reserves and management know-how,' said Mr von Sandersleben. 'Many are struggling to survive'. Yet, according to the Federal Association for Germany's banks, (BDB) under which the country's private bankers are grouped, these are precisely the kind of tools the banking sector in eastern Germany is now providing. Last year's figures for these activities seem to confirm this. For example, the credit flows from the private banking sector increased from DM23bn in 1990, to more than DM96.9bn in 1993. Almost half that credit has been earmarked for the housing sector. The Hypotheken banks, which specialise in this sector, have already lent DM46bn, while the smaller banks have extended more than DM11bn of credit. Investment in businesses, ranging from the small crafts sector to property and the infrastructure, has also increased sharply, rising from DM2.7bn in 1991 to DM4.3bn in 1993, and is set to increase to DM6.2bn by the end of next year. Yet curiously, the private banks have increasingly shied away from lending to enterprises under the Treuhand privatisation agency. By the end of 1990, the private banks had extended loans totalling DM18.3bn to the agency, and only DM4.7bn to non-Treuhand companies. This ratio was understandable, given that there were few private enterprises at that time, everything was in flux and, in any case, credit facilities to the Treuhand carried few risks. They were guaranteed by the government and margins were high. Yet, by the end of 1993, more than DM48.9bn of credits had been extended to non-Treuhand enterprises, and less than DM8bn to those enterprises still under the agency. 'We wanted to have the freedom to do our own advising and financing and locate potential customers ourselves,' said one banker. As the private banks identified their niches throughout eastern Germany, they also employed more people, crucial in a region which is facing unemployment rates of more than 17 per cent. The number of jobs created by the private banking sector rose from 18,000 in 1991 to over 21,000 in 1993. But in creating jobs, the BDB believes is it also contributing to 'the transfer of management know-how to the eastern states, which is a crucial plank for restructuring the entire banking sector,' according to its officials. Bankhaus Lobbecke, which was founded in 1761 and which has opened branches in Dresden and Magdeburg since unification, shares this philosophy. But Konsul Gunter Follmer, the spokesman for the bank's partners, would go one step further. 'Banking in eastern Germany is often pioneering work and it still is. . .' Mr Follmer said. He added that Lobbecke wanted to support the fledgling mittelstand sector. Indeed, by the end of last year, more than DM1bn, or a third of its total credit volume, had been targeted on eastern German clients. There is hardly a banker who does not believe that eastern Germany needs a mittelstand as much as the banks need these clients. 'The landscape will change over the next 10 years,' said Mr von Sandersleben. 'But we will have learned from our mistakes as well. And the existence of an overriding bureaucracy is one of those mistakes. But that's another issue.'</p>

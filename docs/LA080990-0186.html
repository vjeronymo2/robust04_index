			<p><P> August 9, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATED FOR ALLEGEDLY DESTROYING EVIDENCE;  </P> <P> COURTS: SHE REPORTEDLY DESTROYED A PHOTOGRAPH FOUND IN JACKET OF MAN ACQUITTED  OF MURDER CHARGE.  </P> <P> A veteran prosecutor in the Los Angeles County district attorney's office is  being investigated for allegedly destroying evidence in a murder trial -- a  recent case in which an old burrito helped to acquit the defendant.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Christine Gosney, during jury deliberations last month in  the murder trial of Edward Vasquez, told a judge she had destroyed a photograph  of a little boy found in Vasquez's jacket because it might have created  sympathy for the defendant, Vasquez's defense attorney, Jay Jaffe, said  Wednesday.  </P> <P> Gosney's revelation July 27 came as Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg was  considering whether to reopen the argument portion of the trial because of  something else found in Vasquez's jacket: a 2-year-old burrito.  </P> <P> Jaffe had argued that the burrito, discovered in a pocket only after the jury  had adjourned to deliberate their verdict, substantiated part of Vasquez's  alibi. The green jacket had been seized as evidence when Vasquez was arrested  in 1988 on charges of shooting a security guard.  </P> <P> After hearing about the burrito, Weisberg did reopen the trial, the burrito was  entered into evidence and, ultimately, Vasquez was acquitted.  </P> <P> But Gosney's admission in court that she had destroyed the photograph, which  was inscribed with the words "To my uncle Eddie," led the district attorney's  office to open an investigation, according to Jaffe. The defense lawyer said an  investigator from the district attorney's office interviewed him earlier this  month as a witness.  </P> <P> Jaffe said Gosney told the judge the photo fell out of a pocket when she  examined the jacket before the trial began.  </P> <P> "I think it was an important piece of evidence," Jaffe said. "(Whether) the  prosecutor felt the piece of evidence had a sympathetic effect in favor of the  defense, that's an issue the judge has to decide rather than her."  </P> <P> Gosney has also reportedly been suspended pending outcome of the investigation.  She could not be reached for comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> District attorney's spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons declined to comment.  </P> <P> "It's a personnel matter (and) I can't comment," Gibbons said.  </P> <P> Vasquez, 23, had been accused of killing a security guard in September, 1988.  The prosecution had argued that Vasquez, wearing a white T-shirt, shot the  guard in a Central Los Angeles parking lot.  </P> <P> But Vasquez, a student at Cal State Los Angeles, had maintained that he was  wearing the jacket and standing some distance from the shooting -- buying a  burrito.  </P></p>

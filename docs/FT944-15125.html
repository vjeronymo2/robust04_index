			<p>941020 FT  20 OCT 94 / Kuchma wins reform vote Ukraine's parliament yesterday endorsed, by a surprisingly wide margin, President Leonid Kuchma's economic reform programme. The vote suggests the Communist-dominated parliament will not for now spoil the first attempt at real reform in the depressed former Soviet republic. Mr Kuchma now has the chance to implement the tough macroeconomic steps required to secure Ukraine's first Dollars 360m credit from the International Monetary Fund, which due to approve the loan next week. Before then, Ukraine must unify currency exchange rates and liberalise prices, among other reforms. Nine decrees are awaiting Mr Kuchma's signature, say advisers. Initial steps are likely to stoke inflation and further devalue the unstable currency. But the IMF credit, a interest rate and foreign aid - to be discussed at a special meeting in Canada next week of the Group of Seven industrial nations - would help offset the devaluation. Price liberalisation, covering coal and natural gas, also would enable the government to reduce subsidies to close the 1994 budget deficit to 10 per cent of gross domestic product.</p>

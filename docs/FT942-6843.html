			<p>940527 FT  27 MAY 94 / Survey of Relocation in the UK (7): Long haul to raise standards - Skill levels Accurate comparisons between skill levels in the UK and its main competitors such as France, Germany and Japan are difficult to make. Indeed, they may not always be a fair measure of workforce skills. In Japan, for example, training is much less likely than in Europe to lead to a qualification. Nevertheless, there is common agreement that the UK has a skills problem. And, despite the recession and large-scale unemployment, severe skills shortages are forecast in a number of occupations, including high-tech industries, unless the problem is solved. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research, the London-based organisation, has estimated that in 1988-89 the proportion of the workforce with higher educational qualifications was roughly comparable to that in Germany, whereas the proportion with an intermediate level qualification, that is at craft or supervisory level, was far lower than in France or Germany. It is a problem that many in the UK regard as the central difficulty affecting UK manufacturing. Indeed, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who this week published a white paper on competitiveness, has said he considers training and education as the second most important factor in competitiveness after the management of the economy. A recent report, from a Commons select committee for trade and industry, said: 'Given that it is becoming ever easier to transfer capital and technology around the world, the skills of the workforce will increasingly be the determining factor in the competitiveness of different countries.' So what is the UK government and industry itself doing about the situation? A number of initiatives, which may bear fruit over the next decade, have been put in place. One of the most significant, albeit controversial, has been the development of a coherent framework of new national vocational qualifications which are based on an individual's ability to do a job. Called National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs) they start at level one, which is fairly basic, progressing through craft level qualifications to level five, which is a managerial one. The qualifications themselves have been attacked for various reasons. Nevertheless, they are a basis upon which refinements can be made, according to their supporters, which include the Confederation of British Industry. Indeed, national targets for improved attainment of qualifications among the workforce and young people were drawn up by the CBI, and endorsed by the government. There are several targets. One of the most important seeks to tackle the underlying problem of poor standards achieved by young people. The target is that by the year 2000, 50 per cent of young people should reach NVQ level 3, which is a craft level qualification, or its academic equivalent of two 'A' levels. Attainment of the targets may not, however, be sufficient to create a workforce that can compete. Indeed, the National Advisory Council for Education and Training Targets, an employer-led body which is monitoring the targets, has warned that some targets may have to be higher if the UK is to match the attainment levels of its competitors' workforces. A second important development by the government has been the establishment of 82 employer-led training and enterprise councils (Tecs) in England and Wales, and 14 local enterprise companies (Lecs) in Scotland. The government's intention is the private sector, from which these bodies' non-executive boards are mainly drawn, will bring a new dynamism to the drive to improve skills in the UK as well as foster economic regeneration in their local areas. Tecs and Lecs have been in existence for a little over three years and there is growing evidence that they are generally improving the attainment of qualifications among young people and the long-term unemployed. They are paid nearly Pounds 2bn a year by the government to administer training schemes. However, there is no measurement yet of whether Tecs have made any impact on improving the training of existing workers, this being a key group as 80 per cent of the workforce of the year 2000 is already in work. The problem is not simple. According to a recent survey by Price Waterhouse, the management consultancy, the expenditure on training in the UK as a percentage of pay bills is reasonably in line with elsewhere in Europe. However, it is the UK's relative failure in basic education, according to the select committee, that makes employers' roles more difficult and expensive. The government is seeking to address the latter problem, with the introduction of new vocational qualifications into schools, so as to cater for those who are not academically inclined. These reforms will take some time to introduce. At the same time Tecs, in partnership with other bodies such as local authorities, are introducing a wide variety of strategies in their local areas to assist both existing employers and inward investors. These include initiatives such as Investors in People, an assessment based on best management practice which helps companies improve their in-house training, as well as customised training. Tyneside Tec, in the north-east of England, working in partnership with the government's Employment Service and South Tyneside College, recently provided customised training for new employees being recruited by Onwa, a subsidiary of a Hong Kong television manufacturing company, which has opened a plant in the region. More than 250 people - some 190 of whom were unemployed - have been taken on by the new inward investor. Tec representatives visited other plants owned by Onwa. 'We observed the range of occupations and the culture within the company,' says Mrs Jean Thomas, business development manager at Tyneside Tec. to the needs of their constituents, the Tecs hope they can 'add value' in their localities. Their efforts, along with those of the government, will, however, be a long haul.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------      Percentage of the workforce with vocational qualifications  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Britain   France   Germany                                            1989      1988      1988  --------------------------------------------------------------------- University degrees                          11         7        11 Intermediate vocational qualifications      25        40        63 Of which: technician                         7         7         7           craft                             18        33        56 No vocational qualifications                64        53        26  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Commons Trade and Industry Committee report, April 1994  ---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

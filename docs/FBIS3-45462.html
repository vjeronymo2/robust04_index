Among those present  at the meeting were all the members of the provincial  government, officials from all the prefectural governments,  mayors of cities directly under provincial government  jurisdiction, people in charge of relevant government  departments, some people in charge of universities and colleges,  as well as people in charge of the provincial armed police  corps, the provincial frontier guard corps, and the provincial  fire brigade.    The main topics of this meeting were to sum up government  work in 1993, to arrange government work in 1994, and to propose  measures to ensure the fulfillment of the reform and development  objectives and tasks. Provincial CPC secretary and Governor Jia  Qinglin made a speech entitled: "Working in Full Cooperation,  Carrying Out Hard Struggle, and Ensuring the Smooth Fulfillment  of Reform and Development."    He said: Last year, guided by Comrade Deng Xiaoping's theory  of building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the  spirit of the 14th CPC National Congress, people throughout the  province made great achievements in seizing the opportunity to  deepen reform and expedite development. The province achieved  82.5 billion yuan in GNP, an increase of 25.4 percent over the  previous year, quadrupling the target seven years ahead of  schedule. Gross agricultural output value amounted to 32  billion yuan, an increase of 8.9 percent. Gross output value of  townships and towns amounted to 101.3 billion yuan. Gross  industrial output value amounted to 135 billion yuan. Marked  achievements were made in the construction of basic facilities,  with 13 key projects put into operation or basically completed.  The people's standard of living improved. The per capita  income of the people in cities and towns amounted to 2,600 yuan  and peasants' per capita net income amounted to 1,150 yuan.  Fifteen practical programs the provincial party committee and  government carried out for the people's benefit were basically  completed.    Jia Qinglin pointed out that in last year's government work,  there were still some aspects which were not up to our  expectations. Agriculture was still weak as the foundation,  farmland was reduced by 100,000 mu, there was a serious lack of  funds for key construction projects, state-owned enterprises  were seriously short of circulating funds, transportation and  communications were overloaded, energy was in short supply,  market prices increased by a wide margin and topped the 10  percent rate originally set, and there were still many problems  in maintaining safety in production and social order. Further  efforts are still necessary for a clean and diligent  administration. All levels of government should pay full  attention to these and overcome and resolve them.    On government work in 1994, Jia Qinglin said that this year  was an important year for speeding up reform and development.  The objective of the province's economic work is to enable GNP  to reach 91 billion yuan or to bring about a GNP increase of  more than 1 billion yuan over 1993; to invest 22.5 billion yuan  in state-owned fixed assets, an increase 21 percent; investment  in basic facilities construction will amount to 12.8 billion  yuan; foreign capital and total exports will amount to $7  billion; and foreign capital actually used will amount to $3.5  billion, an increase of 16.7 percent; revenue will amount to  10.8 billion yuan, an increase of 11 percent; commodity price  rises will be controlled to below 10 percent; the per capita  income of the people in cities and towns will amount to 2,712  yuan; peasants' per capita net income will amount to 1,300 yuan;  and the natural population growth rate will be kept under 12.59  percent [figure as heard].    To fulfill these targets, Jia Qinglin requested governments  at all levels pay close attention to six aspects which have an  important bearing on the overall situation.    The first is to maintain the sustained, speedy, and healthy  development of the national economy; the second is to properly  organize the implementation all reforms; the third is to give  prominence to structural optimization, strengthen management,  and improve efficiency; the fourth is to develop all social  undertakings; the fifth is to maintain social stability; and the  sixth is to strengthen the self-improvement of governments at  all levels.    Jia Qinglin added: An important feature of this year's  reform is that, in aiming to establish a new structure, reform  will be introduced to state-owned enterprises, the financial and  monetary system, the planning system, the investment system, the  foreign trade system, the state-owned asset management system,  and the social insurance system. The industrial structural  adjustment should be focused on strengthening agriculture as the  foundation, the construction of basic facilities and basic  industries; transforming processing industries; and developing  tertiary industries. The agricultural structural adjustment  should be carried out under market guidance, based on stable  grain production, aimed at reaping a good harvest, and focused  on cultivating high- quality and high-yield agriculture as well  as secondary and tertiary industries. Agriculture, forestry,  animal husbandry, sideline production, and fisheries should be  developed comprehensively. [passage omitted]    Enterprises and departments should boldly accept the  challenges of reform and the market economy, constantly improve  their management, and strengthen their competitiveness.    Jia Qinglin pointed out: At present leading cadres at all  levels should pay attention to major issues affecting reform and  overall development, go to the grass-roots level, build ties  with the masses, carry out investigations, and help resolve  problems. Leading cadres and institutions should take the lead  in observing discipline and practicing a clean administration  and self-control. Leaders at all levels should concentrate their  efforts on doing something practical for the masses to win their  trust and support.</p>

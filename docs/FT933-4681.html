			<p>930908 FT  08 SEP 93 / Scar-free healing 'within five years' SCIENTISTS will know within five years how to heal wounds without scars, it was predicted yesterday at the launch of an Anglo-American research initiative on scarring. The University of Florida is working with University College, London, and Moorfields Eye Hospital to develop new scar-prevention treatments for severe burns, disfiguring accidents and surgery. The starting point for the collaboration is research already carried out at Moorfields and the University of Florida. They have found that a single touch of 5-fluorouracil, an anti-cancer drug, greatly reduces the risk of scarring - which can cause permanent blindness - in patients undergoing surgery for glaucoma, a common eye disease. The next stage will be to define the roles of various natural chemicals, called growth factors and proteases, which regulate the healing process. Clinical trials are starting in the US of growth factors to heal persistent wounds. In the UK, Manchester University plans to start clinical tests within six months of a technique to neutralise the growth factors that cause scarring.</p>

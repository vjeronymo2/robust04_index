			<p><P> September 17, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MARKET WATCH;  </P> <P> SMALL-STOCK INDEXERS STILL WAITING FOR SHIP TO COME IN  </P> <P> Investing with Rex Sinquefield and David Booth is a form of existentialism: A  stock exists, therefore they own it.  </P> <P> Their strategy also has been a form of masochism for seven years running,  because the stocks that they buy are those of small companies -- which have  painfully lagged the broad market since 1984.  </P> <P> Sinquefield and Booth's $5-billion investment firm, Santa Monica-based  Dimensional Fund Advisors, is the nation's largest index investor in small  stocks.  </P> <P> They do no original research, no projections of earnings trends or other  fundamentals. They don't care what the companies produce. Shares of 3,200 small  U.S. companies and 2,800 small foreign companies sit in their portfolio -- just  because.  </P> <P> Index investing, which rose to prominence in the 1980s, is the antithesis of  active stock picking. Instead of trying to outperform the market by picking the  best stocks, indexers seek to match the market by owning all of the stocks that  make up key market indexes or subgroups.  </P> <P> If it sounds like joining 'em because you can't beat 'em, that's exactly what  it is. Index investors believe in an efficient market. Therefore, it's  impossible for a money manager to beat the market over the long term, indexers  argue. Better just buy the whole market.  </P> <P> When the witch in "The Wizard of Oz" wrote "Surrender Dorothy!" in the sky over  the Emerald City, it might as well have been these guys taunting the money  managers who try to make a living picking stocks. Says Booth: "Nobody is out  pushing the index concept like we do. We actually believe this stuff."  </P> <P> Investors associate index investing mostly with the big stocks that make up the  Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. Booth and Sinquefield, both schooled at the  University of Chicago and both true believers in that institution's free-market  philosophies, founded DFA in 1981 to extend indexing to small stocks.  </P> <P> It was, Booth admits, "a salesman's dream" of an idea. Big investors, he says,  "agreed they should have it (an indexed small-stock portfolio), but they didn't  have it" because no one offered it. By the end of 1981, DFA had $234 million  under management.  </P> <P> In the beginning, DFA bought only the smallest 20% of the stocks on the New  York Stock Exchange, measured by market capitalization (stock price times  number of shares outstanding). In 1984, the firm began adding over-the-counter  stocks. In 1985, with business booming, Booth and Sinquefield moved DFA to  Santa Monica from Chicago, for the quality of life. Their Ocean Avenue offices  now are home to 40 staffers. A London office has a staff of 14.  </P> <P> Behind DFA's success in attracting money is a basic tenet long respected on  Wall Street: the idea that small-company stocks outperform big stocks over the  long term. No one can say exactly why the so-called small-stock effect occurs.  The simplest theory is that, because small companies by nature grow faster than  big companies, their investors are better rewarded. For whatever reason, it  works:  </P> <P> * In the 50-year period ended in 1989, the average annualized return of small  stocks was 14.1%, versus 11.8% for the blue-chip stocks in the S&amp;P 500, DFA  calculates.  </P> <P> * Over the past 20 years, small stocks also did better, though not by as much:  11.8% versus 11.6% for the S&amp;P.  </P> <P> But in the 1980s, the trend reversed itself. In the five years ended in 1989,  the S&amp;P sharply outperformed small-stock indexes, 20.4% to 12.4%,  annualized. Every year since 1984, investors have kept telling themselves that  it's only a matter of time before small stocks return to the fore. They're  still waiting.  </P> <P> What's wrong? Sinquefield and Booth have no concrete answer. "But on some  level, it has to be earnings-related," Sinquefield says. One argument is that  big companies operated more efficiently than small companies in the 1980s  because of the big firms' drastic restructurings. Takeover mania also helped  big stocks.  </P> <P> A few years of under-performance, however, can't erase the long-term proof of  small stocks' better returns, DFA says. "The logic is unassailable," Booth  says. Yet, he admits, "people are frustrated because we've done so poorly."  </P> <P> Even so, most of DFA's major clients -- names like Blue Cross of California,  the City of Seattle and British Aerospace -- have stayed put. Why? "Well, we  think small-cap stocks will turn around someday," says Georganne Perkins, an  analyst in the Stanford University treasurer's office. Stanford, which has been  with DFA since 1984, has $32 million invested with it.  </P> <P> A strong argument for DFA's approach is that foreign small stocks continued to  outperform their big-stock rivals in the late '80s, even though U.S. small  stocks lagged. DFA began investing overseas in 1986, and its expertise with  those small stocks has attracted U.S. investors.  </P> <P> Perhaps equally important is the fact that DFA's clients know that, despite the  U.S. portfolio's dismal showing, DFA knows the tricks of managing a small-stock  universe.  </P> <P> That's no small feat. By their nature, small stocks are difficult to buy and  sell because there are few shares outstanding. DFA owns stakes of 5% or more in  about 500 of the 3,200 U.S. companies in its portfolio. A big investor who  fails to move nimbly and quietly can send a small stock's price way up when  trying to buy and way down when trying to sell -- defeating the paramount goal  of getting the most efficient price.  </P> <P> DFA has a "buy" list of small stocks that it wants to add to its already huge  universe. Rather than throw money at the stocks, it takes a patient approach,  Booth says -- cultivating relationships with brokers, spreading buy orders  among 40 or 50 brokers nationwide and waiting for "motivated" sellers to  surface. Transactions involve plenty of haggling, and DFA engages in undercover  work to avoid transactions in which would-be sellers know something it doesn't  -- such as an upcoming event that might crush the stock.  </P> <P> "They've shown they're very adept at trading," says DeWitt Bowman, chief  investment officer for the California Public Employees Retirement System, which  has $600 million invested with DFA.  </P> <P> The same kinds of patient strategies apply when DFA sells. And the firm sells  only when a small stock outgrows the "small" definition, which now ranges from  $140 million to $400 million in market capitalization, depending on the DFA  portfolio.  </P> <P> That's one of the ironies of DFA's index approach: A company doesn't exit DFA's  portfolio by going bankrupt, but by becoming so successful that its stock hits  the big leagues. Do well, and you're out.  </P> <P> That may make it sound as if DFA is investing backwards. And partly because  their approach isn't easy to swallow at all times, DFA doesn't seek out small  investors. The minimum investment it accepts is $50,000, and individual clients  can invest with DFA only through certain financial planners.  </P> <P> While they wait for small stocks to return to their historical performance,  Sinquefield and Booth have another concern to contemplate: Whether index  investing might be a trend whose time has passed, after booming in the '80s.  </P> <P> Could the '90s belong to the stock picker rather than the market buyer? You'll  never get Sinquefield and Booth to believe that anyone can be smarter than the  market over the long term.  </P> <P> Asks Sinquefield rhetorically: "What is it that's changed in the 1990s that  suggests markets won't work anymore?" If you need further proof of market  logic, he says, just ask the Soviet Union's communists -- who have decided to  junk the alternative after 73 years of failed results.  </P> <P> </P> <P> KEEPING THE FAITH IN SMALL STOCKS -- BUT FOR HOW LONG?  </P> <P> Measured over 50 years, small stocks have produced far better returns than big  stocks -- in the United States and abroad. But the past 10 years have seen U.S.  small stocks lag badly. Their fans are betting that will change in the 1990s.

			<p>941006 FT  06 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets: Cananda Sell orders and rising bond yields sent the Toronto market tumbling yesterday morning, but the afternoon rally on Wall Street helped the TSE retrieve some of the early loss in a day of heavy trading. At its worst the TSE 300 index was down 58 points, but ended a net 20.9 off at 4,253.36. Declines outscored rises by 209 to 480 after volume of 67.1m shares valued at CDollars 1.07bn.</p>

			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DANIELS EYES THE MARKETPLACE, AGREES TO CONTRACT FOR $600,000  </P> <P> Kal Daniels, stung by lower salaries recently given to comparable players,  settled his differences with the Dodgers and avoided arbitration Friday by  agreeing to a one-year deal worth $600,000.  </P> <P> In compromising between his request for $700,000 and the Dodgers' offer of  $550,000, the outfielder was influenced by the marketplace.  </P> <P> Late last week, Cleveland outfielder Chris James, who has comparable experience  and statistics, signed for $560,000. Earlier this week, Angel outfielder Devon  White lost an arbitration decision and was awarded $580,000.  </P> <P> "The White case was the real killer for us," said Lou Oppenheim, Daniels'  agent. "White even has better numbers than Kal, and when a guy with better  numbers signs for less money than you are asking, you are in trouble.  </P> <P> "So actually, Kal is pleased. We feel good getting what we got."  </P> <P> Daniels, who was traded to the Dodgers by Cincinnati July 18, played in 11  games here because of a knee injury that required arthroscopic surgery. In 38  at-bats, he hit .342 with two home runs and eight runs batted in. Daniels says  he is running and is ready for spring training.  </P> <P> Fred Claire, Dodger vice president, now will try to sign players with fewer  than three years' experience. At the top of that list is pitcher Tim Belcher,  who played for $225,000 last season but will be seeking nearly $1 million. BILL  PLASCHKE  </P></p>

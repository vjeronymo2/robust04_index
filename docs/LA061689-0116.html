			<p><P> June 16, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TASK FORCE TARGETS CON ARTISTS SELLING BOGUS AID TO ALIENS  </P> <P> County officials, concerned about unscrupulous "counselors" offering phony  legal aid and other bogus help to immigrants, said Thursday that they have  formed a task force to crack down on scam artists preying on people seeking  citizenship.  </P> <P> Fraudulent immigration help is of particular concern locally, said Rusty  Kennedy, director of the Orange County Human Relations Commission, because  184,000 immigrants in the county have applied for permanent U.S. residency  under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986.  </P> <P> "The Immigration Reform Act is wonderful," county Supervisor Roger R. Stanton  said in a statement prepared for the county unit's first meeting today.  "Unfortunately, it also becomes an opportunity for the unscrupulous to take  advantage of this large population, which needs educational and legal  assistance.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Exploitation Seen  </P> <P> "Too frequently, instead of critical needed assistance, our newest residents  are being exploited."  </P> <P> Kennedy said the unit will include representatives of the county district  attorney's office, the state attorney general's office, the Immigration and  Naturalization Service and local police agencies.  </P> <P> The Orange County Bar Assn., the Orange County Human Relations Commission and  various community groups will also participate, noted Barbara Brown, executive  assistant to Stanton.  </P> <P> In March, government officials issued a warning about men describing themselves  as government officials going door to door in Latino neighborhoods of the  county and offering guaranteed seats in nonexistent English and civics classes,  which are required for permanent residency status, in exchange for deposits  ranging from $10 to $50.  </P> <P> Apparently, residents in Anaheim, Stanton and Santa Ana were victimized by the  scam.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Fraudulent Counselors  </P> <P> Kennedy said there is also concern about fraudulent immigration counselors  charging outrageous amounts of money to shepherd applications through the legal  maze but never completing the work.  </P> <P> Attorney Olivia T. Ibarra, head of the immigration section of the Bar Assn.,  said: "There is a great shortage of agencies that provide low-cost legal  services to the immigrant population."  </P> <P> Partly as a result, many people are practicing law without licenses in the  county, with people being charged too much, not getting the service paid for at  all or having it performed incompetently, Ibarra said.  </P></p>

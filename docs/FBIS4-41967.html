			<p>BFN     [Text] Zugdidi, 28 Jun -- The Russian Federation  peacekeeping forces have deployed heavy artillery (122mm-caliber  E-30 howitzers) and heavy tanks (T-72 tanks) in the security  zone of the Georgian- Abkhaz conflict.    No peacekeeping force, be it in former Yugoslavia or in  Africa, is armed with either heavy artillery or heavy tanks  since no such weaponry is necessary to carry out a peace mission.</p>

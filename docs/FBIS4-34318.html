			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ricardo Alarcon, president of the National </F> Assembly of the People's Government, by special correspondents  Blanche Petrich, Josexto Zaldua, and Emilio Lomas at the Fourth  Ibero-American Summit in Cartagena de Indias on 14 June]    [Text] Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, 15 Jun -- Not as good  as Guadalajara in 1991, but not as bad, either. Evaluating  Cuba's performance at the Fourth Ibero-American Summit, Ricardo  Alarcon, president of the Cuban National Assembly of the  People's Government [ANPP], concluded that "our satisfaction is  greater" because we were able to overcome more significant  threats than before.    One threat to Cuban diplomacy is the shadow cast by the  Clinton administration's initiative to hold a hemispheric summit  in Miami at the end of this year with all the continent's heads  of state except Cuba's.    On this occasion, the threat took the name and shape of a  woman, Harriet Babbitt, U.S. ambassador to the OAS, who  yesterday appeared in the president's session hall sitting very  seriously beside Rosario Green, Mexican under secretary to the  United Nations. According to Alarcon, Babbitt was able to "slip  in," but her presence neither annoyed nor cheered the Cubans.  "Just as long as she knows how to conduct herself," he commented  sarcastically.    Today there was another noteworthy person; an unidentified  diplomat, but one whom everyone identifies as high-ranking and  responsible for organizing the "other" meeting in Miami. The  uneasiness felt by many heads of state was noticeable since the  diplomat, along with Ambassador Babbitt, was wearing a badge on  his lapel that gave him access to the most restricted areas,  where today only heads of state and their ministers were free to  go. The badge is only given to very high-ranking officials.  "Prerogatives of the host," an uncomfortable diplomat resigned  himself.    Ricardo Alarcon, who has been beside Fidel Castro since the  first Ibero-American summit, granted an interview and stressed  that there was neither more nor less tension prior to and  following the unexpected speech by the Cuban president during  the final minutes of yesterday's plenary session. Alarcon also  denies that Castro's complaints about the presidents' compliant  position toward the U.S. blockade were "out of place."    Alarcon believes that those heads of state who alluded to  Cuba's internal system were out of place and he said they should  keep in mind "the principle of national sovereignty at least  once in a while." That oversight was indeed "an unfortunate  slip."    Alarcon added that the takeover of diplomatic missions in  Havana over the past few days by groups of Cubans demanding  visas to leave the island is on the verge of becoming a "daily  practice," that could even signal the end of the diplomatic  system unless governments clearly stipulate that this is not a  means of obtaining travel documents and the United States ceases  to encourage the illegal departure of Cubans.    [LA JORNADA] President Fidel Castro's unscheduled statements  caused an uproar yesterday afternoon...    [Alarcon] I would not say that it was outside the agenda. I  think it was necessary for a country that was mentioned several  times during this meeting to say something about that. In fact,  President Itamar Franco, speaking for the second time, said it  was necessary that he clarify his position with respect to the  issue mentioned by other speakers. Their statements were indeed  outside the agenda because they made comments that they  considered necessary but which were inappropriate for an  international conference.    [LA JORNADA] Sovereignty is perhaps the oldest principle of  international law in Latin America and should be remembered at  least now and then. That principle is truly sacred on this  continent. Speaking outside the agenda constitutes a serious  slip because this sacred principle is overlooked.    [Alarcon] The international community is inclined to deal  with internal issues such as democracy, crime, drug trafficking,  multilateral diplomatic actions...    The idea of democracy as such comes from a democratic  concept  called plurality, but lately there have been attempts to link  the idea of democracy with certain events [torneos],  appearances, and formalities. In the Ibero-American community,  we repeat daily that we share a common language. Let us look in  the dictionary for a definition of democracy. If memory serves  me correctly, the academy describes democracy as a political  system in which the people participate. It does not say it is a  political system that every now and then must change colors or  pay millions for television advertisements to sell candidates as  if they were toothpaste.    [LA JORNADA] What is Harriet Babbitt, U.S. ambassador to  the OAS, doing here? How do you assess that? It is the first  time the United States has attended an Ibero-American summit  meeting.    [Alarcon] I imagine that she slipped in because she has no  right to be here.    [LA JORNADA] And nobody told her so?    [Alarcon] As far as I know, there was no meeting to discuss  whether observer status would be granted to a country that is  not Ibero-American. I thought of a whole list of countries more  appropriate to attend that are not doing so. I am talking about  other Portuguese-speaking countries or countries that speak  neither Spanish nor Portuguese but which are Latin American as  they are part of our history, such as Haiti or Jamaica.    [LA JORNADA] Is her presence healthy?    [Alarcon] It is all the same to me. I just want her to  behave properly and not make any noise. She is involved in  another conference, the orientation of which could contradict  the orientation of this conference.    [LA JORNADA] Could the Miami summit in December interfere  with the course of this Ibero-American summit? What could this  entail for Cuba?    [Alarcon] It is a summit with particular characteristics.  There is no preparatory work, no program, and no discussion  topics. It seems to be something for fortune-tellers. It should  definitely be a source of great concern.    [LA JORNADA] Certain people, President Cesar Gaviria and  Foreign Minister Noemi Sanin, for example, have established a  certain relationship between the changes being demanded of Cuba  and the fact that Fidel donned a guayabera instead of his  military uniform. There has been, let us say, a lot of mental  masturbation to give meaning to your guayabera. What is your  opinion on Fidel Castro's guayabera?    [Alarcon] We learned that informal clothing would be worn  here. Formal wear in Cuba is a shirt and tie. Informal for  some is a short-sleeved shirt. For us, it is a guayabera. It  is the national dress. As for the changes, some people insist  that we must change to look more like a democracy. When one  really believes in democracy, one must believe in plurality  above all and in diversity to ensure that each country's people  decides their own fate. The mental masturbation you mentioned  is a reflection of manipulation.    [LA JORNADA] What does the successive occupation of  diplomatic missions in Havana suggest to you?    [Alarcon] It is a reflection of the U.S. manipulation of  emigration. The people occupying those diplomatic missions do  not want to go to Antwerp or Brussels.    The United States is the only country that has two  immigration laws; one for the world and the other, the  adjustment law, which gives priority to Cuban citizens who  arrive in their territory claiming to be politically persecuted  in order to block the legal entry of those who wish to emigrate.  This law simultaneously promotes illegal departures. The  adjustment law for Cubans will be 30 years old. It dates back  to 1966. I do not know what would happen in another country if  there were a similar law for them.    Another suggestion is that a generalization of actions such  as this one would bring about disaster. There are millions of  potential economic emigres in the world. A generalization would  mark the end of the diplomatic system, the law of the jungle  would prevail.    [LA JORNADA] Three missions were occupied in past days; the  Belgian, German, and Chilean Consulates. Could this become  widespread?    [Alarcon] We can solve this problem in a civilized manner.  We have said that the people who violated diplomatic missions  will not be punished. Those embassies must recognize that this  is no means to travel to those countries. If we do not make  this clear, this could indeed become normal practice. This will  not end as long as the United States continues to implement its  immigration policy. Part of the solution is to convince these  people to use peaceful means. The other part is to allow them  to emigrate normally if they wish to do so</p>

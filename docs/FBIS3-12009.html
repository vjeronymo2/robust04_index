Nobody  from the SLF was killed or wounded by the Army, said A. Bappa,  one of the rebels involved in the occupation of the dam and the  hostage-taking of 30 employees from the bauxite company Suralco.    This statement directly contradicts the Army's official  statement, which said that five rebels were killed while fleeing  during the recapture mission. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Yaounde, 16 May (AFP) -- Siga Assanga, secretary  general of the radical Cameroonian opposition Social Democratic  Front [SDF] party, was dismissed today at the end of the party's  disciplinary council meeting, sources close to the opposition in  Yaounde disclosed. Mr. Assanga has appealed against the  disciplinary council's decision and the difference is expected  to be settled for good at the next party congress.    The council, which met in Bamenda, capital of the Northwest  Province, accused Mr. Assanga, the movement's second in command,  of having tried to approach the government for possible SDF  participation in a national union government. SDF Chairman John  Fru Ndi has, since the multiparty presidential elections in  1992, opposed the participation of his party in such a  government. Fru Ndi, who stood in those elections, contested  President Paul Biya's reelection.</p>

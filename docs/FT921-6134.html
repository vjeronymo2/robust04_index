			<p>920228 FT  28 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Radical rejig for Swiss capital structures - Ian Rodger on changes in company law aimed at giving shareholders a fairer deal AS the annual round of press conferences by big Swiss companies begins this week, the focus in many cases will not be so much on the companies' 1991 financial results as on their plans to overhaul their share structures. This is because of radical revisions in Swiss company law which come into effect on July 1 and which oblige quoted Swiss companies to be more transparent about their businesses and to bring their treatment of shareholders more in line with accepted international practice. From now on, for example, all groups must present consolidated financial accounts. Also, fund managers can no longer vote their holdings without first trying to obtain instructions from their clients. But the most important changes are to regulations regarding capital structures. At the moment, big Swiss companies offer bewildering combinations of registered and bearer shares of sometimes varying nominal values, some of which are restricted to Swiss nationals, some not. To top it off, some have participation and/or dividend right certificates as well. Under the new law, dividend right certificates may not have a nominal value and can only be issued without charge as a means of remuneration to founders, directors, shareholders or employees. This rules out the practice of issuing them to raise capital, as Roche, the pharmaceutical group, has done on a massive scale. Participation certificates may still be issued, but the total nominal value may not be more than twice the the nominal value of the share capital. Finally, the new law reduces the minimum nominal value for all classes of shares and participation certificates from SFr100 to SFr10. This is of particular appeal to the many Swiss companies whose shares are extremely high priced. EMS-Chemie, the Zurich fine chemicals group, announced last month it would split its registered and bearer shares to attract a wider group of investors. The bearers now cost a whopping SFr5,300 apiece. Nestle, whose bearer shares trade in the SFr9,300 range, has made no secret of its intention to do the same, although it has not yet revealed details. There has been considerable speculation among Swiss equity analysts about how each company is going to restructure its capital. In some cases, the restructurings could remove the discounts and premiums now attached to different classes of securities, and so offer the investor opportunities for one-off gains. Darier Hentsch, the Geneva private bank, has published its views recently on what will happen at some of the biggest companies and banks. It forecasts, for example, that Union Bank of Switzerland will split its registered and bearer shares five for one and perhaps force the conversion of the few remaining participation certificates. In this case Darier recommends buying the PCs because they are at a discount to the bearer share. The Roche case is the most complex. The group now has 1.6m voting bearer shares of SFr100 nominal value and 7m dividend right certificates of no nominal value or voting rights, but with equal right to dividends. The simplest solution, to convert DRCs into PCs, is not possible because the value of PCs would then be more than double the share capital. However, it is difficult to raise the share capital because a majority of the shares is held by the controlling Sacher family. Darier suggests that the company could make a disguised split of the bearer shares, offering three new shares for each one held and adding in a free DRC at the rate of one for every eight shares held. The family could then sell the DRC to finance their participation in the rights, and then the DRCs could be converted into PCs. Again, the upshot is likely to be more favourable terms for the DRC holders than the current discount would imply, according to Darier. Mr Thierry Hertig of Darier warns, however, that it is difficult to predict the timing of these changes. Some companies, he says, may make them in two stages, perhaps announcing a conversion of DRCs or PCs this year and a split next.</p>

			<p><P> January 21, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PISTONS' EDWARDS SEEKS HAPPY ENDING TO SAGA  </P> <P> James Edwards' favorite daytime drama is "One Life to Live," which is perfect  for a guy whose NBA career has had more subplots than a soap opera.  </P> <P> "Nobody's getting pregnant all the time, but there's always a lot of stuff  going on," he says. "Sometimes my life sure does seem like a soap opera."  </P> <P> Edwards, in his 13th year, is with his fifth team since being the 46th player  chosen in the 1977 draft and one of those tours of duty had him caught up in a  drug scandal in Phoenix.  </P> <P> But this story might have a happy ending yet. Edwards is starting for the first  time in four years and he's making a difference.  </P> <P> In his first 21 games as a starter Edwards, who was averaging 5.7 points per  game as a reserve, came to life with a 13.9 average, and the Pistons went on a  15-6 streak. In the last 10 of those 21 games, Edwards has averaged 17.6 points  per game.  </P> <P> "They're calling my number more often," says the 7-foot-1 center whose drooping  mustache and catlike smile have earned him the nickname Buddha. "I'm getting  the ball in good low-post positions where I can either spin inside or shoot  from the baseline."  </P> <P> What pleases Piston Coach Chuck Daly even more than the extra offense is the  way Edwards has begun to play defense, something he had been a little soft on  in the past.  </P> <P> In a recent victory over the New York Knicks, he held Patrick Ewing to just  three points in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "Jimmy has really been hitting some big shots for us lately," Daly says. "He's  playing about as well as I've ever seen him."  </P> <P> But it has certainly been an uneven road.  </P> <P> "The last time I was a starter must have been about four years ago in Phoenix,"  he says. "It's working out better now."  </P> <P> Edwards, who also has a passion for playing Nintendo, would just as soon zap  his Phoenix experience.  </P> <P> Edwards was among 13 people, including four Suns players, indicted in Phoenix  by a Maricopa County grand jury investigating drug use in the area in 1987.  </P> <P> Edwards was indicted on three counts -- conspiracy to possess a narcotic drug,  conspiracy to transfer a narcotic drug and conspiracy to transfer or possess  marijuana.  </P> <P> According to court transcripts, Edwards was accused of supplying or offering to  supply drugs to several people, including then-Sun rookie William Bedford, who  made the Piston roster this season after years in rehabilitation clinics.  </P> <P> Later in 1987, Edwards officially entered a yearlong counseling program in  Phoenix as part of a plea-bargain agreement that led to the dismissal of all  three charges against him.  </P> <P> "That part of his life is behind him, and has been for quite some time now,"  says Jack McCloskey, the Piston general manager. "James now is a solid citizen.  He's heavily involved in several charities both in Phoenix and in the Detroit  area."  </P> <P> But even McCloskey became involved in the soap-opera aspect of Edwards' life  last spring when he left popular Rick Mahorn unprotected in the expansion  draft. Everyone thought Edwards should have been the one left unprotected.  </P> <P> Today, the critics are silent.  </P></p>

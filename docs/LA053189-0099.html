			<p><P> May 31, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> LOWEST SMOKING RATE SINCE '44 REPORTED  </P> <P> Cigarette smoking has declined to its lowest level since 1944. In a new Gallup  survey, 27% of American adults report having smoked cigarettes during the week  prior to being interviewed. Until this year, smoking had never dropped below  the 30% mark. Last year 32% identified themselves as smokers. However, the  trend toward lower rates of consumption -- that is, the tendency of smokers to  consume fewer cigarettes per day -- appears to have halted. Between 1977 and  1987, the proportion smoking more than one pack of cigarettes a day fell from  27% to 18%, while those reporting consumption of less than a pack edged upward,  from 38% to 48%. Currently, 39% say they smoke less than a pack; another 39%,  one pack; and 20% more than a pack, almost identical to the figures reported in  last year's poll. The results are based on telephone interviews with a randomly  selected national sample of 1,250 adults conducted May 15-18.  </P></p>

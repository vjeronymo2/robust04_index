			<p><P> March 30, 1990, Friday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA DELAYS HIRING OF NEW CITY MANAGER  </P> <P> After two closed-door sessions, the Pasadena Board of Directors agreed Thursday  to delay hiring a new city manager to allow more time to review each of the  three candidates.  </P> <P> Mayor William E. Thomson Jr. said members of the board, which is equivalent to  a city council, put off the decision so they can visit the cities where each of  the applicants is currently working.  </P> <P> "The board did not make a decision and will continue deliberations to permit  additional careful and thorough consideration to each of the three candidates,"  Thomson said.  </P> <P> The board voted to meet in two weeks to make a final decision on the  candidates: Larry Moore of Richmond, Calif.; Jack Bond of Durham, N.C., and  Philip Hawkey of Toledo, Ohio.  </P> <P> The new city manager will succeed City Manager Donald McIntire, who is retiring  after 17 years.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Tiffany Brown] </F>   [Text] Beijing, June 16 (AFP)--China underlined Thursday  its commitment to protecting its fledgling car industry from  foreign competition, issuing a policy paper blocking overseas  investment in assembly plants until 1996.    "Under the industrial policy, until the end of 1995, no  projects domestic or foreign involving the making of whole cars  will be approved," while restrictions on imports will continue,  the vice minister of the State Planning Commission, Ye Qing,  told reporters.    Foreign companies will instead be encouraged to invest in  factories producing components and spare parts to promote the  backward sector's technological upgrading, Ye quoted the  Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry, issued by the  State Council, as stipulating.    "We welcome extensive cooperation with foreign partners in  the sphere of component parts," the official said, revealing  that any companies involved in successful projects in this  sphere would be given priority when China freed up restrictions  on assembly plants after 1996.    The extent of such liberalisation would depend on China's  economic development and the market demand for family cars at  that time, he said, defending the moves by saying the domestic  industry remained in its "infant stage" despite 30 years of  development.    The new policy also outlines moves to rationalise and  upgrade  technological levels in the sector, while encouraging  localisation of component purchasing by offering preferential  treatment to factories buying more than 60 percent of their  parts domestically within three years, Ye said.    Rationalisation is to focus on restructuring the country's  120 scattered, small-scale car plants into bigger groups  producing better quality vehicles, of which most are to be  family cars, he said.    The country's 1.18 billion people now own only 8.3 million  cars, with family vehicles accounting for only small proportion  of China's auto output of 1.18 million units last year.    "By 1996, we will satisfy 90 percent of the domestic market  demand and over half of auto output will be cars," he said.    By 2000, basic restructuring of plants into "three big and  three small" conglomerates would be complete, with the three  major groups "accounting for the majority of sales on China's  domestic market," he said.    Ye said the three groups -- which reports say are to produce  five million cars by 2000 -- would be centred around plants in  northeastern Changchun, Shanghai and central Wuhan that have  joint ventures with Germany's Volkswagen-Audi, Volkswagen and  France's Citroen respectively.    Although he did not explain how the restructuring would  affect other existing foreign-funded car assembly projects in  China, foreign carmakers here played down the implications of  the policy paper.    Most major international players are already manufacturing  cars here, they said, adding they were now stepping up  involvement in projects making components and establishing links  with key members of the "big three" to ensure their position in  China after 1996.    Of greater concern to foreign manufacturers are the  continuing restrictions on imports. Foreign cars now face  import tariffs of 150 percent.    The Industrial Policy for the Automobile Industry was the  first of a series of specific policy statement due to be issued  under the Framework of National Industrial Policy for the 1990s,  also released by the State Council recently.    Other policy papers are to include such sectors as  transportation, telecommunications, construction, electronics  and machinery, petrochemical, foreign trade, foreign investment  and technology, Ye said.</p>

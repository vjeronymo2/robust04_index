			<p><P> December 30, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> COLUMBO PRO AND CON  </P> <P> "Columbo" has an unquestionably winsome main character, to which Peter Falk  still contributes his unquestionably charismatic star. Also unquestionably, the  series' plots are so contrived you wonder about Columbo's true sleuthing  abilities.  </P> <P> Columbo is always aided in his investigating by an army of imbecilic murderers  who ignore, inadvertently drop or otherwise flaunt evidence of their doings  throughout each show (case in point, "Columbo Goes to College," ABC, Dec. 9).  Considering the extraordinary amount of planning that goes into the murders,  the ensuing stupidity of the perpetrators is simply perplexing. Or is it?  </P> <P> Columbo is hailed by it creators and the press as one of the world's great  detectives (he even gets the TV Times cover). The truth is, the series is just  another average attempt by television to make its audience feel superior to the  characters in a show. Given questionable cleverness of both killers and  detective, figure out what they're implying about the audience.  </P> <P> Valentina Verdugo, Los Angeles  </P></p>

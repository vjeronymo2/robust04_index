			<p><P> November 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHULLER'S NEW CENTER FAULTED FOR ITS SECULAR LOOK;  </P> <P> ARCHITECTURE: SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL'S $25-MILLION LATEST  ADDITION DOES NOT LOOK RELIGIOUS ENOUGH.  </P> <P> The Rev. Robert Schuller is just weeks away from unveiling another building in  his Crystal Cathedral complex -- the four-story Family Life Center. A  ribbon-cutting ceremony was held there on Thanksgiving.  </P> <P> But, already, the $25-million structure has been disparaged by some  architectural analysts as not looking religious enough.  </P> <P> "It looks like every standard office building seen in the suburbs," said Robert  A. Benson, associate professor of architecture at Miami University of Ohio.  </P> <P> Only when construction is completed next year on a $5.5-million Prayer Spire at  the Garden Grove church, said Benson, will the complex be "pushed back into the  sphere of religion" architecturally.  </P> <P> Prayer Spire  </P> <P> Ground was broken two months ago for the 234-foot-high Prayer Spire, designed  by noted architect Philip Johnson. Johnson also created the Crystal Cathedral,  which some critics suggest looks more like a modern corporate headquarters than  a place of worship because of its reflecting glass exterior.  </P> <P> Schuller's impact on American religious culture came under the gaze of Benson  and other scholars at the American Academy of Religion's annual meeting in  Anaheim early this week. The author of numerous books that reflect his  unconventional "theology of self-esteem," Schuller and his Sunday services are  seen by millions on his weekly television program.  </P> <P> In an interview this week, he agreed with the architectural critique.  </P> <P> The multipurpose Family Life Center intentionally was designed to resemble an  office building so that it could be leased as such in the future if the church  ever needs money, Schuller said. When the building initially is opened in  January, it will house a gymnasium and the offices for Schuller's television  program.  </P> <P> Well before the $20-million Crystal Cathedral was completed in 1980, Schuller  said he talked with Johnson "about some kind of statement that could be part of  the cathedral, that would mark it as a gathering place for the people of God."  </P> <P> Schuller conceded that "the cathedral doesn't say from the outside what it is;  it is incomplete without the spire. . . . We couldn't afford it at the time."  </P> <P> The spire will house a 52-bell carillon and a chapel for which $1 million has  already been donated. Narrow columns of polished stainless steel will cover the  exterior.  </P> <P> 'Art-Deco Zigzag'  </P> <P> Looking at architectural renderings of the steeple this week during a tour of  the church, architectural historian Richard Guy Wilson of the University of  Virginia, called the design "Art-Deco zigzag" referring to a design of the  1920s.  </P> <P> Wilson also said that except for the cross atop the church's multistory Tower  of Hope offices, nothing on the grounds visible from a distance identifies the  complex as a religious center.  </P> <P> Schuller founded the congregation in 1955, preaching to a small group at a  drive-in theater. He later pioneered the drive-in church concept, and still  addresses churchgoers both sitting inside the Crystal Cathedral and outside in  their cars listening to the service on a short-range radio band. Two 90-foot  doors on one side of the church open to expose the pulpit section to the  parking area.  </P> <P> More than one scholar who toured the church and attended a service last Sunday  said he was disappointed that Schuller did not mention the slayings of six  Jesuit priests in El Salvador last week.  </P> <P> "The killings were horrible," Schuller said in an interview. "I probably should  have said something but I had so much on my mind about what I had to cover in  60 minutes," he said. At the same time, he added, "my messages go out to a  television audience that hears it three weeks later. I cannot 'date' my  message."  </P> <P> Cost Questioned  </P> <P> A recurring criticism over the millions spent on buildings was raised by Steve  Shoemaker of the University of Illinois. Shoemaker said he went on two tours  Sunday -- one at the Crystal Cathedral and one of downtown Los Angeles to view  the plight of the homeless.  </P> <P> "I just wished the priorities were different," Shoemaker said, referring to the  $25-million cost of the new Family Life Center.  </P> <P> Schuller's response was that "an awful lot of (workers) have money this week  because of the job opportunities at this building project, some of them from El  Salvador."  </P> <P> Schuller claimed that the structure will open debt-free, explaining that the  last payment of $2.8 million, due Jan. 31, will be covered by $3.5 million in  outstanding pledges.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, last Sunday from the pulpit and through a full-color brochure,  the pastor urged his congregation to increase their contributions 25% during  1990 because of the added costs of maintaining the building.  </P> <P> Schuller said he draws an average of 6,000 people to his three Sunday services  each week.  </P></p>

			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOUSE PANEL LOOKS FOR INSIDE TRADING BY AMWAY OFFICIALS  </P> <P> The House Energy and Commerce Committee said Friday that it is investigating  allegations of insider stock trading by officials of Amway Corp. before the  company offered to buy Avon Products Inc.  </P> <P> In a letter, Rep. John Dingell (D-Mich.) asked David S. Ruder, chairman of the  Securities and Exchange Commission, to open his own probe of the allegations.  Ruder said in New York that the SEC planned to investigate as it does whenever  it receives such allegations.  </P> <P> Amway, a door-to-door sales business headquartered in Ada, Mich., on May 10  offered $39 a share in a takeover bid for its larger rival, Avon. Amway  withdrew its $2.1-billion offer Wednesday, and in an SEC filing made public  Friday indicated that it did not plan to make a tender offer or any other new  bid.  </P> <P> Dingell's committee released a memorandum it had received from an unspecified  source alleging that Otto Stolz, Amway's executive vice president, and William  Nicholson, Amway's chief operating officer, apparently intended to profit  personally when they purchased Avon stock in late March and early April before  the takeover bid was announced.  </P> <P> The memorandum said Irwin L. Jacobs, a Minneapolis investor and a partner of  Amway, also purchased stock before the takeover announcement. Jacobs, the  memorandum said, was being paid out of profits from trading in Avon stock  before the takeover announcement.  </P> <P> Federal law forbids trading securities based on information not available to  the general public. Avon stock rose more than $2 per share immediately after  the takeover bid was announced.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Part of 'Smear Campaign'  </P> <P> Nicholson said the shares were assigned to the partnership with Jacobs at cost,  the transactions were reported to the SEC, and there was no personal profit  involved.  </P> <P> "This is the standard part of the smear campaign of Avon and its advisers to  divert attention from their own performance or problems," Nicholson said.  </P> <P> Avon said no one was available to comment on Nicholson's assertion.  </P> <P> Jacobs said the allegations were "preposterous, plain and simple."  </P> <P> "It is strictly politically motivated. We welcome any government agency that  wishes to look into this thing. Our books are wide open to them," he said.  </P> <P> A spokesman for the House committee, Dennis Fitzgibbons, declined to discuss  the source of the memorandum.  </P> <P> "The allegations are sufficiently serious that the chairman had to ask Ruder  and the commission to look at them," Fitzgibbons said.  </P> <P> The memorandum said Stolz purchased 10,000 Avon shares on March 23 and 6,600  shares on March 27, at a value of $356,000.  </P> <P> Nicholson, the memo said, on April 5 purchased options to buy 40,000 Avon  shares at $25 per share, with the options costing $70,400.  </P> <P> Meanwhile, investors continued to unload Avon shares Friday, although the  selloff seemed to be subsiding. Avon stock closed at $32.25 a share, off 75  cents, in composite New York Stock Exchange trading.  </P> <P> Avon stock had reached a 52-week high of $41.25 earlier in the week amid  speculation Amway might raise its offer or another, more generous bidder might  emerge. But after Amway withdrew its takeover proposal Wednesday night, Avon  shares plunged $7.125 on Thursday.  </P> <P> Takeover-stock speculators were nursing heavy losses on Avon shares, and  several of them directed pointed questions at Avon executives during a meeting  with financial analysts in New York on Friday.  </P> <P> At that meeting, Avon Chairman James Preston predicted that the company will  sharply increase its profits. Company executives projected that earnings would  grow from last year's $1.70 a share to about $5 a share by 1992, principally  through cost reductions and beefed up direct sales revenues in the United  States.  </P> <P> "We're going with the businesses we've got," Preston said. "There will be no  acquisitions, start-ups or divestitures."  </P> <P> Avon said it would focus on selling to its "core" customers -- principally  homemakers with a median income of $21,000 -- and work to serve them better  through the elimination of distribution inefficiencies and improved marketing.  </P></p>

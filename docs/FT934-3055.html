			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Personal View: More jobs, the same interest rates European governments can stimulate demand and increase employment even if German interest rates remain high. Any country can increase spending on business equipment and construction without reducing interest rates and therefore without the possible inflationary consequences of currency devaluation that might accompany lower interest rates. Moreover, such a stimulus need not increase the budget deficit and national debt. The key to stimulating capital investment is an investment tax credit (ITC) financed by higher taxes on business profits. An ITC is easy to implement and is effective as a stimulus to investment. The US has used an ITC to stimulate investment on several occasions and a substantial amount of research has shown it to be quite effective. The simplest form of ITC reduces a business's tax liability by a percentage of the firm's spending on eligible investment. For example, with a 10 per cent investment tax credit a company that spends FFr1m on eligible investment reduces its tax obligation by FFr100,000. Eligible investment could be defined narrowly (eg, restricting it to equipment) or broadly (including all construction). Taken by itself, an ITC would reduce the government's tax revenue and increase the budget deficit. But it could be financed by a higher tax on business profits without reducing its effectiveness. Although a typical business might pay the same total tax as it would without the ITC, the shift in the structure of the tax system would provide a strong incentive to spend more on new investment. The increased corporate tax is essentially a tax on profits of prior investments while the ITC is a subsidy for new investment. Indeed, an ITC's impact on a company's incentive to invest is very similar to the effect of lower interest rates. Either change makes prospective investments more profitable: the ITC reduces the initial cost of the investment, and the lower interest rates reduce the annual cost of servicing the debt. The ITC rate could be set to provide the same effect on the profitability of investments as an interest rate reduction of, say, 2 percentage points. By using an ITC, each government can tailor its policy of stimulating interest-sensitive spending to its own domestic circumstances. The acrimonious debates about easing German monetary policy in order to serve the needs of other European countries would become unnecessary. Because of reunification, the German situation is different from the situation in other countries. Even if it were not, German citizens and the Bundesbank are entitled to pursue a more vigorous anti-inflation policy than others if that is what they want to do. I have emphasised the feasibility of substituting an ITC for a reduction of interest rates because of the manifest distaste of several European governments for lowering interest rates and for the accompanying decline in the currency value. But such a substitution is not satisfactory when the country has a trade deficit as well as a demand deficiency at home. When the country's external account is in balance, though, an ITC has the advantage of providing a domestic stimulus without weakening the demand of foreign countries and without imposing a trade deficit on the country's trading partners. One technical point should be noted. An ITC, like any fiscal stimulus, will only be effective if it is not offset by higher interest rates and an associated currency appreciation. A country that adopts an ITC should therefore adjust its monetary policy to maintain unchanged short-term interest rates. There is finally the more fundamental question of whether European governments should try to deal with the unemployment problem by increasing demand. It seems clear that most of the dramatic rise in European unemployment rates over the past two decades cannot be attributed to a lack of demand. Reducing that unemployment requires greater flexibility in the level and structure of employee compensation. Any attempt to reduce the unemployment rate by demand stimulus alone would lead to an explosive increase in wages. Nevertheless, some stimulus to demand may be warranted. Countries differ and the amount of stimulus that is right for one may not be right for another. To the extent that increasing aggregate demand is warranted, an investment tax credit financed by an increase in other taxes can be a desirable alternative to a reduction in interest rates.

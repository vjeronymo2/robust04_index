			<p>921103 FT  03 NOV 92 / International Company News: Norwegian radiology group rises 25% HAFSLUND NYCOMED, the Norwegian group which makes radiology products, yesterday reported a 25 per cent increase in nine-month pre-tax profit to NKr1.12bn (Dollars 195m). Group operating revenue rose by NKr271m to NKr4.25bn, as operating profit - before research and development expenses - increased by NKr181m to NKr1.72bn. Research and development expenses fell to NKr119m from NKr155m in the third quarter, but Hafslund warned that for the fourth quarter they were likely to be significantly higher. Hafslund reported a fall in financial expenses to NKr138m for the nine months from NKr257m a year ago as net interest expenses declined to NKr75m from NKr179m. However, the group was forced to write down the value of its bond portfolio by NKr36m because of a third-quarter interest rate increase.</p>

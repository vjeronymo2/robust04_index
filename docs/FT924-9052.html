			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / International Company News: GM plans to allow some workers to retire at 50 GENERAL Motors, which is in the throes of a major job and cost-cutting programme, is offering early retirement incentives to North American salaried employees, giving some workers the option of retiring at 50, 15 years ahead of the normal GM retirement age. The company is also believed to be working on plans for a job buy-out programme covering hourly paid workers. This week's package, which was unveiled to employees on Thursday, is the second salaried employee buy-out programme this year. The first, which was in place until June, cut the retirement age to 53 and was so popular that GM was able to shift its goal of cutting 20,000 salaried jobs forward from the end of 1994 to the end of 1993. The latest move lowers the retirement age in overstaffed units to 50 and in areas that are not overstaffed to 52, provided that the individuals concerned have 10 years of service with the company. GM declined to say how many workers were covered by the programme. It employs some 81,000 salaried staff in North America, down from around 91,000 at the end of last year. The company's new top management team, which was named earlier this week following the forced resignation of Mr Robert Stempel, GM's chairman, is due to make an important strategy presentation to Wall Street analysts next Thursday.</p>

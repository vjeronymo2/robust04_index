			<p><!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The second requirement for an Exchange to be deemed a ``qualified options exchange'' pursuant to the NASD's rules is that the exchange have procedures providing for the surveillance of its market makers' use of the market maker exemption set forth in NASD Rules, Article III, Section 48(h)(1). The purpose of such procedures is to ensure that short sales effected by qualified options market makers are exempt hedge transactions and that other non-qualified market makers are not using the exemption. The Commission is satisfied that the Exchanges have provided for the implementation of such procedures to become effective with the implementation of the NASD's bid test rule. These procedures are intended to monitor market maker use of the market maker exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, each Exchange, in its respective proposal, has stated that if it determines that a qualified options market maker has failed to comply with the terms of the exemption, the Exchange may withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker based upon the Exchange's determination of the substantial, willful, or continuing nature of the violation. <FOOTCITE>43</FOOTCITE>  The purpose of this provision is to satisfy the third NASD requirement for an exchange to be deemed a qualified options exchange. That requirement states that an exchange must have rules and procedures authorizing the NASD to withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker if the qualified options exchange has determined that the qualified options market maker has failed to comply with the terms of the market maker exemption, and that such a withdrawal, suspension, or modification of the market maker's exemption is warranted in light of the substantial, willful, or continuing nature of the violation. <FOOTCITE>44</FOOTCITE>  The Commission also notes that because each Exchange proposal contains a commitment to notify the NASD of such a determination, the Exchanges have provided the NASD with the means to withdraw, suspend, or modify the designation of a qualified options market maker insofar as Nasdaq NM securities are involved. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 43 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34049, supra note 11, and File Nos. SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;21, SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;22, SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;16, and SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;09.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 44 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Moreover, the CBOE, in its proposal, provides that it will not be deemed a violation of the proposed rule when a member designates a short sale as bid test exempt where the member does not know or have reason to know that the criteria for designating such a sale as bid test exempt are not satisfied. See CBOE Proposed Rule 15.10(e). With the exception of the NYSE, the other exchanges have very similar provisions. See Phlx Proposed Rule 1072(e); Amex Proposed Rule 957(d)(4); and PSE Proposed Rule 4.19(e).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission approved the NASD's short sale rule on an eighteen month temporary basis, effective September 6, 1994, through March 5, 1996. <FOOTCITE>45</FOOTCITE>  In doing so, the Commission stated that questions remain whether the market maker exemption from the short sale rule is appropriate on an ongoing basis. The Commission noted that specialists and other market makers do not enjoy similar exemptions from the Commission's short sale rule for listed securities under Rule 10a&hyph;1 under the Exchange Act. Consequently, the Exchanges' proposals are approved on a temporary basis, to remain in effect so long as there exists a market maker exemption to the NASD's short sale rule. <FOOTCITE>46</FOOTCITE>   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 45 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34277, supra note 5.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 46 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> If the NASD later amends its short sale rule in a manner that affects the market maker exemption, including its definition, conditions, and requirements, the Exchanges might be required to amend their respective companion market maker exemption rules so that the Exchanges' members may avail themselves of any continued market maker exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> During the eighteen-month temporary approval period for the NASD's bid test rule, the Commission expects the Exchanges to gather data on the operation and effectiveness of the rules and procedures relating to the market maker exemption. In particular, the Exchanges should focus on: gathering data regarding the number of market makers using the market maker exemption, and the frequency with which they use it; the sufficiency of the surveillance procedures; difficulties in administering the market maker exemption and the accompanying surveillance procedures; and the nature of any violations of the market maker exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Commission finds good cause for approving File Nos. SR&hyph;Phlx&hyph;94&hyph;09, and Amendment Nos. 1 and 2 thereto; SR&hyph;Amex&hyph;94&hyph;21, and Amendment No. 1, thereto; SR&hyph;PSE&hyph;94&hyph;16, and Amendment No. 1 thereto; and SR&hyph;NYSE&hyph;94&hyph;22 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Each of the Exchanges' proposed rule changes and amendments is consistent with the CBOE's proposal, notice of which was published on May 18, 1994, <FOOTCITE>47</FOOTCITE>  and contain only minor variations from the CBOE proposal. As a result, the Commission believes that good cause exists for approving the foregoing rule proposals and amendments on an accelerated basis given that the implementation date of the NASD bid test rule is September 6, 1994.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 47 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34049, supra note 11.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> IV.

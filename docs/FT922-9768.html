			<p>920506 FT  06 MAY 92 / International Company News: STET profits climb 3.4% NET profits at STET, the holding company for Italy's state-owned telecommunications interests, increased by 3.4 per cent last year to L1,413bn (Dollars 1.14bn). Group sales rose by 15 per cent to L22,946bn thanks to continuing improvements at most subsidiaries. Among the companies STET controls are SIP, Italy's main telephone utility, and Italcable, which handles most international telephone traffic. The group is paying an unchanged dividend of L100 for ordinary shares and L120 for savings shares. STET's good results may have helped to arrest the apparent free fall in its share price following the announcement late last week that IRI, the state holding company which controls the group, was planning to dilute its stake. The secondary sale of stock could raise up to L1,800bn. Shares in STET staged a mixed recovery yesterday, with ordinary stock rising by L28 to L1,927, while savings shares fell by L25 to L1,745. STET has signed an agreement with Bell Atlantic of the US to set up a joint venture in Italy to develop software for telecommunications for both companies.</p>

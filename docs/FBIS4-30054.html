			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Chon Yong-taek, full-time member of the </F> National Security Council and chairman of the Emergency Planning  Committee, by Kim Tang; place and date not given -- first  paragraph is SISA JOURNAL's introduction]    [Text] The National Security Council, the Emergency  Planning Committee, and the Chungmu Program are all unfamiliar  organizations and terminologies. Chairman Chon Yong-taek (57)  is a minister-level high-ranking figure serving as a full-time  member of the National Security Council, which is a  constitutional institution advising the president, and as  chairman of the Emergency Planning Committee assisting the prime  minister. Regardless of his position, he is an unfamiliar  figure to the people. Nevertheless, since the North Korean  nuclear crisis has been thrown into taking sanctions against the  North by the ROK, the United States, and Japan, thus heightening  a tense situation on the Korean peninsula, the people are under  a situation in which they must familiarize themselves with the  Chungmu Program of which Chairman Chon is in charge. At the  crossroads of peacetime and wartime, the following is an  interview with Chairman Chon on diagnosing the current situation  and taking a posture of preparedness.    [Kim Tang] The holding of the National Security Council  meeting, the first one since the new government set sail,  attracted an extraordinarily amount of attention. Is the current  situation such as to convene a national security meeting?    [Chon Yong-taek] The government had held security related  ministerial meetings, high-ranking strategic meetings, and  reunification and security policy coordination meetings in the  past to take measures regarding the North Korean nuclear issue.  However, since the National Security Council meeting--a  constitutional institution--was held officially for the first  time, people are apt to feel that there is a serious critical  situation. Before the Fifth Republic set sail, the National  Security Council meeting was held regularly every quarter.  However, it was held once or twice annually after the Sixth  Republic was launched. This must have given a sense of tension  to the people. The meeting was not convened because there was a  critical emergency situation.    [Kim] In the operational regulations of the National  Security  Council it is stipulated that except for an "emergency matter,"  the agenda to be discussed must be presented seven days in  advance and distributed five days before. If it is not an  emergency matter, why was this normal operational regulation  avoided?    [Chon] The president decided to hold such a meeting when he  was in Uzbekistan. An atmosphere was created to fully discuss  the issue of taking sanctions against the North by the United  Nations when the president was on a visit to Russia. Also, the  National Security Council meeting convened because the president  judged, after holding a telephone conversation with President  Clinton, that it was necessary to give North Korea a firm  message. Formally it was regarded as an emergency matter  because of the pressing time, but it was not carried out  urgently because the content of an emergency agenda had to be  discussed. It only seemed an emergency matter because of the  limitations in time and venue.    [Kim] How was the atmosphere of the meeting?    [Chon] On the one hand, participants of the meeting were  disappointed because the North Korean nuclear issue has led to  taking sanctions against the North, and on the other hand, it  was an atmosphere of communion of minds in that the government  must deal with this matter resolutely and with confidence. The  president revealed that he will convey his firm will and message  to the people and the North Korean regime. It was an opportunity  for the officials who attended the meeting, who are to draft and  execute the state's policy, to examine that they will deal with  the situation, even it turns to the worst, with resolute  confidence.    [Kim] Were there any matters for resolution?    [Chon] It is not a time to make it public at this time and  also it is not a matter to make it public.    [Kim] My question is not what matters were resolved but  whether matters were discussed.    [Chon] That is also a secret. There are two functions in  the National Security Council meeting. The first function is a  resolution function, to establish a policy guideline through  discussions by the members to establish foreign, military, and  domestic policies related to securing national security. The  second function is a reporting function, to analyze and assess a  situation. The recently held meeting had a stronger reporting  function.    [Kim] What was the content of your report?    [Chon] I cannot give you any details. I just gave a report  on "the state's mobilization preparedness if UN sanctions are  taken against the North," which the Emergency Planning Committee  is in charge of. What I would like to emphasize is that going  into a phase of sanctions does not mean that we are going to  have a war. What I mean is that we must persuade the North  Korean authorities even through forcible means. I made a report  on the government's posture for preparedness if we go into an  emergency situation and on taking measures for a possible  provocation from North Korea which may be expected during the  period of sanctions, if things do not go well.    [Kim] You are the chairman of the government's Emergency  Planning Committee and a full-member of the National Security  Council. What is the function of the Emergency Planning  Committee?    [Chon] The three main roles of the Emergency Planning  Committee are maintaining the government's function; assisting  military operations; and stability of the people's livelihood.  In other words, first the government organization must be  changed into a war structure so that the government's functions  can be carried out as in normal time; second, the government  must mobilize all the resources for carrying out war to assist  the military; and third is stabilization of the people's  livelihood. This is to assist and manage work so that the  people can maintain a stable life even during war. For example,  it will supply necessities of life and when there are acts of  buying up and hoarding goods, it will control circulation and  price as the time demands. Also, it may carry out ration  systems to stabilize the people's livelihood. These functions  will be carried out through the Chungmu Program, the state's  emergency plan in case of wartime, which the Emergency Planning  Committee is in charge of.    [Kim] This state structure, which carries out an important  role, is not stipulated in the National Government Organization  Act.    [Chon] The basis for establishing the Emergency Planning  Committee is clearly stated in the law on managing resources for  emergency set up in 1984.    [Kim] It seems that most of the people do not know the  content of that law or that there is even that kind of law. For  example, most of the adults are targets of the law on managing  resources (human resources), and is the press not also a target  to be managed?    [Chon] Yes. Since South-North confrontation was a  confrontation of ideology and system, cooperation from the press  is absolute in all-out national efforts. Therefore, we have  sent an emergency plan to press the organs and designated the  organs to be mobilized during peacetime in preparation for an  emergency.    [Kim] Under the law of managing resources, what was  presented in detail as an emergency situation?    [Chon] It differs according to the signs or magnitude of a  war or a crisis that can threaten the nation's security.    [Kim] Does it mean that it is carried out step by step just  like the ROK-U.S. Combined Forces Command's operational plan,  the OPLAN 5027?    [Chon] Yes. Regarding an emergency situation, the  government judges that it is inevitable to have a close  connection with the military's preparedness. If the military  enhances the posture of preparedness, the Chungmu Program will  be geared gradually. However, when the final proclamation on  order of mobilization in wartime is made or when an emergency  situation occurs, the military will explain the situation, but  the government will make decisions through a cabinet meeting on  a step-by-step basis.    [Kim] If the Chungmu program had been a preparation for  North Korea's southward invasion in the past, should the current  program have not included measures for a sudden collapse in  North Korea, for instance, a refugee plan?    [Chon] A war always comes with refugees. Plans for  sheltering and relieving refugees are one of the functions of  stabilizing the people's livelihood. The Chungmu program is a  wartime plan and does not include plans for such a sudden and  special situation.    [Kim] Then, do you mean that the Chungmu program is only  related with the OPLAN?    [Chon] They are certainly related. One of the three major  functions of the Emergency Planning Committee is to support  military operations. However, the core of the Chungmu program  is to maintain government functions. If the government stops  functioning, there will be no military operations or  stabilization of the people's livelihood. Therefore, the  Chungmu program is not for military operations alone.    [Kim] The Emergency Planning Committee would need actual or  map exercises. What kinds of exercises are conducted by the  Emergency Planning Committee?    [Chon] The Ulchi exercise is the typical one. It is  basically a map exercise of the three major functions that I  just have mentioned in a simulated war situation. Sometimes,  actual exercises are conducted for those fields that require  special evaluation and checking of the plan's actual efficiency.    [Kim] Ulchi and Focus Lens exercises will be combined  beginning this August.    [Chon] Yes. However, it is a methodological decision aimed  at maximizing the effect of the exercise. It has no other  objectives or messages. The Focus Lens is purely a military  exercise. Because the military exercise cannot be separated  from the Chungmu program, only the inter-government training  part of the Ulchi-Focus Lens exercise is controlled by the  Emergency Planning Committee and the military part of the  exercise is controlled by the commander of the ROK-U.S. Combined  Forces Command. In principle, the prime minister takes overall  responsibility but the military exercise is commissioned to the  commander of the Combined Forces Command and the  inter-government training is controlled by the prime minister  through me, the umpire. The prime minister is the general  supervisor [chonggam] and I am the chief of the central control  group [chungang tongje tanjang].    [Kim] At the National Assembly Defense Committee on 9 June,  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae expressed his confidence in the  preparedness for an all-out war. Do you think it is possible  that North Korea would start a war?    [Chon] I believe there is little possibility that North  Korea  would start a war judging from the objective conditions after  the collapse of the Cold War system. However, as everyone  knows, North Korea adopted four major military lines from 1964  and has invested 20 to 24 percent of the gross national product  in defense to prepare for a war. In addition, North Korea has  repeated irrational acts, including the Panmunjom ax incident,  terror at Aung San Memorial Hall in Burma, and the bombing of a  Korean Air plane. Thus, we cannot say that there is no  possibility that North Korea would start a war by objective  conditions or classical strategic theories. I would like to  emphasize that it is not important whether or not a war would  breaks out, what is important is that we are fully prepared so  that the enemy cannot attack us.    [Kim] If UN sanctions are implemented and are to reap  fruits to some extent, we have no choice but to employ  semi-military means, such as a naval blockade. But by driving  North Korea to a dead end in such a way, does it not give North  Korea a justification to evoke a provocation, such as violating  the Armistice Agreement? Would this not happen if North Korea is  pushed to a dead end?    [Chon] The media have been reporting on various scenarios,  however, they are only scenarios and have no credibility at all.  The present stage is a stage of mapping out international  sanctions and I do not even know in what form and order  sanctions would be taken. No decisive methods and procedures  have been chosen. And even if the situation enters a phase of  sanctions, the government cannot spell out the worst-case  scenario beforehand and disclose to the media its measures  against such a scenario. This is because the government would  impose sanctions with an upbeat view that North Korea would  change its stance during the period in which sanctions are  imposed against it. Of course, the government is fully prepared  with various measures since North Korea is expected to resist in  any way in case sanctions are invoked. This is also an  assumption.    [Kim] The media recently quoted the TIME's report on  pessimistic and optimistic views over the result of a war game.  Do such scenarios have credibility?    [Chon] A game is only a game. I do not know whether the war  game coincides with reality or not, however, there can be some  assumptions in this. The first assumption is that North Korea  would succeed in a surprise attack. There is no strong man who  can counter a surprise attack. No matter how formidable the  Army may be, it can fall victim of a surprise attack. With such  an assumption, defense difficulties follow in the war game.  Such being the case, it is very important to know whether such  an assumption is rational. Another tragic scenario is that the  North Korean Army's vehicles, cannons, and tanks invade the ROK  through underground tunnels. No one can absolutely deny such a  possibility. It is even more impracticable to assert the real  possibility of an underground invasion like that. In fact,  underground tunnels are very fragile. When an exit is uncovered,  everyone inside the tunnel is doomed to die. This kind of an  imprudent war cannot be unleashed. Accordingly, it is important  to know whether the assumption is rational and realistic. Defeat  in a war game takes place because a computer was set up to be  defeated. For example, the enemy's large-scale mechanized unit  is inputted into a computer on the assumption that the enemy  makes a surprise attack into Munsan and Chorwon as an axis.    [Kim] However, a vague psychological fear prevails in our  society.    [Chon] Our basic strategy is the ROK-U.S. joint deterrence  strategy. In other words, it is a strategy aimed at deterring a  war on the Korean peninsula. We are heightening military  preparedness not for victory but for the deterrence of a war.  The strategic concept of the ROK Force is "the metropolitan  area equals the ROK." Fifty percent of our country's national  assets and 45 percent of the population are concentrated on the  metropolitan area. Our strategy on defending the metropolitan  area is firm and the Chungmu program has also been supplemented  and developed over a long time. Moreover, the defense capability  of ROK-U.S. Joint Forces is formidable. Even if the enemy  evokes a provocation, there is no need to worry about the combat  capability in the front line. When the rear is well prepared  against the intrusion of the enemy's special unit, a worrisome  situation will never arise.    [Kim] What kind of determination or preparedness should our  people have at the present stage?    [Chon] As you are well aware of, a country such as  Switzerland is perfectly prepared against contingencies even  though it has no threat from outside. In Switzerland, every  work place is equipped with a protection facility and every  household has an underground protection facility prepared  against chemical, biological, and radiological warfare and is  also equipped with enough emergency food and medicines to last  for over six months. Its reserve forces, whose houses are armed  with individual firearms, have preparedness in which they can be  mobilized within 48 hours in more than 48 divisions. Maybe that  might be the reason Switzerland is enjoying the best quality of  life in the world. What is important for us is not whether a  war arises or not but having a determination and preparedness in  times of peace.</p>

			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Cookery: Summer treats Is it really June? Given the treacherous nature of the weather, wise cooks will hedge their bets by choosing foods that can be served hot or cold equally well. Asparagus, which should be at its best just now, is a prime candidate. It is quick to cook and can be served straight from the pan, sauced with hot, melted butter to hearten the chilly. More adventurously, asparagus stalks can be grilled or roasted and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds or grated Parmesan. If the temperature soars, cool the stalks briefly after cooking and dress them lightly with a fresh herb vinaigrette instead, or with a parsley and coriander pesto that has been diluted seriously. Shrimps and prawns with their summery, seaside connotations are also adept at beating the weather. Freshly-boiled little brown shrimps are best for flavour - or is nostalgic memory playing me false? Easier to track down than fresh shrimps are Baxter's potted variety (to order direct, tel: 0524-410910). A few tubs stashed in the freezer bring enormous reassurance. Serve the classic way, with wedges of lemon and lots of toast. I also like to spoon a few potted shrimps into the bottom of ramekins for oeufs en cocottes a la creme; or to stir them into a delicate cream and fish stock bechamel for a satisfyingly simple shrimp sauce to spoon over fillets of sole or turbot. Large cold-water prawns and the tails of Dublin Bay prawns are easier to buy raw than they were. Like potted shrimps, they are useful to keep in the freezer. Defrosted, painted with oil and seasoned with sea salt and black pepper, they take hardly any time to sizzle on a griddle or to stir-fry. When the shells have turned from blue-grey to pink and the air is tinged with an agreeable whiff of the sea, add a little chopped garlic, ginger and spring onions for an oriental finishing touch; or lime and chillies for a Mexican slant; or a handful of basil or a few seeds of fennel and coriander for a Mediterranean flavour. Serve the prawns hot in a nest of noodles or rice, with the pan juices poured over, or serve them just as they are with plenty of good bread to mop up the juices. If the weather plays fair, let the cooked prawns become cold and serve them on a suitable salad bed with a sesame sauce for dipping; or a spicy tomato and green coriander salsa; or a bowl of saffron-flavoured mayonnaise. Uncurling the flesh from the shells is messy but fun, appealing to primitive picnicker instincts, and sucking the shells at the end is the best part of all, for the shell is where the sweetest flavour lies. Finger bowls and large mini tablecloth sized napkins are advisable. Here is a good way to serve prawns and asparagus in tandem: ASPARAGUS RICE WITH PRAWNS (serves 6) I have written this recipe for serving hot. But for hot-weather eating, the dish can be served cold equally well. In that case, though, I suggest using olive oil rather than butter to anoint the rice. And instead of Hollandaise or Bearnaise sauce to partner the dish, I would hand round a bowl of tarragon-flavoured mayonnaise thinned to the consistency of pouring cream by beating in yoghurt, fromage frais or soured cream. Another good - and less rich - sauce is a fresh tomato coulis. Ingredients:  3/4 lb basmati rice; 1 1/2 lb asparagus; 2 to 3 dozen raw tails of Dublin Bay prawns; 5 to 6 inches of cucumber; a little butter; a large pinch of sugar; a splash of tarragon vinegar; 1 or 2 tablespoons of olive oil; half a lemon. A 3pt ring mould is needed for this recipe. The rice is moulded in it and used as a 'vase' to contain a king-size bunch of short lengths of asparagus. Method: Scrape or peel the asparagus stalks, discarding the woody bases of the stems. Then cut the stems down to a length suitable for standing upright in the middle of the ring of rice, and chop the trimmings into pea-size pieces. These tender trimmings can be used to stud the rice and flavour it deliciously. Peel and seed the cucumber. Dice the flesh into pea-size pieces, toss with the sugar, tarragon vinegar and a pinch of salt and set aside for five minutes or so. Drop the cucumber into a large pan of heavily-salted water and boil for a minute or so. Fish the cucumber out of the pan and pat it dry. Then drop the diced asparagus trimmings into the same water and cook until just tender. Remove and pat dry, reserving the cooking liquor. Let the rice soak in cold salted water while the vegetables are cooking. Then drain it and boil it in the water in which the cucumber and asparagus were cooked so that it benefits from the build-up of flavours. When the rice is just cooked, drain it and refresh it under a cold, running tap. Drain again, season well, and stir in the chopped and cooked vegetables. Mix and bind with up to 1oz of cool, melted butter, pack the mixture into the lightly-buttered ring mould, and cover with buttered foil. Everything up to this stage can be done well ahead. To re-heat the rice for serving, stand the mould in a roasting tin containing enough freshly-boiled water to come halfway up the sides of the mould, and slip the tin into an oven heated to 375`F/190`C (gas mark 5) for about 15 minutes until the rice is hot. Meanwhile, boil or steam the asparagus and prepare the prawns. Season them with sea salt, pepper and a good squeeze of lemon and toss them in enough olive oil to make the shells glisten all over. Heat a wok or a large saute pan thoroughly. Add the prepared prawns and saute or stir-fry, turning them until the shells are pink and the flesh is hot and cooked right through. Let the prawns rest in the pan while you un-mould the ring of rice on to a flat, warmed dish, blot the asparagus dry, and stand it in the ring. Arrange the prawns all around the rice and pour their pan juices over the rice. Serve with good bread and the sauce of your choice.</p>

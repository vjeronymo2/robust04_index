			<p>931207 FT  07 DEC 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nickel and copper lead advance in metal markets Base metals prices at the London Metal Exchange all moved up strongly yesterday, led early on by nickel and later by copper, the exchange's flagship contract. As brisk trading saw overhead, chart-based resistance broken down in several markets, gains on the day ranged between 0.47 per cent, for tin, and 3.49 per cent, for nickel. Nickel's early strength was in part a response to reports of a strike at Russia's Norilsk smelter, which, according to a senior executive, last year produced 240,000 tonnes of the metal, equivalent to nearly 40 per cent of western world supply. That helped to lift the LME three months delivery price above a significant chart point at Dollars 4,830 a tonne. The Norilsk strike reports were later denied by the company, but by then the bullish sentiment seemed firmly entrenched and the three months price held most of its gain to close at Dollars 4,947.50 a tonne, up Dollars 167 on the day and the highest since early August. The next strongest performer was lead, which extended its recent upward run to Dollars 40 in seven trading days with a Dollars 10.75 rise to a Dollars 457.25-a-tonne close for three months metal. That 10 1/2 -month high meant the market had exceeded its immediate chart objective, dealers said, but with supplies of lead concentrate (an intermediate material) remaining tight and demand from car battery makers continuing strong a further push towards the next major chart resistance area at Dollars 486 a tonne was not being ruled out. Aluminium joined in the upward move but proved unable to breach strong resistance near Dollars 1,090 a tonne for the three months delivery position, which closed at Dollars 1,088.25 a tonne, up Dollars 12.50 from Friday. The aluminium market's fundamentals remain 'dire', according to the latest report from Billiton-Enthoven Metals. 'And our reading of the technical charts confirms the view that any sustained upward movement is unlikely', the London-based firm says. It notes that when it last detailed aluminium smelter production cuts in late June 'rumours abounded of impending further cuts in the US'. But subsequent announcements by Aluminum Company of America and Reynolds Metals, have failed to make any real impact, 'indeed the latter's announcement actually coincided with a slump in prices in mid-late August'. 'At these depressed prices,' Billiton says, 'and with renewed weakness widely anticipated, the obvious conclusion would be that more producers will be forced to lower their production'. But it suggests that such moves may be delayed while results are awaited from talks between the Commonwealth of Independent States, the US, the European Union, Norway and Australia on multilateral cuts.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ibrahim Humaydi: "10 Factions Attack </F> `Concessions'; Islamic Jihad Pledges To Step Up Attacks; Popular  Front Will Not Confront Palestinian Police"]    [Text] Damascus -- The 10 Palestinian oppositionist  factions have said that the signing yesterday of the agreement  on the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho accord is the  culmination of a "series of concessions" offered by President  Yasir 'Arafat. They pledged to step up the "struggle against  the occupation," politically and militarily. They stressed  their refusal to participate in the self-rule authority.  However, they indicated their wish to avoid any "confrontation"  with the Palestinian police. Talal Ahmad, media spokesman for  the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine [PFLP] led by  George Habash, said that the agreement "is the culmination of  the concessions that led to the self-rule authority agreement.  It gives Israel complete control at all levels." In a  statement to AL-HAYAH he said that the PFLP will not participate  in the self-rule authority, "but we will not allow any violent  confrontations against the Palestinian authority or the police.  We will continue our struggle against Israel and the occupation  wherever they exist in order to secure a settlement that offers  the Palestinian people a just solution." He stressed the PFLP's  intention of moving its decisionmaking to the occupied  territories in the light of recent developments on the  Palestinian scene. He pointed out that the "agreement should  take place inside and that it should be basically confronted  inside."    On the possibility of PFLP cadres' entry into the Gaza  Strip,  he said that the return is "a right for everyone. It has  nothing to do with the (position on the) agreement."    Dr. Fathi al-Shaqaqi, secretary general of the Islamic Jihad  Movement, told AL-HAYAH that the agreement "confirms that what  is intended is the establishment of an entity subservient to the  Zionist entity both economically and at the security level." He  said that the agreement does not provide for a Palestinian state  plan. He warned that he will confront the agreement by  reactivating military and political action.    A spokesman for the Democratic Front for the Liberation of  Palestine [DFLP] led by Nayif Hawatimah said that the agreement  "is not binding on the Palestinian people." And that yesterday  "was not the end of Palestinian national history, but, rather,  the beginning of a new phase of struggle whose task is to topple  the self-rule and continue the struggle."    In a statement issued by him he went on: The agreement "has  exposed all attempts at deception and cheating and all the false  allegations about the partitioned self-rule in Gaza and Jericho."    The "central leadership" of the [Palestinian Forces]  Alliance  held a meeting yesterday evening to discuss ways of conducting  action after the signing of the agreement. Hamas considered  yesterday an "ill-omened" day in the Palestinians' history. It  said that those who signed the agreement "do not represent our  people," and the agreement is not binding on the Palestinians.    A statement issued by the movement said what happened in  Cairo "is a cheap sellout of the homeland represented in a weak  and disfigured self-administration controlled by Zionist  domination and sovereignty."    Having pointed out that the agreement "is not binding" on  the  Palestinian people and that those who signed it "do not  represent them," the movement urged "all Palestinian factions  and influential figures to unite their efforts to oppose this  sinister agreement...and not to be dragged in any way into  violence or fighting among brothers of one people."    Concluding, the statement said that the agreement "will not  represent the end of history, because no treaties are going to  abolish the Palestinian people's claim to their homeland and  holy places. One day our people will tear up this agreement,  just as they have torn up all documents of abandonment  throughout history."</p>

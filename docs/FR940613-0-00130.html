			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The plans will be the basis for selecting those PHAs that will receive assistance under the program. For troubled PHAs, funding of vacancy reduction activities will be contingent upon the PHA either making or providing reasonable assurances of substantial progress in remedying any management deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Use of Survey to Determine FY 1993 NOFA Threshold Factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As discussed in the proposed rule, all PHAs where existing data indicated the PHA met the statutory criteria for mandatory participation in the program were surveyed. The results of the survey have been used to define the threshold factors for the NOFA published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and are discussed in greater detail in that NOFA. In addition, the Department has conducted assessments at PHAs that the Department believes meet the threshold factors for the NOFA that is published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . As explained in the NOFA, any PHA that meets the threshold factors and has not already been assessed should immediately request an assessment by contacting the Department.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Six sets of comments were submitted to the Department on the proposed rule: two from public housing authority (PHA) industry groups and four from local housing authorities. Comments were received from the:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> _Council of Large Public Housing Authorities (CLPHA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Public Housing Authorities Directors Association (PHADA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Chicago Housing Authority (CHA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Morgan County (Illinois) Housing Authority (MCHA);  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Los Angeles County Housing Authority (LACHA); and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> _Atlanta (Georgia) Housing Authority (AHA).  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Discussion of the comments is organized according to the following topics: Eligibility requirements; development of the vacancy reduction plan; assessments; funding of vacancy reduction activities; sanctions; use of NOFAs to convey significant program information; the relationship of the Vacancy Reduction Program to other HUD programs; and miscellaneous comments.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Eligibility Requirements  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1) The rule states that a PHA must participate in the program if a receiver has been appointed for the PHA. The term ``receiver'' should be clarified, in that HUD has taken actions against PHAs that have resulted in takeovers of programs or operations from PHAs without necessarily having a court-appointed receiver. (CLPHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The term is statutory and refers to a receiver appointed by a Federal or State court under section 6(j)(3) of the United States Housing Act of 1937; the term does not include other arrangements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2) Benefits of the program should be available to a PHA that does not have a vacancy rate of twice the national average only if the PHA fails the Public Housing Management Assessment Program (PHMAP) standard for vacancies (see 24 CFR part 901). (PHADA) Similarly, program participation should be optional for troubled authorities that do not have a vacancy rate twice the national average. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As the commenter noted, using the PHMAP standard would require congressional action because the current statute requires participation by PHAs that are troubled or for which receivers have been appointed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3) In defining the term ``vacant unit'', reference is made to an effective lease, which is defined in terms of an eligible family being charged rent. However, because of utility allowances or zero income, many residents do not pay rent for the units they occupy. (CLPHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The definition requires that the family have a right to possession of the unit, in addition to being charged rent. The calculation of the rent to be charged by a PHA takes into account income and any utility allowance. As noted by the commenter, as a result of this calculation of rent, the PHA might not actually collect any money from the family having the right to possess a unit (e.g., when the utility allowance equals or exceeds the total tenant payment). However, the lease still obligates the tenant and includes a rental charge that, at least in part, is based on income. Therefore, the elements of the definition are met, even though the actual amount collected by the PHA from the tenant is $0.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4) A PHA is required to participate in the program if it has a vacancy rate that is twice the national average, regardless of the number of units in the PHA's inventory. Because the vacancy problems of small PHAs, especially, may be due to lack of demand, participation in the program should be optional for PHAs with less than 250 units. (PHADA) For the first year, program participation should be limited to PHAs with 500 or more units. (CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The statute does not discriminate among the causes of vacancies in establishing the participation requirements. However, the extent of participation may be limited to providing documentation of lack of demand or proposals to deprogram units. In awarding funding, the Department will concentrate on PHAs where there is a demand for housing, as reflected in the terms of the NOFA published elsewhere in today's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Furthermore, because smaller PHAs dependent on CIAP funding often have fewer resources to solve a vacancy problem, these PHAs could realize substantial improvement of their vacancy statistics with a minimal increment of funding. Thus, their selection for funding would serve the statutory purposes of the program, and their exclusion from the initial round of funding could not be justified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5) Program participation should be available to any PHA that needs help in addressing its vacancy situation. (MCHA, CHA)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

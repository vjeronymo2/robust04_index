			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] A formal rally was held in Varazdin this morning  on the occasion of the 130th anniversary of organized  fire-fighting in Croatia. Franjo Tudjman, president of the  Republic of Croatia, spoke at the rally. Zlatko Kuretic reports:    [Kuretic] [passage omitted] After introductory speeches by  the host and Franjo Greguric, the president of the Croatian Fire  Brigade Association, the rally was addressed by President Franjo  Tudjman. He expressed gratitude to the Croatian firemen for  their contribution in the patriotic war. Speaking about the  firemen's parade in Varazdin, he also said:    [Begin Tudjman recording] This parade speaks about the unity  of all parts of Croatia, of all Croatian counties, about the  unity that we must nurture in all areas because we have  established a single, independent, sovereign, and  internationally recognized Croatian state. There are still  people in the world who cannot reconcile themselves to this  fact. Our Croatia has become, however, not just internationally  recognized, but our sovereign and independent Croatia also has  powerful allies and friends, including, in the first place, the  United States, the most powerful world superpower in one part of  the world, and also our friend China, another world power, in  the other part of the world.    We have good relations with the European Union and friendly  relations with most of the European and other countries in the  world. Croatia's international status is such that we can  devote ourselves to carrying out other tasks before us: the  liberation of the occupied parts of Croatian and the development  of the federation and the confederation with Bosnia-Herzegovina.  From then on, we can devote ourselves in peace to economic and  cultural development and to the tasks our government is faced  with.    In both the economic and political fields, we have achieved  not just surprising results, but a miracle that the world is  admiring. We have curbed inflation. We have created conditions  for the introduction of a new Croatian currency that will be  stable because our efforts and our sweat and blood are in our  hands and will no longer go to foreign capitals. All our sweat  and blood will be in the interests of Croatian men, Croatian  people, and the Croatian state. [end recording] [passage  omitted]</p>

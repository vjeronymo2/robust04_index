			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Like paragraph (d) above, paragraph (f) of the final rule drops the list of specific atmospheric conditions and instead references &sect;&sect;1915.12, 1915.13 and 1915.14. The substantive requirement for stopping work until a space found to be hazardous has been retested and found safe for workers has not changed from the previous language.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 6. &sect;1915.16&blank;Warning Signs and Labels <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The substantive change OSHA has made to this section involves the expansion of the scope of the previous requirements to all phases of shipyard employment. The previous language limited the scope of &sect;1915.16 to ship repairing operations only. The reasons for the expansion in scope of this section are discussed above in &sect;1915.11, Scope and Application.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The provisions in final &sect;1915.16 require that signs and labels that are posted to meet the specific requirements contained in other sections of Subpart B be presented in a manner that can be understood by all employees. Like the previous standard, an individual tank or other space need not be labeled separately if the whole area has been tested and all means of access to the area are labeled with a warning sign.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA solicited public comment on whether &sect;1915.16 should require that all conditions be labeled on tanks. The majority of responders who considered this issue (Ex. 6&hyph;8, 6&hyph;15, 6&hyph;21, 6&hyph;22, 6&hyph;23, 6&hyph;24, 6&hyph;36, 6&hyph;37, 6&hyph;38) supported the continuation of the previous requirement that only tanks containing unsafe work conditions need to be labeled. Other commenters (Ex. 6&hyph;4, 6&hyph;12, 6&hyph;28, 6&hyph;31) supported labeling all locations that had been tested, whether safe or unsafe. Still other commenters (Ex. 6&hyph;3, 6&hyph;6) suggested that only tanks containing safe work environments be labeled.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Those commenters who supported continued use of the previous requirement of posting only unsafe tanks are best represented by the following comments. The American Waterways Shipyard Conference, (Ex. 6&hyph;23) commented, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> Current shipyard operations only provide warning signs for unsafe tanks. If both conditions are marked with warning signs, then it ceases to be an instant hazard recognition. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This was further emphasized by a comment from Sound Testing, Inc., (Ex. 6&hyph;8): <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> I have always found the present standard's section on warning signs to be very workable. Not much is gained by labeling safe places as such, for three reasons: 1. This practice would be very costly; 2. The very idea of using a warning sign on a safe place is illogical; and 3. Signs would proliferate. The more signs there are, the less is the effect of any single sign. Signs should be used as sparingly as possible, so that when we really need them they will be effective. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On the other hand, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) (Ex. 6&hyph;10) supported the placing of warning signs on only those tanks that have been tested and found to be safe. NFPA states: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> NFPA would support a requirement for placing warning signs on tanks if the signs were specifically restricted to indicating spaces which have been tested and suitably designated as ``SAFE.'' If signs are required for all tanks which are ``SAFE'' then any tank which does not have a sign is then interpreted by all employees to be ``NOT SAFE.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> OSHA has concluded that requiring only unsafe spaces to be labeled as specified in &sect;&sect;1915.12, 1915.13, or 1915.14 will provide the most effective notice of atmospheric conditions that could endanger employees. The Agency believes that the identification of hazardous conditions is the most efficient means of utilizing signs or labels. OSHA agrees with commenters who noted that warning signs should be used only when necessary so that when they are posted, employees will take notice of them. Shipyard employees are familiar with the labeling of tanks that have been tested and found to be unsafe. On the other hand, OSHA is not prohibiting the posting of other signs and labels an employer may find appropriate for that employer's workplace, but the Agency cautions employers about the overuse of signs and labels, which could lead to decreased effectiveness. Moreover, in response to the NFPA and other commenters who supported labeling ``safe'' spaces, OSHA notes that spaces that have been tested and found to be safe are required to be identified by the Marine Chemist's certificate or the competent person's record of testing and recommendations. These certificates and records provide the appropriate notice of safe working conditions. There is insufficient evidence in the record to show that changes to the labeling requirements would increase safety. For all these reasons, OSHA is requiring that all tanks and other spaces that fail to meet the requirements of &sect;&sect;1915.12, 1915.13, or 1915.14, as applicable, be posted with hazard warning signs or labeled with hazard warning messages as required in those sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> OSHA deleted paragraph (a) of the old and proposed rules which required employers to notify employees of dangerous work areas. The reason for this is that the posting requirements for various atmospheric conditions are specifically addressed in their respective sections.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The final rule text and the proposed rule text differ in that OSHA proposed that employers be responsible for ensuring that all employees ``obey'' all warning signs. One commenter, Bay Shipbuilding Corp., (Ex. 6&hyph;15) addressed the issue of employee compliance with safety regulations. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The employee must share the responsibility to obey and observe proper practices along with the employer. Every employee must be held accountable for their actions. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In this regard, OSHA notes that under the OSH Act, employers are responsible for compliance with standards issued under Section 6, and enforcement is directed at the employer and not the employee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In this final rule, OSHA has revised the previous rule by providing two basic requirements addressing hazard warning messages to employees.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In paragraph (a), OSHA is requiring that all hazard warning messages that are posted to comply with respective paragraphs of &sect;&sect;1915.12, 1915.13, and 1915.14 be presented in a manner or format that can be perceived and understood by all employees. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

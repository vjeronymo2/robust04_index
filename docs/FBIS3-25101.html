Garoeb told NBC [Namibian  Broadcasting Corporation] news that the visit is a strictly  party-to-party business mission, although political issues will  also be discussed. He said both the MPLA and SWAPO have  business interests which are supposed to help them become  independent and self-reliant within the multiparty political  environment. Garoeb revealed that some of the business  interests to be discussed between the two parties will include  fisheries and transportation.</p>

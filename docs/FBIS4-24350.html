			<p>BFN     [Text] Fresh clashes occurred between opposition supporters  and security forces in the Congolese capital Brazzaville. At  least two people were killed in Pila in the eastern part of  Brazzaville. Tension seems to have ebbed but sporadic shots from  automatic weapons were still heard last night at Pila considered  as the stronghold of the supporters of former President Sassou  Nguesso. This new tension followed the kidnapping last Saturday  of two sympathizers of the Presidential Group in Bacongo in the  sourthen part of Brazzaville and stronghold of the members of  the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development  led by Bernard Kolelas.</p>

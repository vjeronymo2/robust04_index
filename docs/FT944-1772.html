			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Israel reviews plan for stock market tax Israel's cabinet yesterday reviewed controversial government plans to tax stock market profits from January 1 as debate over economic policy widened. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime minister, met key economic officials after senior cabinet ministers launched a campaign to have the tax scrapped, amended or postponed. Since the unpopular capital gains tax was announced earlier this year analysts say it has contributed to the continuing weakness on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and calls have been growing in Mr Rabin's Labour party for it to be abolished. The Mistanim two-sided index has plunged almost 30 per cent from 240-250 points last year to a current level of 170-180 points and shows little sign of a quick recovery. The continuing weakness of the market has placed severe constraints on the government's privatisation programme and the ability of private companies to raise capital. The abolition campaign has been led by Mr Shimon Shetreet, economics minister, who has argued the tax is a big factor in Labour's recent decline in the opinion polls. A recent Gallup poll showed that 36 per cent of those polled opposed the tax while 32 per cent supported it. The same poll showed 58 per cent of investors in the stock market wanted the tax scrapped. Mr Shetreet has called the tax 'absurd and draconian' and said it would hurt the small investor most. The right-wing Likud opposition party has also condemned it. A private member's bill to scrap it was defeated 36-26 in parliament last week. Mr Abraham Shochat, minister of finance, has warned that any attempt to abolish the tax would send negative signals to investors about government economic policy. He says the tax brings Israel into line with other countries and will be structured to allow deduction of losses, and has strongly criticised opposition to the measure based on political considerations. General elections are due in November 1996. 'Zigzagging on the issue, speculating as to what will happen in 1996, and flinching because of political intrigue and fears, all mean fleeing responsibility,' he said last week. 'The leadership of a country is evaluated according to its determination, its backbone and its trustworthiness. Popularity ratings and political intrigues should not determine what needs to be done.' The tax has been strongly supported by Mr Jacob Frenkel, Bank of Israel governor. However many Labour members feel Mr Rabin is open to persuasion and could agree to postpone its implementation or amend it. The debate over the tax comes amid wider discussion on economic policy. Mr Micha Harish, industry minister, has warned of recession in 1996 unless the government more resolutely tackles inflation, running at 14 per cent, high interest rates and an overvalued shekel.</p>

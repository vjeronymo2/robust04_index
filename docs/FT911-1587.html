			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Turkish border closure hampers aid TURKEY closed its main border route into Iraq for more than three hours yesterday, cutting the overland flow of allied relief to Kurdish refugees in the region, US military officials confirmed. The incident came as Turkey decided to expel a British reporter whom it accused of 'biased' reporting. The article by Robert Fisk, correspondent for The Independent, alleged that Turkish troops were stealing aid supplies. In Ankara, Mr Morton Abramowitz, US ambassador to Turkey, sought to play down the significance of the border closure. He said the problem was caused by Turkish construction workers, due to enter northern Iraq to work on setting up allied refugee camps. They arrived without proper documentation, he said. 'This is not something we are trying to single out. Please understand that these are the sort of problems that occur in any big operation. 'We are not talking about major problems, we are talking about problems that constantly arise in any operation, especially one of this magnitude,' he said. The incidents came after a rise in tension between Turkey and the allied forces working to move hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurdish refugees back to their homes. The closing of the border and the expulsion of the journalist appeared to reflect the anger felt by Turkey's military over its loss of control of operations within its country, and the critical portrayal of Turkish soldiers in the foreign media. The Independent said Turkish authorities had declared that Mr Fisk, defence correspondent Christopher Bellamy, staff reporter Phil Reeves and Richard Wayman, a freelance photographer working for the paper, persona non grata and had withdrawn their press credentials. Meanwhile the United Nations took the first formal step to obtain the payment of compensation by Iraq under the ceasefire terms, creating a special fund to be financed from the country's oil revenues. But in a report to the Security Council, Mr Javier Perez de Cuellar, secretary general, acknowledged that ensuring financing for this compensation fund would be among the most technical and difficult tasks to be undertaken by its proposed commission of experts in finance, law, accountancy, insurance and environment damage-assessment. Among the options he suggested to ensure that Iraq honoured its pledge to make reparations was the setting-aside of a percentage of the market value of oil exports or the acquisition of a physical share of such exports for direct sale on the market on the fund's behalf. 'It must be recognised that, in all probability, it may be some time before Iraq is able to resume oil exports,' he said. Also, at any given time, the value of claims approved by the commission, a subsidiary organ of the Security Council, was likely to exceed the fund's resources. The EC and the British government are to co-finance 20 'mobile support teams' to help Kurdish refugees return to Iraq, David Gardner reports from Brussels. Volunteers from the UK's fire and ambulance services, hospitals and Territorial Army, are to be deployed for three months, financed by Ecu2m (Pounds 1.39m) from Brussels and Ecu0.9m from London. The EC has already mounted three other joint operations in northern Iraq - with France, Belgium and the Netherlands - as part of its commitment of Ecu150m in aid to the Kurds. Joint action is seen as a way of reducing growing aid demands on a badly strained budget.</p>

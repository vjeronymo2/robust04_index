			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BROWN AGAIN TOPS LEGISLATORS WITH OUTSIDE INCOME OF $100,000-PLUS  </P> <P> Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) reported on Wednesday that he  collected more than $100,000 in speaking fees, gifts and travel expenses last  year, largely from special-interest groups pushing bills in the Legislature.  </P> <P> Brown's report of outside income -- far short of his record-setting total of  $161,000 in 1987 -- was part of an avalanche of financial disclosure statements  filed with the state Fair Political Practices Commission before a Wednesday  midnight postmark deadline.  </P> <P> The reports, which will continue to arrive over the next few days, illustrated  anew the common practice among legislators of accepting fees, gifts and foreign  trips from many organizations that seek to influence legislation.  </P> <P> Among others filing Wednesday was Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti  (D-Los Angeles), who reported a total of $66,178 in gifts and honorariums in  1988, including $49,578 in speaking fees and $12,081 for trips to Taiwan,  Germany and Italy.  </P> <P> Last January, Roberti received $3,000 for a speech from the California  Retailers Assn., a group that successfully pushed for passage of a  controversial bill that lifted the limit on interest rates that department  stores are allowed to charge their credit card customers. The organization paid  $16,000 to key lawmakers for speeches in 1988.  </P> <P> Gov. George Deukmejian reported receiving gifts totaling $7,459 and said he had  no income from speeches. The governor received $2,500 in gold medallions from  Armenian supporters, three Super Bowl tickets worth $450 from Alex Spanos,  owner of the San Diego Chargers, and a painting of a Chinese dragon valued at  $1,000 from the Charity Cultural Services Center of San Francisco.  </P> <P> Brown, talking to reporters, said his speaking fees declined in 1988 because of  time spent on a yearlong fight with the dissident Democratic "Gang of Five,"  who unsuccessfully tried to oust him as Speaker.  </P> <P> He said he continues to support a proposal to ban outside income for  legislators, but only if their pay is raised from $40,816 a year to a Superior  Court judge's salary of $84,765.  </P> <P> In addition to the $89,600 he received last year for 49 speeches and $10,698 in  gifts and travel expenses, Brown reported income of more than $10,000 from his  law practice. (Under state law, lawmakers must report exact amounts of gifts  and honorariums, but other sources of outside income need only be revealed by  monetary category, with "over $10,000" the highest amount.)  </P> <P> "I don't have any problems at all giving up outside income totally," Brown  said, "but there has to be an adequate salary."  </P> <P> Brown also defended public officials who accept speaking fees and travel  expenses from special-interest groups that lobby for legislation. "It may look  like vote-buying, but it really doesn't have anything to do with vote-buying,"  he said.  </P> <P> As for lawmakers who accept fees without giving speeches -- for simply  attending a reception or seminar, for example -- Brown said, "It's a dumb thing  to do, real dumb. There's no accounting for the fact that some of us are dumb.  Some of us permanently."  </P> <P> Brown complained that a $1,000-a-year limitation on gifts and speaking fees  that went into effect in January, after passage of last year's Proposition 73,  will have a dramatic effect on his speech-making. "It's burdensome in that I'll  end up making three to four times the number of speeches," he said, "and that's  time-consuming."  </P> <P> A number of legislative leaders appeared to be in high demand as public  speakers in 1988, including Assemblyman Pat Nolan of Glendale, who stepped down  from his post as Assembly Republican leader in December. He was one of four  lawmakers whose offices were searched by the FBI as part of its undercover  Capitol corruption probe.  </P> <P> Nolan reported receiving $24,750 for delivering speeches and serving as a  panelist at conventions. His largest speaking fee -- $3,000 -- came from the  California Retailers.  </P> <P> Senate Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno reported a $2,000 speaking fee  from the retailers group among $12,250 in honorariums he received in 1988.  </P> <P> Several elected state officials reported receiving foreign trips, including  Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, who was given a $13,372  trip to Japan to visit educational institutions. The trip was paid for by the  Japanese government.  </P> <P> Brown was given $2,000 for delivering a speech to the Italian parliament.  </P> <P> State Board of Equalization member Paul B. Carpenter, one of the subjects of  the FBI investigation into Capitol political corruption, reported a $9,116 trip  to Europe in February, 1988, during which he also received $3,311 for  delivering speeches in Dublin, London and Madrid.  </P> <P> Another target of the FBI sting, Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), for the  first time officially reported receiving $3,000 on June 29 of last year from  Peachstate Capital, a phony company set up by FBI agents as part of their  undercover investigation. The money was delivered at a breakfast meeting in a  restaurant a block from the Capitol.  </P> <P> Montoya's financial disclosure statement showed that he collected $36,550 in  honorariums during 1988, the largest being $5,000 from the California Medical  Assn.  </P> <P> The senator has also disclosed that he failed to report an $8,000 personal  consulting fee he received in 1987 from Tony Olguin, a City of Industry builder  and developer. The amount should have been included on the financial statement  Montoya filed a year ago, but he said in a letter to the FPPC in December that  the omission was "inadvertent and certainly unintentional."  </P> <P> Times staff writer Douglas Shuit contributed to this story.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Justice and Interior Minister Juan Alberto </F> Belloch by Jose Maria Brunet in Madrid; date not given]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] [Brunet] Do you consider the  government's political responsibilities concerning the  corruption affairs to have been discharged with the resignations  that have occurred?    [Belloch] The events that have occurred have meant accepting  particularly rigorous political responsibilities, largely owing  to the social atmosphere that has been created. This does not  mean that there could not be more people accepting  responsibility if there are further developments or information.  But with what we have right now, this matter has been resolved,  except for those who can only repeat: "Resign, Mr. Gonzalez."  That assertion does not acquire further intellectual nuances by  being said many more times. That kind of line is unreasonable  from the democratic viewpoint, because Felipe Gonzalez won the  election with a very clear message that he was going to act  against corruption. If we who work with him do not do our jobs  well, let us be called to account at the polls.    [Brunet] Do you believe that the government and Felipe  Gonzalez have suffered a grave deterioration over the past few  days?    [Belloch] My sincere opinion is that it depends whether or  not we do things well. If we are able to restore an atmosphere  of calm and win confidence through sensible and balanced  actions, he will more than surmount the crisis and carry out  what he promised and what we members of his government must now  implement.    [Brunet] There is an impression that this crisis could be  tackled because the nationalists have caused the government to  dig its heels in and shake off its doubts.    [Belloch] I do not believe so. All that I believe is that  this has been a month in which it had to be shown which is the  parliamentary majority and which is the minority. Naturally,  majorities are formed in accordance with their own laws; the  partners in that majority have the right and duty to intervene  and act. That is what has happened, but I would not submit a  confidence motion right now. It would be like succumbing to a  minor pitfall. If anybody should submit anything, the People's  Party should submit a censure motion. A confidence motion makes  sense only when you lose the parliamentary majority -- that is,  the vote on an important bill.    [Brunet] Why has cooperation between yourself and Baltasar  Garzon not been possible, when you are both judges and  independents?    [Belloch] The first thing that I must say is that I greatly  regret that he has tendered his resignation. I regret it  because he was the appropriate person to take charge of the task  that he had -- namely, the struggle against drug trafficking,  plus the set of policies entailed by the National Plan Against  Drugs, and also the possibility of coordinating anticorruption  units. He had the right profile for that task, and that is why  I offered him that post. But I am going to create a  secretaryship of state for the interior, and I certainly have  not offered him that. I believe that the profile of a secretary  of state for the interior is different. He has very  wide-ranging duties and a very different set of general  guidelines, and another profile is needed for that. I believe  that he was not satisfied with the offer to stay in the current  secretaryship, and that is why he tendered his resignation to me.    [Brunet] Garzon was the Interior Ministry's number two.  Was there no basis for a relationship of trust between  yourselves and for his remaining so?    [Belloch] The point is that we are now going to set up a  different structure, because there is now a new ministry, the  Ministry of Justice and the Interior. This should be organized  in accordance with a principle of autonomy: on one hand, the  secretaryship of state for justice and the secretaryship of  state for the interior, and coordination from above through the  minister, and also, in parallel, two autonomous central matters  -- the struggle against drug trafficking and corruption, and  prison institutions -- that should have autonomous  secretaryships of state. That structure means that the  secretaries of state for the interior and justice are actually  deputy ministers or responsible overall for the area as a whole.  I believe that they have more appropriate profiles for that  task than Garzon. That is why, while greatly regretting it, I  had to act accordingly. The prime minister had a high opinion  of Baltasar and knew that he must be doing a good job in his  field, but it matters more to me that I choose people with the  appropriate profile.    [Brunet] In any event, you showed Garzon the door by saying  in public that if he tendered his resignation, you would accept  it.    [Belloch] I would be sorry for that impression to remain. It  is true that he asked me for two weeks to reflect, and I did not  give him them. In my opinion, it is essential to finish  appointing the secretaries of state this weekend. As the  situation stands, the impression of a makeshift situation must  not be given.    [Brunet] Has the government "applied the scalpel" against  corruption, as Garzon demanded?    [Belloch] Of course. This is not a matter of the past two  months. When he offered me the post of justice minister, the  prime minister told me that my aim was to combat corruption  thoroughly, with all the means available at the Justice  Ministry. Moreover, I am convinced that he chose me for that  reason. There is no doubt, because it was a result of his  commitment to the electorate with two messages -- to surmount  the economic crisis and to end corruption and the atmosphere of  impunity. I was one of the elements for this second major aim,  and he appointed me minister for that reason.    [Brunet] The most sensational corruption cases were raised  by  the press.    [Belloch] Following my appointment, I gave the state  attorney  general instructions, making it clear that the struggle against  corruption was an absolute priority in terms of criminal policy.  After that, a series of investigations which are producing  results began. In short, the instruments are working.  Paradoxically, the uncovering of corruption cases can become a  matter which disturbs the impression of calm and civil peace.  However, it is the natural consequence of going all-out to  combat any form of corruption.    [Brunet] Have you been appointed to clean up the Interior  Ministry?    [Belloch] I do not believe that is the central aim. I have  been appointed to investigate all the cases which may exist, but  it is not fair for us to speak in general terms of the Interior  Ministry or the Civil Guard. The Civil Guard cannot bear the  blame of the director general who commanded it. That is not in  keeping with the feeling of the public, who have a level of  confidence in the security forces which many other institutions  would like for themselves.    [Brunet] In any event, the prevailing view is that the  government did not take the struggle against corruption so  seriously before the cases of Roldan and Rubio.    [Belloch] That is the public impression, but it is not in  keeping with the facts. The qualitative change in the  assessment of the corruption phenomenon dates from the first day  of the formation of the current government. There is, however,  a change of approach in assessing the phenomenon's importance in  comparison with the previous situation. If this were not so, we  would not have been able to ensure that many investigations  would be completed so quickly.    [Brunet] Do you believe that there could be concealed  interests behind the outbreak of the Rubio affair?    [Belloch] I believe that precisely because we have begun a  process of thorough investigation of corruption, there are a  number of consequences. There are people who may have taken  part in such activities and are rightly afraid that they will be  uncovered. So one thing can lead to another. This could cause  some people to play at a war of cases. We knew that this  possibility existed when we accepted this priority, but it was  necessary. The public's confidence cannot be restored unless we  end this atmosphere. The public should see that this process  has a cost but that it is unavoidable. So they should be calm.  Cases could, of course, continue to emerge. The important  thing is that the public support this struggle.    [Brunet] In any event, the question is whether the cases  are a consequence of the current atmosphere concerning  corruption or else are one of the causes of it. Are more cases  emerging because there are those who have an interest in this?    [Belloch] There are undoubtedly moves of that kind, but I  would like to make a general observation: You cannot switch  from an atmosphere of a certain passivity and inhibition with  respect to tax crime to suddenly setting up a Holy Inquisition  or launching general inquisitorial processes. Our duty is that  there should be neither tolerance not inquisitors in this  respect. Inquisitors, especially those acting in the name of  the good, have always caused very clear consequences. The  principle of legality, calm, confidence, and balance must be  restored.    [Brunet] Do you believe that an anticorruption Holy  Inquisition has been set up?    [Belloch] It is clear that we cannot switch overnight from a  situation in which the public considered that this matter of tax  crime was a minor matter to launching a historical crusade of  the masked warrior. I am not here for that purpose. I have  always had a poor opinion of inquisitors, and if, moreover, the  cause for which they fight is just, they are usually more  dangerous. Against that, there should be reason, the  rule-of-law state, legality, and each institution's doing its  job, and so confidence will spread.    [Brunet] Over the past few days, the government has joined  the crusade with the arrest of Rubio.    [Belloch] That impression may exist, but those who acted  were  two professional prosecuting attorneys, without anybody's  instructions. These prosecuting attorneys immediately placed  the matter in the hands of a police court judge. Nobody can  express suspicions of a judge's acting with the intention of  favoring somebody's image. This judge examined the facts and  took the steps that he deemed opportune. Along with this, an  atmosphere of confusion is being created according to which the  necessary steps were not taken with Luis Roldan, who was accused  simply of a tax offense, and in this other matter, in which the  accusations are more serious -- because they include forgery --  the same people criticize the latter situation. Precautionary  steps were not taken with Roldan, and the result is that this  gentleman has been able to escape. In the second case, the  steps that in fact have prevented this were taken. No  inquisitorial spirit should be seen in this. It is a matter of  the gravity of the alleged conduct and of the evidence gathered  by some professionals.    [Brunet] Was it necessary to make these arrests by night?  Was  it not intended that they spend that night in the cells?    [Belloch] I do not believe so. The main work of this  ministry is legality and reason. Therefore, insofar as it is my  responsibility, I will try to ensure that there is always  proportion in what falls within the police sphere, and the least  possible harm is done to the accused person's rights. I reject  any formula of the kind which they have suffered in Italy --  unnecessary cameras, handcuffing people needlessly, and turning  these actions into a spectacle. It is necessary to act very  vigorously, but always with the least possible harm to those  accused of the offense.    [Brunet] The opposition says that this arrest was made on  the  day before Garzon's press conference in order to influence the  atmosphere.    [Belloch] That is an insult to the two prosecuting attorneys  in the case. They do not deserve it. I sincerely believe that  that is quite enough. All those who aim to hold political  responsibilities should realize that this leads nowhere except  to unnecessarily discrediting the institutions and destroying  the country. And nobody who aims to hold responsibility can  afford that.    [Brunet] Could the government do nothing to prevent Roldan's  escape?    [Belloch] The administration could have been more effective  in remote surveillance or other methods which are not  interpreted as coercion, but that is all there is to it. The  interior minister -- a particularly courageous, honorable,  upright, and competent person -- accepted his political  responsibility and resigned. In any country in the world, it is  destructive to continue to speak of these matters.    [Brunet] But what would you do in a similar case?    [Belloch] Order that there be a reasonable remote  surveillance system in order to try to prevent escape. That is  what I believe Asuncion did.    [Brunet] Then he was not obeyed.    [Belloch] We are investigating whether there are  administrative responsibilities, in order to find out how those  methods were organized. There are no conclusions as yet.    [Brunet] That is, the system failed; it has been shown that  it is not always possible to reconcile individual rights with  collective security.    [Belloch] It is very possible. One of the reasons for  seriously considering a change of procedural model is because  there are structural defects. For instance, a prosecuting  attorney could adopt those surveillance measures. Our model has  its difficulties. Would you accept three policemen accompanying  you everywhere? Asuncion said so: All this has happened  because it was the Roldan affair. In no other case would he  have accepted political responsibility. This was an exceptional  situation, in which the system could have worked better, but, as  a method, it makes no sense for a gentleman against whom  proceedings have been opened to be under police surveillance.    [Brunet] Is it difficult to explain to the public that there  was no arrangement with Roldan?    [Belloch] Those who refer to the possibility of an  arrangement necessarily do so in bad faith or believe that other  people do not have a normal intelligence quotient. It is clear  that the chief interest which the government and the minister  had was for this not to have happened. We have launched a very  large-scale search operation to find him. The theory of an  arrangement is untenable.    [Brunet] Would you negotiate a posteriori with Roldan for  him  to give himself up?    [Belloch] The only thing of which he can be assured, like  anybody else, is that he will have security, but the same as any  other criminal: Excuse me, suspected criminal. [passage  omitted]</p>

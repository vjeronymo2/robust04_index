			<p>930505 FT  05 MAY 93 / UK Company News: Goodhead warns of setback GOODHEAD Group, the printer and publisher, yesterday warned of a further profit fall for the current year to end-May 1993. The shares closed 1p lower at 25p. In January the company reported a 58 per cent drop in first - half pre - tax profits to Pounds 181,000, after exceptional charges of Pounds 133,000. For the whole of 1991 - 92 the profit was Pounds 721,000, compared with Pounds 4.02m in the previous 12 months. In a trading statement issued yesterday the directors said that trading conditions deteriorated in the third seasonally difficult quarter in both the design and print divisions, due principally to uncertainty in the economy, and high interest rates which led to cancellation of orders. The company said that as such the group was likely to report a reduction on the profit achieved for the first half of the current year. However, profitability has been restored to all areas of its activities, directors said.</p>

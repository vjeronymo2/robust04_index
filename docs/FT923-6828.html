			<p>920821 FT  21 AUG 92 / McAlpine shares fall after cut in payout SHARES in Alfred McAlpine fell 22p to 101p yesterday after the construction and housebuilding company cut its interim dividend by a third and said forecasts made earlier this year were now 'too optimistic'. Mr Graeme Odgers, chief executive, said the construction market was 'severely depressed' and house prices continued to fall. As a result, profits for the year will be lower than last year's Pounds 9.3m. For the six months to April 30 McAlpine announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 71,000 from a Pounds 700,000 profit, but said the traditionally-stronger second half would be better. 'While I am deeply unhappy about the current levels of profitability, I believe we are doing the right things,' Mr Odgers said. Costs are being controlled and staff numbers have fallen almost 15 per cent since Mr Odgers, former managing director of British Telecom, started trying to revitalise the previously family-run company in 1990. Turnover fell to Pounds 250m from Pounds 254.8m, mainly due to lower construction sales. The company's workload has fallen 22 per cent and margins are dropping. Redundancies, which are continuing, cost Pounds 500,000. Housebuilding improved but still made pre-tax losses of Pounds 1.3m. More houses were sold due to heavier marketing but average selling prices fell 5 per cent to Pounds 83,000. Margins are improving as expensive sites acquired at the peak of the property market in the late 1980s are developed and sold. The company saw little chance of a recovery in UK housing until next year. McAlpine also announced it was buying the 40 per cent stake it does not already own in the housebuilding division from the founding Grove family. McAlpine will pay a mixture of cash, shares and loan notes for the stake, valued at about Pounds 18m at yesterday's closing price. There is also a deferred consideration based on average profits in the three and a half years to October 1995. Profits for the minerals division fell more than a half due to falling aggregate prices. In the US, competition and reduced margins affected construction. Earnings per share fell to 0.2p from 2.8p. The interim dividend is cut to 3p from 4.5p. Mr Odgers said the cut reflected the company's thinking for the full year. Comment, Page 16</p>

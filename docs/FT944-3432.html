			<p>941213 FT  13 DEC 94 / International Company News: Cariplo emerges as contender for Rolo Potential suitors for Gruppo Bancario Credito Romagnolo (Rolo), the Bolognese banking group, continued to stir up speculation yesterday about a possible counter-bid for the bank. Credito Italiano (Credit), the Milan-based bank, formally launched its L20,000-a-share bid for Rolo at the weekend. The offer for 65 per cent of the company will open on December 19 and run until January 16. If shareholders accept the offer, Credit will have to spend nearly L2,800bn (Dollars 1.7bn). Rolo has deliberately left itself open to possible counter-bids, and attention is now focused on Cariplo, the unquoted Italian savings bank, which is said to be preparing an alternative offer in alliance with IMI, the Italian financial services and banking group. Without confirming those rumours, Mr Sandro Molinari, Cariplo's chairman, indicated yesterday that there would 'certainly' be more news before Christmas. Under Italian takeover rules, Cariplo has until the end of the first week in January to launch a counter-bid. It would have to be pitched at least 5 per cent higher than the Credit bid, both in terms of the price per share, and the overall amount offered. Mr Gianguido Sacchi Morsiani, chairman of Rolo's local rival, Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna (Carisbo), said yesterday that his bank would also be ready to take part in an alternative bid. However, he said Carisbo had not yet talked to Cariplo about making a friendly approach to Rolo. Rolo and Carisbo have cross-shareholdings in one another of just over 3 per cent. Rolo originally planned a merger with CAER, the parent company of Carisbo, as a defence against Credit's first, hostile offer. Those plans were dropped 10 days ago, when Rolo's board declared that Credit's plans for a higher offer were an improvement on the initial approach.</p>

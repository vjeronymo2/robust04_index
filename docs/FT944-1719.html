			<p>941219 FT  19 DEC 94 / Arts: 'Method' married to madness - Nigel Andrews talks to Rod Steiger, who returns to the cinema after ten years in the wilderness What do you do if an unexploded bomb is lying about in your movie? Do you defuse or detonate it? Or do you just rejoice that it is there? The Specialist, opening on Boxing Day, is a Sylvester Stallone thriller full of fake explosions and dummy showdowns: but it has one genuine exposed bomb in its cast. The name is Rod Steiger. The 69-year-old Jewish-Irish actor is back: ex-Oscar winner for In The Heat Of The Night, ex-sparring partner to the great (Brando in On The Waterfront) and for decades the most articulate spokesman for the postwar era's best-known acting tradition. The Method. In The Specialist Steiger, marrying madness to Method, careers about the screen with a gun and Cuban accent as if he had never been away. But for ten years he was away, in a private hell of near-clinical depression. It was caused in part by a faltering career and bad role choices. I met him recently in Hollywood. Yachting cap on head, face round as a Gouda, voice primed for that raspy singsong, he talked for two hours about acting; with a passion and breadth I have never met in any other practitioner. Steiger accepts that he is no longer first choice for top character roles in modern Hollywood. 'Every time I see something I like,' he snarls, 'I run into Sean Connery or Gene Hackman.' But he is still mildly shocked when he encounters executives who demand an interview before casting him. 'They've never heard of me. Some of your executives today are 30 years old, what the hell do they remember of me? You just have to go in and swallow your pride. I figure if Brando could do a screen test for Godfather - smartest move he ever made - I can do auditions too.' False pride he has given up. He vanished into his black hole, compounded of drink, divorce pains and career depression, soon after making what he thinks was his worst ever career judgment: turning down the lead role in Patton. 'I woke up one morning and I was young and vibrant and alive and my philosophies were strong, and I said I'm a pacifist] I'll have nothing to do with this man. Biggest mistake of my life. If I'd been successful in that part, and it won George C. Scott an Oscar, I might even have had a shot at the Godfather.' Instead the Steiger glory days are the 1950s and '60s, when in the era before Hoffman or De Niro he was a one-man phenomenon: a character actor with the power and presence to push into stardom. Steiger thinks he never pushed quite that far. 'I was never a leading man. I missed that one pre-requisite for real stardom, I never was what they call a 'sex symbol'. If you don't get the female following of a tribe, you don't get that big as an actor. Brando had it. James Dean. Nicholson even has it - the attractiveness of evil.' So he settled for the rollercoasting life of a high-exposure character player. There was joy here, from 'the freedom of being other people'. And there was fear too: the energising anxiety that comes from ever-changing challenges on stage and screen. 'Fear motivates an actor,' says Steiger. ''I'm gonna try to be good in this part,' you say, and you don't care who is watching, you have to entertain them. If I was in a room with just an automatic camera, and lighting, and no human beings, and there was just the studio cat, I'd worry about how the cat was reacting. Or a cockroach. 'Did the cockroach look at me? Did I entertain him?' 'But there's a price to pay for living with the childhood romantic dream of having adventure and challenge. After a while you don't have so many 'highs', because you don't get employed that quickly any more. And then you watch out because boredom comes in and you're looking frantically for something to give that fear again, because you misinterpret that fear as being alive.' Glamour, not terror, lured him into acting. 'I came from a neighbourhood in Newark, New Jersey, where if you put the garbage out and helped with the dishes your mother gave you fifteen cents and you went to the movies on Saturday afternoon and watched the golden people.' Steiger's voice rises and stretches on that 'g-o-l-d-e-n' He knows, even off camera, where the oomph should come in a sentence. When he joined the golden people himself, enrolling in the Actors Studio, then going on stage and TV to hew his reputation as a powerhouse Everyman, Steiger became famous for pushing and pulling his scripts. Not just accents and emphases but whole words and phrases. 'What are sentences?,' he says. 'They're prismatic particles, flying out from the centre of a thought. And you catch the flashing of their individual light and you understand that sentence. So you fool around with it a little, so long as you keep the meaning.' He and Brando did so in the famous taxi scene in On The Waterfront ('I coulda been a contender, Charlie'). The scene was born, recalls Steiger, from an accumulation of happy mishaps. 'We spent eleven hours shooting. The producer Sam Spiegel had promised us back-projection. When Kazan the director arrived, there was no street footage to project behind the cab's window] 'Well, a crew member said he'd come in that day in a taxi with venetian blinds. So Kazan used that. And we were in that tight space - half a mock-up cab - and Kazan brought the camera right in on our faces. We played that scene, and played with it, till it came right.' Waterfront was a watershed in postwar acting: the vindication of the Method in popular cinema. Did Steiger sense this at the time? 'You never know you're doing a revolution,' he says. 'If you do, you're a pain in the ass. You cannot make love and criticise your performance at the same time. 'Let me tell you about the 'Method.' The word was invented by journalists to describe the ideas that Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler brought back from a visit to Russia. In the old style of acting you used conjecture to force an emotion in from outside. With the Method the actor uses involvement to discover the emotions in himself. 'So you find something in your own life. If somebody tells me my daughter's died, I cry.' Tears come into Steiger's eyes on cue. (His daughter and only child is the opera singer Anna Steiger.) 'But I'm afraid of using that too much, in case I use it up. Another time, I'll use something like I did in The Big Knife. I had to get angry in one scene, so I looked at the set and I had just seen - this was after the war - photos of Auschwitz and Treblinka. So I said to myself, 'These people built this place]' And that did it for me.' Steiger exploded on cue. Look at the movie today and take shelter. But the Method has room for more lightweight techniques too. 'The famous American actress Shirley Booth was rehearsing a scene on stage where she puts provisions she's bought into the fridge. And the director said, 'Shirley darling] We can't take this long]' So she came in again and did the scene in a fifth of the time, without hurrying. He asked how she did it. 'Oh I have a taxi outside with the meter running,' she said.' Occasionally the actor finds he has no techniques at all to hand. For The Pawnbroker Steiger had to 'invent' a moment while the camera was running. 'For the scene where I put my hand down on the spindle and the spike goes through, I had done a lot of rehearsal at home. But midway through the shot I thought to myself, 'You son of a bitch. You forgot to practice taking the hand off]' So I couldn't embarrass myself by stopping the camera. I just remembered what I did whenever I panicked, which was to hold my breath, and I took a deep lungful of air and then - phooh] - let it out.' Steiger's greatest early roles were plain men yanked into extremity. But in the late 1960s his career took a startling turn. He began behaving like a one-man Madame Tussauds. Pope John XXIII, Mussolini, Rasputin, WC Fields. Real historical figures, topped off by Napoleon in Waterloo. 'Oh that's a high]' he rhapsodises. 'If I could live for one tenth of a second at the exciting level of a great moment in history, because I somehow made myself believe it was happening to me, why not go for it?' So he bookwormed through the reference tomes. He had Napoleon's autopsy translated into English; he discovered that the man was riddled with diseases and drugs; he invented a scenario for the Waterloo defeat. 'I believe on the night before the battle he bombed himself out on laudanum.' The only thing Steiger refused to do was put his arm inside his coat. Not even for a publicity shot. 'What's a cliche? It's a given truth that's repeated so often that it becomes a bore, a joke. What makes a king or an emperor isn't gestures or royal vowel sounds - 'Men of Fraahnce]' The man may stammer; he may have a high lisping voice. What makes a king is that when he says he is thirsty, fifty people come bringing water]' And what makes an actor, I ask; knowing the clock is ticking towards a football match Steiger wants to watch on television. 'We're all of us actors. We act all day long. We act when we say no and we mean yes. We act when we say yes and we mean no. We act trying to seduce a woman. Acting belongs to everyone on earth. 'Why do we do it professionally? People ask me that. You put yourself under the microscope of the world; there must be something wrong with you. Well, I know why I do it.' (pause) 'Because I want respect.' (Hint of red again in the eyes). 'For me. For my family.' He lets the words sink into the silence. 'And now get out. (goodhumouredly). I'm turning the TV on] Goodbye]'</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Czech </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Jan Luptak, chairman of the Association of </F> Workers of Slovakia, by Oldrich Zabojnik; place and date not  given: "New Workers Party Is Taking Shape"]    [Text] Representatives of some parties devote increasing  attention to the founding of a new political entity--the  Association of Workers of Slovakia [Zdruzenie robotnikov  Slovenska, ZRS]. ZRS Chairman Jan Luptak, deputy to the  National Council of the Slovak Republic for the Party of the  Democratic Left [SDL], granted an interview to the Bratislava  correspondent of HOSPODARSKE NOVINY.    [Zabojnik] With what feelings did you, as the only worker in  the Slovak parliament, receive the contemptuous reaction of  deputies when you recently spoke about the difficult social  situation of people who live by the work of their own hands?    [Luptak] I was not surprised because it was not the first  such reaction. I have been to 245 factories and know exactly  what people in production take an interest in and what their  problems and worries are. It is their language I speak in  parliament.    [Zabojnik] How do these people respond to the declining  living standards and growing social tension?    [Luptak] Their stands are very harsh, and I cannot even  interpret them here. Workers at Hnust said to me, for example:  Remind Meciar of the promises he made when he was here and how  it all ended. We are now 600, out of an original work force of  2,600, and we are all worried about our jobs. The previous  management had salaries of 18,000 [currency not specified], and  their successors made themselves a gift of 22,000 and bought  themselves another posh limousine, in a situation in which the  factory has no money to pay wages. I think, therefore, that  transformation can hardly be made only on the backs of the  people below. This situation cannot last forever, in our  country or anywhere else. The Czech trade unions have also  already made that clear.    [Zabojnik] In the last public opinion survey in Slovakia,  your ZRS remained only 0.2 percent below the 5-percent threshold  necessary to get into parliament. Are you planning to go into  the elections on your own or as some kind of SDL reserves?    [Luptak] We are not reserves of the SDL; we are an  independent party. Workers must have a clear position in the  left-wing spectrum. They must exist as an organized opposition.  Of course, our aim is not a government of workers or some kind  of a dusted-down version of Bolshevism.    [Zabojnik] How many members does the ZRS muster, and from  where does it get funds?    [Luptak] After achieving a membership of 13,000, we have  stopped providing any more figures. Inasmuch as we are about to  go into the elections, we naturally do not want to abet other  parties in any way. Our funds come from collections organized  by workers in Martin, Ziar, and elsewhere among themselves. In  the ZRS headquarters in Banska Bystrica, we are also preparing  the publication of our own newspaper.    [Zabojnik] On what will your program be built?    [Luptak] On the fact that there exists no wealth greater  than people's work and skills. The situation must not be  tolerated, for example, of a society as poor as ours affording  the luxury of 360,000 unemployed who collect money produced by  the belt-tightening of others. It is necessary to separate  those who really do not have a chance [of finding a job] at the  moment from those who do not want to work and do not deserve  more than some 300-400 korunas in social support. Where shall  we end up with masses of people receiving 2,000-2,200 korunas  without moving a finger!?    [Zabojnik] What causes would your parliamentary deputies  pursue?    [Luptak] They would see to it that no laws are passed that  are directed against the interests of workers and the working  intelligentsia. Not only is the Labor Code directed against  workers, but also privatization as a whole, in the course of  which millions of people have been deprived of values they  themselves created. It is scandalous when rogues, cheats, and  criminal elements live at our expense. Workers have been  deceived many times since November [1989], and they have come to  understand that they must have their own party if they do not  want to become extinct as a social group.</p>

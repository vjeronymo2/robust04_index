			<p><P> November 11, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RETROSPECTIVES / POP MUSIC;  </P> <P> COSTELLO'S TRUE AIM  </P> <P>  ELVIS COSTELLO "Girls Girls Girls" Columbia  </P> <P> This master of words showed such immediate passion and skill that after just  two albums in the late '70s, he was hailed as the finest rock songwriter to  come out of Britain since since the '60s class of Lennon-McCartney, Davies and  Townshend.  </P> <P> No one since Dylan had zeroed in quite so convincingly on hypocrisy and deceit  in both relationships and the social order as Costello -- and no one had  attacked those traits so unflinchingly.  </P> <P> While the flashes of verbal warfare and rage gave Costello the reputation as  rock's angry young man, there were also elements of compassion and comfort in  many of the early songs -- as Costello acknowledged his own weaknesses and  needs.  </P> <P> The material on those two albums, "My Aim Is True" and "This Year's Model,"  combined wicked wit and blistering observation into such compact, near  sing-along formats that many early fans of Costello still look on those songs  as his best work.  </P> <P> One of the revelations of "Girls Girls Girls" is how, in truth, Costello has  grown as an artist: His work has advanced in both sophistication and insight  despite what might have looked at some points in his career like artistic  detours almost as puzzling as those of Neil Young and Lou Reed.  </P> <P> As suggested by the playful album title (taken from one of Elvis Presley's most  forgettable '60s movies), many of the songs are about relationships -- though  Costello uses women as a convenient symbol for tales of desire and  disappointment that are meant to reflect on the nature of the human character,  male and female.  </P> <P> The songwriter is our guide on this retrospective album, not just selecting and  sequencing the 47 songs on the CD version (51 songs on the much realigned  cassette edition), but also reflecting in the often humorous, self-depreciating  liner notes on the background of the songs.  </P> <P> He says 1979's tenacious "Pump It Up" was written shortly after rock's sex 'n'  drugs lifestyle beckoned, adding good-naturedly, "This anti-rock 'n' roll song  was my last stand before I gave in to it completely."  </P> <P> Rather than follow chronological order, Costello mixes selections according to  mood and loose-knit themes. By following "Party Girl" with "Shabby Doll" and  then "Motel Matches," for instance, Costello forces us to listen to songs with  dramatically different emotional shadings in marvelously unexected and  revealing new contexts.  </P> <P> For much of his career, Costello released albums so fast that you wondered if  he thought every idea that came into his head was worth sharing on record. The  lesson of "Girls Girls Girls" is that, aside from some occasional obliqueness,  they were worth sharing.ROBERT HILBURN  </P></p>

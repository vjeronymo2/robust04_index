			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Credit rating of Swedish bank cut again by S&amp;P SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest bank, yesterday suffered the third cut to its credit rating this year by Standard &amp; Poor's, reflecting continuing concern over the severe troubles facing the country's banking system. Svenska Handelsbanken, another leading commercial bank, also had its rating cut, while the ratings of Swedbank, a savings bank, and a number of mortgage companies, remain under review. Despite the proposed package of support from the government for the banking sector, Swedish financial institutions still face serious difficulties. 'We would expect 1993 to be another very bad year for credit losses in Sweden,' said Mr John Paulsen, a director of S&amp;P. While the worst of banks' property-related problems may be over, broader credit losses in the commercial and personal loan areas, resulting from economic recession, are expected next year. SEbanken, which started the year with a AA rating, yesterday had its Dollars 3.8bn of long-term debt downgraded from A+ to A-, with a stable outlook. S&amp;P added that the change incorporated 'an expectation of continued high levels of asset quality problems for the next few years'. Svenska Handelsbanken's Dollars 4.2bn of long-term debt was downgraded from AA- to A+, reflecting a sharp deterioration in the bank's asset quality due mainly to the depressed commercial property market.</p>

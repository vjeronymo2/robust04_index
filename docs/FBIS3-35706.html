			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A conference of Russian armed forces command  personnel has been held at the Defense Ministry. Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev noted that the main purpose of  the event was to analyze the work of the management bodies of  the General Staff and the Defense Ministry. In particular, he  pointed out shortcomings in the work of the cadre and  indoctrination structures of armed forces management bodies. In  their speeches the commanders in chief of the branches of the  Armed Forces noted that systematic combat training is taking  place among their troops. Combat readiness is being maintained  at the proper level in units and subunits. There have been no  disruptions in the performance of combat alert duties.    The main problem acutely facing the Armed Forces remains  financing. In order to prevent any disruptions in fuel  deliveries and food and electricity supplies and to carry out  military transportation tasks Grachev has issued instructions  that the Defense Ministry's reserves be used for these purposes.    He also drew attention to the question of bringing up to  strength the level of active service personnel at Russian  military units and subunits situated in so-called trouble spots.  In this connection Colonel-General Vladimir Semenov, commander  in chief of land forces, noted that these units are manned only  by volunteers who have signed contracts and who have served for  not less than six months in the Army.</p>

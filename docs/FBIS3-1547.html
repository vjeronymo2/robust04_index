Furthermore, it has given itself up to 1 April  to decide on the appeals for cancellation filed against seven  other deputies from the opposition coalition formed by the  Action Committee for Renewal [CAR] and the Togolese Union for  Democracy [UTD].    The CAR with 36 deputies and UTD with seven have won the  absolute majority of the 81 seats of the National Assembly.  Under the Constitution, this situation forces the head of  state, General Gnassingbe Eyadema, to appoint the future prime  minister from within this majority. The election of Bemba  Bahissa, a UTD member who won in the second constituency in Oti,  470 km northwestern Lome, was invalidated, because "his  alternate did not meet the conditions concerning residence in  Togo as provided for by the electoral laws," the source added.  Bahissa defeated the CAR candidate in the constituency during  the second round of the elections. Under the electoral laws, a  new election is to be held within one month following the  Court's decision.    The discussions for the appointment of the prime minister  have been going on since 15 March between President Eyadema and  the two opposition leaders, namely Yaovi Agboyibor of CAR and  UTD of Edem Kodjo. The two leaders agreed to propose the  candidacy of Agboyibor, but yesterday, Gen. Eyadema announced  that he would prefer to choose among many personalities,  claiming that the prime minister should not be "appointed by the  parliamentary majority," but by himself "from within" it.</p>

			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / The new boys and girls settle in: Philip Stephens tries to pick winners among the latest intake of MPs on their first day at Westminster IT was not hard to spot the new boys and girls as they milled around in the lobby of the House of Commons at yesterday's opening of the new parliament. Apart from fresh faces and brightly polished shoes, most of Westminster's new MPs sported proudly the photographic security badges which older hands have long since removed from their lapels. 'It's rather embarassing really, but I suppose they must be allowed to show off for a week or so,' offered one long-serving Tory. A colleague confessed that his grandchildren looked older than some of those with whom he would now be sharing a place on the government backbenches. Not all the newcomers displayed the awkwardness that comes with unfamiliarity. The more worldly-wise on the Conservative side were already busy arranging 'pairs' with their Labour counterparts under the system that allows matched government and opposition MPs to escape many late-night votes. Attending her first meeting of the parliamentary party, Ms Glenda Jackson, newly installed in Hampstead and Highgate, showed none of the humility that the Labour heirarchy expects of newcomers. To the chagrin of her 'seniors', Ms Jackson arrived 10 minutes late and then calmly took a seat alongside the party executive on the top table. Her confidence was matched by the determination of some on the Conservative side to make their first Commons television appearance during the election of the Speaker. Many ministers were forced to stand in the packed chamber, but Mr Gyles Brandreth - who has swapped a career in light entertainment for the constituency of Chester - managed somehow to find a place just behind the prime minister. In all, about a fifth of the 651 MPs who arrived to elect the Speaker of the new House of Commons yesterday were newcomers - with 120 of them split evenly between the Conservative and Labour benches. Labour's new entrants displayed little of the deep gloom that has engulfed the party leadership since April 9. The party may have lost the election but the presence of their new parliamentary recruits was testimony that they were individually victors. Those looking for clues as to who has a role in the machinations after Mr Neil Kinnock's resignation needed to glance no further than Mr Peter Mandelson, the former campaigns director now installed in Hartlepool. But it is on the Conservative side that the immediate interest of colleagues and the media will focus. For the next while, the game will be to pick 'winners' destined for ministerial office and, perhaps 20 years hence, for Downing Street. Among those already on the inside track are a clutch of former Whitehall advisers. Mr David Willetts, once of Mrs Margaret Thatcher's policy unit and more recently director of research at the centre for policy studies, has an obvious head start. So too do Mrs Judith Chaplin (Mr John Major's political adviser) and Mr David Lidington (an adviser to Mr Douglas Hurd). Mr Charles Hendry (formerly at social security), Mr Peter Luff (an aide at one time to Lord Young) and Mr Alan Duncan (whose Westminster house was the base for Mr John Major's leadership campaign) are among other putative stars. On the right of the party, Mr John Whittingdale's loyal service as an aide to Mrs Thatcher will stand him in good stead. For those who want to climb on to the first rung of the ministerial ladder, obedience to the party line will count for as much if not more than intelligence.</p>

			<p>941011 FT  11 OCT 94 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Frankfurt rockets up on short covering Over the weekend, two opinion polls predicted a hung parliament following this week's German general elections, and one pointed towards an outright victory for the chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl, writes Our Markets Staff. The addition of this ingredient to short covering in Frankfurt, the absence of the US bond market on a day's holiday and a comfortable start for the Dow made for phenomenal results in German equities yesterday, and other bourses came along for the ride. FRANKFURT saw its bond market stabilise, and appreciate, and the gain in bund futures transmitted to equities after last week's gloom which saw some pessimists talking about 1,850 for the Dax index while selling equities and Dax futures short. Short covering was the order of the day. Dealers said that they saw little true investment business as the Dax rose 64.20, or 3.3 per cent on the session, to 2,024.79 and put in another kick to close the post-bourse 70.89, or 3.6 per cent higher at an Ibis-indicated 2,048.56. Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM7.6bn. Big winners included stocks hurt in the market's recent bout of weakness, including Daimler, up DM41.40, or 5.6 per cent at DM778.90;in the post-disaster stock category, Metallgesellschaft rose DM15.90, or 11.4 per cent, to DM154.90. Other big winners included Bayernhypo in banks, Thyssen in steels and Volkswagen in carmakers, all up between 5 and 6 per cent; but there was little respite for the phamaceuticals group Schering, up only DM3 at DM898 ahead of yesterday's data from the competing Biogen in San Francisco. PARIS built on Friday's gains and, towards the end of the day, the CAC-40 index momentarily breached the 1,900 level for the first time since the end of September. However, the breakthrough was short-lived and the index ended the day at 1,898.32, up 41.94 points or 2.3 per cent. Following the decline to a new 1994 low during last week some analysts believed that the market was due for a rebound and forecast that the CAC-40 could well attain the 1,950-2,000 level by the end of the year. Bouygues went against the trend, losing FFr14 to FFr550, on reports that company officials had been interviewed recently in connection with a judicial investigation into financial irregularities. There was better news for Danone, up FFr8 at FFr704, as it confirmed that it was looking at the possibility of buying the Colman's division from Reckitt and Colman of the UK. The 'Euro stocks' went separate ways: EuroDisney weakened 25 centimes to FFr7.50 in spite of denying a report that attendance figures had fallen, while Eurotunnel improved 55 centimes to FFr21.95 as the company said that freight traffic was on target. ZURICH finished 2.3 per cent higher in a strong technical rebound, and the SMI index rose 56.5 to 2,553.4. Shares in UBS, under pressure last week as Mr Martin Ebner's BK Vision sought to increase its influence, bounced back. The bearers picked up SFr31 to SFr1,225, with UBS said to be a buyer of its own stock, while the registered added SFr6 to SFr296. CS Holding rose SFr21 to SFr530. Swiss Re gave up SFr10 to SFr689 with investors said to be still swapping to the other insurers. Zurich Insurance rose SFr30 to SFr1,185. Nestle rose SFr40 to SFr1,206 and Brown Boveri, which announced a Russian joint venture, was SFr18 ahead at SFr1,067. Among the pharmaceuticals, Ciba added SFr12 to SFr729 as investors awaiting third quarter sales figures tomorrow and Roche certificates, which reports its own third quarter sales details next Monday, rose SFr165 to SFr5,785. MILAN saw a technical rebound as some shares began to look relatively cheap after last week's cumulative 7.3 per cent losses and on short covering ahead of trading deadlines for the October account. The Comit index picked up 10.16 or 1.6 er cent to 640.06. Politics remained the driving force, but attention switched from the damaging row between the government and investigating magistrates to proposals aimed at distancing the prime minister, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, from his Dollars 7bn a year Fininvest media empire. Mr John Stewart at InterEuropa in Milan commented: 'The prospect of an immediate political crisis looks to have been averted but the situation remains extremely unstable.' Industrials led the market higher. Fiat was L110 higher at L6,360, Olivetti rose L30 to L1,900 and Pirelli was up L45 at L2,270. Financials followed the trend. BCI was L50 higher at L3,600 and Credito Italiano rose L40 to L1,940. Generali was L700 ahead at L38,700, but Ras gave up L350 to L20,350, still depressed by talk of a capital increase to finance its purchase of the Swiss Eliva insurance group. Benetton bounced L1,170 or 6.3 per cent higher to L19,670, paring some of last week's sharp losses. AMSTERDAM moved forward as equities were encouraged by strength in the bond market. The AEX index rose 5.84 or 1.5 per cent to 398.71. Philips, up 80 cents at Fl 53.20, was bought on news that it had signed a co-operation agreement with IBM of the US for the production of semi-conductors at the latter's German factory. Reports of changes in the Dutch broadcasting system initially affected the performance of VNU, the publishing house, which has a substantial stake in two commercial channels. VNU fell to Fl 171.20, rallied to a session high of Fl 175.30 before closing at Fl 174.00.

The province has reaped bumper grain harvests for three  years  running despite frequent natural disasters. Last year, the  grain output of the province hit a record of over 12 billion kg.    Local agricultural officials attributed the success mainly  to  the efforts made by the provincial government in improving basic  facilities for agricultural use.    According to local sources, in the past six years, the  province has managed to raise more than three billion yuan  (about 345 million U.S. dollars) for farmland improvement  projects, such as building of more water control works and  arable land, and for the harnessing of biological environment  and for comprehensive agricultural development.    In addition, the province has also introduced more than 500  million U.S. dollars in foreign investment to support the  development of agriculture.    At the same time, the province, believed to be one of the  country's most backward areas, has also strengthened the  manufacturing of means of production for agricultural use and  sped up the construction of mechanization of agriculture.</p>

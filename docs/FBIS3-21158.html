The tactile feedback you get lets you adjust your grip  to the resilience of the object. A rock you can really grab,  while a cotton ball you need to nab gingerly so it doesn't get  crushed.    A human's tactile system is sensitive enough to deal with  most objects, but for something really small, say a millimeter  in size, feedback is lacking and we have no control. This poses  a problem for engineers designing tools for precision  manipulation, like during microsurgery or during the handling of  individual cells in a biotechnology lab.    A group at Tokyo's Hosei University has developed a  master-slave robot hand designed to overcome this problem. Its  prototype consists of a V-shaped master control shaped like a  grip strengthener, and a slave hand shaped like a set of  pincers. When the user grips the control, the pincers close to  grasp a small object. At the same time, a strain gauge built  into the pincers conveys information back about the resilience  of the object.    Through a computer interface, the resilience of the V-shaped  handle is changed so the user can ``sense'' that the object has  been grasped and can adjust the amount of force applied.    The prototype manipulator is 10cm long. In tests, users were  able to grasp objects ranging in size from 15mm to 2mm, and they  were also able to discriminate differences in softness between  objects of the same size.    The group aims to combine the robot hand with a manipulator  table and a microscope in order to develop a tool which can be  used to grasp microorganisms and other small objects.</p>

Bahia Governor Antonio Carlos Magalhaes [ACM] is  threatening to review the PFL [Liberal Front Party]'s support  for the government only a few days before the decisive battle to  approve the economic plan in Congress. "The government has  suffered a serious credibility crisis," the governor said on 18  February. "This is why we must renegotiate the pact that made  possible PFL support for the FSE."    The PFL was one of the main parties responsible for a full  plenary session during the first voting session on the FSE, when  the government amendment was approved. This is why ACM's threat  carries a strong risk that the decisive voting session might be  postponed. "It can be delayed, yes," the governor admitted. In  order to have the amendment approved in the decisive session the  government needs the votes of 293 legislators, which requires  broad support. This support was weakened recently by Itamar  Franco's behavior during Carnival and his remarks in favor of  the candidacy of Finance Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso for  the presidency.    FSE resources are essential for the government to balance  the  public deficit and begin the second stage of the plan providing  for the implementation of the Real Value Unit (URV). Political  parties are aware of the consequences if the plan is not  approved by 10 March, when the deadline for negotiating the  foreign debt with the IMF expires. But many politicians are  willing to delay a vote on the plan to prevent the minister from  running for the presidency. Tarcisio Delgado (PMDB-MG [Brazilian  Democratic Movement Party- Minas Gerais]), leader of the largest  bloc in Congress, is facing the possibility of a vote on 23  February with "moderate optimism." Today the PMDB will have a  meeting with all its deputies and senators to reevaluate its  support for the government. The mood of the party turned more  serious after the president's support for Cardoso's candidacy  because the PMDB is reluctant to approve measures offering  electoral profit to the minister.    The PPR [Progressive Renewal Party] already has announced  that it will again insist on the approval of measures keeping  funds for education and housing intact. That could represent a  loss of $2 billion for the FSE. The party will try to close an  agreement with rebellious PMDB legislators that might make the  life of the government miserable. That alliance is supported  even by some groups inside the PFL, which is also against  Cardoso's candidacy. On 18 February, legislators again could not  gather enough numbers for a quorum for a session. There were 40  deputies on the premises and only 18 of them went to the  auditorium to ask if there was going to be a session.</p>

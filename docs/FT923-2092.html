			<p>920919 FT  19 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Liberty falls sharply as recession bites PRE-TAX PROFITS at Liberty, the fashion and fabric group, fell sharply, from Pounds 1.65m to Pounds 648,000, in the six months to August 1, against a background of continuing recession on the high street. Mr John Pugh, finance director, admitted: 'The results are not terrifically exciting, but it has been pretty tough in the UK.' However, recent events, which will allow tourists to spend more, 'have to be positive for us'. The main reasons for the downturn were doubled losses to Pounds 1.11m (Pounds 564,000) in retailing where turnover rose some Pounds 400,000 to Pounds 23.3m, and halved profits to Pounds 869,000 (Pounds 1.82m) in converting and wholesaling where turnover declined to Pounds 8.69m (Pounds 11.3m). He said there was a lack of larger ticket sales, like furniture and furnishing fabrics, because of the poor housing market, and a shift away from printed fabrics in the fashion industry. Mr Brian Myerson, speaking for Concerto Capital Corporation, his family's investment vehicle and owner of 15.6 per cent of Liberty's voting shares, described the performance as 'dismal, very disappointing'. However, he thought it was 'not a company problem - Liberty has enormous potential - but a management problem'. He said the results vindicated his concerns about the way the company was run, concerns he raised in the extraordinary meeting in June when he called for equality of voting rights and the appointment of non-executives to the board. He said he would remain a pro-active investor. Mr Pugh pointed to the rise in profits - to Pounds 538,000 (Pounds 492,000) on turnover up at Pounds 4.37m (Pounds 3.88m) - in the French printing operations, and said that July 1991's rent review was showing a benefit, with rental income growing to Pounds 782,000 (Pounds 607,000). Debt was cut and gearing reduced from 19 per cent to 7 per cent. Earnings tumbled to 0.46p (5.13p) per share, but the interim dividend is held at an uncovered 1.85p. Mr Pugh was 'not worried at all' by this, pointing to the seasonal bias of the business.</p>

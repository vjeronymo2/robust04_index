			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / International Company News: Saudi bank plans to double its capital Saudi Investment Bank, the kingdom's smallest by capitalisation, plans to double its capital to SR180m (Dollars 48.6m) through a one-for-one offer of 900,000 shares to shareholders. The share transfer will be paid for by a SR90m transfer from reserves. The transfer will keep SIB's shareholding structure. The bank is more than 40 per cent owned by Saudi private shareholders, with the remainder being held by local and international banks, including Chase Manhattan (which has 15 per cent), Industrial Bank of Japan and J. Henry Schroder Wagg. The bank said the planned capital increase, which is to be put to a shareholders' meeting in Riyadh on July 11, would 'give some psychological feeling to our customers and correspondents' and 'bring our capital closer to that of our peers', but not alter the bank's strategy. 'We are going to continue on our strategy to be a quality corporate bank for the kingdom, catering for sophisticated business clients,' it added. SIB, which has only 10 branches in the kingdom, has always seen itself as a 'boutique' corporate lender, with a strong emphasis also on private banking as a leading broker in Saudi Arabia's stock market. Banks monopolise direct brokerage in the kingdom's Dollars 50bn-capitalised stock market, which is closed to foreign investors. SIB's recapitalisation will not affect its position as one of the kingdom's smallest banks. It is among the last of the kingdom's 11 listed commercial banks to recapitalise over the past few years, during which most banks have taken advantage of the post Gulf war stock market boom to issue new stock.</p>

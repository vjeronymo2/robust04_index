			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed report: "Heroin and Cocaine Seized"] </F>   [Excerpts] Their obvious nervousness was the undoing of  two drug couriers from Slovakia. As Joachim Pirker from the  Vienna Security Office reported, 26-year-old Jozef F. and his  22-year-old compatriot Radoslav K. were arrested at the  Westbahnhof railroad station in Vienna on 14 May. [passage  omitted]    F. and K. tried first to pose as harmless tourists. However,  in their car, a rented Skoda with a Slovak license plate, the  officials found about one kg of heroin of very good quality,  which was packed in small portions in a plastic bag and is  valued at about 4 million schillings. After first denials, the  Slovaks became entangled in contradictions and finally admitted  that as drug couriers they had "supplied" heroin from the  Bratislava area via Austria to Switzerland and Germany for  months.    So far, the security office has succeeded in proving eight  smuggling trips against the two men, where heroin valued at a  total of about 22 million schillings had been transported. Only  two days before their arrest, F. and K. had been with four kg of  the drug in Switzerland. F. and K. were not able or willing to  say anything about the people behind them. However, they are  probably Kosovo Albanians.    The drug squad at Vienna-Schwechat Airport has again exposed  a Colombian drug courier. On Wednesday [18 May], the man had  arrived from Ecuador via Amsterdam with 770 grams of cocaine  with a black market value of about 2 million schillings in the  false bottom of his travel bag and the hollowed-out soles of his  shoes.

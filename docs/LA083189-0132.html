			<p><P> August 31, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BLACK YOUTH'S MOURNERS CALL FOR END TO VIOLENCE  </P> <P> Mourners packed a church and the street outside Wednesday to remember a black  teen-ager killed last week by a white gang, cheering as the Rev. Louis  Farrakhan and others demanded an end to racial violence.  </P> <P> "We say, as the Jews say, 'Never again. Never again. Never again,' " the Black  Muslim leader said to cheers and applause from more than 300 people attending  Yusef Hawkins' funeral at Glover Memorial Baptist Church.  </P> <P> About 1,000 people stood outside singing hymns and listening to eulogies for  Hawkins, 16, who was shot to death Aug. 23 in the predominantly white Brooklyn  neighborhood of Bensonhurst.  </P> <P> The service began an hour after two white Brooklyn youths, including one  identified as the gang's leader, were charged with murder. Both remained free  on bail.  </P> <P> Police continued hunting for an 18-year-old man believed to be the triggerman.  </P> <P> "As long as white children can get away with killing black children, and white  law enforcement does not know how to make examples of its own . . . then  justice is far off," Farrakhan said.  </P> <P> While none of the speakers advocated violence, the Rev. Al Sharpton indicated  the time for a passive response to such incidents had passed.  </P> <P> "We're not going to let you down. They're going to pay this time, Yusef,"  Sharpton said. "It's time for us to change our ways. We can run a man for the  White House, but we can't walk a child through Bensonhurst."  </P> <P> Hawkins' slaying triggered a racial furor in New York unseen since a black man  died fleeing a white gang in the Howard Beach section of Queens.  </P> <P> "Let freedom ring from Howard Beach, Mr. Mayor," the Rev. Curtis Wells, pastor  of the church and a cousin of the victim, said in addressing Mayor Edward I.  Koch. "Let freedom ring from Bensonhurst. We're not going to take it any more.  We're going to walk where we want to walk."  </P> <P> Hawkins and three friends were answering an ad for a used car when up to 30  whites carrying bats, golf clubs and at least one gun confronted them,  authorities said.  </P> <P> A grand jury Wednesday charged Keith Mondello, 18, and Pasquale Raucci, 19,  with second-degree murder and Raucci with manslaughter.  </P></p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Society uses BES for homes disposal BRISTOL &amp; West Building Society will today become the first society to use the government's Business Expansion Scheme to try to take repossessed properties off its balance sheet and rent them to the private sector through assured tenancies. The society has spent two years trying to devise a method of using the scheme - which offers tax relief to savers who make five-year investments - to reduce its stock of repossessions. Any such scheme has to be approved by the Building Societies Commission. The Pounds 45m Bristol &amp; West scheme is intended to rent out up to 800 of the society's repossessed properties through housing associations. Building societies' legal duty to gain the highest possible price for repossessed properties has largely prevented them from renting directly to tenants. Mr Tony FitzSimons, the society's chief executive, said last night that the scheme would offer investors attractive returns, and would allow the society to move properties off its balance sheet without selling them at low prices because they are repossessions. The society has established a separate company as a vehicle for the scheme. Many building societies have been trying to devise ways of reducing the stock of repossessed properties, which have obliged them to increase their provisions for bad debts.</p>

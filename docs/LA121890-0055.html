			<p><P> December 18, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> MONROVIA FIRM'S UNIT GUIDES DESERT SOLDIERS;  </P> <P> DEFENSE: HAND-HELD SATELLITE RECEIVER CAN LOCATE TROOPS WITHIN 75 FEET. THE  ARMY HAS ORDERED 592 FOR PERSIAN GULF OPERATIONS.  </P> <P> Soldiers used to march off to battle guided only by the humble compass. But  U.S. Army troops will soon be negotiating the Saudi Arabian desert with the  help of $3,500 hand-held satellite receivers made in Monrovia.  </P> <P> The Monrovia-based Magellan Systems Corp. was recently awarded a $2-million  contract to send 592 of the devices -- about the size of a mobile phone -- to  the Army's 1st Infantry Division, which is shipping out to the Persian Gulf  this month from its base at Ft. Riley, Kan.  </P> <P> Similar devices made by other companies already are in use in the Persian Gulf.  </P> <P> "There was a shortage of this type of navigation system in the Army's  inventory," said Mark Meseke, media relations officer for Ft. Riley and the 1st  Infantry Division.  </P> <P> The Army bought the devices to make sure that its soldiers would not get lost  in the desert, he said. The receivers will be distributed among the division's  11,500 soldiers.  </P> <P> To operate the device, a soldier presses the "position" button and punches in  his approximate latitude and longitude, within 300 miles. The correct location  then is displayed on a small screen at the top of the receiver. The device can  pinpoint a location within 75 feet.  </P> <P> The receiver uses signals from four satellites to make its calculations. It  provides information on longitude, latitude and altitude.  </P> <P> Magellan already has delivered 240 of the portable devices, said Randy D.  Hoffman, the company's president and chief executive officer. The rest will be  delivered Dec. 28.  </P> <P> Magellan also has contracts with the British Ministry of Defense and the Saudi  Arabian frontier forces. Hoffman said France and Italy have also bought a few  for their soldiers in the Middle East.  </P> <P> Dennis Degen, the company's sales operation manager, said Iraqi troops would be  unable to pick up the satellite signals because they lack the receivers and the  technological know-how.  </P> <P> "We are not allowed to sell to countries that the federal government has a  trade embargo against," Hoffman said. These countries include Iraq, Iran, North  Vietnam, North Korea, Cuba and Libya, he said.  </P> <P> Magellan began designing the hand-held receivers for commercial use more than  three years ago.  </P></p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Letter: Questions of pensions security Sir, Mr H R Wynne-Griffith (Letters, February 15) refers, in respect of the Maxwell pension funds, to the situation in which banks appear to have title to collateral received by them as security for loans where such collateral was not in the ownership of the borrowers. In these circumstances, why should not those banks and their employees responsible for these transactions be charged with receiving or handling stolen property?

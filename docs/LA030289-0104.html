			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MAN GOES ON TRIAL IN DEATH OF HIS BRIDE ON HONEYMOON CRUISE  </P> <P> It was a bright Saturday afternoon in February, the sun suspended over a glassy  sea, when Coast Guard searchers spotted two tiny points of white bobbing in the  water off the coast of San Diego.  </P> <P> The cutter moved in closer, and the two spots became the toes of Karen Waltz  Roston's tennis shoes, floating in the still Pacific above her bruised and  bloodied face -- the first concrete indication that Roston's honeymoon cruise  to Mexico might not have ended as her new husband had said.  </P> <P> Scott Roston had told the cruise ship's captain that his 26-year-old wife had  tumbled overboard the night before in a stiff wind. The bruises on her forehead  and neck belied that explanation even at first glance. So did the puncture  wound in her abdomen. Coast Guard Lt. Jeff Lee said even his seasoned rescue  team was disturbed by its cargo as they headed back for port.  </P> <P> "I directed the chief to say a prayer on the Bible, to kind of calm everybody  down," Lee testified Wednesday on the opening day of Scott Roston's trial on  charges of second-degree murder on the high seas.  </P> <P> Roston's lawyer, David Kenner, told a federal court jury in Los Angeles that  Roston was afraid to tell investigators initially that his wife had apparently  been murdered by Israeli agents -- agents who had first drugged him into  unconsciousness -- in retribution for a book he had written about Israeli human  rights abuses.  </P> <P> "There was no motive or reason or rationale for Dr. Roston to take the life of  the woman he had wanted so long to marry," Kenner said in his opening  statement.  </P> <P> But Assistant U.S. Atty. Kendra McNally sketched a picture of a honeymoon gone  awry, of a bridegroom annoyed by his wife's lack of social sophistication and  her propensity for sweets and of a bride constantly afraid of annoying her new  husband.  </P> <P> McNally said that after "a fight" about an hour earlier, Roston accompanied his  wife to a jogging track on the upper-level deck of the ship and began  strangling her.  </P> <P> "The force of his hands on her throat was enough to cause bleeding in all the  muscles of her neck, but it did not kill her so he lifted her, still breathing,  still alive, over a 3 1/2-foot wall and dropped her into the dark, quiet sea  where she drowned," the prosecutor said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Santa Monica Chiropractor  </P> <P> Roston, a 27-year-old Santa Monica chiropractor, walked to the table tennis  room two decks below and told a trio of musicians that his wife had just been  blown overboard by strong winds. He explained the scratches on his face by  saying he had run into a piece of equipment when he had turned in response to  her cries for help.  </P> <P> But McNally said the ship's captain will testify that Roston asked to use a  bathroom immediately after being asked about the scratches, then was seen to  examine his face in a mirror, wash it and leave the bathroom without ever using  the other facilities.  </P> <P> After he was arrested, Roston asserted that Israeli agents had been following  him and harassing him since he wrote a book about "atrocities" in Israel,  "Nightmare in Israel," and had drugged him and apparently murdered his wife.  </P> <P> Kenner said there is evidence, in fact, that two Israeli nationals were aboard  the Stardancer during the cruise, but both have since returned to Israel and  cannot be subpoenaed to testify at the trial.  </P> <P> "Because of what happened to him in Israel, he was afraid, in fact, for his own  life while still on that ship, to discuss and to reveal his recollection of  what occurred on that ship and his belief as to why," Kenner said, admitting  the allegations may appear "unbelievable."  </P> <P> "But these kinds of events do happen in the world of international intrigue,"  he told jurors.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Witnesses Shared Table  </P> <P> Among the first witnesses were two passengers who were assigned to the Rostons'  table in the ship's dining room, an Oregon homemaker and her daughter from  Seattle, who testified that Roston frequently seemed irritated when his wife  would show up late for dinner or, on another occasion, expressed confusion at  the array of silverware on the table for a formal dinner.  </P> <P> "He seemed embarrassed and more or less perturbed that she would admit she  didn't know all these different silverware," Carol Abramson testified. "At  times his eyes would flash at her, and right away she would drop her eyes and  then hardly say anything."  </P> <P> Abramson's daughter, Peggy Thompson, said Roston once made a "startling"  statement during dinner about his work as a chiropractor.  </P> <P> "He mentioned that one of the things he liked about being a chiropractor was  the sense of power it gave you," she said. "When he had the person in a  position that he could either cure them or he could do great harm to them."  </P> <P> Roston, if convicted on the second-degree murder charge, could face up to life  in prison. The trial before U.S. District Judge James M. Ideman is expected to  last three weeks.  </P></p>

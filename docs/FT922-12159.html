			<p>920421 FT  21 APR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats after rise in bond yields Wall Street AFTER three consecutive days of record-setting gains, US stock markets ran into heavy selling yesterday as investors reacted negatively to fresh declines in Tokyo and sharply higher bond yields at home, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished 30.19 down at 3,336.31, although about 20 points above a mid-afternoon low for the day. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 receded 5.89 to 410.16 and the Nasdaq composite of over-the-counter stocks dropped 14.61 to 577.20. Turnover on the New York SE came to 192m shares. Early weakness had been expected, although the magnitude of the losses surprised many analysts. Most of last Thursday's gains were linked to the monthly expiration of stock index futures and options and had disguised the underlying soft tone in a market that looked overbought. Another substantial drop in Tokyo share prices overnight, and a rise in US bond yields triggered by Friday's bullish housing data, exacerbated a downward trend established at the start by profit-taking. The Dow's retreat would have been greater but for strength in Caterpillar, which rose Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 56 as investors continued to respond to the end of the union strike at the company, and Alcoa, up Dollars 1 1/8 at Dollars 77 3/4 on hopes that its earnings will recover alongside the economic rebound. Otherwise, quarterly earnings continued to dominate sentiment among individual stocks and sectors. Chase Manhattan shed Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 23 1/2 after reporting a 20 per cent rise in first-quarter net income to Dollars 141m but also warning that loan-loss provisions would remain at relatively high levels for the foreseeable future. Eli Lilly lost Dollars 2 to Dollars 69 3/4 after news of first-quarter profits of Dollars 442.6m, up from Dollars 388.6m at the same stage a year ago. The drug group also said it would acquire a majority interest in a German pharmaceutical company, pending approval from German anti-trust authorities. Among entertainment stocks, Capital Cities/ABC dropped Dollars 10 3/4 to Dollars 457 1/4 on a decline in quarterly earnings to Dollars 41.7m. Time Warner slipped Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 102 7/8 after announcing a Dollars 60m multi-media deal with pop star Madonna. Microsoft fell Dollars 9 1/2 to Dollars 118 1/8 after warning that income growth will slow next year. Canada TORONTO stocks drifted lower in very light trade. The composite index ended 16.3 off at 3,398.8. Falls led rises by 308 to 164 on volume of 11.9m shares. South Africa was closed.</p>

			<p>940901 FT  01 SEP 94 / Arts: Capitalism stuck in a time-warp - Cinema THE HUDSUCKER PROXY (PG) Joel Coen WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN (15) Luis Mandoki THE SLINGSHOT (12) Ake Sandgren BOSNA] Bernard-Henri Levy If you can imagine Death Of A Salesman gift-wrapped for Christmas by Frank Capra - and I sympathise if you cannot - you will have an idea of The Hudsucker Proxy. The film-making Coen brothers, writer-director Joel and writer-producer Ethan, have long been threatening to make an overblown, under-conceived movie. Blood Simple was a modest but punch-packing murder thriller; Raising Arizona was a slight but funny baby-napping comedy; Miller's Crossing was a rich, labyrinthine, intermittently barmy tale of American-Irish gangster wars. Then came Barton Fink, stylish, bloated, loved by the French and beginning to hint at major vacuity. Now we have The Hudsucker Proxy, a whimsical enormity in which the brothers' whole creative operation seems to have been surrendered to their production designer, Dennis Gassner and his numerous assistants. Size and show have been used to cover up the pinbrained premise. Amid over-rich sets - every room looks like Grand Central Station, every actor seems to be drowning in the ochre-and-twilight light - we watch a fable of man's greedy quest for enrichment. Takeovers threaten Hudsucker Industries, New York, after the suicide of their chairman just before Christmas, 1958. We see this in flashback: Waring Hudsucker (Charles Durning) taxi-ing for take-off on the boardroom table before flying through the window. Can his aide and next-in-line Sidney Mussburger (Paul Newman) lower the company's stock, thereby enabling the board to buy control? And might not the best way to effect that devaluation be to appoint a nincompoop as chairman? Enter mailboy Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins), upon which everything goes according to plan. The movie's moral plan, that is, not Newman's money plan. Norville sends the stock skyrocketing with his first theoretically silly invention - the hula hoop (all resemblances to real history . . . ) - and by the close he is announcing something even more stupid called a frisbee. Between the crunching ironies about small dreams triumphing in the teeth of repressive corporate ambition, our hero is visited and romanced by a character we can only call the Ghost of Screwball Heroines Past. She is reporter Amy Archer, played by Jennifer Jason Leigh as if the Coens had sat her down at a phonograph with records of Katharine Hepburn and Jean Arthur and told her to stay until she could do them both to a turn. A 'turn' is what the poor actress then gives us. We feel our minds' ears being dragged through Mr Smith Goes To Washington and Mr Deeds Goes To Town and Bringing Up Baby, as if not only were there no tomorrow but today had been forced at gunpoint to turn into yesterday. Everything in The Hudsucker Proxy is nostalgic pastiche: from the corny-sumptuous Khachaturian music (recognisable to ex-addicts of TV's The Onedin Line) to the lovingly mocked-up skyscrapers embossed with giant clocks, out of Citizen Kane by Harold Lloyd. As for the film's David-versus-Goliath view of industrial politics, it is stuck around the year of Fritz Lang's Metropolis. The Coens play their capitalism-trashing fable for comedy not epic melodrama; but its simplifications still seem retarded. In this world everyone who holds power (Newman) or gains power (Robbins) becomes corrupt. 'Little' ideas are the truly durable ones. And only the love of a good woman can hope to turn our hero from the path of moral degeneration. Sad, sententious, time-warped. Wake me up when the Coen brothers reach 1994. ***** Hollywood has traditionally been reluctant to make films about alcoholism, writes Stephen Amidon. When drunks do appear on screen, they are usually used for either comic relief or a quick shot of pathos. Eliciting sympathy for the addict is a tricky business, requiring the genius of a Jack Lemmon or a Michael Keaton. Far better to afflict your hero with a less problematic disease. The makers of When a Man Loves a Woman seem to have lost sight of this fact, creating a wino weepie that never really engages the audience's sympathy. In it, yuppie Alice Green (Meg Ryan) tries to kick her quart-a-day Vodka habit at an exclusive clinic, while her hunky, caring husband (Andy Garcia) looks after their angelic kids in a San Francisco dream home, aided by a diligent ethnic nanny. Setting aside the obvious cavil that if someone who looked like Meg Ryan drank a quart of Stoli a day she would not look much like Meg Ryan, it would still take a rare film indeed to make us care for such a pampered character. Unfortunately, director Luis Mandoki tries to push all our pity buttons without first earning our respect. He, along with writers Ronald Bass and Al Franken, would have us believe that their heroine merely catches alcoholism as she might 'flu. It doesn't wash. Kicking the bottle certainly has its heroic elements, but they are of a different order than those found in, say, terminal cases. Ryan is at a loss to portray a character for whom hitting bottom means taking a baby step down the social ladder, while Andy Garcia is equally at sea as her beleaguered spouse. Only Ellen Burstyn as Ryan's acerbic mother can inject some realistic passion into the film, suggesting that somebody might be to blame for this boozing after all. ***** The Slingshot is one of those perfectly pitched coming-of-age stories that the Swedish film industry churns out with alarming regularity. Set in 1920s Stockholm, it follows the exploits of Roland, a poor yet resourceful 12-year-old who wins friends by using the condoms his progressive parents distribute to make slingshots. Director Ake Sandgren's touch is as light as a feather, allowing him to modulate scenes of ribald anarchy and gentle emotion without ever hitting a wrong note. Lesser talents would have turned the prophylactic weaponry into the film's centrepiece, but Sandgren wisely keeps it just one of many arresting images of youth. And it is a measure of the director's ironic sensibility that when Roland finally escapes poverty for his childhood paradise, his destination turns out to be a reform school. Bernard-Henri Levy's Bosna] is an old-style polemic whose maker would like nothing better than to have its audience storm out of the ICA, rush across The Mall and besiege the Foreign Office, demanding something be done about the situation in Bosnia. Levy spent several months in the Balkans last year, collecting imagery too powerful for the TV news - snipers at work, the aftermath of bombings and beheadings, and one unforgettable scene of a concentration camp inmate dying of shock after being given his first drink of water in three days. Levy argues that the Bosnian government's fate is a political situation which the west has cravenly transformed into a humanitarian crisis. It is a compelling point, though the director's unchecked partisanship hinders his argument. The Serbs are referred to as 'scum' and at no time are they asked to give their side of the story, weak as it may be. NATO's recent air strikes, meanwhile, undercut Levy's accusations of western inaction. That said, this remains a disturbing documentary that should shame everyone who claims to suffer from compassion fatigue.</p>

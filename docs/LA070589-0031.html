			<p><P> July 5, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> ROSE FINDS SOLACE IN THE GAME  </P> <P> Tug McGraw stood on the floor of Veterans Stadium on Monday, staring across the  field at Pete Rose.  </P> <P> Rose, the Cincinnati Reds manager, had just pulled away from the batting cage,  leaving in his wake a trail of reporters, former teammates and club personnel.  Rose then retreated to the visiting team's dugout, where only he and his demons  sat.  </P> <P> "You know, whenever I get my name in the paper over some simple thing,  something stupid, it infuriates me," said McGraw, Rose's former Philadelphia  Phillie teammate. "When I think about what he's going through every day, all  the articles and headlines, it amazes me he hasn't snapped. He must have some  incredible inner peace."  </P> <P> What Rose has is baseball. For a few hours, balls and strikes blot out writs  and appeals, gambling charges and the bitter warfare between accused and  commissioner. The game not only breaks up his day, it's about the only thing  that can break through the cloud of despair engulfing him.  </P> <P> That cloud forms wherever Rose goes. It's inescapable because his predicament,  mixed with his celebrity, deems it so. Rose always used to hold court rather  than depend on them for relief. Nowadays he hides in the shadows in order to  escape the harsh glare.  </P> <P> So Rose retreated Monday. Still, reporters found him. And the media, including  this writer, sat, listened and waited for Rose to volunteer yet another morsel  concerning his predicament even though he has long ago stated he has run out of  answers. Some days he tries, which those around him say is to his credit. "Pete  has really done a super job on keepino it away from the team," Reds outfielder  Ken Griffey said.  </P> <P> Monday was one of those days when Rose seemed out of the energy needed to carry  through one more day of dealing with such questions. Talked out, Rose made only  a passing reference to an old intimate in the Philadelphia press corps, saying  he would do whatever his lawyers suggested concerning upcoming court cases.  </P> <P> Still the reporters waited, just as they have every day since March, when it  was first revealed Rose was being investigated for allegedly gambling on  baseball.  </P> <P> A lifetime ban -- which some believe is the equivalent of a death sentence to  Rose -- has hung over Rose ever since. The charges and the ambiguities as to  what is right or wrong grow with each passing day. Even as he sat in the dugout  watching his team prepare to play the Phillies, Rose's life took another turn.  The lawsuit he filed charging Commissioner A. Bartlett Giamatti with bias was  ordered out of the jurisdiction of a Cincinnati court that had'issued a  temporary restraining order in Rose's favor. Now Rose's fate -- and that of  baseball's case against him -- is in the hands of federal judges.  </P> <P> After the Reds beat the Phillies, 2-1, Rose would talk only to writers who  travel with the Reds. He told them, "We sort of expected that (the case would  be taken out of Cincinnati) ... We don't think it has any merit."  </P> <P> Still, news like that can't make his day. What does?  </P> <P> "This," Rose said, motioning around the dugout. "And winning. It's the ofly  fun."  </P> <P> To call it an ever-tightening noose might be putting it mildly. That it cannot  be fun being Peter Edward Rose is obvious, written in every crease in his face.  And nothing makes him smile -- except baseball. Those questions he welcomes.  And perhaps the only thing Rose does more defiantly than defend his integrity  against his accusers is keep that one little vestige of happiness intact.  </P> <P> So it was, on Monday, when Rose lit up the dugout. Because the subject turned  to baseball. That he can talk about all day. That one subject, with its endless  number of anecdotes and memories, erases the worry, the uncertainty and what  has to be a world of pain he still has yet to reveal.  </P> <P> Just being in the Vet was enough to stir the memories.  </P> <P> "This was a great place to play baseball," said Rose, who helped lead the  Phillies to the World Series in 1980 and 1983. "It seemed like this ballpark  was packed every night."  </P> <P> "I couldn't wait to get out here early and play (Greg) Luxinski in gin," Rose  said, his eyes dancing. "I rode the subway. ... Sure, I did. It only cost 40  cents and I couldn't get lost. This was the last stop."  </P> <P> Rose talked of his love for the Phillies fans, his hate for the alibis used by  some that the fans here are toughest in the game. "They don't boo effort," he  said.  </P> <P> Other memories flooded back. "Nolan Ryan struck me out three times in a game  here," Rose said. "I loved facing Nolan because he made you work your butt off.  He was fun to hit off of."  </P> <P> Then there was his former teammate, Mike Schmidt, whose tearful farewell May 29  Rose understood, but probably could never emulate. Heck, Rose didn't even think  Schmidt should have quit. "He was in shape, he could still play," Rose said.  </P> <P> Rose's eyes lit up when reminded the Phillies had not won the National League  pennant in a while (since 1950) before his arrival. "Yeah, then we got to the  big one, the World Series," Rose said, a broad smile crossing his face. "And we  won the big time. It took 97 years to do that here."  </P> <P> He was, for a few moments, the one and only Rose people dearly want to  remember, the embodiment of a boy in a man's body, playing a kid's game. And at  such moments it seems all the sadder that it must matter whether he broke the  rules or not.  </P> <P> Just as Rose can no longer freeze the frame so that only the winning and the  glory days are remembered, baseball cannot go back to the days right before it  realized it had no recourse but to investigate.  </P> <P> "I feel for the guy," McGraw said. "... But it's like people say. You have to  be accountable for your own dilemmas."  </P></p>

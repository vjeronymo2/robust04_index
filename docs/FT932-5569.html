			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / Pride suspended over the Tyne LEADERS OF the campaign to save the troubled Swan Hunter shipyard hope the launch today of a Pounds 1.4m ferry will not be the last in the company's 130-year history. The Pride of the Tyne (above) was the last vessel order received before Swan Hunter went into receivership after failing to win a helicopter carrier contract three weeks ago. The 25m ferry, built for the Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive, was small enough to be lowered into the water by crane. Many of the 1,800 workers remaining at the yard are mainly employed in fitting out three frigates. Talks between the receivership team and the Ministry of Defence have so far guaranteed work on the frigates only up to the end of next week. However, further negotiations could result in the ships being completed at the yard.</p>

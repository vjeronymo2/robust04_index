			<p>920319 FT  19 MAR 92 / Financial markets cheered but remain cautious CLOSER trade, investment, and financial links with South Africa were predicted in the financial and business community yesterday following the referendum, although there was caution about the future. Commerzbank, one of Germany's largest commercial banks, said it would proceed with a bond issue for Escom, the electricity utility, which had been postponed during the referendum. It will lead an international consortium for the issue. German banks have already paved the way for South Africa's return to the international capital markets after a six-year absence. Deutsche Bank, the country's biggest bank, was the lead manager in a DM400m (Pounds 139m) issue for the republic last September, increased from DM300m because of strong investor demand. Deutsche Bank yesterday welcomed the outcome, as did Mercedes-Benz, one of Germany's largest corporate investors in South Africa. Mercedes said the vote was a vindication of its decision to stay in South Africa  - where it employs nearly 5,000 people. Corporate America's initial reaction was muted. A handful of companies and banks surveyed said it was too early to plunge back into major investment in South Africa. Ms Jennifer Kibbe, an official at the Washington-based Investor Responsibility Research Centre, which tracks US investment in South Africa, said US companies regarded the referendum vote 'as a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for them to go back in.' Citicorp, the biggest US bank, bank indicated it would need to see what type of interim government came to power before it could consider changing its position. Citicorp which closed its office in South Africa in 1987, does have a limited business in South African ADRs (American depository receipts), but it is unlikely to expand that business immediately. After sanctions were lifted Citicorp said it had no plans to resume lending and that position has not changed. The Ford motor company, which withdrew in 1988, said it would conduct a full review before changing its position. Among British companies, Barclays Bank, which pulled out of South Africa in 1986 in response to student protests, said it was a positive result but that it would wait to see how the situation developed. 'As the political situation and economic climate becomes clearer .. it is possible that in the future Barclays may establish some representation in South Africa to look after large corporate business in that country and to service the bank's global clients,' the bank said. RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining company, said it was 'delighted'. It saw 'nothing but good coming out of the complete integration of southern Africa.' On the international bond market, the result was widely seen as likely to bring forward further bond issues from the republic. Bankers said further political headway would have to be made before there was fresh fund-raising. South Africa has launched three international bond issues since last summer, two in the name of the republic and one in the name of the Development Bank of South Africa. All have been sold mainly to German private investors, rather than institutions. Concern about political risk, and ethical or legal obstacles, still loom large. The republic's Ecu250m (Pounds 178m) of bonds, launched in January, were trading at a yield of 10.63 per cent, 0.2 of a percentage point above offer price  - a reflection that demand for the bonds, though reported to have picked up yesterday, has yet to affect the price.</p>

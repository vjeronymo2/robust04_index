			<p>930819 FT  19 AUG 93 / International Company News: Lufthansa sets deadline for AUA co-operation decision LUFTHANSA, the German state-controlled airline, has given Austrian Airlines (AUA) until early next month to decide on proposals for a business co-operation agreement, writes David Waller in Frankfurt. The proposed agreement has been the subject of intensive discussions between the two airlines in recent weeks, culminating yesterday in a meeting between senior executives from both airlines. These included Mr Rudolf Streicher, chairman of AUA's supervisory board, and Mr Jurgen Weber, Lufthansa's chief executive. The agreement envisages close co-operation in business areas such as passenger services, marketing, cargo, maintenance and flight operations. If adopted, it could deal a blow to the Alcazar project, a proposed link-up between AUA and other European airlines Swissair, SAS and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.</p>

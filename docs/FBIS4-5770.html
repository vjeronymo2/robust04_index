			<p>BFN     [Text] The Defense Agency [DA] and aircraft makers, such  as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, have begun considering plans to  designate a redesigned version of the next-generation support  fighter (FSX) as a successor to the current aircraft being used  for high-level training since the latter is becoming outdated.  The FSX is currently being developed with joint Japanese-U.S.  efforts. Initial plans called for purchasing at the most about  130 of these aircraft, which were originally intended as support  fighters. To turn them into high-level training aircraft,  aircraft makers would be required to increase their total  production to a little under 200 units. The increased  production is expected to reduce unit production costs. Another  advantage is that it would help U.S. military industries, which  are suffering from defense spending cuts, to make more profit.    The FSX is a successor to the F-1 support fighter.  Mitsubishi Heavy Industries is the primary contractor for its  production. Since the maximum number of these aircraft to be  purchased is approximately 130--a rather low figure--unit cost  is said to range from 7 billion to 8 billion yen. Consequently,  reducing production costs has been a problem.    Meanwhile, the T-2, a domestically produced high-level  training aircraft, has served as the basis for designing the  F-1. A little under 100 of these aircraft were produced as of  1988. It made its maiden flight in 1971, much earlier than the  F-1. The aircraft has become outdated, and several of them have  already been decommissioned.    The DA considers selection of a successor to the T-2 as an  important issue in its next defense program, which starts in  fiscal year 1996. Preparations have already begun.    Initially, there were plans for Japan to independently  develop a supersonic aircraft to replace the T-2. Since, among  other reasons, Japan would have to bear development costs,  circumstances are such that it would have to give up on the plan  to build a completely new aircraft.    Should the FSX be successfully transformed into a training  aircraft, the DA would purchase about 200 of these aircraft. It  is hoped that production costs would be reduced as a result of  mass production.</p>

			<p>940914 FT  14 SEP 94 / French government to sell 28% of Renault car group The French government yesterday announced plans for a partial privatisation of Renault, the state-owned motor group which is one of the most attractive assets in the country's public sector and a former bastion of union power. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said that the government would sell a 28 per cent stake in the company by the end of the year and that the flotation would be accompanied by a FFr2bn (Pounds 240m) capital increase. Industry analysts value the group at between FFr42bn and FFr46bn. The planned flotation follows an agreement with Volvo, the Swedish motor group, which is to reduce its 20 per cent stake in Renault to 12 per cent immediately with the option of selling a further 4 per cent at the time of the share issue. The two companies have been unravelling a complex system of cross-shareholdings since the collapse of merger plans in December last year. Yesterday's announcement follows months of speculation about the sale, which has been complicated by opposition from trade unions and opposition political parties. They claim that privatisation will lead to job losses and that the car company is a national asset which should not be sold. The Confederation Generale du Travail, the communist-led union, said it will take action against the planned share issue. Prime minister Edouard Balladur has sought to defuse union opposition by insisting that Renault will remain in French hands and that the government's stake will remain above 50 per cent. The shares would be offered principally to French investors and Renault employees. Mr Louis Schweitzer, the Renault chairman, welcomed the move. 'We are an increasingly competitive company and it seems to me that what has been decided gives us an additional trump,' he said. The capital increase would give Renault valuable development funds, he added. Industry analysts said they expected strong demand for shares in the automobile company. Renault is one of the most profitable European car manufacturers and is one of the few international car groups to have remained in profit through the industry recession of the past few years. Earlier this month it reported first half net profits of FFr1.7bn, more than double the figure for the same period in 1993. 'The issue will be attractive to the French public because it is regarded as a strong company and because it is a familiar brand,' said one analyst at a Paris securities company. International investors may, however, be frustrated in attempts to buy Renault shares. 'It seems that the amount of stock available will be limited,' one British stockbroker said. Mr Alphandery said that French industrial and financial groups would take part in the partial privatisation. Probable candidates include Elf Aquitaine, the oil group, Banque Nationale de Paris and Groupe Lagardere, the media to missiles company.

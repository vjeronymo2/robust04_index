			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / International Company News: Stockholm approves Volvo/Renault merger SWEDEN'S centre-right government has given its blessing to the full merger, expected to be announced in Paris this week, possibly today, between Volvo, the country's premier manufacturing company, and Renault, the state-controlled French car and truckmaker due to be privatised. 'Volvo is very important to the Swedish economy, but this is a market-oriented government,' said a senior government official. 'Our view is that Volvo as a private company must do what it thinks is right for Volvo.' Both companies want to announce the merger before the start of the Frankfurt motor show tomorrow. However, a French government official said yesterday that the agreement had yet to be signed and a delay until tomorrow or Wednesday would not matter. The merger will create one of Europe's four biggest car manufacturers and the world's second biggest truck group. It will set the seal on a three-year old industrial alliance which began with an exchange of cross shareholdings in 1990. The French government, wary of domestic political sensitivities surrounding the merger, has insisted on a dominant role in the partnership for Renault, which it has placed on a list of 21 state-controlled groups it seeks to sell in an ambitious programme to be launched this autumn. Motor industry analysts believe the most probable scenario is that the French car group, currently 79 per cent owned by the state, will have a 65 per cent stake in the joint company. Renault's chairman, Mr Louis Schweitzer, will be in charge of day-to-day operations, with the flamboyant Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, who has led Volvo since 1971, as head of the supervisory board. Aware of the sensitivities in Sweden also over the future of one of the symbols of the country's industrial prowess, Mr Gyllenhammar has kept Mr Carl Bildt, the Swedish prime minister, abreast of the negotiations. Volvo is hoping that other political and market reaction to the merger will be similar to that of Mr Bildt. Most analysts in Stockholm view a 35 per cent share for Volvo as a reasonable outcome. 'You can never be sure of anything, but if people look at this in a neutral way they must see that it is the best deal for shareholders, given the alternative of a future on our own,' said a Volvo official. According to expectations, French control will be wielded through a majority stake in a joint holding company and through a stake in a unit which groups the automotive operations of the two companies. But Volvo is expected to retain a powerful influence. Volvo will hold smaller stakes in the holding company and the industrial unit. It is likely to have veto powers over strategic issues.</p>

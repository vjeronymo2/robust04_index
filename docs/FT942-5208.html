			<p>940606 FT  06 JUN 94 / Fox among the television giants: Martin Dickson and Raymond Snoddy say Murdoch is taking on the big US broadcasters - and making gains Coming this autumn from Fox Broadcasting, America's upstart fourth television network: a new comedy series Hardball, which promises to take a 'rowdy, locker room look' at a baseball team, led by a 'no-nonsense' manager, which will try anything and everything to make it into the big league. Mr Rupert Murdoch, Fox's own no-nonsense boss, is playing a real-life game of hardball as he tries to push the company into the US broadcasting big league, alongside the established network trio of CBS, ABC and NBC. Last December he shook the television establishment when he won an auction to broadcast for the next four years American football games featuring one of the two leagues, the National Football Conference. Fox bid Dollars 1.6bn, more than Dollars 400m higher than CBS, which has shown NFC games for almost 40 years. Two weeks ago Mr Murdoch followed that up with another shocker: 12 television stations owned by media group New World Communications are to shift affiliation from the big three to Fox, broadcasting its national programming along with their own local content. Once again, the main victim is CBS - the number one network in the US audience ratings for the past three years - which is losing eight affiliates to Fox. A change of loyalties by 12 stations may not sound particularly dramatic, given that the big three networks have nearly 650 affiliates between them. But a switch of this magnitude is extremely unusual - Mr Murdoch claims it is unprecedented - and it could have a far-reaching impact on the US broadcasting industry. It is likely to set off a struggle for affiliate loyalty between CBS, NBC and ABC. It could also prompt CBS to review its strategy of remaining a one-medium broadcaster at a time when NBC and ABC have diversified into cable. Some observers suggest Mr Laurence Tisch, CBS chairman, might even consider merging the group with another entertainment company. But the most immediate effect of the New World deal is to give a big boost to Fox's credibility. It marks a milestone in Mr Murdoch's efforts to build it into the leading network in the US. 'Partly as a result of this and partly what was going on already you will see another six or eight VHF stations joining our line-up between now and Christmas,' Mr Murdoch says. Fox has come a remarkably long way since 1987, when Mr Murdoch launched the network with two nights a week of programming and just over 100 affiliates, many of them small, independent stations broadcasting on UHF frequencies, which are less powerful than the VHF signals used by the stations which dominate most big US cities. The latest deal was typical Murdoch opportunism. New World approached Murdoch about making programmes together for daytime schedules and launching them across half the US. 'Then the conversation led into this rather bigger deal and it was all done in three weeks,' Mr Murdoch says. Fox, however, is still far from achieving Mr Murdoch's ambitions. In the broadcasting season that ended in April, the market research agency Nielsen gave it a rating of 7.2 in the prime evening television hours, far behind NBC with 11, ABC with 12.4 and CBS with 14. (Each rating point represents 942,000 viewing households.) Fox only began broadcasting seven nights a week last year. It has no national news service and it only broadcasts 15 hours of prime time programming a week - made either in-house or under contract - compared to the big three's 22 hours. Last year Wall Street began questioning whether Fox might be running out of steam. Its prime time ratings dipped for the second year running and two of the network's most important creators - Mr Barry Diller and Mr Jamie Kellner  -had quit the group. Mr Murdoch's recent coups have dispelled much of the scepticism. Capturing the NFC contract gives Fox its first big scheduled sports programming. He will almost certainly lose money on transmission of the games - as CBS did when it aired them - but since winning the NFC contract Fox's number of affiliates has risen from 138 to 184, though 34 of the new stations are partial affiliates, interested mainly in feeds of the NFC games. By comparison, ABC has 227 affiliates, NBC 213 and CBS 206. The deal with New World will not add to the network's number of affiliates, since the stations are in cities where Fox already has an outlet, which it will now discard. The importance of the deal is that it will substantially increase Fox's reach in the 12 markets - which include important cities such as Detroit, Dallas and Atlanta - because the New World stations are high powered VHF ones, while those Fox is discarding are UHF ones. Fox reckons its prime time ratings will improve by 40 per cent in the cities involved, though observers suggest a 20 per cent improvement. CBS will probably try to steal the VHF affiliates of NBC and ABC in cities where it has lost stations, rather than settling for Fox's UHF cast-offs. That in turn could unsettle the financial relationship between the networks and affiliates which has long underpinned the US television industry. The networks make much of their money from selling advertising space during the national programming they supply to their affiliates. The affiliates make their profits from selling local advertising, but they also get paid 'compensation' by the networks for carrying national programming. To win new affiliates the networks may now need to increase compensation, buy additional stations outright or emulate Fox and take minority financial stakes in some. Mr Howard Stringer, who heads the CBS network, is promising to 'open the network's wallet' to replace defectors. The Big Three may also have to make the timing of programmes more flexible to accommodate affiliates' demands for local advertising slots. Yet in spite of such constraints on its rivals, Fox still faces big challenges. The Federal Communications Commission, the regulator, is looking into a complaint that Fox's ownership of six television stations - the basis of its network - violates federal laws prohibiting foreigners from owning more than 25 per cent of a broadcast outlet. Mr Murdoch, who changed from Australian to US citizenship in the 1980s to build his television empire, holds 76 per cent of the voting power in the company that owns Fox's stations, but News Corporation, his publicly quoted Australian company, holds more than 90 per cent of the equity. News Corp said on Friday the ownership structure has not changed since permission was first given in 1985. The minority stake Fox is taking in New World seems certain to produce fresh complaints from rivals that Mr Murdoch is exploiting loopholes in the law. With the ratings slip of the past two years, Fox also has to prove that it can keep producing fresh programmes, introduce some national news content to its service and extend its appeal among older Americans. The New World deal may be the first step towards 'relaunching our late night programming, maybe national news, certainly daytime programming,' Mr Murdoch says. All four networks also face competition for viewers and affiliates from two networks being put together by Warner Brothers and Paramount Pictures, the Hollywood film and television studios. Whatever the outcome of this struggle, the money flowing into broadcasting shows that some very canny entertainment industry investors disagree with the widespread idea that cable television is gradually killing off the networks. Mr Murdoch says: 'All four (networks) will survive and do very well. We'll be the most economic way for mass marketers to reach the American public and that will remain so for a very long time.' He is putting a great deal of money where his mouth is.</p>

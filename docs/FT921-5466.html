			<p>920304 FT  04 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Expamet falls 43% to Pounds 7.3m EXPAMET International, the building products and security group, yesterday reported a 43 per cent fall in profits as most of its divisions continued to be hit by recession. Pre-tax profits for 1991 fell from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 7.3m on sales 11 per cent lower at Pounds 141m. Earnings per share fell from 19.62p, adjusting for the 1990 rights issue, to 9.06p but the group nevertheless maintained its final dividend at 6.2p and the total for the year at 10.38p. Debt was cut from Pounds 17.3m at the interim stage to Pounds 10m, or gearing of 45 per cent, a level that Mr Alex Orr, managing director, described as comfortable. This was achieved by an increase in profitability, following a difficult first quarter and a sharp reduction in working capital in Europe. The group continued to suffer from the delayed launch of five security products from its 1989 acquisition, Radionics of the US. The radio product - with the most promising market in the US  - is now due for launch in late March. A breakdown of operating profits after exceptionals showed that the security division nearly halved to Pounds 3.9m on lower sales after disposals, a reduction in gross margins and increased R&amp;D expenditure. The building division was static at Pounds 5.1m after an improvement in the ducting business in the Netherlands and Belgium. The industrial sector's profits fell by more than half to Pounds 1.5m, partly because of costs of halving the workforce at the old expanded metal business. COMMENT One has to question the wisdom of maintaining a dividend by digging into reserves but Expamet was probably tied to this policy by its Pounds 21m rights issue last year. It leaves little room for manoeuvre if something goes wrong. Nevertheless, having regained control of working capital and cut debt, and with the prospect of some benefit from the much delayed launch of Radionics' radio security product, the dividend is probably safe. Profits forecast at Pounds 11m this year give earnings of 12.6p, and a multiple of nearly 12. With a maintained dividend level, Expamet still yields an attractive 9 per cent.</p>

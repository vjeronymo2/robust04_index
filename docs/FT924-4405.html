			<p>921202 FT  02 DEC 92 / International Company News: Ciga hotel chain lines up debt reduction scheme CIGA, the international luxury hotel chain controlled by the Aga Khan, is expected to announce later this week an agreement to slash debts by selling a substantial stake in its hotel portfolio to an Italian private investor. The transaction is set to reduce Ciga's debts, totalling almost L1,000bn (Dollars 717m) including rolled-over interest and a convertible bond issue, to between L350bn and L400bn. The agreement should allow the company to lift much of the financial burden which has pushed it into increasing losses and provide a breathing space for further asset sales and restructuring. However, after the deal, expected to involve the sale of a substantial stake in the subsidiary which owns Ciga's 36 hotels in six European countries, Ciga faces a continuing fall in demand for top-price hotel accommodation in the economic recession. Ciga's shares have plunged as a result of growing financial difficulties, which earlier this year led to a debt rescheduling deal with its bankers and the suspension of interest payments. Group losses rose to L98.9bn last year from L33.4bn in 1990. Yesterday, Ciga's shares shed a further 3.1 per cent to L1,151, having fallen by 4.2 per cent on Monday. The new transaction, which should be revealed later this week, supersedes an earlier plan to lower Ciga's debts by the sale of up to six of its top Italian hotels, handled by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank. Although a number of buyers came forward for both individual properties and all six hotels, the prices offered were unsatisfactory. The plan for hotel sales has been suspended pending completion of the deal, which takes up an earlier scheme to bring in outside investors into Ciga's property interests. The company may pursue outright disposals, subject to agreement with its new partner, in order to further reduce its debts.</p>

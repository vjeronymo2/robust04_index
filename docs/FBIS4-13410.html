			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by On Levi] </F>   [Text] The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] is completing  preparations for the implementation of the Gaza-Jericho  agreements. The General Staff believes the agreement will be  signed on 5 May.    The evacuation and redeployment plan can be implemented in  three different ways. It provides for a speedy evacuation  lasting only 24 hours, one lasting a week, and a lengthy  evacuation process that will last for up to three months. The  Southern Command expressed satisfaction with the speed at which  the preparations are proceeding and believes that it will be  ready to carry out the plan on whatever date is determined.    The Defense Ministry recently completed contracts with all  the Gaza Strip settlements for the security forces to enter the  settlements and use empty structures there. The only Gaza Strip  settlement with which no agreement has been signed is Netzarim,  but the Southern Command believes that one will be signed in the  coming days.    Senior Southern Command sources praised the cooperation with  the Gaza settlement leaders and said that all the obstacles and  misunderstandings that prevented the Army's entry have been  removed.    Under instruction from Yitzhaq Rabin, prime minister and  defense minister, the IDF is currently concentrating its efforts  on concluding the building of an electronic fence along the  demarcation line. Eight contractors won a tender to build the  fence, which is expected to cost 150 million shekels. The IDF  believes the fence will be completed by early 1995.    Until the fence is completed, the IDF is deploying large  forces along the new lines, and dozens of electronic measures  have been set up to prevent movement to and from the Gaza Strip  as long as there is no fence.    The Southern Command's engineering units and the IDF  Logistics Branch are preparing the ground where the forces will  be deployed once a decision is made to implement the Gaza  agreement.</p>

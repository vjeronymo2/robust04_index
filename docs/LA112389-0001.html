The  ministry acted after concluding that the crash of a Korean Air DC-10 at Tripoli  airport last July 27 was caused by pilot and flight crew error. The airplane  crashed in dense fog, killing 80 people and injuring 139 others. The ministry  said it also plans to scrutinize Korean Air's operations in December to see  whether it is abiding by safety regulations as well as properly maintaining its  fleet of airplanes.  </P></p>

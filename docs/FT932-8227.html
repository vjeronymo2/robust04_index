			<p>930520 FT  20 MAY 93 / Major says UK still not ready for ERM move MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday put off indefinitely sterling's re-entry into the European exchange rate mechanism and made clear that Danish approval of Maastricht would not change Britain's stand against European monetary union. Ahead of a large-scale revolt expected by Tory MPs over the Maastricht treaty today, the prime minister said the right conditions for considering ERM re-entry 'simply do not apply at the moment and, in my judgment, are unlikely to apply for some time in the future.' At least 30 Conservative MPs are expected to vote against the government tonight when the Commons gives the Maastricht treaty its third reading. Similar numbers of Labour MPs will also vote against. But the Labour leadership's decision to abstain means the government should secure passage of the bill with ease. It then goes to the House of Lords. Mr Major said the prospects of a rapid move towards European economic and monetary union had 'drifted away very substantially'. He said the timetable for Emu envisaged by other EC leaders at Maastricht had been 'unrealistic'. However, he did not rule out the possibility of other countries moving to a single currency without Britain. His refusal to contemplate Britain's rejoining the ERM cheered Conservative Euro-sceptics and came close to endorsing a prediction by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, that Britain would not re-enter until after the next general election. In practice, any early move would split the cabinet. The Danes approved Maastricht by a margin of 56.8 per cent in favour to 43.2 per cent against, on an 86.2 per cent turnout, reversing the narrow rejection of the treaty in a poll last June. The positive vote has also given new impetus to the Danish presidency. Denmark now intends to press for agreement on issues such as a new trade liberalisation package for eastern Europe before Denmark hands over the presidency to Belgium on July 1. In Brussels yesterday, Commission officials hailed the Danish endorsement of the Maastricht treaty in Tuesday's second referendum as giving a 'psychological lift' to the Community. Despite euphoria among many European Community leaders at the Danish referendum result, Mr Major's believes that there is support throughout the EC, including Germany, for wholesale reform of the ERM. 'The ERM, as it was when we left it, is an inadequate instrument that we could not re-enter,' Mr Major said on BBC radio. Downing Street rejected suggestions that the prime minister was implying Britain might never rejoin but said there remained 'big problems' with the ERM - although at least it was no longer regarded as a quasi fixed rate system. Officially, re-entry depends on conditions set by the Treasury on correcting 'faultlines' in the ERM and on bringing UK and Germany monetary polices into line. One Euro-sceptic Tory MP said that 'the day we rejoin the ERM is the day the Conservative party splits. There would be mass resignation from government.' With his comments on the ERM, however, Mr Major has risked upsetting the pro-European Conservative wing, including Sir Edward Heath, former prime minister. Mr Major said the Danish result should put British ratification of the treaty back on track. After the Yes vote, Page 2 Jostling around Major's cabinet table, Page 9 Editorial Comment, Page 19</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] In a secret vote at Modra yesterday, the republican  leadership of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia [HZDS]  expressed no confidence in Deputy Prime Minister Roman Kovac and  Foreign Minister Jozef Moravcik and rejected the Alternative of  Political Realism. The HZDS political executive will make a  decision on early elections and will also assess the possibility  of initiating a referendum.    After the meeting, Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar stated  that  Kovac and Moravcik were nominated to their government posts by  the HZDS, and, if their aim is to cause the movement's  disintegration, they should have the courage to leave  voluntarily. At the moment, he is not considering proposing  their removal to the president but will wait to see what they  are going to do.    According to Meciar, the HZDS is monolithic, functional, and  capable of fighting on. In his opinion, the image presented by  the signatories of the alternative is leading to destruction.  The prime minister also rejected the idea of a government of  wider coalition and stated that it could only become the  government of wider corruption. His government does not intend  to resign, and, if the opposition parties are thinking of  expressing no confidence in the government or in the prime  minister, they will have to be prepared for what will follow,  Meciar said. In his view, the current political crisis in  Slovakia is not real but has been provoked artificially by  political parties fighting for power in the privatization  process.    In an interview with a reporter for the Slovak press agency  [TASR], Jozef Moravcik said that, while he can, he will try to  put across the views held by the Alternative for Political  Realism within the HZDS. If the signatories of the alternative  have their party membership withdrawn, then, according to  Moravcik, they will have to continue their political work  outside the movement.    Roman Kovac told TASR that he does not intend to resign his  position of deputy prime minister.</p>

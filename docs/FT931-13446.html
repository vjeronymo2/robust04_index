			<p>930123 FT  23 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Margins boost First Maryland FIRST MARYLAND Bancorp, the US subsidiary of Allied Irish Bank, yesterday announced a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits from Dollars 75.1m to Dollars 92.5m (Pounds 60.8m) after a 0.8 per cent rise in fourth quarter earnings to Dollars 24.1m (Dollars 23.9m), writes John Gapper. The bank said its earnings performance reflected improved net interest margins, higher levels of non-interest income, lower provisions for possible credit losses and careful management of non-interest expenses. The bank's return on average assets for the fourth quarter fell slightly to 1.04 per cent (1.23 per cent) and its return on average equity fell to 13.95 per cent (16.11 per cent). Mr Brian King, FMB senior vice president, said the low rise in fourth quarter earnings reflected the fact that the bank's loan portfolio had fallen by 8.5 per cent over the year to Dollars 4.97bn from Dollars 5.43bn because of sluggish demand. Shareholders' funds rose to Dollars 699.4m (Dollars 606.8m). The bank's overall capital ratio is 14 per cent, with Tier 1 capital of 10 per cent.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [ITAR-TASS report under the "Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow" </F> rubric: "Relying on CIS Mechanisms"]    [Text] The achievement of economic independence by  Uzbekistan "will require time," and in the meantime the country,  relying on CIS mechanisms, must develop economic integration and  also attract foreign aid, Republic President Islam Karimov  stated in an interview in Tashkent with a group of Japanese  journalists on the eve of his first visit to Tokyo, beginning 16  May.    He noted that the idea of setting up a "Eurasian community"  in the place of the CIS, proposed by Kazakhstani President  Nursultan Nazarbayev, "is only a new slogan, deliberately put  forward with the aim of strengthening this leader's personal  authority."</p>

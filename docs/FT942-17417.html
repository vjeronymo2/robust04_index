			<p>940405 FT  05 APR 94 / Arts: Goode plays Beethoven - Concert The latest instalment of Alfred Brendel's Beethoven cycle is just a week away. Meanwhile, however, there is Richard Goode's, which began on Thursday at the Queen Elizabeth Hall with four early sonatas and the late, dappled one in A, op. 101. (Second concert tomorrow, a third next Tuesday; then 10 more sonatas in November, and a final series later in the season.) On the strength of this first programme, Goode is plainly just as rewarding a Beethoven pianist as American reports have proclaimed him. There is none of the hierophantic 'I am ushering you into the presence of a Great Work' manner. Goode just plays, with evident delight and a buoyant imagination which belies his sure command of Beethoven's structures. Also he croons and hums along, like his teacher Rudolf Serkin and like Glenn Gould. Certainly the vocal obbligato is redundant, for he makes the piano sing with appealing directness - rare among self-conscious moderns in this repertoire, especially since the death of Serkin. A favoured way of playing Beethoven is to build up edifices of distinct, sculpted blocks. Instead, Goode treated all the music as running lyrical discourse, shaded with such easy subtlety that every phrase bore its own speaking sense in the argument. Only in retrospect did we realise how firmly the larger forms had been tamped into place. He opened the cycle conventionally with the first sonata, op. 2 no. 1 in F minor. By way of revealing the young Turk at once, pianists often make it an exercise in junior thunderbolts; with Goode it was lighter and wittier than that, without sacrificing its air of a challenging debut. There and in op. 14 no. 1 and op. 22, he mostly played 'brilliant' arpeggios and scales as light decorations, almost throwaway effects, not aggressively motorised note-by-note and therefore not inflated. With the Sonate Pathetique he broadened his scale dramatically, without hardening. It must need a rare purity of heart to shape the familiar Adagio so sweetly and uncomplicatedly. As for op. 101, it stretched out great branches, richly and effortlessly and marvellously coloured on a towering scale that remained human. It felt like a rare temperamental attunement between master-pianist and masterpiece.</p>

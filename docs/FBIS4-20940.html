			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Viktor Litovkin report: "Academician Kuntsevich Learned of </F> His Dismissal in a Telephone Call from IZVESTIYA"]    [Text] The Russian president's Press Service disseminated  a report through ITAR-TASS channels that "a presidential edict  has released from his post Anatoliy Demyanovich Kuntsevich,  chairman of the Committee on Convention Problems of Chemical and  Biological Weapons under the Russian Federation president." It  also pointed out that A. Kuntsevich has been released from his  post "for a single gross violation of work duties."    The Press Service did not explain what kind of violation  this  was, and Vyacheslav Kostikov, the Russian president's press  secretary, said at a briefing that there were such violations.  But Kuntsevich's closest colleagues do not know of them, and he  himself, so he declared in conversation with me, had not heard  about this and learned of his dismissal only in a call from  IZVESTIYA's editorial office.    Let us leave aside this, not the first occasion when someone  released from a high state post learns of this from press  reports. Particularly a prominent scientist who is one of the  creators of the most sophisticated Soviet chemical weapons,  winner of the Lenin Prize, hero of socialist labor, lieutenant  general, and academician who, at the end of his scientific  career, resolutely set about destroying these weapons.    Let us ask ourselves a different question: Why, after all,  has Academician Kuntsevich been removed from his post, and what  true reason hides behind the vague wording "single gross  violation of work duties?"    There are several answers to this question. One version was  suggested by observers: Kuntsevich has suffered...for the  complete failure of the case of chemical scientist Vil  Mirzayanov, which he supposedly initiated. In conversation with  me the academician categorically denied his involvement in the  "Mirzayanov case," although he has repeatedly and harshly  condemned Mirzayanov's action.    In any case, the responsibility for that shameful trial  lies,  in my opinion, with the law enforcement organs.    The reason for Academician Kuntsevich's dismissal lies far  deeper than it seems. It lies in our country's economic and  technical inability and unpreparedness to fulfill its  international obligations to destroy chemical weapons.    The program for the destruction of these weapons has not yet  been approved either by parliament or by the government. The  funding of all measures connected with preparations for the  direct salvaging of toxins and ammunition is proceeding  extremely irregularly and plainly inadequately, not to mention  the actual program of their destruction. This year alone the  preparations to rid Russia of chemical weapons are to cost 10.4  billion [currency not specified], but this [money] simply does  not exist.    Academician Kuntsevich was categorically opposed to the  destruction of chemical weapons without resolving social  problems and without guarantees for the population resident in  the places where they are stored and where it is proposed to  salvage them. But sufficient funds have not been found for just  these purposes. The program is slipping and is today under  threat of being wrecked.    The Convention Committee tried to find nonbudgetary funds to  implement the chemical disarmament program. In many ways it  succeeded. We were given assistance in resolving these problems  by the United States (the total amount exceeded $60 million for  the development of a safe and efficient technology for the  destruction of toxins), the FRG, Sweden, and the EEC, and  contacts were initiated with NATO. I am not sure if they will  be broken off with Kuntsevich's departure from his post, but  they will certainly be complicated somewhat -- the academician's  authority in international scientific circles is very great.    One thing remains beyond doubt -- by signing the Convention  on the Destruction of Chemical Weapons in Paris in 1993 along  with 155 other states, Russia assumed juridical obligations to  start parting with them in two years' time. It will hardly be  able to keep to this deadline.</p>

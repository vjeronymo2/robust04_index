			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Carrie Lee] </F>   [Text] Chinese-funded enterprises are investing in more  than 20 foreign countries and regions around the world,  according to Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing. A total of 4,497  Chinese-funded enterprises had invested U.S.$5.16 billion around  the world, Mr Li said yesterday. Meanwhile, China had a total  of 174,000 foreign-funded projects with actual investment of  U.S.$63.9 billion.    "China's economic reform is deepening, and its opening to  the  outside world has made new progress," he said.    The rate of overseas investment in China was growing, he  said. Last year, the mainland saw foreign investment equal to  the total of the previous 14 years. China would continue to  carry out preferential treatment for foreign investors, he said.    However, "China will gradually implement national treatment  towards foreign-founded enterprises, creating a competitive  environment on an equal footing for Chinese and foreign  investors." The country would introduce further "helpful" reform  measures Mr Li said. "In the field of reform, we should focus  on invigorating large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises  by transforming their operating systems and actively setting up  a modern enterprises by trial and error."    "We should strengthen and improve macro-control and  meticulously implement various reform measures in taxation,  finance, investment and the foreign exchange system, while  ensuring that these are smoothly carried out," he said.    This year it was important for China to speed up the  establishment of a socialist market-economy and maintain  sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national  economy. "Now, China is advancing toward its second goal in its  economic and social development drive and establishing a new  socialist market economy," he said. Mr Li was speaking at the  opening of the '94 China Summit Meeting held in Beijing. The  meeting provides a multilayered opportunity for Chinese and  foreign officials, entrepreneurs and economists to meet and  discuss economic theories and practices.    At the summit, Chinese Trade Minister Wu Yi launched a  thinly  veiled attack on the United States for politicizing trade issues  in his keynote speech that mapped out China's trade strategy for  the 1990s. Describing the next seven years as a "crucial  period", Ms Wu outlined plans to shift the focus of China's  export production, narrow regional economic disparities in the  country and complete the construction of a legal framework  governing foreign trade by 1997.    While China is committed to the "extremely heavy and arduous  task" of economic development, Ms Wu said progress was being  threatened by countries exerting economic pressures for  political ends. Ms Wu also made it clear that trade disputes  with Beijing could penalise other countries, predicting that  total imports to China in the next seven years "may well reach  U.S.$1 trillion".</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Polish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Krystyna Grzybowska from Bonn: "Without </F> Ally-Type Commitments; Olechowski and Kinkel on European  Security"]    [Text] Foreign Minister Andrzej Olechowski wants the  terms and the timeframe for accepting Poland into NATO to be  clearly defined. He paid a short working visit to Bonn. It was  his first visit to Germany as the chief of Polish diplomacy.    German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he had made a  deliberate decision to invite Minister Olechowski to visit Bonn  as the first foreign guest of the New Year. During the meeting  the following topics were discussed: Poland's efforts to join  the European Union, the Western European Union, as well as NATO  -- these constitute a block of issues linked with creating  European security.    Minister Kinkel said during a press conference that Germany  will continue to be an advocate of the Polish cause in Europe.  "It is obvious," Kinkel said, "that Poland should want to leave  the security grey area through its integration with NATO and  with the remaining organizations of European security."  According to the German foreign minister, during the NATO  summit on 10 January fundamental decisions will be made  concerning the opening up of NATO to the East, but it will not  be possible for new countries to join the Alliance in the  nearest future. Decisions will be made during the summit on  coming to some agreements, but these agreements will not contain  ally-type commitments. But Minister Kinkel thinks that closer  cooperation between Poland and NATO will be possible; this could  be -- among others -- joint military maneuvers or joint peace  missions.    Polish public opinion has high expectations in connection  with the NATO summit. "Poland wants to be a member of the  Western family of countries," Minister Olechowski said, "which  also means being a member of the European Union and of NATO. It  will not happen tomorrow but it is our desire to have a clear  and specific prospect opened up before us. Apart from Poland  itself and the NATO members, nobody can decide whether we should  join the Alliance or not," Minister Olechowski also stressed.    That statement corresponded to one made by Minister Kinkel.  When replying to a question asked by a German journalist,  Minister Kinkel recalled that during talks with Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev he pointed out that Russia has not had  the right of veto in NATO nor will it ever have it in the  future, but at the same time he assured Kozyrev that Russia's  sensitivity will be taken into account. The Germans are in  favor of NATO adopting the kind of solution that would take into  account the interests of both the countries of Central Europe  and of Russia.    Minister Kinkel did not talk about "Partnership for Peace."  Only Minister Olechowski mentioned it by pointing out that  Poland expects the kind of partnership that would not mean  giving up full membership in the future. "We can be satisfied  with that part of the talks," Minister Olechowski said, and he  suggested that Poland also take part in providing assistance to  Russia and other eastern neighbors.    The Polish and German foreign ministers also discussed  bilateral relations of our two countries, but -- as Minister  Kinkel said -- they are so close that there are no major  differences of opinions.</p>

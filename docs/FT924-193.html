			<p>921230 FT  30 DEC 92 / Meridian tones down TV contrast: The successor to TVS seeks continuity THE MOST memorable moment of the television franchise affair for Mr Roger Laughton, managing director of Meridian Broadcasting, was the signing of a Pounds 7.5m deal to buy TVS's studio headquarters in Southampton, including the desk of Mr James Gatward, former TVS chief executive. Meridian takes over from TVS on Friday and Mr Laughton said: 'The deal meant we could plan an orderly handover between TVS and Meridian - including a commitment to employ at least 150 TVS staff.' Meridian took over all TVS's assets, including its local film library. The lack of acrimony between the winner, which bid Pounds 36.5m a year, and the loser, which was judged to have over-bid with Pounds 59.75m, has helped produce a feeling of continuity between old and new. TVS happily pocketed about Pounds 1m from Meridian for advertising the imminent arrival of its successor. Mr Laughton, who worked at the BBC for 25 years, said he wanted to build on the strength of the ITV network by not changing too many things at once. The Meridian schedule next month will not look very different from this month's TVS schedule. Coast to Coast, the TVS regional news programme, will give way to Meridian Tonight and a third news region which covers the Thames Valley will be added, but three of the six presenters are survivors from TVS. Country Ways, the popular regional countryside series, will continue. The real changes will be behind the camera. Meridian's controlling shareholder is MAI, the financial and media services group. Meridian is a publisher broadcaster, commissioning almost all programmes apart from news from independent producers, though it will sell its own advertising air time. It will have a staff of fewer than 400 people, compared with about 800 at TVS before the redundancies began. SelectTV will be the sole supplier of comedy and comedy drama, including one of Meridian's first big shows for the ITV network - Full Stretch, a six-part comedy drama series by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais starting on January 5. Local programmes will include The Pier, a regional arts programme, Ambulance, a seven-part series on the region's busiest ambulance station, and Three Minutes, a daily slot giving the public a chance to air its views. Lord Hollick, the Labour peer and chief executive of MAI, which has invested Pounds 30m in the venture, believes that in spite of the Pounds 36.5m bid and the recession, Meridian will contribute to group profit in 1993 - 4. Lord Hollick said: 'If we can demonstrate that Meridian can deliver the right product at the right price then we can possibly say with confidence we believe this model (publisher broadcaster) will work elsewhere.'</p>

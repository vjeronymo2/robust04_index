			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, April 5 (XINHUA) -- Visiting Brazilian  Foreign Minister Celso Luiz Nunes Amorim said here today that  his current visit to China has been "fruitful."    Speaking at a press conference this evening, the foreign  minister said that during his visit he has met with Chinese  leaders including President Jiang Zemin and held talks with  vice-premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. The two sides,  he said, exchanged views on bilateral ties and international  issues, and gained positive results.    Amorim said that Brazil and China enjoy good cooperative  relations, adding that both are developing countries playing  more and more important roles in the world.    Both Brazil and China work for world peace and focus on  their  own economic development, said Amorim. Therefore, Brazil-China  cooperation is conducive to world peace and security.    The foreign minister said trade between the two countries  has  been developing impressively, with an annual volume surpassing  one billion U.S. dollars. Bilateral cooperation in various  fields, including hi-tech, has broad prospects, he noted.    Amorim said that Brazil has always advocated the restoration  of China's status as a founding party of GATT, adding that China  is a big nation in trade, and its re-entry into GATT is  important for both China and the world. Brazil and China are  cooperating in that regard, he added.    The foreign minister, who visited China in 1986, extended  his  congratulations on China's achievement in economic construction,  saying that the great changes taking place in the country in the  past eight years are great, and he was "astonished" by the  changes.    Amorim and his party are scheduled to leave here for home  tomorrow.</p>

			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / UK Company News: North American and Far East losses peg Logica LOSSES IN North America and the Far East contributed to a lacklustre full year performance by Logica, the computing services group. Profits before tax for the year to June 30 were Pounds 9.03m, a 28 per cent increase on the previous Pounds 7.1m, but slightly below market expectations. The shares fell 1p to 254p. Revenues rose 9 per cent to Pounds 217.4m (Pounds 200.4m). The tax rate was up slightly to 41.65 per cent as a result of unrelieved losses in the US, leaving earnings per share 24 per cent ahead at 8.7p (7p). A final dividend of 2.75p will be paid giving a total for the year of 4p, an increase of 10 per cent. Cash was strong at Pounds 17m (Pounds 13.7m), the result of continuing tight management controls. The company performed well in the UK where operating profits grew by 31 per cent to Pounds 9.2m and gross margins improved to 7.1 per cent (5.8 per cent). Continental Europe, where the company lost Pounds 1.7m last year, improved to profits of Pounds 2.6m. The company lost Pounds 2.6m in North America through set backs in the telecommunications sector and a sharp decline in Logica's business with the large computer vendors. The result was a 'major disappointment' said Mr Martin Read, the newly appointed chief executive: 'We cannot go on as we have in the past three or four years. North America has got to be sorted out'. In the Far East, the company lost Pounds 300,000 chiefly as a result of overspending on a large fixed price project for the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. COMMENT Logica's results are not bad, but they are not good enough. The difficulties in the US and Asia cannot disguise the fact that a company with its strength in technology and its formidable customer list should be at least twice as profitable. Mr Read, formerly a high flyer with GEC Marconi, has been brought in to bring new aggression and focus to Logica's market presence. He intends to find ways of make more productive use of the company's skills and experience, but it will take time to change the culture and boost profitability. On a historic p/e of about 29, the shares seem fairly valued.</p>

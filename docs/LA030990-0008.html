			<p><P> March 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DRUG CHARGES IN SHERIFF'S DEPT.  </P> <P> While I do not condone the alleged activities of the 10 accused officers  involved in the drug-money theft case, I feel our modern way of life in America  can only lead to more of the same.  </P> <P> Instead of Block bemoaning the skimming of monies collected in raids on drug  premises, why not suggest an alternative program?  </P> <P> There is a great deal of money involved in most seizures, as well as the tons  of product confiscated. Why should our legal system compound the problem of  maintaining honest control of cash collected in each successful raid?  </P> <P> It seems only fair that when cash is seized, a portion of this money should go  into a fund to be distributed to all officers engaged in ending the drug  scourge. In my opinion, a 60% distribution to the officers and/or their  respective pension funds would eliminate the necessity of seeing many loyal and  good agents fall by the wayside and corrupt themselves.  </P> <P> A distribution program would remove the reason for 90% of officers who succumb  to the greed aspect within most of us. It's worth a try, and the men deserve  the extra compensation.  </P> <P> ABE R. BLUMENFELD  </P> <P> Palm Desert  </P></p>

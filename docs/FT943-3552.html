			<p>940913 FT  13 SEP 94 / World Stock Markets: Equity markets feels sting in tail The world's equity markets were broadly lower over a week which brought a sting in its tail. On Friday, Wall Street and leading European markets finished in retreat in reaction to US figures showing an unexpectedly sharp rise in wholesale prices during August, which raised the spectre of rising inflation and interest rates. Italy was the week's biggest loser, weighed down by worries about cabinet splits and vacillation, and doubts about the government's ability to take decisive action on the 1995 budget. Last week's focus was on government plans to cut at least L8,000bn from pensions, prompting trade union threats of a 'hot autumn' of conflict if the proposals were not rewritten. Today, Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the prime minister, meets the unions to discuss the issue in what is being seen as the first real test of his stated resolve to take firm, but fair, measures on the economy.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                     MARKETS IN PERSPECTIVE  ---------------------------------------------------------------------                                                  % change    % change                 % change in local currency **   sterling **   in US                                                             Dollars **             ----------------------------------------------------------               1 Week  4 Weeks  1 Year  Start of  Start of    Start of                                          1994      1994        1994  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Austria        +0.17    +2.92   +9.40   -4.29     +2.57       +7.52 Belgium        -2.07    -1.33   +6.53   -5.21     +2.93       +7.90 Denmark        -1.70    -3.83   +1.48   -7.24     -1.39       +3.37 Finland        +0.47   +10.66  +43.31  +27.38    +40.70      +47.48 France         -3.01    -2.34   -4.07  -12.32     -6.52       -2.01 Germany        -0.60    +2.97  +13.45   -4.77     +2.31       +7.24 Ireland        -1.00    +5.24  +18.57   +5.73     +9.62      +14.91 Italy          -4.94    +1.59   +6.93   +6.25    +10.39      +15.70 Netherlands    -1.61    +0.81  +12.50   -2.96     +3.99       +9.00 Norway         -2.35    -0.61  +17.52   +2.86     +8.80      +14.04 Spain          -0.32    -3.39   -0.51   -8.88     -3.20       +1.46 Sweden         -2.13    +2.59  +13.24   +3.77     +9.16      +14.43 Switzerland    -1.26    +1.61  +11.92   -9.36     -0.16       +4.66 UK             -2.43    -0.13   +3.84   -7.42     -7.42       -2.96 EUROPE         -2.07    +0.34   +6.03   -6.27     -2.15       +2.57  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Australia      -2.29    +0.18   +7.73   -4.37     +0.11       +4.94 Hong Kong      +2.98    +8.05  +37.96  -14.90    -18.81      -14.90 Japan          -3.39    -3.99   -4.90   +9.03    +16.94      +22.58 Malaysia       +3.08    +8.18  +44.97   -6.61     -6.12       -1.59 New Zealand    -0.23    +6.26  +12.03   +2.71     +5.85      +10.96 Singapore      -1.51    -0.16  +17.45   -8.24     -5.93       -1.40  --------------------------------------------------------------------- Canada         -0.22    +4.26  +12.99   +2.86     -5.12       -0.54 USA            -0.64    +1.19   +2.16   +0.56     -4.06       -0.56 Mexico         +2.63    +4.87  +42.45   +5.46     -8.19       -3.76  --------------------------------------------------------------------- South Africa   +1.09    +2.27  +60.90  +22.05    +10.75      +16.10  --------------------------------------------------------------------- WORLD INDEX    -1.68    -0.31   +2.83   +0.56     +1.68       +6.58  --------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Based on September 9th 1994.

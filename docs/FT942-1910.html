			<p>940622 FT  22 JUN 94 / Big rise in legal aid abuse inquiries A sharp rise in cases of fraud and abuse of the legal aid scheme was reported yesterday by the Legal Aid Board. In its annual report the board, which administers the scheme for the government, said the number of preliminary investigations undertaken by its investigation section had risen from 642 in 1992-93 to 1,035 in 1993-94. The number of cases under investigation also increased from 362 in 1992-93 to 957 in 1993-94. The board said the rise was largely because of the number of letters sent to solicitors requiring an explanation of questionable costs claims. Of the 957 investigations, 836 fell into that category. As a result, information about 363 firms had been passed to the Solicitors Complaints Bureau and 21 had been reported to it with a request for disciplinary action. The remaining 121 cases involved more detailed investigations. Six cases had resulted in court appearances, four of which involved solicitors and their support staff. Two solicitors and a clerk were convicted and one solicitor acquitted. The two other cases involved legal aid applicants making false declarations to obtain aid. At the end of 1993-94 there were 517 continuing investigations of which 30 had been reported to the police and five were awaiting trial. The investigation section also dealt with solicitors' firms which, during the course of investigations, had been found to be over-claiming costs on the legal aid fund. A total of Pounds 143,000 had been recovered. During 1993-94 the board met all but one of its performance targets on handling aid applications and payment of lawyers' bills, and achieved the quality assurance standard, BS 5750.</p>

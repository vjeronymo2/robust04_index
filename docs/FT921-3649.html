			<p>920313 FT  13 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive Lloyds Chemists advances 88% to Pounds 15.4m LLOYDS Chemists yesterday followed up its recommended Pounds 96m bid for Macarthy with interim results showing an 88 per cent increase in pre-tax profit. On sales 94 per cent ahead at Pounds 218.4m (Pounds 112.6m), pre-tax profit went up from Pounds 8.2m to Pounds 15.4m in the six months to December 31. Mr Allen Lloyd, chairman and chief executive, said the performance proved that healthcare retailing was 'safe retailing'. He added that 'When times are tough, people are more susceptible to illness.' Lloyds' diluted earnings per share grew rather less rapidly to 10.86p (8.95p). This reflected extra equity from last spring's Pounds 71m rights issue to fund the Pounds 55m acquisition of Kingswood-GK chemists and Holland &amp; Barrett health stores. These additional 350 stores, plus three smaller acquisitions in 1991, helped drive the figures ahead. At this time last year (pre-Kingswood), the group had 455 chemists and 174 drugstores. Now (pre-Macarthy) it has nearly 1,080 outlets, including 667 chemists, 211 drugstores and 197 health stores. First-half operating profit rose by 67 per cent to Pounds 16.7m. Mr Dick Steele, finance director, said the apparent decline in margin was caused by inclusion of Holland &amp; Barrett and the new wholesaling division, which had slimmer margins than chemists and drugstores. Before the Macarthy bid, net debt was Pounds 21.1m, gearing of 35 per cent. If the deal went through (UniChem may still re-enter the fray), Mr Steele said he expected gearing to rise to 60 per cent, on combined net assets of roughly Pounds 80m. The interim dividend goes up to 1.55p (1.17p). COMMENT Lloyds seems to be making as high a trading margin in its chemists division as Boots, ie 9 per cent. This is remarkable, especially as half of Boots' shops are freehold and it enjoys considerable benefits from the type of electronic information system that Lloyds is only now introducing. Explanations include its modest sites (where Boots does pay rent it is for prime locations), its tight control of the payroll and other costs, high margins on own-label products and highly efficient distribution. Once this is applied to Macarthy, with a liberal helping of acquisition provisions, analysts start shoving up 1992-93 pre-tax profit forecasts from Pounds 40m to more than Pounds 50m. Reasons for caution include the group's propensity to issue paper, while doing less well than expected on the cashflow and gearing. If Pounds 35m (Pounds 20.8m) is made this year, the prospective p/e is about 15 on yesterday's close of 347p. This is just above the market, but below the stores sector which is more geared to recovery. The shares have had a good run but remain worth holding for acquisition benefits and defensive qualities.</p>

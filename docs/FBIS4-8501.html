			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan by Josef </F> Horsky; place and date not given: "Reality Is More Difficult  Than I Thought"]    [Text] The head of Slovak diplomacy, Eduard Kukan, is an  experienced diplomat and has been employed by the foreign  service for almost 30 years. It would certainly be interesting  to talk with him about a wide range of problems in our foreign  policy, but, during our short meeting, we limited ourselves to  the most topical problems connected with his assuming the office  of foreign minister.    The new government, as you said, is considering dealing with  our relations with our main neighbors, Hungary and the Czech  Republic. The government believes it is our main task.    [Kukan] Of course, our relations with the Czech Republic are  being built now. To normalize them--in which we are interested,  as is the Czech side, I believe--we have to sort our problems  that have remained open. When we start again with a clean  sheet, so to speak, our situation will be easier. I am not  going to speak about details, but you know that the problem of  gold and other issues is involved, as is quite well known. We  are conducting complicated and difficult negotiations, and it is  our concern not to damage Slovakia's interests. We will not be  able to sort out many of the problems within six months, but we  do not want to wait. We must devote our full time to them.    Both successor countries to the former CSFR must learn how  to  live in the new situation and adjust to it because there are  historical links and interests, in my opinion. The real  situation will force us to cooperate in the future. But then,  our cooperation will have a new quality, based on the decisions  of both countries.    [Horsky] As regards our relations with Hungary, the chief of  Slovak diplomacy confirmed that he wants to create a peaceful  atmosphere without emotion, which is needed to keep the dialogue  running.    [Kukan] We would be happy if there were a similar reaction  in Hungary. We expect no miracles because our relations are  complicated and burdened by the past, but there are things we  can solve within six months. They are contained in the  government policy statement. The most important thing is that  we do not want to lose communications with Hungary.    [Horsky] When asked whether there is a real possibility for  a treaty on good-neighborly relations being concluded with  Hungary, or at least its principles, Kukan provided a diplomatic  response.    [Kukan] I do not see it as unrealistic. I do not mean the  treaty itself. Regarding these principles, there is such a  possibility.    [Horsky] The second problem of our foreign policy is that we  want to integrate into Western political and economic  structures. In this connection, we are interested in what you  are going to discuss tomorrow with [U.S.] Deputy Secretary of  State for Eastern Europe Talbott.    [Kukan] As you know, Mr. Talbott is very close to President  Clinton. They studied together and have personal contacts.  This is not the only reason we believe his visit is so  extremely important. His visit is a certain signal in the  situation that has arisen in Slovakia. According to our  information, he wants to explain to us thoroughly and  analytically the current position of the United States toward  the countries of Central and East Europe because it has recently  changed slightly after being criticized. On the other hand, he  will certainly listen to our opinions on our integration into  Western structures. Apart from this, he will be interested in  the development of the economic situation in Slovakia and in  conditions for the arrival of entrepreneurs from the United  States and the influx of U.S. capital. These two issues are his  priorities.    [Horsky] But the United States is only one of the NATO  pillars, albeit the stronger one. What will the situation look  like with respect to the European Union [EU] and its military  component, the Western European Union [WEU]?    [Kukan] In the political sphere, we are interested in EU  membership. Our association treaty has been ratified by two  countries, and our task is to have the other EU countries do the  same so that we might do the same thing that Hungary and Poland  did on Friday [8 April]--submit an application for EU membership.    [Horsky] As regards security matters, Minister Kukan said:  Our signature on the Partnership for Peace plan is a step toward  full membership in NATO. Only reality will show us how this  mechanism will function. As far as the WEU is concerned, we are  interested in permanent observer status.</p>

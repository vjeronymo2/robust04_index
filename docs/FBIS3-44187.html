The chairman of the Independent  Electoral Commission, Judge Kriegler, was reluctant to comment.  He said it would be inopportune to do this as an official  report on the issue could be tabled before the commission.    The ANC said at a conference in Midrand that peace keepers  would man routes leading to polling booths and in so doing  prevent intimidation. Law and Order Minister Hernus Kriel says  it boils down to a threat to intimidate voters. He said such a  step was extremely provocative and a recipe for violence.    The National Party said the plan is strongly reminiscent of  a  similar action by the Nazi Party in Germany in the 1940's and  the Communist Party in the Soviet Union.</p>

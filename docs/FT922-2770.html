			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Survey of Belgium 92 (1): Right man for the job - Jean-Luc Dehaene is the epitome of the hard-headed approach which Belgium needs. He is prepared to make Belgians sweat, if that is what it takes to guarantee a solid political and economic future for the country BELGIANS do not have much time for idealism. In a small country, burdened with one of the most complex political, linguistic and institutional structures in Europe, ideals usually do not work. Pragmatism is a much more useful commodity. For an almost unbroken 13-year period until this March, the public face of that pragmatic spirit was the long-serving prime minister, Mr Wilfried Martens, a Flemish Christian Democrat with a talent for compromise and an ability to soothe the periodic disputes between Flemings and French-speaking Walloons. But a massive protest vote in last November's elections rocked the traditional Belgian political parties, almost all of which lost parliamentary seats, and dealt a fatal blow to Mr Martens' premiership. After more than 100 days of wrangling over the composition of the new government, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene - a fellow Flemish Christian Democrat and former vice-premier - took over at the head of a smaller, more manoeuvrable centre-left coalition. Mr Dehaene is the epitome of the hard-headed approach which Belgium now needs. The emollient Mr Martens was long considered the only Belgian who could reconcile the conflicting demands of Flemish- and French-speakers, but he is now coming in for his fair share of retrospective criticism. His own party, the CVP, thinks he conceded too much to the French-speakers; economists believe the spirit of compromise overcame the pressing need to tackle economic slippage in the latter Martens years. Even Mr Dehaene - a staunch Martens supporter during his term in office - describes 1991 as 'in budgetary terms, a lost year'. Such neglect, Mr Dehaene asserts, will not be repeated. He will make Belgians sweat, if that is what it takes to guarantee a solid political and economic future for the country. 'I belong to a political party, and to do what has to be done you have to have electoral support,' he told the Financial Times. 'But people are more likely to back a government which has taken its responsibility, than one that has run into the sand.' Mr Dehaene's government has two pressing responsibilities. One is to set Belgium's economy - in particular its public finances and budget deficit - on course for European economic and monetary union (Emu) in 1996. The other is to give new impetus to the domestic constitutional reforms which were set in motion by previous governments. Living up to the nickname 'TGV', the energetic Mr Dehaene has moved with express-train speed on the first point, wrapping up an emergency budget for 1992 in just three days before his premiership was more than a month old. With its plans to tighten up on dole fraud, close loopholes in the tax system, and introduce a new 1 per cent social security tax, it has not been universally popular. But without this mini-budget, Belgium's large budget deficit would have risen from 6.3 per cent of GDP in 1991 to 7 per cent this year. The measures should curb the figure to only 5.6 per cent for 1992. A full-scale budget for 1993, which should be decided at the end of July or the beginning of August, will help put Belgium on track for a 3 per cent deficit-to-GDP ratio by 1996 - one of the three criteria for joining a full European currency union in the first wave of EC countries. As a founder member of the Community and one of its keenest supporters, Belgium has at least a sentimental interest in being part of the Emu vanguard. Mr Dehaene is a domestic politician at heart, but he is already honing his Euro-jargon ready for next week's Lisbon summit. He must hope he will still be prime minister in a year's time when Belgium will be poised to take over the six-month presidency of the EC. Many believe, however, that the Dehaene express will hit the buffers long before then - derailed, ironically, by the very effort of shunting Belgium a little further towards a national federal goal. The problem is that constitutional reform requires a two-thirds majority in parliament. The first two stages of the three-stage programme drawn up four years ago passed without too much difficulty under Mr Martens' leadership. But Mr Dehaene's four-party coalition - socialists and Christian Democrats from both sides of the language divide - does not command enough seats to guarantee the passage of the latest proposals. They include direct elections for the regional and language community councils, and the controversial issue of increasing fiscal responsibility for the regions. Mr Dehaene's solution was typically workmanlike. He set up a 'dialogue' between politicians from 10 parties (excluding, to their huge irritation, the maverick and extremist groups which increased their parliamentary representation at the last elections) in the hope that the requisite majority would gradually emerge. That discussion began in April and was scheduled to restart this week, but it has moved slowly and at times has looked like grinding to a halt. Even optimists put the chances of success at only 50-50, while cynics call it the dialogue of the deaf. If it fails, then Mr Dehaene's government of pragmatists is unlikely to outlast the summer. The political and budgetary pressures are ominously closely linked. Flemish politicians have argued in the dialogue for a regionalisation of part of the public debt, a point which the francophones will not even discuss. French-speaking teachers, meanwhile, have this month threatened industrial action if the French community cannot deliver on its promises of increased wages - a commitment the community can only honour if it also takes on greater fiscal responsibility. It was a very similar dispute, and its inevitable repercussions, which brought down Mr Martens' last government. So how likely is another election in Belgium before the end of the year? Probably not as likely as one might expect, given the odds apparently stacked against Mr Dehaene. The main stabilising factor may be fear. The strength of the popular vote against traditional politics last November came as a shock to all Belgian politicians and represented a clear signal that they should get down to business and stop squabbling. However vocal their criticism of Mr Dehaene's plans, the opposition parties would probably be reluctant to test the electorate again so soon, particularly as the lengthy interregnum proved that in many areas the Belgian state can operate perfectly well without a strong government. If he survives, Mr Dehaene has much he wants to do. Reform of the public sector is one priority. It has already started with the management restructuring of some of the bureaucratic 'regies' which control most of Belgium's public services. This process may even end in privatisation, an approach promoted by many Belgian financiers and academics. Mr Dehaene believes this should be part of the debate about the public sector, but he shies away from starting an ideological argument and says privatisation could never be the 'panacea which is going to resolve all the problems' of public finance. It is a realistic approach, applauded by economists. 'When you look at the amount of inefficiency (in the economy) you can see theoretical solutions, but can you see how to correct the situation? For that you need to be very strong, you have to have vision and you have to have courage,' says Mr Peter Praet, chief economist at Generale de Banque in Brussels. He believes Mr Dehaene is probably the man for the job and is inclined to compare these attempts to prune back the overgrown public sector to the first stages of the Gorbachev-inspired reform process in the old Soviet Union. At the moment, Belgium is benefiting from improved transparency: glasnost. Next will come perestroika, the more radical restructuring. It seems worth pointing out - even though most analysts say it would never happen in Belgium - that stage three of the Gorbachev process was the disintegration of the central state itself.</p>

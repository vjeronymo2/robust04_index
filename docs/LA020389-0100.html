			<p><P> February 3, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING BRIEFING: CS SACRAMENTO TEAM IS ONE FOR THE ROAD  </P> <P> When Cal State Sacramento joined the Great Northern Conference, which stretches  all the way to Anchorage, Alaska, some creative scheduling was necessary.  </P> <P> The last home game for the Hornets was Jan. 18. After that, they were off for  10 days. Now they are finishing up with eight straight games on the road.  </P> <P> Said Coach Joe Anders: "January was a great month to be a Hornet. February is a  great month to be a Hornet travel agent."  </P> <P> If Kiki Vandeweghe is traded from the Portland Trail Blazers to the New York  Knicks, he will join the team his father, Ernie, played for in the early 1950s.  </P> <P> Marty Glickman, who was the Knick radio announcer, told the Hartford Courant:  </P> <P> "Ernie was a tremendous guy. A medical student who joined the Knicks out of  Colgate. His med school schedule was such that he would arrive at the game just  in time to play. He would get dressed in the restrooms of airplanes and come to  the arena ready. I can see him now, coming onto a court still lacing his  sneakers."  </P> <P> Add Ernie: He was born in Canada, where his father was a furrier.  </P> <P> "I was a spoiled little boy, " he told Zander Hollander in "The Modern  Encyclopedia of Basketball."  </P> <P> "I had everything I wanted, especially when it came to sports equipment. I had  a hockey rink in my back yard, a basketball court, a motorboat, skates, hunting  gun and a horse. That's when I thought I would be a jockey."  </P> <P> Trivia Time: Who was the last defenseman to score four goals in a National  Hockey League game? He played for the Kings. (Answer below.)  </P> <P> From Wallace Matthews of Newsday: "Is this ridiculous or what? Bruce (the  Mouse) Strauss, who in the words of Randy Gordon of the New York State Athletic  Commission has more aliases than most fighters have bouts, was approved to  fight Harry Arroyo in Rochester as a substitute for Donald Gwinn, who was under  lifetime suspension. Gwinn's crime? Fighting under an assumed name."  </P> <P> Add Matthews: "Overheard at the Leonard-Hearns news conference, one fight guy  talking about another: 'He was a moron. He took the test for imbecile and  failed.' "  </P> <P> Said Edmonton Coach Glen Sather, responding to reports that the Oilers were  having difficulty filling the stands since trading Wayne Gretzky to the Kings:  "We've had 97% and 98% capacity. I'd have used 99, but we're not using that  number anymore."  </P> <P> The basketball teams weren't the only ones putting up big numbers Tuesday at  Loyola Marymount. Before the basketball game, in which Loyola beat USIU,  181-150, the schools met in baseball. Loyola won, 20-12.  </P> <P> Trivia Answer: Ian Turnbull. He scored 4 goals against Vancouver on Dec. 12,  1981.  </P> <P> Quotebook  </P> <P> Former NBA player and coach Johnny Kerr, now a Chicago Bulls announcer, on  coaching: "If a coach starts listening to the fans, he winds up sitting next to  them."  </P></p>

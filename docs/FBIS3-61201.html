An honor guard was formed at the runway. The national  anthems  of Iran and Kazakhstan were played. Presidents Ali Akbar  Hashemi-Rafsanjani and Nursultan Nazarbayev inspected the honor  guard. The VIP said his farewells to officials seeing him off.    After the honor guard passed in review Nursultan Nazarbayev  bade a warm and heartfelt farewell to the Iranian leader at the  airplane ladder, and wished him a safe journey.    The head of Kazakhstan said at a subsequent press conference  improvised then and there that he was fully satisfied with the  results of talks with the Iranian president, and with the  agreements they reached, primarily in the economic sphere. There  is good potential for increasing diverse business ties between  the two countries, which can now be utilized highly productively  owing to the extensive transportation system currently being  established, including rail, motor, air and sea lines of  communication. In the future, Nursultan Nazarbayev emphasized,  Iran may become one of the biggest importers of Kazakhstan's  agricultural products; the exchange of goods is growing in many  other directions as well.    Because of bad weather in Karaganda Oblast, which the  Iranian  president had intended to visit, his itinerary was revised. Ali  Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani stopped in Aktau, where he inspected  the seaport and acquainted himself with the possibilities of its  expansion and reconstruction through the efforts of the two  countries. An infrastructure that will make possible the  shipment of a large quantity of oil, grain, livestock products,  industrial goods and equipment by sea across the Caspian between  Kazakhstan and Iran is to be created here. The guest also  visited other facilities of the oblast center.    He was accompanied on a tour of the city by Minister of  Power  and Fuel Resources Kadyr Baykenov, the co-chairman of an  intergovernment joint Kazakh-Iranian commission on commercial,  economic, scientific, technical and cultural cooperation; by  Myrzatay Zholdasbekov, our republic's ambassador to Iran; and by  Fedor Novikov, the head of Mangistau Oblast's administration.    The Iranian president took off for Baku from Aktau.    His first visit to Kazakhstan, which was made at the  invitation of Nursultan Nazarbayev, occurred in a spirit of  mutual trust and good will, and it is seen on the whole as  having been productive for both sides. Nine documents were  signed on the basis of the results of the talks, including a  protocol on mutual deliveries of goods in 1993-1994. Thus  relations between Kazakhstan and Iran are now regulated by  almost 25 different agreements, which create a strong foundation  for growth of diverse cooperation.    Ali Akbar Hashemi-Rafsanjani invited Nursultan Nazarbayev to  make an official visit to Iran at any time convenient to him.  The invitation was gratefully accepted.</p>

			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: S Africa stops foreign buying of Elfi issue SOUTH Africa's Reserve Bank has stopped foreign investor participation in the planned issue of the Elfi 5 stock, a main capital market instrument. The Reserve Bank is concerned that high coupons on Elfis were damaging the balance of payments. Elfi (equity-linked fixed interest) instruments, issued by Transnet, the state transport utility, are linked to the All Share index on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Mr Johan Van Schoor, treasury manager at Transnet, said about 30 per cent of the Elfi III and IV issues were held by foreigners. He said this meant a potential outflow, in interest payments, of about R75m a year.</p>

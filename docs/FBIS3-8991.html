			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] Sarajevo Radio Bosnia-Herzegovina  Network in Serbo-Croatian at 1400 GMT on 17 March carries in its  regular 39-minute newscast the following reports about the  fighting in the republic.    Bihac correspondent Mirza Sadikovic reports that "Karadzic's  terrorists are using Vis, howitzers, and tanks to shell the  defense lines on the entire Bihac front, particularly in the  areas of Sokolac, Orljanska, and Ribicka Glavica. After  unsuccessful attempts at infiltrating subversion groups, the  aggressor launched a new fierce artillery and tank attack at  Grabez, [name indistinct], and Hasin Vrh. The defenders also  came under fierce infantry attacks, and the fighting is still in  progress. The members of the paramilitary formations of the  so-called Kladusa autonomy also attacked the defenders in the  areas on Litkovac and Pecigrad in the Cazin Municipality, which  confirms anticipations of a fresh, joint attack on the free  Bihac territory."    Amira Salibasic reports from Olovo and says that "early this  morning, the chetniks began their attack using tanks and  mortars, which continues this afternoon. The defense positions  of our troops on all parts of the long Olovo front are being  (?pounded) by howitzer and mortar shells. There are small arms'  provocations along the entire demarcation lines."    The studio announcer says that "the afternoon hours in the  7-South Operative Group operational zone are somewhat calmer,"  and introduces a report by correspondent Mirudin Aldobasic who  says that "the reason for this are the enemy's significant  losses in manpower and equipment. The criminal Mladic and his  henchmen can no longer motivate their troops, so they are  employing extremely repressive measures toward the population in  the occupied Doboj and Teslic. They are mobilizing all Serb  nationals up to age 55, but they are also mobilizing Muslims and  Croats [words indistinct]. It is evident that some Serb  nationals are avoiding mobilization, so the prisons are  overflowing."    Correspondent Sead Custovic reports from the 1st Corps  Information Service and says that "small arms' provocations were  registered very early [this morning], and they intensified  through the day. Brijesce was targeted from Bozica Kuca, and  Varazdin Street was targeted from Devino Brdo, which resulted in  the wounding of one civilian. [Words indistinct] where four  portable rocket launcher shells exploded."</p>

			<p><P> August 25, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AUSTRALIAN PILOTS QUIT IN BITTER DISPUTE OVER PAY  </P> <P> Australia's domestic airline pilots resigned en masse Thursday after airlines  started firing them individually over a pay dispute that has shut down the  nation's air services.  </P> <P> Desperate travelers thwarted by a shutdown of domestic services were flying  1,200 miles to New Zealand and back just to hop from one Australian city to  another.  </P> <P> The Australian Federation of Air Pilots delivered the 1,600 resignations to  airlines after the companies started taking legal action against individual  pilots.  </P> <P> Neither side would comment on the move, which aviation industry analysts said  could cause the airlines serious financial problems because some pilots were  entitled to large pension and long-service payments of more than $380,000 each.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strain for Airlines  </P> <P> Some could receive more than $760,000, adding to the strain for the airlines,  already losing millions of dollars each day that their planes are grounded.  </P> <P> The latest round in the two-week dispute about pilots' demands for a 30% wage  hike came hours after some international airlines, responding to a government  request, began ferrying passengers on the internal sectors of their services.  </P> <P> Air Force transport planes were being prepared on the orders of the Labor  government for emergency domestic service.  </P> <P> Normal domestic services were suspended late Wednesday, although some flights  operated early Thursday as aircraft returned to their home airports.  </P> <P> Air New Zealand, which operates 120 flights to and from Australia weekly, said  travelers prepared to fly any distance to get to their destinations had boosted  bookings sharply.  </P> <P> "Australians are aware New Zealand is a close destination," said spokeswoman  Heather Jeffrey. "It is only three hours from an eastern (Australian) city and  three hours back."  </P> <P> In some cases people wanting to get from Sydney to Melbourne -- a 500-mile  flight -- were flying by way of Auckland or Christchurch, a 2,500-mile round  trip.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Hawke Comments Criticized  </P> <P> The grounded companies, state-owned Australian Airlines, Ansett Airlines of  Australia and East-West Airlines, announced legal action against individual  pilots, firing some and suing others for damages.  </P> <P> The pilots federation said Prime Minister Bob Hawke and his ministers had  inflamed the situation with their comments and made it impossible for  negotiations to continue.  </P> <P> Hawke, in various television and radio interviews, has repeatedly belittled the  pilots' skills, at one point comparing them to bus drivers.  </P></p>

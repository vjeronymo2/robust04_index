			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (4): On track for easier access - The approaches to an airport serving 20m people EASY accessibility, with 20m people within two hours' driving, has been one of Manchester Airport's main selling points. In contrast to the southern international airports Gatwick and Heathrow, its approaches have not been badly congested. Outside the rush hours, it is an easy 20-minute drive from the centre of Manchester to the airport. There is adequate parking there, and prices are comparable with elsewhere. Ms Louise Congdon, general manager in charge of market strategy at the airport, says there is still a car-to-aircraft time of only 20 minutes for domestic flights. For international flights, with passport control and security, it takes a little longer. But passage from the car park through the airport is considerably quicker than in the vast, sprawling Heathrow complex. However, Manchester's great weakness has been the lack of a rail link. At the moment the airport can be reached only by road. It is estimated that more than 70 per cent of all journeys to the airport are by private car, the rest by bus or taxi. As air traffic grows and the airport expands pressure would have built up not only on the approach roads but also on the car parks. It was recognised some years back that a rail link would be necessary to alleviate this pressure. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Authority, which runs the county's public transport, applied to the Department of Transport in 1989 to build a rail link. Building started in 1990 and the service will start operating in May, two months after the opening of the first phase of the airport's second terminal. The rail link has cost Pounds 28m to build including rolling stock. Fifty-five per cent of the cost was met by British Rail and the remaining 45 per cent from the GMPTA. The line is a double track rail link and not a metro. It will use mainly existing track although a new 2.64km spur has had to be built. There will be four trains an hour to the airport, two of them shuttles from Manchester Piccadilly. The shuttles will stop at four stations between Manchester and the airport and take 22 minutes. They will leave at 10 minutes and 40 minutes past the hour during the day. In between, will be two express trains. One line will originate at Scarborough and run through Leeds. It will stop at Manchester and then without further stops will go on to the airport. The travel time from Manchester to the airport will be 17 minutes. Leeds will act as a hub for Humberside. The other line will start in Blackpool and run through the conurbations of Preston, Blackburn and Burnley. Again, it will stop in Manchester and then with one further stop go on to the airport. There is already a fast train service from Merseyside into Manchester. The whole of the north of England will therefore be covered, with a total catchment of 20m people. Apart from the four trains an hour during the day, there will be one an hour during the night. Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive says it expects 10,000 people will travel on the service each day. The GMPTA was keen to build the rail link not only because of the airport but because it represents new business for the GMPTA. The missing link in the rail network will be to the south. It will remain difficult to get to the airport from areas such as Crewe or Stoke without cumbersome changes in which passengers will have to handle their baggage. The GMPTA says there is a plan to build a new spur which will tie the airport directly into a rail line running to Crewe. This spur would only need to be a quarter of a mile long and would mean that there would be a feeder from the main west coast line directly into the airport and journeys into Manchester could be avoided. However, the new spur is still at the planning stage. As for roads, the main development to come is the completion of the motorway box around Manchester from Denton to Middleton. This is expected to be finished by 1995 and will mean that the conurbations to the east in West Yorkshire, most notably that of Leeds-Bradford, will be 20 minutes closer to the airport. This will put Leeds within 45 minutes travel time, or about the same as Merseyside. Under consideration is the Greater Manchester West and Northern Relief Road. This would be a trunk route around the conurbation linking the M62, with the M56 and the M6. Also under consideration is the widening of these three motorways. This will ease existing access to the airport. To the north there is also a proposal to extend the M58 to link up with the M61 near Wigan. As with rail, the weak link in the road network would be to the south and south-west because of overcrowding on the M6, particularly in the peak summer months. South Yorkshire and the East Midlands also have access problems because of the lack of an all-weather dual carriageway between Sheffield and Manchester. Pressure is mounting on the government to address both these problems - and not only because of access to the airport, although this is now a principal reason advanced by business lobby groups, including the Coalfield Communities Campaign in South Yorkshire, for improving the roads.</p>

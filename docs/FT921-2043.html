			<p>920320 FT  20 MAR 92 / The Lex Column: Working assumptions for the polls FT-SE Index: 2,467.6 (+2.9) The only consolation for the government in yesterday's unemployment figures is that they could have been worse. A monthly rise of 42,000 is broadly in line with the average for the previous three months, so at least the trend is not accelerating. That said, the Tories will not have been helped in marginal constituencies by the regional breakdown. The south-east and the Midlands accounted for nearly 90 per cent of the total monthly increase. A more general worry is the way in which average earnings continue to grow by more than 7 per cent despite the decline in inflation and continuing announcements of large-scale lay-offs. This may reflect the continuing impact of high pay awards last spring, in which case one could expect the figure to drop fairly quickly. It may also be that redundancies have been concentrated among lower-paid workers, pushing up the average pay of those that remain. That might in turn explain why so little of what ought to be a sharp increase in real wages is finding its way into extra spending in the high street. Even if the statistics overstate the underlying trend in wage growth, the high reported rate could be especially awkward for Labour if it wins the election. It leaves less grounds for resisting catch-up demands from public-sector employees. That would put a further strain on Mr John Smith's budget, whose Pounds 28bn borrowing requirement for 1992-93 already looks less than convincing.</p>

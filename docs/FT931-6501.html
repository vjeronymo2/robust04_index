			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Sterling borrowers ready to lock into low rates THE Eurosterling sector of the international bond market is poised for a marked rise in new issuance in the coming weeks, as an increasing number of borrowers take the view that the time is right to lock into the lowest interest rates the UK has enjoyed for 20 years. UK corporate treasurers, who have so far declined to borrow extensively in the sterling Eurobond market for fear of missing out on further base rate cuts, are now looking hard at the various opportunities for raising fixed-rate sterling funds. A strong UK government bond market, which had fully discounted a further cut in base rates before this weekend's comments from the chancellor of the exchequer that no cut was in prospect, has also increased the attraction of tapping the Eurosterling sector. There is talk in the Eurobond market that the World Bank is considering proposals from banks with regard to reopening by as much as Pounds 100m to Pounds 150m its Pounds 200m 7 1/4 per cent Eurobond issue due 1998, launched last November. British Gas is also said to be looking to raise Pounds 200m through a fixed-rate Eurobond issue with a maturity of seven to 10 years. Neither borrower had any official comment on the rumours. However, British Gas, which announced its 1992 results last week, is known to want to take Pounds 500m out of the market this year, and is also known to favour the longer end of the yield curve. British Gas is a frequent and highly-regarded borrower in the Eurobond market, and syndicate managers say that any sterling Eurobonds it issues will be snapped up by domestic and international investors who are currently starved of paper with seven-to-10-year maturities in the sector. This lack of supply has caused the yield spread on recently-issued paper with those maturities to tighten. For example, the spread on the seven-year Pounds 150m issue by Argyll, the UK supermarket group, has fallen to about 72 points over the 9 per cent UK gilt due in 2000, from a spread at launch of 80 basis points on February 17. The spread on the Royal Bank of Scotland's Pounds 150m 20-year issue of subordinated Eurobonds has dropped to 125 basis points above the comparable UK gilt from 140 basis points at launch on January 28. The exception has been last week's Pounds 100m issue from Peugeot Talbot Motor Company, the UK subsidiary of the French car group. The yield spread on its bonds, due December 1997, has risen to more than 100 basis points above the 8 3/4 per cent UK gilt due 1997 from a spread at launch of 90 basis points. Syndicate managers involved in the deal offer two overriding reasons for the widening: the fact that Peugeot's long-term debt is not rated, and the issuer's absence from the Eurosterling market since 1981. Furthermore, the maturity of just under five years is not so attractive to institutional investors. However, they note that competition for the Peugeot mandate was fierce, with no fewer than seven banks in the running. They also believe that the spread on the bonds would have widened further if the supply of corporate paper had not been so low. In recent weeks, a high proportion of the UK borrowers in the sterling Eurobond market have been financial institutions seeking to raise long-term funding either to top up their regulatory capital or, in the case of insurance companies, to raise extra capital for their operations. The issues have tended to coincide with the publication of the borrowers' 1992 results, and syndicate managers expect more UK borrowers to announce fund-raising exercises with their annual results over the next few weeks. Last week, Royal Insurance raised Pounds 100m of subordinated Eurobonds due 2003. 'We wanted to lock into beneficial interest rates,' says Mr Roy Randall, head of group corporate relations at Royal Insurance. The bonds have replaced the group's existing short-dated bank borrowings and have served to push out its debt profile. Together with Royal's Pounds 76m issue of convertible Eurobonds, launched last December, one-third of the group's borrowings has now got a 10-year maturity profile. More importantly, Mr Randall says that the recent bond issues have resulted in a considerable saving in the group's borrowing costs. Also last week, Woolwich Building Society raised a similar amount of subordinated sterling Eurobonds, but with a much longer maturity of 24 3/4 years. The Province of Ontario will launch its first global Canadian dollar bond issue in the near future. The issue, of at least CDollars 1bn with a maturity of 10 years, will be lead-managed by Merrill Lynch Canada, Nomura Canada, ScotiaMcLeod and Wood Gundy. Ontario said the indicated yield spread of the bonds was around 90 basis points above comparable Canadian government bonds. It said the issue would be at a fixed rate, and there were no plans to swap the proceeds into floating rate. The issue will be part of the province's borrowing programme for 1993-94, estimated at about CDollars 8.9bn.</p>

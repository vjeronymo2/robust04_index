First, all 22 type curve wells were analyzed with equations where current gas-oil rations were used, as well as a single current reservoir pressure of 1,000 psia and the corresponding fluid properties at that pressure. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 11 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Second, the oil permeabilities used in the calculations were derived by the analysis of the 22 wells' historical oil production.

Specifically, Commission records show that the Upper Spraberry formation in the Preston and Shackelford Units, the most productive interval of the three productive intervals, has undergone unitized waterflooding since 1964. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  These records also show that by 1980, the waterflood front had expanded over most of the Preston and Shackelford Units and as a result, most wells were producing more than 75% water. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 12 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The records show that unitized waterflooding also began in the Lower Spraberry in 1964, but was discontinued in 1968 when it was determined that 80% of producing capacity was attributable to the Upper Spraberry and that water injection did not cause additional oil to be produced from the Lower Spraberry. None of the records reviewed shows any waterflooding operations in the Dean formation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 13 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Commission's records do not show whether the Lower Spraberry interval also produces 75% water. However, the record contains no evidence showing that hydraulically fractured Lower Spraberry wells would not be in communication with the Upper Spraberry interval as a result of the extensive system of interconnected natural fractures throughout the Spraberry Formation, thereby allowing water encroachment. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Our review also shows that at original conditions, the Spraberry Formation was a crude oil reservoir with a solution gas drive. Such reservoirs initially have zero effective gas permeability by virtue of the fact that all the gas is dissolved in oil until reservoir pressure declines sufficiently, through sustained production, to allow free gas to form (known as the ``bubble point''). Thus, it appears that gas could not flow at initial conditions because the pores of the rock were filled only with oil and water, not because of the way the rock was cemented together. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, we conclude that one oil and gas flow rate data well ( <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3414&hyph;A), regardless of its completion date, does not constitute substantial evidence showing that the Spraberry Formation meets the flow rate guidelines in the recommended area because of the geological characteristics of the Spraberry Formation in the recommended area. Commission records show that Spraberry sediments in this area were deposited along two depositional axes running roughly north-south. The records further show that, at initial conditions, wells located along the eastern axis produced two to six times as much oil as wells located between the two axes, and that wells located along the western axis are characterized by high water production. The records also show that Spraberry reservoirs in the recommended area are highly compartmentalized due to extensive natural fracturing and complex depositional boundaries. Accordingly, we conclude that data from the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 3414&hyph;A well does not provide sufficient evidence to support Texas' determination that the formation meets the oil and gas flow rate guidelines. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Our review also shows that the record does not reflect the natural fracture permeability in the formation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Commission's records clearly show that the original permeability of the formation (before sustained production and water injection) substantially exceeded 0.1 md due to the existence of interconnected, well-developed natural fractures that extend throughout the Spraberry Formation within the recommended area. The Commission's records also show that wells located parallel to the northeast trend of the fractures have substantially better reservoir permeability and flow rates than those located perpendicular to the trend. Therefore, wells draining sands that do not intersect the fracture system would be expected to reflect matrix permeability only, the pressure regime of a closed system, and low flow rates. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 14 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> The Interim Rule issued February 20, 1980, in Docket No. RM79&hyph;76, states that matrix permeability alone ``will not be sufficient to qualify a formation, because formations with very low matrix permeabilities may be economic to develop if fractures have developed naturally.

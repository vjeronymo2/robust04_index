			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / London Bullion Market (2): Need for more turnover transparency - Robert Guy and Dick Gazmararian THERE is a need for greater transparency in the gold market, suggests Mr Robert Guy, a director of N. M. Rothschild, the bullion house which hosts London's daily gold fixing session. 'I find it very difficult when people ask me the turnover of the market not to be able to tell them.' Mr Guy was the first chairman of the London Bullion Market Association when it was set up in 1987 to represent the interests of participants in the wholesale bullion market. He has only just stepped down after four strenuous years. Freed from the necessity for diplomatic neutrality, Mr Guy is able to nail his colours firmly to the mast. He suggests that the association went one step in the right direction towards more transparency in July, 1990, when it started to publish details of gold lending rates. 'I believe this attracted more business to the market, not only from mining companies, but also from central banks,' he says. Now he has stimulated a debate about turnover transparency. He is very much in favour of the London gold market providing turnover details, not on a daily basis but regular historic statistics. Many other markets do this - Mr Guy points to the London stock exchange as an example of a market where turnover statistics apparently help to lift trade. 'Investors today demand more transparency than they used to. I believe gold market activity would be enhanced if we had greater transparency.' Mr Guy suggests that the management of those companies participating in the market would benefit from publication of turnover statistics. They would have some benchmark figures against which to measure their own statistics. Not every member of the association agrees with him. Mr Guy thinks that most of the LBMA's market making members are in favour but 'as we believe in consensus, unless everyone agrees, it won't happen'. Mr Guy startled some in the bullion business recently by suggesting a merger between the gold and platinum markets. He points out that many members of the LBMA are also part of the platinum market and the two markets face similar issues. Then it would be worthwhile for the combined markets to employ a chief executive to take on some of the work which at present, as far as the LBMA is concerned, is shared between members of the management committee with the backing of an executive secretary and her assistant. Mr Guy says: 'The level of regulation has increased and is increasing. I am sure, for example, that there will be new regulations on financial derivatives and I am also sure this will involve the bullion market.' Perhaps the biggest disappointment during his four years, says Mr Guy, was that the association failed to persuade UK government that gold trading should not attract VAT. He points out that, although in theory gold has been de-monetised, it is still accepted along with currency as a reserve asset by governments in creating and managing their reserves. 'There is no VAT on currency when an individual buys, why should he be penalised on gold?' He suggests that the UK government should conduct an audit to see how much it really gains from taxing gold, including a calculation of the revenue collected from VAT, an estimate of revenue lost because of VAT fraud 'which obviously still continues', and how much business is lost to the London market as a result of the imposition of VAT on gold. Mr Guy is particularly pleased with an agreement reached last year between the association and UK Customs and Excise so that trading between LBMA members could continue to be free of VAT. As Mr Guy explains, as long as gold remains under the effective control of an LBMA member, no VAT should be paid when it is traded. It makes no difference if the gold is allocated to a particular customer or not. Mr Guy's successor as LBMA chairman is Mr Dick Gazmararian. He has no doubt about what is the most important issue facing the association today: it is the question of how the London market will be treated as the European Community harmonises its VAT system. Mr Gazmararian, 46, took over as the association's second chairman in May. He is managing director of Mase Westpac, which has the distinction of being the world's only bullion bank. He started his career with Merrill Lynch before spending eight years as managing director of the Hong Kong operations of Mocatta &amp; Goldsmid, the oldest London bullion house. He joined his present organisation in 1986 when Westpac Banking Corporation, Australia's biggest bank, bought Johnson Matthey Bankers from the Bank of England. The bank had rescued JMB two years earlier after it got into some difficulties with its loan book. He says that, while the association does not expect the EC to remove VAT on gold, neither does it fear that the tax might in future have to be paid on every transaction. However, it is having to work very hard to ensure that the European Commission's bureaucrats understand enough about the way the London bullion market works to recognise that the present arrangements agreed with the UK Customs and Excise should be allowed to continue. Any substantial change is likely to have an adverse impact on LBMA members' cash flow and make the London market just a little less competitive - given that Zurich will not be covered by any EC regulations (at least, not until Switzerland joins the Community.) Time is running short because the Commission hopes to have the issue out of the way by the end of this year. Mr Gazmararian says that the LBMA's efforts to promote itself will continue. 'Promotion is a necessary cost in the times in which we live. More and more is put out by other organisations and regulated exchanges. We have to keep in step with other markets.' But there is a limit to what can be achieved. 'Our job is to let people know how they can buy in London - it's an educational matter as much as anything.' Mr Gazmararian says Mr Guy's contribution to the LBMA was unique. He spearheaded efforts to put it together when at first there was some mutual suspicion. On one side some long-established members of the market were concerned that some of the new participants, being foreign-owned, might be Trojan horses for organisations primarily interested in their own gold centres. On the other hand, there was some concern that the association might be run by the five members of the fix and their interests would be held paramount. But the association was pulled together, even though during those first four years the gold price was falling and it is obviously easier to arouse enthusiasm in a bull market. Mr Gazmararian points out that as he begins his term the association has 12 market making members and 50 other members - 62 in all, about the same as when it started four years ago. And 75 per cent of the membership turned out for the association's annual meeting - a sure sign that enthusiasm runs high. He suggests that today any company wishing to be an international bullion dealer must have a market making presence in London.</p>

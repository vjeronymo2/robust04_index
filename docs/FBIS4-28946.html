			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["NODONG SINMUN Calls For Reviving Fighting Spirit of June </F> Resistants" -- KCNA headline]    [Text] Pyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- NODONG SINMUN in a  commentary today says the desire of the fighters of the  anti-U.S., anti-fascist resistance in June 1987 for  independence, democracy and reunification has yet not been  realized in South Korea though seven years have passed since the  resistance of the South Korean people. This is because of the  U.S. policy of occupying South Korea and maintaining it as a  colonial dependency, it adds.    The analyst says:    As long as South Korea remains a colony of the United States  and fascist traitors stay in power, neither the desire of the  people for a social change nor the reunification of the country  can be achieved. This is the precious lesson gained by the June  resistants and the South Korean people and the sum total of the  struggle.    The South Korean students and people of all segments should  wage a more valiant anti-U.S., anti-war, anti-nuke struggle and  build up fierce flames of massive resistance in all areas to  overthrow the Kim Yong-sam puppet regime and establish an  independent and democratic government.    The South Korean people of all strata and Koreans overseas  must wage a persistent nationwide struggle to reunify the  country by the confederacy formula and, for the present,  vigorously turn up in a joint struggle for the convocation of a  national conference.</p>

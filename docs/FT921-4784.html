			<p>920307 FT  07 MAR 92 / International Company News: Renault to raise fresh cash for Agentina arm RENAULT, the French state-owned car maker, is to raise fresh cash for its loss-making Argentinian arm, to help it increase production for the South American common market, due to come into effect in 1995. The group currently owns 72 per cent of Renault Argentina, with the remaining 28 per cent held by local private investors. It plans to inject the 72 per cent stake into a new holding group, to be owned two thirds by outside investors and one third by Renault. The price of the shares, and hence the amount of fresh capital the exercise will attract, has yet to be fixed, said a Renault official. Renault made 35,000 cars of the 200,000 sold in Argentina last year, by far its largest market within the region. It made a FFr330m (Dollars 59.13m) loss there last year, a legacy of the high inflation that crippled Argentina until the sweeping economic reforms of President Carlos Menem had time to take effect. Renault officials stress that they have faith in the reforms, and that they did not plan to restructure the group's business in Argentina. However, they do not feel they can launch aggressively into neighbouring countries without local partners. The plan for a South American common market, or Mercosur, was agreed a year ago between Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Para -guay. They aim to curb trade barriers between each other and set joint rules on anti-dumping, investment and intellectual property.</p>

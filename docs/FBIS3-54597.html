In the first phase of  the repatriation process, a total of 400 refugee families will  be sent back to their homes in Bangladesh. The remaining  refugees will be repatriated in phases. This was decided at a  meeting held between the representatives of the Bangladesh  Government and the tribal refugees on January 16 in Ramgarh  District of Bangladesh. The tribals agreed to go back after  being assured that their preconditions would be fulfilled by the  Bangladesh government.    The decision of the tribals to go back to Bangladesh was  conveyed by the leader of the tribal delegation to the recently  held talks, Upendra Lal Chakma, when he called on the Tripura  governor, Romesh Bhandari, in Agartala today. Meanwhile, work  has already started with a view to prepare the list of the 400  families to be repatriated in the first phase. It may be  mentioned that these tribals started fleeing from CHT's in 1986  due to the repression launched against them and took refuge in  camps located in the southern part of Tripura.    The following preconditions given by the tribal delegation  were accepted by the representatives of the Bangladesh  government during the meeting held on January 16: 1) the  government agreed to protect the life and property of the  refugees, return their lands, and ensure their proper  rehabilitation; 2) representatives of the Refugee Welfare  Assocation based in Tripura will be allowed to visit CHT's to  see for the themselves the rehabilitation of the refugees who  will be repatriated in the first phase; and 3) repatriation of  the remaining refugees will depend on the progress made in the  talks between the Bangladesh government and the representatives  of the Parbatya Chattagram Jana Samhati Samity [Chittagong Hill  Tracts People's Solidarity Council] on bringing about a  political settlement of the CHT's tangle.    The Tripura governor, Romesh Bhandari, has welcomed the  decision made by the tribal refugees to go back to their  country. It may be mentioned that he played a important role in  this regard. Bhandari became acquainted with the Chakma refugee  problem during the period when he was the foreign secretary of  India. He took personal initiative to expedite the repatriation  of the refugees since he took over as the governor of Tripura.  In this regard, he also held discussions with the central  government in Delhi.</p>

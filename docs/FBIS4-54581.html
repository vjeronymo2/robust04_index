			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Jan Zahorka, of the CR Agricultural Chamber: </F> "Intervention Purchases of Wheat Have Begun"]    [Text] The Council of the State Fund of Market Regulation  decided at the end of 1993 to purchase foodstuffs wheat from  this year's harvest through the form of so-called time-limited  intervention purchases. These purchases are time-restricted  because, as early as spring of this year, contracts will be  concluded for the purchase of foodstuffs wheat, with the  deadline for delivery to coincide with the harvest period. On  the basis of such agreements, down payments amounting to 50  percent of the value of the deliveries are to be paid as early  as this month.    The council decided on the above method of purchasing  following the experiences of last year's harvest, when the fund  purchased only an insignificant quantity of foodstuffs wheat,  with which it was totally unable to influence the situation on  the market. Other buyers had simply paid more than the fund,  which is authorized to purchase at the so-called minimum  (guaranteed) price or to pay in advance, even if those payments  were at a lower price. The fund failed to purchase a significant  amount of wheat, despite the fact that the minimum (guaranteed)  price before the harvest rose significantly.  <H5>  The Market and the Import of Grain </H5>   In view of the fact that the fund virtually purchased no  wheat from the 1993 harvest, it did not even have any stockpiles  with which it could have blunted the increase in the consumer  price of flour, baked goods, and even fodder grains for  production consumption in livestock production. The desire to  have such stockpiles at its disposal was also the sole motive  for the decision of the fund council regarding imports. This  decision actually halted the rise in grain prices. And it did so  even before the actual importation of a single kilogram of  foodstuffs wheat. The effect developed even in the face of  subsequent announcements that these imports represent current  imports at market prices abroad, including customs duties. The  Ministry of Finance merely adopted measures according to which  the customs duties are assessed but not collected for the time  being. Such procedures are valid until such times as the  minister of agriculture submits (in the case of need) a proposal  to forgo such duties; the proposal is submitted to the  government, which makes the final decision.    The Ministry of Finance was motivated in this direction  primarily by the virtual balance between grain resources and  requirements in the Czech Republic, including foodstuffs wheat.  Another reason was the fact that the difference between the  market price of this wheat at the time on our domestic market  (3,500-3,700 korunas [Kc] per metric ton) and the cost of  possible imports, including customs duties of approximately  Kc4,200 per ton, was not considered an impenetrable barrier in  terms of foodstuffs consumer prices. For example, such a price  increase for wheat would show up in the consumer prices of  crescent rolls only to the extent of 10 halers. There was thus  no reason that foodstuffs wheat could not be sold on our markets  at prices of its possible import costs, including customs duties.    Despite the effect of this procedure, it must be said that  the fund for the importation of agricultural products was never  conceived. It is supposed to purchase interventional stockpiles  on the domestic market when prices paid to farmers are lower  than the minimum (guaranteed) price and is thus supposed to  assist in revitalizing farm prices and not to import stockpiles  when market prices are higher than the minimum (guaranteed)  price. In the latter case, it then acts against the interest of  farmers; in the event the forgiveness of customs duties is not  subsidized, consumer prices on the domestic market would not  even benefit consumers or processors.    Thus, in discussing procedures for the year 1994, the fund  council was faced by a decision: either to engage in  interventional purchases in a traditional manner at harvest  time, with a great risk of repeating the situation of last year,  or to conclude contracts for futures purchases, paying out  deposits and thus adapting to the practices used by a number of  buyers. The decision was made to buy time-limited futures.  Regular analyses of the grain market indicate that the decision  by the council has already influenced the conduct of the other  buyers without the fund's having purchased a single kilogram of  grain and without having concluded any futures contracts. Buyers  are offering higher market prices than the minimum (guaranteed)  price, lower-quality parameters than called for by tough export  criteria for the fund; concluding contracts for futures  purchases and paying down payments; using bills of exchange to  make these payments; supplying agricultural chemicals with the  provision that they will subtract their value from the  compensation paid for grain delivered at harvest time; and so  forth.  <H5>  The Task of the Agricultural Chamber </H5>   Because the conclusion of futures contracts to affect  interventional purchases required that the offerings of growers  be concentrated, the fund council asked the Agricultural Chamber  of the Czech Republic for assistance. The agreement with the  director of the fund regarding the most important criteria and  conditions for purchases was aimed at at least allowing growers  to more or less orient themselves and to begin, with the  assistance of okres agricultural chambers, to make a listing of  offerings. The first round of offerings took place as early as  January so it would be possible to meet the deadline for making  downpayments in March. The result was an offering that  corresponds to the quantity of 500,000 tons being considered by  the council.    The procedures adopted by the okres agricultural chambers,  however, encountered the criticism of some members of the fund  council. They were calling on their findings in the field, which  indicated that some growers did not find out about the  possibility for interventional purchases and, in some locations,  allegedly even refused to register their offerings in the  listing (although this involved a grower who is capable of  producing foodstuffs wheat) because the individual involved  allegedly was not a member of the agricultural chamber. But this  was never proved.    Therefore, the agricultural chambers organized a second  round  of listings, the results of which (halfway through February)  already amounted to approximately 50,000 tons more than was  being considered by the council. Therefore, the offerings were  curtailed by the Commodity Council of the Agricultural Chamber  at okres levels according to the actual quantities of foodstuffs  wheat purchased over the past three years, according to  production in recent years and the listing of areas sown to  wheat. However, such an offering was again rejected by the fund  council, with a reference to the fact that there is a need to  leave room for the registration of growers. Therefore, a third  round of offerings was conducted, which ended on 25 February.  <H5>  A Systems or Nonsystems Approach </H5>   The principal effect of any kind of interventional  purchases--in other words, even of futures purchases--is to  influence market prices paid to farmers and the conduct of  buyers in the market. A secondary effect of futures intervention  purchases is the payment of deposits and, thus, the payment of  advances to growers for their expenses for the next harvest.    From the standpoint of the principal effect, therefore, it  is  completely immaterial in terms of price levels whether a  purchase for intervention purposes is actually made from any one  specific grower. Moreover, a specific grower does not care at  all whether a deposit is paid by the fund or by another buyer.  After all, another buyer can (and frequently does) contract for  even more advantageous conditions than the fund. In some  okreses, particularly in production okreses, this was reflected  in low offerings made to the fund. The fact that there have now  been three rounds of listing offerings, however, also leads to  the fact that, particularly in the less productive okreses,  offerings are obviously no longer being made with the intention  of actually delivering foodstuffs wheat, but with the secondary  intent of borrowing financial resources without demonstrating  their returnability to commercial banks or to the Supportive and  Guaranteeing Agricultural and Forestry Fund. And the fund was  not designed to effect an individual approach to every market  entity (so no one could complain that he did not have the  opportunity to participate in interventional purchases). One can  thus believe that the current approach by the fund with respect  to futures intervention purchases is based solely on a  complicated financial situation faced by agricultural primary  producers and on the fact that the measures are being asserted  for the first time. After evaluating the experiences, this  nonsystems approach will surely be transformed into a  systems-type approach and will gain the right to exist.</p>

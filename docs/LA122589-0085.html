			<p><P> December 25, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PAUL ECKE'S POINSETTIAS HAD THEIR ROOTS IN HOLLYWOOD  </P> <P> Older Angelenos may recall the days when, at this time of year, the fields  around Hollywood were ablaze with poinsettias growing in the open. The sight of  the red flowers drew busloads of tourists.  </P> <P> Paul Ecke, who began cultivating the plants in Hollywood in 1906, sold his crop  as cut flowers in stands along Sunset Boulevard. But by 1924 the land had  become too valuable to support further farming, and Ecke moved the operation to  San Diego County.  </P> <P> Today, the Paul Ecke Poinsettia Ranch in Encinitas covers hundreds of acres  near Interstate 5 and Encinitas Boulevard. The payroll climbs to seasonal highs  of about 300 -- not just at the holiday season but also at midyear, when the  emphasis is on producing seedlings for other commercial growers in the West and  in 65 countries around the world.  </P> <P> There still are fields of flowers. But a lot of the production today takes  place within the greenhouses that cover 35 acres, said spokeswoman Carolyn  Mack.  </P> <P> Now, the main business, besides supplying cuttings from "mother plants" to  other growers, is to develop new poinsettia cultivars, she said.  </P> <P> "Every year we produce about 10,000 new and different seedlings. These are  evaluated, and several dozen are selected for further trials and  cross-breeding. It can take a dozen years to produce one new commercial  variety, like this year's bright yellow poinsettia, which we call 'lemon drop,'  " she said.  </P> <P> Paul Ecke Sr., now 95, is in good health and maintains an active interest in  the ranch. "He comes to work every day and checks the greenhouses," Mack said.  BRUCE KEPPEL  </P></p>

			<p>940216 FT  16 FEB 94 / Business and the Environment: Off on the wrong foot - Bronwen Maddox reports on the row brewing over the funding of Britain's Energy Saving Trust Energy efficiency, one of the most innocuous-sounding parts of the UK government's environmental policy, is shaping up to be a political minefield. Last month John Major, the prime minister, announced that the government's plans for combatting the threat of global warming rested heavily on the Energy Saving Trust, whose mission is to encourage households to use fuel more efficiently. But giving that much prominence to the trust may prove a misjudgment. One of the commitments in the 1992 election manifesto, the trust has been slow to get off the ground. The government now needs urgently to sort out regulatory conflicts and political controversies that are threatening to cripple the trust before it has begun to act. One of the most serious emerged within hours of Major's speech. Clare Spottiswoode, director-general of Ofgas, the gas regulator, told a parliamentary select committee that she was reluctant to allow the trust to pass the costs of its projects on to gas customers. Without that means of funding, the trust's activity could be severely curtailed. Eoin Lees, its' chief executive, says her remarks were 'a bombshell'. Even if that is navigated, the trust presents ministers with a tough dilemma. If the trust fails to meet targets for cutting emissions of carbon dioxide, the UK could find it hard to fulfil its pledges at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. But if the trust succeeds, it could become unpopular by pushing up household fuel bills across the country. The purpose of the trust - in fact a company limited by guarantee - is to search out investments for British Gas or the 12 regional electricity companies that will help their customers use energy more efficiently. The heart of the trust's problem is that although energy efficiency schemes often sound like something for nothing, the initial investment needed is high. It has also become clear in the past year that the government's targets for the trust are demanding. According to figures published by the Department of the Environment after last year's spring Budget, the government wants the trust's schemes to curb emissions of carbon dioxide by 2.5m tonnes of carbon a year. That is around a quarter of the cuts that the UK needs to make by the end of the decade to meet its Rio commitments. To meet that goal, the trust will need to be investing between Pounds 300m and Pounds 400m a year by the last years of the decade, according to DoE reports. But although the trust was formally set up 18 months ago when Lord John Moore, the former cabinet minister, was appointed chairman, it is a long way short of those goals. In the year to March 1994 the trust will have invested only about Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m in a handful of pilot projects. The largest of these provides grants of around Pounds 200 to encourage householders to install gas-condensing boilers, which typically cost more than Pounds 1,000. The trust has also backed combined heat and power generators for large blocks of flats and offices; long-life light bulbs; and new local energy advice centres. It is now at a turning point. Next year it wants to spend between Pounds 25m and Pounds 30m, much of this on a nationwide survey of energy efficiency. Equipped with that data, it wants to invest more than Pounds 100m the next year, and some Pounds 350m a year by 1997-98. 'After the pilot projects are complete, we would move to the real big spend,' says Ian Fraser, the newly appointed finance director. But to make that leap, the trust will have to overcome the barrier that Spottiswoode has suddenly erected (Offer, the electricity regulator, has shown less anxiety about the trust's funding). She told the select committee on trade and industry that she did not believe that a regulator should impose levies on customers that were tantamount to 'regressive' taxes - falling proportionally harder on less well-off families. Her concern is that all households, even those that have not benefited from the trust's work, will pay a share of its' costs. But those who have benefited are likely to be comparatively well-off, as they can afford to install gas-condensing boilers. That is a sensitive point for the government, according to Andrew Warren, director of the Association for the Conservation of Energy. The DoE's own figures suggest that if the trust met its targets in full by the end of the decade, and if its costs were fully passed on to customers, annual average energy bills might rise by between 2 per cent and 4 per cent. Those increases would come on top of the value added tax at 17.5 per cent imposed in last year's spring Budget, which provoked one of last year's fiercest political rows. Labour, which has made much of the VAT uproar, has now homed in on the trust's potential impact on fuel bills. Chris Smith, Labour environment spokesman, said: 'We support the concept of the trust, as so little is being done about energy efficiency. But we want the cost of the schemes to be passed on to those properties which have benefited from improvements.' The trust says that these concerns about its future are unwarranted. Its directors argue that if it is successful, energy savings will mean that for many people the rise in household bills would not be as big as DoE figures suggest. They say, too, that many projects planned for the next few years, notably one dubbed 'Affordable Warmth', are targeted at poorer households. Their confidence, however, assumes that the government can persuade its critics that households should foot the bill for energy efficiency. Urgent talks have now begun between Ofgas, the Department of Trade and Industry and the DoE to work out whether the trust's brief is compatible with the regulators' present powers, or whether new regulation might be needed. Those are still formidable hurdles for the trust to overcome before it fulfils the central role in UK environmental policy that Major has awarded it.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Energy Saving Trust  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Spending needed in order to meet government targets  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- 1993-94            pounds3m-4m (actual) 1994-95            pounds25m-30m (proposed) 1995-96            pounds125m 1996-97            pounds250m 1997-98            pounds350m 1999-2000          pounds400m  ---------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: EST  ----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

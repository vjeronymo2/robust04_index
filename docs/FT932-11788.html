			<p>930430 FT  30 APR 93 / Ciampi to seek vote of confidence after government loses support THE newly-formed Italian government said last night it would seek a vote of confidence after the leader of Italy's former communists, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), said he would withdraw support for Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi's coalition. The decision by Mr Achille Occhetto of the PDS followed a surprise decision by the Chamber of Deputies to reject most of the requests by Milan magistrates to waive immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader, to face charges related to alleged corruption. The vote was immediately seen as an effort by the Christian Democrats and Socialists to protect a political class discredited by the corruption scandals. According to Italian news agency Ansa, the three PDS ministers chosen by Mr Ciampi to join the coalition were set to resign in protest. Mr Francesco Rutelli, a Green chosen as environment minister, also said he would resign. Mr Occhetto said he would urgently seek a meeting with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro saying that under the understanding on which PDS members had entered the government, members of the outgoing four-party coalition would back magistrates' requests for immunity to be waived in cases of corruption. Milan magistrates indicated they would take the matter up with the constitutional court, foreshadowing a confrontation between parliament and the judiciary. The sudden turn of events came only 10 hours after Italy's 52nd post-war government was sworn in under Mr Ciampi, the governor of the Bank of Italy, and which included for the first time since 1947 three members of the former communist PDS. The inclusion of the PDS in the 24-strong government would have formed a broad-based group of politicians and technicians to carry out electoral reform and manage the economy. Observers said that if the three PDS ministers withdrew from the government, and their resignations were accepted, it could make early elections inevitable - even before new electoral reform had been introduced.</p>

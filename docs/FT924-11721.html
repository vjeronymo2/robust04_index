			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Former Kelt chief wins control of Blystad THE former chief executive of Kelt Energy, Mr Alastair Locke, has won conclusive control of Blystad, owner of the offshore oil service company, KCA Drilling. The deal goes into the history books as a rare example of shareholders agreeing to accept unquoted shares in a private company in return for publicly-quoted paper. Mr Locke said yesterday that his private company, Abbot Holdings, had received acceptances from 75.23 per cent of Blystad shareholders. The acceptance level means Mr Locke will be able to take the company private or pass any other resolutions at an EGM. Mr Locke already had acceptances from Blystad family directors who controlled 65.2 per cent of the company. Passage to the critical 75 per cent acceptance level was despite opposition from independent Blystad directors who say the offer is inadequate. Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance says Abbot's preference share offer values Blystad at Pounds 7.5m, or 5.4p a share. The offer remains open but is unconditional in all respects.</p>

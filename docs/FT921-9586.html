			<p>920211 FT  11 FEB 92 / Europe risks air fares rise, CAA chief says AIR FARES in Europe could rise and consumer choice diminish unless there is a coherent policy on airline mergers and acquisitions, Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, warned yesterday. In his first important policy statement since becoming CAA chairman eight months ago, Mr Chataway said that without a vigorous European policy on mergers and competition there was 'every prospect that fares will rise and consumer choice will shrink as the little competition that exists today is further diminished'. His warning coincides with an acceleration of the restructuring of the European airline industry. British Airways is in advanced negotiations about linking with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, while this year Air France expects to complete a strategic partnership with Sabena of Belgium which will include the French carrier taking a significant stake in Sabena. While Mr Chataway does not want to prevent large European airlines from expanding their businesses to compete against large US and Asian airlines, he also wants a safeguard for smaller carriers and new entrants into the market who can stimulate competition and lower fares. He added that it was important for European air transport and consumers that a merger policy was formulated before the process of airline consolidation confined Europe's airline to a few so-called mega-carriers. Conditions should be attached to mergers between two national flag carriers to safeguard the position and prospects of smaller airlines, he continued.</p>

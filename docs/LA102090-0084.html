			<p><P> October 20, 1990, Saturday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> NEW GOALIE DOESN'T HELP STRUGGLING GULLS BREAK THE ICE  </P> <P> The expansion San Diego Gulls, winless since capturing their first game in the  International Hockey League, hoped to turn things around with the acquisition  of former NHL goalie Glen Hanlon earlier this week.  </P> <P> It didn't quite work like that Friday at the Indianapolis Fairgrounds Coliseum.  </P> <P> The Indianapolis Ice defeated the Gulls, 6-1, in front of 3,190 fans.  </P> <P> "(Hanlon) didn't get too much support," Gulls Coach Mike O'Connell said. "But  you need big saves to win, and we didn't get that."  </P> <P> Hanlon, who began the year with the Detroit Red Wings, saved 16 shots, but  allowed the Ice (3-2) to score for the first time in three games only 1:29 into  the game. Martin Desjardins scored the first of his two goals off assists from  Marty Nanne and Owen Lessard. Sean Williams, who had only one goal in four  games, scored a hat trick, the final goal on a power play in the third period.  </P> <P> Bob Jones scored the lone goal for the Gulls (1-4-1), who have outshot their  opponent in every game, including 23-22 against the Ice, the defending IHL  champion.  </P> <P> "Just mental mistakes again," O'Connell said. "The mistakes we're trying to  correct are still being made."  </P> <P> The Gulls play in Fort Wayne, Ind., tonight, before returning to the Sports  Arena for a game Tuesday against the Phoenix Roadrunners.  </P></p>

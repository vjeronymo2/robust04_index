			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Installment No 139 of the serialized memoirs of Xujiatun: </F> "Xu Jiatun's Hong Kong Memoirs]    [Text] From Hopes to Disappointment (Part Two of  Four) -- Li Peng Refuses To Heed My Report on the Sale of Hong  Kong Dragon' Shares to Jung Chih-chien, Leaving Me To Repeatedly  Explain the Pros and Cons and Pound the Table With Zou Jiahua    As "Hong Kong Dragon" did not obtain the support of the  General Administration of Civil Aviation of China [CAAC] after  it was established, making for an unsuccessful start of  business, I went to Beijing several times, holding meetings with  then Vice Premier Li Peng who was in charge of CAAC, to study  the matter of supporting the start of mainland business by "Hong  Kong Dragon." "Hong Kong Dragon" had been operating for several  years at a loss. During this period, Kuo T'ai Airlines had  contacted Pao Yu-kang, asking him to consider an exchange of  shares, which would have actually made Kuo T'ai a holding  company for "Hong Kong Dragon." When Pao Yu-kang solicited my  advice, I found it hard to oppose this publicly, but suggested  that he consider CAAC's response, whereupon Pao Yu-kang  immediately stated that he would abandon his plans for an  exchange of shares with Kuo T'ai.    Later, Jung Chih-chien [2837 2535 0256] of the Hong Kong  Central Trust Company bought shares in Kuo T'ai, becoming its  board chairman. While Jung Chih-chien had not notified the  Hong Kong Office of the NCNA of this action in advance, I  guessed that he had at least obtained Li Peng's approval and  Wang Zhen's [then PRC Vice President] endorsement. This  incident upset Pao Yu-kang considerably, with it being learned  only after the event that Pao had at first considered an  exchange of shares with Kuo T'ai, in which Kuo T'ai would have  allowed Pao a seat on its board of directors as deputy chairman.    By 1990, "Hong Kong Dragon's" business had improved, with  already some slight surpluses, so Pao Yu-kang turned over his  post as board chairman to his son-in-law. But just as he was  preparing to buy new aircraft and add new lines with great  prospects, Pao Yu-kang suddenly sought me out, telling me that  he was going to "offer" "Hong Kong Dragon" shares to Ts'ao  Kuang-piao, who would in turn transfer them to Central Trust's  Jung Chih-chien. As I had had absolutely no news of this in  advance, I was surprised and asked why, only to learn that Jung  Chih-chien had proposed the share offering on his own  initiative. I could see that while Pao said that he did not  mind, he was showing a very helpless manner, so that I asked him  to wait until I had clarified the matter before discussing it  further, to which Pao agreed.    By this time, Ts'ao Kuang-piao had also sought out Hong Kong  and Macao International's board chairman, Chang Chien-hua [1728  1696 5478], proposing that Hong Kong and Macao International  "offer" all of its shares held in "Hong Kong Dragon" airlines to  Central Trust's Jung Chih-chien, telling Chang that Pao Yu-kang  had already agreed to "offer" Jung Chih-chien his shares.    Then Chang Chien-hua asked Ts'ao Kuang-piao: "What is your  plan all about? Does the Hong Kong Office of the NCNA know  about it? And has anyone in Beijing approved it?"    Afterwards, Chang Chien-hua told me that the purchasing plan  had been endorsed by Yang Shangkun and approved by Li Peng.  After the purchase, Jung would combine and transfer to Kuo T'ai  the shares owned by Pao Yu-kang and the ones sold by Ts'ao  Kuang-piao. And Central Trust would keep the shares sold by  Hong Kong and Macao International, with Kuo T'ai becoming the  majority shareholder. Business operations would also be  "entrusted" to Kuo T'ai management, with the additional aircraft  being leased by Kuo T'ai, which would stop flying and "offer" to  "Hong Kong Dragon" its mainland routes to Beijing and Shanghai.    Such a complete plan would actually turn Hong Kong Dragon  into a "subsidiary" company of Kuo T'ai, not only violating its  original establishment intention, but also resolving the problem  that Kuo T'ai was having trouble overcoming at the time: its  almost failed dispute with CAAC over mainland and Hong Kong  routes. At the least, Kuo T'ai would temporarily retain its  navigation privileges.    So I notified Pao Yu-kang, asking him to temporarily not  sell  his shares to Jung Chih-chien. And I immediately flew to  Beijing, asking for meetings with Yang Shangkun and Li Peng.  When Yang Shangkun met with me, he said that he had only heard  Jung Chih-chien's report, but "certainly did not understand the  actual situation."    Li Peng would not see me, asking [State Councilor] Zou  Jiahua  [6760 1367 5478] to meet with me on his behalf. While Zou  listened to my report and expressed understanding, he did not  take a stand, saying that he would go to Yang and Li for  instructions. The next day, Zou told me that Yang Shangkun had  stuck to his statement that he had heard Jung Chih-chien's  report but did not understand the actual situation, while Li  Peng had said that he would not consider a change. So I asked  them to reconsider, suggesting that Zou Jiahua look up certain  figures familiar with Hong Kong's situation in this respect for  a better understanding of the matter, to see if they had any  objections to the State Council's decision.    By this time, Jung Chih-chien had also arrived in Beijing,  which I guessed was related to my involvement in this matter.    I again asked for a direct hearing of my report by Li Peng,  who still would not see me. On Zou Jiahua's third meeting with  me, he stuck to his position unchanged, while I repeatedly  explained the pros and cons. We had a heated arguement, with him  pounding the table first, and then me pounding it back, calling  him to account with the questions: "Are not party principles  still important? And are we not going to show consideration for  united front targets?" But we finally parted on bad terms.    On my return to Hong Kong, Pao Yu-kang, who probably already  knew the situation (as to how he knew, I was unclear), invited  me to dinner, which was our last meeting, where we discussed  many emotional matters. When we met, he advised me that: "I  have already sold the shares to Jung Chih-chien (which were sold  in name to Ts'ao Kuang-piao, who then sold them to Jung).  Thank you for your concern, but the matter is settled." After  chatting a bit, he then told me that: "I have had only two  failures in my whole life, one being my investment in the  Standard Chartered Bank, and the other being Hong Kong Dragon!"  What could I say? His investment in Hong Kong Dragon had been  at my request, so that all I could say that I was truly sorry  and offered my apologies to him.    When Chang Chien-hua went to request instructions, Ts'ao  Kuang-piao told him that Pao Yu-kang had already sold his  shares, and that Chang should also quickly sell his shares in  Hong Kong and Macao International. When Chang asked me "whether  he should also sell to him," I indignantly said that: "Ts'ao  Kuang-piao does not have the say, so that in order to sell, they  will have to get State Council documents." The next day, Jung  Chih-chien asked to see me. While I knew that he would not come  to see me without business, and that he was coming in reference  to this matter, I saw him anyhow. But when he greeted me as  uncle and told me his mission, I told him also that in order to  get Hong Kong and Macao International's shares in Hong Kong  Dragon, he would need State Council notification, which I would  comply with. Sure enough, before long, State Council  notification arrived, making it obvious how much Li Peng  supported and "cherished" him.</p>

			<p>910418 FT  18 APR 91 / Commodities and Agriculture: Large surplus of copper concentrates forecast COPPER DEMAND is growing more strongly than previously expected but the supply chain is getting out of balance, according to Mitsubishi Materials Corporation. Substantial surpluses of copper concentrates, an intermediate material, are likely in the next 10 years, says Mr Shigeki Yabuta, Mitsubishi's general manager, ore department. Among the projects contributing to the concentrates surplus are Escondida in Chile (owned by a consortium including BHP of Australia and RTZ Corporation of the UK and Mitsubishi); the expansion of Freeport Copper's Etsburg mine in Indonesia; and the potential re-start of Bougainville, operated by CRA of Australia, in Papua New Guinea. Mr Yabuta says that if all known new smelter projects go ahead as planned there would be enough smelting capacity to meet projected demand during the 1990s. However, some will probably be delayed because of environmental pressures and the problems of raising capital. Delays would worsen the concentrates surplus. Copper demand in the west (excluding the former and present Communist countries) is likely to grow by 8.7 per cent between 1990 and 1995 and by nearly 20 per cent between 1990 and the year 2000, Mitsubishi forecasts. This would increase annual consumption by 776,000 tonnes to 9.708m tonnes in 1995 and 10.672m tonnes in the year 2000. Mitsubishi suggests that former and existing Communist countries will show a 0.4 per cent annual consumption increase raising total world copper demand in 1995 to 12.107m tonnes, and 13.119m tonnes in the year 2000. Mr Yabuta, in a paper prepared for a meeting of the International Wrought Copper Council, suggests that 824,000 tonnes of the additional demand by 1995 will be met by cathodes produced by the solvent extraction-electrowinning process and 132,000 tonnes by the increased recovery of scrap metal. This leaves a balance of 317,000 tonnes of copper to be provided by concentrates. Projects already under way would provide an extra 528,000 tonnes of copper in concentrates by 1995, giving a surplus of 210,000 tonnes. He suggests that the surplus will rise to at least 860,000 tonnes by the year 2000. To meet forecast extra demand an additional 449,000 tonnes of smelting and refining capacity is required by 1995 and by 2000 an additional 1.462m tonnes - 'equivalent to 10 large-scale smelters of 150,000 tonnes each'. If all planned projects went ahead, there would be 540,000 tonnes of additional smelting capacity by 1995 and an increase of 1.45m tonnes by 2000, 'almost enough to meet forecast increases in refined copper consumption' Refined copper consumption last year rose by more than 2 per cent to a record 8.87m tonnes while production increased by less than 1 per cent to 8.402m tonnes, according to the International Wrought Copper Council. This implies there was a supply deficit of about 200,000 tonnes. Consumption will be flat this year, predicts the IWCC, while production should continue to grow, suggesting there will be a small supply surplus, 'to be followed by a larger surplus in 1992'.</p>

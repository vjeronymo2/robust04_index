			<p><P> February 19, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERVICE WINS ALL-AROUND TITLE AS BRUIN GYMNASTS TAKE OWN MEET  </P> <P> Tanya Service recovered from a motorcycle spill on Monday to win the all-around  on Saturday and help the Bruins gain their third straight UCLA-Times Women's  Gymnastics Invitational title, thus moving from uneasy rider to easy glider in  less than a week.  </P> <P> She scored an invitational record 38.85 in the all-around, including another  meet record of 9.85 on floor exercises, to keep Bruin dominance alive in this  event. "Our first peak of the year," said UCLA Coach Jerry Tomlinson.  </P> <P> The Bruins, who have won 23 straight dual meets but never an NCAA championship  (third last year), had a team score of 190.95 points(another record) to easily  beat Cal State Fullerton (188.2) and Arizona State (188.15). Georgia was fourth  (187.50) and Stanford was fifth (183.65).  </P> <P> For Service, who missed competing in the NCAA championships last year when she  dislocated her elbow in the regionals, this week's developments were very  encouraging. Usually when she gets injured, it is in competition.  </P> <P> This time it was riding on the back of boyfriend (and UCLA men's gymnast) Mike  Chaplin's motor scooter when they were rear-ended. "Lower back whiplash," she  explained after the Pauley Pavilion meet. "It still hurts."  </P> <P> Not that anybody noticed. College gymnastics best athlete never to win an NCAA  title sailed through the meet, capping it off with a crisp floor exercise  routine. Her record-breaking score was helped by teammate Shawn McGinnis,  another oft-injured gymnast, who threw what was announced as college gymnastics  first "full-in."  </P> <P> In fact, it was the second. McGinnis had done the double-twisting double-back  somersault in a dual meet with Cal State Fullerton. "But they weren't sure it  was the first at the time," she said. "So I guess I'm still the first."  </P> <P> Her routine earned her a 9.80, which tied the record. But it only stood for  minutes until Service followed with hers, nothing as spectacular but possibly  more polished.  </P> <P> Service, who had won the all-around in this same meet two years ago with a  record score of 38.60, beat Arizona State's Karli Urban (38.40) and teammate  McGinnis (38.30). UCLA's Jill Andrews and Cal State Fullerton's Liso Dolan tied  for fourth with 37.90.  </P> <P> Tomlinson said his team, which normally performs in the John Wooden Center, was  a "little bit hyper" in its once-a-year Pauley Pavilion performance. "Our bars  performance was hyperness," he said of some uneven scoring.  </P></p>

			<p>940328 FT  28 MAR 94 / The Monday Interview: No short cuts for committed minimalist  -Fame has come late for fashion designer Jil Sander, explains Alice Rawsthorn Most fashion designers hit the headlines when they are bright young things turning out avant garde designs at the start of their careers; but there are exceptions for whom fame and acclaim comes later in life. Jil Sander, now 50, has for two decades been creating contemporary classic clothes in a subtle, understated style. Her crisply-cut trouser suits and tunics have won her a fanatical following among the nattier brand of bus-inesswomen and Hollywood sirens such as Winona Ryder and Sharon Stone. Her commercial success has already made her one of the wealthiest women in her native Germany. But it is only recently, as consumer taste has swung away from the opulence of the 1980s, that Jil Sander's minimalism has been billed the look of the moment. 'It feels like my time has come,' she says. 'I felt out of step with fashion in the 1980s. I hated the madame look - all those little suits with shiny buttons. It was boring and bourgeois. It made women look like little girls. I like clothes that make them look cool and classy - that bring out their strength. Women don't have to dress like bimbos to be sexy.' Sander, with her tousled blonde bob and laughing blue eyes, is typical of the strong, self-confident women for whom she designs. She exudes energy as she strides into the room in a navy blue trouser suit and immaculate white T-shirt. Her face is free from make-up. Her only ornament is an extremely expensive, but workmanlike, watch. She was born Heidemarie Jiline Sander in wartime Wesselburen, a small town on the North Sea coast to which her mother had fled from the Hamburg bombs while her father was fighting on the Russian front. Her childhood was happy and comfortable, but there was nothing in it that might have been expected to spur her on to her current success. 'There were no career women in my family, so I didn't have any role models in that sense. But my mother was very creative and she always encouraged me to express myself. The German women of her generation were very strong. Life was tough in the years after the second world war. Many women played dual roles by looking after their families and earning a living. That made a big impression on their children, like me, and even on their grandchildren.' Sander studied textile engineering and then spent a year as an exchange student in Los Angeles. 'It was a wonderful time for me. California seemed so sunny and free after Germany which, in the early 1960s, was still stifling and narrow-minded.' But she cut short her stay in the US when her father died and returned home to help her mother and younger brother. She worked as a stylist on a fashion magazine and started to design clothes in her spare time. In 1968 she opened a boutique in the plush Poseldorf area of Hamburg and in 1974 launched her first full collection. Germany then, as now, had a huge commercial clothing industry. But it was a creative back-water. Karl Lagerfeld, the only other notable German designer of her generation, fled to France where he is now artistic director of Chanel. Sander stayed in Hamburg to go it alone. 'It wasn't easy establishing myself as a designer in Germany,' she says now. 'The struggle of rebuilding the country after the war and the guilt about the terrible things that had happened created a very materialistic culture. The nouveaux riches were very powerful and the creative part of our heritage tended to be forgotten. Things are changing now after reunification, but in those days it was difficult.' Also she began her business at a time when it was relatively rare for women to do so. 'It may sound surprising but I've never experienced any problems because of my sex. I founded the company and I run it myself. That's the way it's always been. I've never had a boss. Things might have been different if I had. I think some men do find it difficult to deal with women in positions of authority. That's why so many women set up on their own. They opt out of the boardroom battles.' The business grew gradually in the early years but its expansion has accelerated since going public in 1989. Sander is now the chairman and majority shareholder of a company with annual turnover of Dollars 210m that sells everything from Pounds 900 suits to Pounds 30 bottles of scent. Yet she still sees herself as a designer rather than a businesswoman. 'Even as a child I always knew I wanted to be creative, but the business side came as a surprise. I do it because I have to. It still amazes me that I have a flair for it. The key is delegation. I've made sure that I have very good people.' She still oversees every aspect of the design of her collections and even tries on each garment to check the cut and construction. 'I need to know whether anything is wrong. The only way to be sure is to try it myself.' What sort of mistakes does she find? 'Everything.' Her face wrinkles. 'Maybe the sleeves are too short or a button is in the wrong place. I've got to be sure.' She usually works for 14 hours a day. 'I've always been pre-occupied by my career. There's never been enough time for me to play a conventional domestic role, even if I'd wanted to.' But she does enjoy the fruits of her success - she has a 19th century town house in Hamburg, a country estate in Schleswig-Holstein and the latest acquisition, an 18th century town house in Paris. At first she favoured the same minimalist style for her homes as for her clothes. 'It was very chic,' she laughs. 'So chic that no one could relax.' These days she scours the auction rooms for antique furniture, although her taste in art is still uncompromisingly contemporary. 'I'm a modernist. I'm interested in art that reflects my own era. Besides, I've been buying work by Joseph Beuys, Jannis Kounellis and Cy Twombly since the early days when it was cheap. It certainly (giggle) isn't now.' Her latest passion is gardening. She has created a formal English garden in the grounds of her Schleswig-Holstein estate and spends her spare time there pruning trees and clipping hedges. 'I love the idea of planning a garden and imagining how it will look in 10 or 20 years. It's a wonderful contrast to fashion. Clothes come and go from season to season. It's all change, change, change. A garden is something that lasts.'</p>

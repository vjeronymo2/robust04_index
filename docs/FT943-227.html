			<p>940930 FT  30 SEP 94 / Tight price curb on Scots power groups: Shares fall on regulator's move Share prices in the two Scottish electricity companies fell sharply yesterday after Professor Stephen Littlechild, the industry regulator, announced price controls which he said would save consumers Pounds 300m over the three years from next April. If accepted by the companies, the controls would mean a saving of Pounds 91 over three years to a family with a Pounds 400-a-year ScottishPower bill. Scottish Hydro-Electric household customers would save Pounds 74 on average. The controls were tougher than some analysts had predicted, with Hydro-Electric judged by most to have come off worst. At the close yesterday Hydro-Electric shares were down 45p at 327p while ScottishPower was down 31p at 349p. The review contrasted with Prof Littlechild's recent review of the English and Welsh electricity companies which were criticised as being too lax - and prompted significant rises in share prices. Direct comparison is difficult because the Scots companies are generators, suppliers and distributors while the controls south of the border were applied only to distribution. In distribution, the one area where comparison is possible, the Scottish companies appeared to have been treated less harshly. ScottishPower must cut distribution prices by 2 per cent a year in real terms in the next five years and Hydro-Electric by 1 per cent. The English and Welsh companies were required to make cuts of between 11 per cent and 17 per cent in the first year and 2 per cent thereafter. The Scots had argued that they were entitled to better treatment because price controls for the first year of privatisation were tougher on them than on English and Welsh companies. Hydro-Electric had pressed to be able to increase its distribution charges in real terms to compensate for a formula which will require it and ScottishPower to lower their generation charges in stages to match those in England and Wales by 1998-99. Prof Littlechild also proposes to tighten controls on the companies' supply businesses which buy and sell electricity. He wants reductions of 2 per cent in real terms for three years until the market is opened up to full competition. ScottishPower said the review was broadly in line with expectations and 'would not alter our stated aim of sustainable real dividend growth of 5 per cent to 6 per cent a year.' Mr Roger Young, Hydro-Electric chief executive, said the review document was extremely complicated. The board would decide on 'acceptance or otherwise'. Some analysts downgraded dividend growth forecasts although most consider 5 per cent achievable for the rest of the decade.</p>

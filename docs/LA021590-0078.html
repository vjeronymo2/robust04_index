			<p><P> February 15, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SOVIET LAWYER HOLDS NO BRIEF FOR HER COUNTRY'S JUSTICE  </P> <P> Painting a far from flattering picture of her homeland, a Soviet lawyer  visiting Ventura County this week blasted Soviet economic reforms, charged that  her country's judges are corrupt and called her fellow countrymen rude.  </P> <P> Irina Mashlenko, touring Ventura at the invitation of Dist. Atty. Michael D.  Bradbury, showed no qualms about stating her views on conditions in her  country.  </P> <P> The self-possessed 29-year-old, who is not a member of the Communist Party,  said the trip, part of a unique six-month internship, would have been  impossible without recent changes in her country.  </P> <P> "This is the first time in history that this has been done and it's really  remarkable to be involved in this program without interference of a  governmental organization," Mashlenko said after touring the district  attorney's office.  </P> <P> Bradbury met Mashlenko at a law conference she was attending in November as  part of her internship with a Maryland legal firm. Bradbury said he was  surprised by Mashlenko's outspokenness.  </P> <P> He said it was her willingness to share information about the Soviet Union that  made it worthwhile to sponsor the six-day trip to California, where she studied  the district attorney's office and told lawyers about conditions and changes in  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> "I felt it would be a mutually enriching experience for the local lawyers in  light of what is going on in the world today," Bradbury said.  </P> <P> "It would not have been as beneficial if we had had someone come out who was  not as forthcoming," he added.  </P> <P> Mashlenko is one of 17 Soviet lawyers chosen from 167 candidates in a program  sponsored by the American Bar Assn. and the Soros Foundation, a New York agency  that funds different educational and social programs in the United States and  the Soviet Union.  </P> <P> The program allows the lawyers -- who must speak English, have a legal  education and be younger than 35 -- to work with private attorneys, public  defenders, state prosecutors and legal researchers in offices stretching from  Maine to Hawaii.  </P> <P> "The belief was that the Soviet lawyers could profit from the long-term  practical exposure to the way law firms work," said Anthony Richter, program  director of the Soros Foundation. "They could see the roles of lawyers in the  United States and even possible things they could avoid as they go about  shaping their own society's laws in the future."  </P> <P> Mashlenko said she did not know when many of the changes recently suggested to  rectify the Soviet justice system would be enacted and doubted whether some  would work. Hesitating once or twice and stressing that she does not speak for  her country, Mashlenko sharply criticized the traditional Soviet justice  system.  </P> <P> She said defendants are beaten into making confessions, prisoners are  prohibited from taking showers and corrupt judges are easily bribed.  </P> <P> Many Soviet judges are swayed toward certain decisions under threat of recall  by the government bodies that elect them, she said.  </P> <P> "Everybody knew that the judge was not independent in his decision because it's  easy to bribe the judge," Mashlenko said, adding that Soviet judges  traditionally have received low pay and are not accorded much respect.  </P> <P> In addition, she said, prison conditions in the Soviet Union are dismal.  </P> <P> Soviet prisoners live in outdated facilities and are banned from using the  television, telephone or showers. They are severely limited in the  opportunities they have for seeing their families and are only allowed about  three letters per year, she said. She said the most important difference  between the legal systems in the Soviet Union and United States is the jury  trial. Trial by jury was recently approved in theory in the Soviet Union but  has yet to be implemented, she said.  </P> <P> Even so, she said, juries will only be used in cases in which the defendant has  committed a crime that carries the death penalty.  </P> <P> However, Mashlenko said, she believes the American justice system has its own  problems, notably the length of time many condemned prisoners spend on Death  Row as they await rulings on their appeals for a change of sentence.  </P> <P> In the Soviet Union, she said, the appellate process is much quicker.  </P> <P> "I think that it's terrible when a person lives and lives and is still  waiting," she said. "In Russia, the death penalty is executed."  </P> <P> Keenly interested in her surroundings, Mashlenko has observed more than the  legal system, noting especially the clean restaurants and restrooms in the  United States.  </P> <P> She said she also was pleased by Americans' volunteer efforts to donate money  and clothing to those less fortunate. And she has enjoyed the friendliness of  those she has met.  </P> <P> "Because of all the difficulties in our country, people are so involved in  their own problems that they're more aggressive and ruder," she said.  </P> <P> While she has enjoyed her experiences here, Mashlenko said, she is preoccupied  by the rapid changes now occurring in her country.  </P> <P> "The Americans are so excited, but, excuse me, I really can't believe it," she  said. "I'm a little more skeptical."  </P> <P> Mashlenko said she believes that despite Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's  success in foreign policy he has absolutely failed in economic reform.  </P> <P> "Those economic difficulties can destroy political changes," she said. "The  people's patience is exhausted. They don't want to wait anymore."  </P> <P> Mashlenko said she has long had an interest in the American justice system.  </P> <P> Saying that she has "never liked the work of the prosecutor," she said she  wants to become a defense lawyer when she returns to the Soviet Union in April.  </P> <P> She said she has been more inspired to pursue her goals after watching defense  work by the lawyer she is interning with in Maryland.  </P> <P> During one case she observed, a doctor charged with fraudulent possession of  controlled substances was acquitted.  </P> <P> "That was a great victory," Mashlenko said.  </P> <P> Wearing a demure maroon dress with a white collar and cuffs, Mashlenko paid  close attention during her Ventura County visit, even expressing wide-eyed  interest in a disaster-training session for county employees.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Mashlenko said, her most vivid memory will be of Disneyland, which  she visited with Bradbury on Sunday.  </P> <P> "It was the strongest impression and experience I got in my stay here,"  Mashlenko said. "I almost forgot about the reason I'm here and the political  problems and everything."  </P></p>

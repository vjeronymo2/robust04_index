			<p>920813 FT  13 AUG 92 / Maxwell law firm has bills queried A LAW firm working on the insolvency of Maxwell Communication Corporation had its fees questioned yesterday in a US bankruptcy court, Andrew Jack writes. The judge also extended the deadline for the completion of a reorganisation plan for MCC. Judge Tina Brosman granted administrators a 60-day extension to October 13 to file the plan for the company - and said she was pleased with the progress made so far. Sitting in the South District of New York Court, the judge refused to approve a Dollars 677,000 bill from Milbank Tweed Hadley and McCloy for work in the three months to June 30. She also queried payments to Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, and JP Morgan, the merchant bank, but authorised their settlement. Milbank Tweed said its bill covered 85 per cent of lawyers' hours over the period, tax advice and clerical costs. The judge queried fees of between Dollars 35 and Dollars 50 an hour for paralegals faxing documents, photocopying papers and stuffing envelopes. The firm defended the fees as comparable with those demanded by temporary workers. MCC is protected from creditors under Chapter 11 in the US, and through administration under UK insolvency law.</p>

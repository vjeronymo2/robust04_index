			<p>BFN     [Text] On Friday the Crimean parliament adopted a  resolution under which all residents of the republic of draft  age should pass military service in the army on the territory of  the peninsula. Deputies also decided to suspend sending draftees  out of Crimea and to draft them for serving in Crimea and in  Black Sea Fleet units.    At the same time the Crimean parliament ordered the military  commissar of Crimea, Volkov, to fulfill this resolution.  However, Volkov said at the session that he would not be able  to fulfill the resolution because he is subordinate directly to  Commander-in-Chief, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk. Volkov  also said that "it is impossible to have all draftees stay in  Crimea."    In the meantime, Vice Commander of the Black Sea Fleet,  deputy Aleksandr Frolov said at the session that "the commander  is ready to receive all draftees from the Republic of Crimea."    On the same day the republic's parliament formed a  delegation  which will leave for Kiev in a few days for talks on the return  to the first version of the Crimean Constitution of May 6, 1992.  The delegation is led by Chairman of the Crimean parliament  Sergey Tsekov. The delegation includes, Refat Chubarov, one of  the leaders of the Crimean Tatars and the faction Kurultay of  the Crimean Tatars in the Crimean parliament.</p>

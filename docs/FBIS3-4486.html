Russian Ambassador to China Igor Rogachev  said in Hong Kong yesterday that five or six diplomats would be  stationed here.    It is understood that the Consul-General, who will be named  soon, is fluent in Chinese and English and has served in China  and the West. "Hong Kong is such a major international  financial centre, we missed a lot by not having diplomatic  representation," Mr Rogachev said.    Mr Rogachev, who is Russia's premier sinologist, called on  Hong Kong businessmen to take advantage of the opportunities  afforded by economic reform. "Our parliament is enacting new  laws on investment, trade, and other aspects of the economy," he  said. "In addition to doing business in the big cities, Hong  Kong companies may play a particularly large role in the  development of Siberia and the (Russian) Far East." He  disclosed that a delegation of central bankers had recently  visited Hong Kong in search of investment.    Last year, Hong Kong exported $2.44 billion worth of goods  to  Russia, most of them re-exports. Imports were a relatively  paltry $706.93 million.    Poland is the first country in the former East Bloc that has  diplomatic representation in the territory.    The Director of Protocol of the Hong Kong Government Vivian  Warrington yesterday welcomed the setting up of the Russian  mission. He said approval in principle had been given to Hungary  and the Czech Republic to open consulates here.    Both countries, however, have yet to begin the formalities  of  establishing their missions.</p>

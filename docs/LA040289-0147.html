			<p><P> April 2, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> UCLA HOLDS OFF CS FULLERTON TO WIN WEST REGIONALS  </P> <P> The UCLA women's gymnastics team defeated Cal State Fullerton three times  during the regular season.  </P> <P> So, it was hardly surprising when the No. 2-ranked Bruins -- led by Kim  Hamilton and Tanya Service -- held off No. 6 Cal State Fullerton Saturday night  to win the regional team title and advance to the national championships, April  14-15, at Athens Ga.  </P> <P> The Bruins outscored the Titans, 193.25-191.85. Defending regional champion  Oregon State was third with 190.85 points, and Washington was fourth at 187.70.  Fullerton, which had not advanced to the nationals in two years, also qualified  for the meet at Athens.  </P> <P> "It was closer than I thought," UCLA Coach Jerry Tomlinson said of Saturday's  competition. "We trained to do this well. In fact, I feel we should have done  better. It was not one of our more polished meets, especially the bars."  </P> <P> The Bruins, who will be making their fourth consecutive trip to the nationals,  held a .55-point advantage over Fullerton after the first rotation. But UCLA  fell behind the Titans after the second set of scores when the Titans scored  well on the beam, and UCLA struggled on the uneven bars.  </P> <P> Fullerton totaled 96.35 points to UCLA's 96.10.  </P> <P> "In my mind, certain things needed to happen (for us to contend)," Fullerton  Coach Lynn Rogers said. "One of them was going five for six on the beam."  </P> <P> Which Fullerton accomplished, placing three in the top five finishers in the  event.  </P> <P> That pressured UCLA, because the Bruins next rotation was the beam, one of the  more difficult events.  </P> <P> "It was extremely critical going into the beam," Tomlinson said. "I was  worried, only because we were going to the balance beam, and you have to stay  on (the beam) in order to stay in the running."  </P> <P> Service, who was second in the all-around competition, won the beam with a  9.90.  </P> <P> "We still have things to work on in the next two weeks," Service said.  </P> <P> Hamilton was the all-around champion.  </P></p>

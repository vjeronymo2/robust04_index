			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bear Li] </F>   [Text] Taipei, May 13 (CNA) -- The main opposition  Democratic Progressive Party [DPP] on Friday [13 May] finalized  its proposal for constitutional change, recommending that the  Republic of China [ROC] adopt a single-parliament system and do  away with the National Assembly, among other changes.    The DPP's National Assembly Caucus submitted the proposal,  which is also being supported by several nonpartisan and  Kuomintang Assembly members, to the National Assembly  Secretariat.    National Assembly members are gathering in Yangmingshan in  suburban Taipei for a three-month special meeting to consider  constitutional changes and the nominations of grand justices and  the head of the Judicial Yuan.    Of the DPP's 31-article proposal, only the one that  recommends election of the ROC president and vice president by  popular vote is shared by the ruling Kuomintang.    Other major points of the DPP proposal include allowing  national referendums, abolishing existing nuclear power plants,  judiciary reforms, and doing away with the quota for overseas  Chinese parliamentary members.    The KMT, which controls a majority of assembly seats, has  decided to push ahead with its own version of constitutional  changes, including the election of an assembly speaker and vice  speaker, extension of legislators' tenure from three years to  four, and granting overseas Chinese the right to vote in the  presidential election.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Leading Article: Euro-plugs Lord Young, when trade and industry secretary, remarked that Europe would truly have one market when it used one electric plug. Now that just such an idea is under study in Brussels, it is turning out to be less straightforward than it seemed. With Labour party support, UK plugmakers are out to scotch proposals for a standard Euro-plug, claiming it would be dangerous and would eventually require Pounds 20bn to be spent re-wiring homes throughout Britain. But British readers should pause before complaining to their MPs about another piece of Euro-lunacy. There are practical advantages to harmonisation. The European Commission estimates that scale economies would enable Euro-plugs to be made for only one tenth the cost of the moulded plastic plugs which UK law will soon require electrical equipment manufacturers to fit to their products in the factory. There would be further savings for electrical equipment makers, which have already standardised many of their products and are increasingly concentrating European production in fewer plants. Their freedom to match supply to demand would be increased if they no longer had to juggle with 20 different plug standards. Meanwhile, cross-border shoppers would be spared the chore and safety risk of changing plugs on electrical products when they got them home. The issue is not the desirability of this nirvana, but the difficulty of attaining it. Since fitting suitable Euro-sockets would be practical only in new houses or when re-wiring existing ones, the change-over would be lengthy. If new products were wired to Euro-plugs as standard, they would require special adaptors to work in existing sockets. That would involve some inconvenience. UK plugmakers say it would also be unsafe, as consumers would be tempted to stick Euro-plugs directly into British sockets. How real that risk would be is debatable. It does not appear to apply to the 18m foreign tourists who visit British every year. Like many of the plugmakers' arguments, it smacks of special pleading. Rather than welcoming harmonisation as an opportunity to sell throughout Europe, they seem more concerned with the threat it poses to their existing markets, where the UK standard has limited competition. Nonetheless, the affair poses a genuine conundrum. Harmonisation makes sense in a Europe where crossing national frontiers is becoming increasingly routine for both individuals and businesses. Yet, experience suggests that attempts to standardise banal but highly visible items such as plugs often provoke the fiercest popular resentment about bureaucratic meddling from the centre. In such cases, the challenge for proponents of standardisation is to mount a persuasive case that inevitable short-term dislocation is outweighed by the benefits, many of which may only be realised over the longer term.</p>

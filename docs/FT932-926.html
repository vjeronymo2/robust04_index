			<p>930625 FT  25 JUN 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Quotas on CIS 'could hit aluminium prices' ALUMINIUM PRICES could go down if the European Commission imposes quotas on imports to Europe from the Commonwealth of Independent States, according to Intercomalum, the organisation recently set up to promote and defend the CIS aluminium industry. CIS producers would be forced to look for new markets and might have to offer additional discounts to tempt new customers. This would have a knock-on impact on worldwide aluminium prices, Intercomalum suggests. This is one of the points the organisation will make in written presentations to the commission, scheduled to be delivered on Tuesday. The commission is being urged by European producers to impose draconian quotas on the former Soviet Union's aluminium imports and is inquiring into their complaints under rules that allow measures to 'safeguard' European Community industries. Its decision is expected very soon. Details of the CIS industry's strenuous plea against quotas were finalised at an Intercomalum meeting in St Petersburg this week. Intercomalum will also point out that any drop in the CIS's income would make it even more difficult for the aluminium industry to carry out environmentally-necessary work at its smelters. There would, moreover, be less money for downstream joint ventures with western groups for such things as aluminium can production plants, which would absorb more CIS metal domestically. Mr Elliott Spitz, a vice chairman of Intercomalum and also a director of the New York-based AIOC Corporation, said that Intercomalum would shortly set up an office in London. He said the UK capital was chosen to emphasise that the office would provide 'a conduit for investment in the CIS by way of joint ventures' and not just for political lobbying.</p>

			<p>920206 FT  06 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Companies face finance hurdle in Russian ventures WESTERN companies seeking joint ventures in Russia and other republics are unlikely to receive benefits from the aid pledged to the former Soviet Union by their governments last week. The message from the UK's Export Credits Guarantee Department is that guarantees will not be provided until the IMF agrees a programme with Russia, or until banks are in place with the authority to provide sovereign guarantees. Other western export credit agencies are expected to take a similar view. For executives at the UK engineering group, John Brown, keen to press ahead with their Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) polyethylene-producing joint venture in Russia, the message is frustrating: 'We are ready to make major progress, and are seeking all sorts of possible ways of going ahead with what is certainly one of the most bankable projects around,' says Mr Tony Bruce, director of marketing. The venture would be John Brown's second large project in Russia, and would make 300,000 tonnes a year of polyethylene for export, using natural gas that is currently being flared off. Its partner, Gasprom, already has foreign exchange earnings from long-term contracts selling gas for export. John Brown's first joint venture, signed in April 1988, has run smoothly and is near completion. It will boost output from an existing polyethylene plant from 100,000 to 300,000 tonnes a year, again for the export market. Although Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, last week offered to provide Pounds 280m in new export credits to Russia and other republics, until an institution is in place prospective projects will either be stalled, or will go ahead without export credit protection. Prospects for projects in other republics - like Chevron's plans to develop Kazakhstan's Tengiz oil field - are even more deeply in the mire. 'There is no ready and immediate solution,' says Mr Bruce: 'It requires our project finance team, and Morgan Grenfell our financial advisers, to be even more creative and imaginative than would normally be required.' John Brown is better placed than many to 'multi-source' financing: Linde in Germany is doing work for the project, and is being pressed to seek credit cover from Hermes; John Brown, apart from approaching Britain's ECGD, can source work in the US, enabling it to approach the US Exim Bank for cover. Gasprom is being approached to provide foreign exchange, at least to cover interest costs arising during the three to four years it will take to complete the project. But the single most helpful development would be the emergence of a credible guarantor institution to replace the Soviet Union's former export credit bank, Vnesheconombank. There was talk of a breakthrough early this week when Japan's Exim bank indicated it would accept guarantees from Vneshtorgbank, Russia's leading commercial bank. However, the EC has signalled that it is seeking guarantees from the central bank of Russia - a move which, if it succeeds, is likely to throw doubt over Vneshtorgbank's authority as a guarantor.</p>

			<p>920410 FT  10 APR 92 / The Property Market: Surveyors map out the road to reform The great and the good of the UK's chartered surveying world yesterday took a break from considering the future of the country, and instead considered the future of their profession, writes Vanessa Houlder. After hours of debate, the General Council of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) voted for a package of reforms which heralds the most thorough overhaul of the institution since it was granted its royal charter in 1881. The case for reform of this inward-looking and bureaucratic organisation was a strong one. 'Today's market, not yesterday's traditions, must dictate the institution's decision making,' said Mr Christopher Jonas, RICS' senior vice-president, proposing the reforms. The main thrust of the reforms is to heighten the awareness of the needs of the surveyors' customers. Half a dozen 'market panels', composed of small groups of experts (rather than committee time-servers) will mull over the needs of different parts of the market. If RICS is to avoid merely adding extra layers of bureaucracy it will have to reduce its swathes of committees and divisional councils. As well as cutting down the bureaucracy, such a measure will save money that can be channelled into the new panels and into a more effective promotion of the profession. The future of the very title 'chartered surveyor' has also been under discussion. Although a cherished and distinctive soubriquet, it means little outside Britain or to the general public. RICS will add the phrase 'the property profession' alongside the title, in place of the existing overlong strapline, 'making land, property and construction work better for people'. However, this may not be welcomed by surveyors working in areas outside the property market, such as minerals. RICS will also start a debate on constitutional reform of the institution. This is a thorny matter: existing divisions are unlikely to want to reduce their power, while RICS' critics are unlikely to feel that the proposals go far enough. Although the institution's leadership has run into opposition on some points, it thinks it has struck a good compromise. 'This is not the counsel of perfection but radical steps in the right direction,' said Mr Jonas The endorsement of the proposed reforms, which could not be taken for granted before yesterday's meeting, was greeted with alacrity by RICS leadership. 'It is a very substantial shift,' according to Mr Michael Pattison, the institution's secretary-general. 'It is a signal that the council is prepared to face up to the changes it has to make.'</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Taipei, April 20 (CNA) -- The International  Economic Cooperation Development Fund will extend more than  U.S.$30 million in Taiwan loans and assistance to Nicaragua,  Costa Rica, South Africa, and Swaziland as part of President Li  Teng-hui's planned visit to the four nations next month, a fund  spokesman said Wednesday [20 April].    Li's tour will take him to Managua, Nicaragua May 4; San  Jose, Costa Rica May 6; Pretoria, South Africa May 8; and  Mbabane, Swaziland May 12. Li, who will attend presidential  inauguration ceremonies in Costa Rica and South Africa, is  scheduled to return to Taipei May 15.    Nicaragua will receive U.S.$1 million in financial support  from the fund for development of its small and medium  businesses, while food processing, wood furniture, shoemaking,  and garment experts will be sent to the country to offer their  expertise, the spokesman said.    The fund will also grant a soft loan of U.S.$15 million to  Costa Rican banks for financing that country's export-oriented  small and medium enterprises, he pointed out, adding that the  loan ceiling for each company is set at U.S.$100,000.    For South Africa, he said, a low-interest loan of U.S.$15  million will be extended to help finance small farms, while  Swaziland will be given assistance with an airport expansion  project and the purchase of new airliners.    Meanwhile, he said, the fund decided to grant a U.S.$20  million soft loan to El Salvador to finance its power  distribution system in line with Premier Lien Chan's expected  visit to that country in early June. Lien's visit has yet to be  officially announced.    The fund, established in 1988 under the Ministry of Economic  Affairs, plays a key role in supplying financial and technical  assistance to developing countries friendly to Taiwan.</p>

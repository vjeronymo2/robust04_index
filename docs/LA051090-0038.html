			<p><P> May 10, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CITY APPROVES ISSUING BONDS TO REINFORCE OLD BUILDINGS  </P> <P> Building owners facing wallet-thinning repair bills to comply with local  earthquake standards got a little help from the city this week.  </P> <P> The City Council approved a proposal to create a special assessment district  under which the city would issue bonds to provide financing for seismic repairs  required under city law.  </P> <P> Property owners in need of money to pay for the earthquake repairs would join  the assessment district and pay both the interest and principal on the bonds,  in much the same way as they would pay off a mortgage.  </P> <P> The council also approved a similar bond issue to help the residents of two  downtown condominium buildings plagued by extensive structural flaws.  </P> <P> With the 1991 deadline for earthquake reinforcement fast approaching, there are  still about 564 buildings in the city that need to be strengthened. The costs  of bringing the pre-1934 structures into compliance with the city's strict  earthquake standards have been a major concern to owners, who will be told to  demolish their buildings if they fail to reinforce them.  </P> <P> More than 100 property owners facing repair costs totaling more than $20  million have indicated their interest in joining an assessment district,  according to city officials, who held two public meetings on the matter last  winter.  </P> <P> "We were hoping people would come up with financing without the city, but that  hasn't really happened very much," remarked Councilman Evan Anderson Braude,  who represents the downtown district where a number of older apartment  buildings need earthquake repairs.  </P> <P> In both bond issues, the city is merely acting as an agent and would not be  responsible for the bond debt. Property owners will have to list their  buildings or condominium units as security on the bonds and make regular  payments. Interest rates are expected to be about the same as those for a  conventional mortgage. The earthquake bond will be repaid over a 20- to 30-year  period, and the condominium bond, expected to be about $1 million, will have a  term of five to 10 years.  </P> <P> The city's earthquake ordinance requires that all non-wooden buildings  constructed before 1934 be reinforced to withstand earthquakes. Structures  built after the destructive, 1933 earthquake in Long Beach are not included  because they had to meet stricter codes than those built earlier.  </P> <P> The Oceangate and Golden Gate condominium complexes in the 700 block of West  4th Street both need shoring as a result of design flaws that left the  buildings structurally unsound. The buildings were approved by city inspectors,  but the structural problems were not discovered until after residents moved in  and started noticing cracks in the walls, and doors that would not close  properly.  </P></p>

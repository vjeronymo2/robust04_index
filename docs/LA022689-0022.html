			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ANGELS AMONG US  </P> <P> With reference to David DeVoss' otherwise flawless piece: "Angels Among Us:  Nine Tireless Southern Californians and Their Quiet Generosity" (Dec. 18/25),  there is only one word that I would question. The word sacrifice, which appears  on the table of contents. I don't think any of these remarkable people consider  that they "sacrifice their time for others." It is apparent that they are doing  what they are doing for the sheer love of it, without expecting anything in  return. These dedicated folks are, in effect, pros in the art of living. Their  faces display smiles, kindness, serenity, a joy of living that so many search  for and never attain. And, in the process, they're having fun.  </P> <P> SHERRY TERZIAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

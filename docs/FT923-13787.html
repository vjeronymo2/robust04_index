			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / UK Company News: C and W talks with US West threaten BT CABLE AND WIRELESS, the telecommunications group, is negotiating to sell a stake in its Mercury Communications subsidiary to US West, the North American telephone company, for several hundred million pounds and a stake in TeleWest, US West's cable television joint venture in the UK. The deal would create a formidable alliance to challenge the dominance of British Telecommunications in the UK. TeleWest, which provides local telephone services would link up with Mercury's long-distance network. Advisers to both groups said the talks, which have been led by Lord Young, chairman of C and W, and Mr Dick Callahan, president of US West International, were likely to be lengthy. The move is part of C and W's strategy to seek partnerships with international telecommunication companies for specific projects following the break down of talks earlier this year with American Telephone &amp; Telegraph to form a global alliance. US West was one of the groups formed following the break up of AT&amp;T in 1984. Although C and W refused to comment on the negotiations yesterday, Lord Young, said recently: 'We are in talks with everyone about the possibility of establishing individual partnerships over individual projects.' TeleWest is a joint venture between US West and TeleCommunications, the US cable television group. It is the largest UK cable operator with 17 franchises serving 2.9m homes. As part of a deal with C and W, TeleWest would buy more cable franchises. US West and C and W have already pooled their interests in personal communications networks, the next generation of mobile communications. Advisers said this deal brought the two groups closer together and paved the way for the current negotiations. The Department of Trade and Industry and Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, are thought to be sympathetic to a deal because it would lead to more vigorous competition for BT. But US West may need to receive permission from the US regulatory authorities to take a stake in Mercury because it holds an international licence.</p>

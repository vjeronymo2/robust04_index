			<p>940602 FT  02 JUN 94 / Power plug change 'would cost UK consumers millions' British consumers face costs of Pounds 78m a year for 40 years if the UK backs a changeover to continental electrical plugs and sockets, according to an independent report commissioned by the Department of Trade and Industry. The report by the Building Services Research and Information Association estimates that a 'big bang' changeover, backed by legislation, would cost consumers: Pounds 56m a year for rewiring. Pounds 7m a year for the replacement of old plugs. Pounds 15m a year in conversion costs passed on to the consumer by industry. An alternative would be a voluntary changeover, which would take longer but be cheaper to the consumer, at an estimated cost of Pounds 19m a year. The DTI has commissioned the report as it is considering whether appliance manufacturers should be required to fit British or continental plugs to products sold in the UK. It makes little sense to fit appliances with British plugs if a changeover to European standards is is to be made soon. But the UK has not yet decided that a changeover would be beneficial. Cenelec, the European standards-making body, was yesterday meeting in Ulster to approve the final draft of the standard for harmonised plugs and sockets across Europe. The standard will then go to national standards councils for their approval. In assessing the overall benefits of a changeover, the Building Services Research and Information Association concludes that the Cenelec system would eventually lower the cost of plugs, but the consumer unit - the distribution box where the mains electricity enters the home - would be more expensive. British homes are wired in rings, with the numerous sockets on each ring made safe through a fuse in every three-pin plug. However, the European system is a radial system. Each socket is connected directly to the consumer unit by its own lead, removing the need for fuses in the two-point plugs, but also preventing the fitting of different fuses to suit each appliance. To convert to the continental system, every house would need to be rewired. After the transition appliance manufacturers would need to fit only one type of plug to supply markets throughout Europe. However, building contractors would incur higher costs for the installation of the continental type of consumer units. The makers of plugs, sockets and leads for the British market - which currently benefit from what is in effect a protected market - would also face much greater competition.</p>

			<p>920629 FT  29 JUN 92 / Arts: The death of an original mind - Architecture The sudden death of the British architect Sir James Stirling last week is both a real shock and a serious loss to late 20-century architecture. He was unquestionably the most interestingly individual architect in Britain and his talent had been recognised by a knighthood just twelve days before his death. In the obituary notice last Friday in the Financial Times, the day after his death, the facts of his career and some of the reasons for his international importance were spelt out. It seems appropriate in this column today to pay a personal tribute to his talent as an architect. There is no doubt that Stirling was by far the most original and influential architect of his generation and it was this very originality that made his work controversial. He took enormous risks, sometimes risks that endangered the very buildings he was creating. I recall the way he worked in his old office in Gloucester Place, London. There was never any doubt that he was the fount of original ideas and needed a good staff to understand, interpret and build them. He had brilliant partners. James Gowan at the beginning, in the 1950's, enabled him to combine engineering and architecture in a unique way. Later Leon Krier had a great influence enhancing his new-classical thinking. Michael Wilford has persistently supported him and will now carry the burden of the practice. But the originality was Stirling's and that cannot be replaced. James Stirling thought about architecture as an artist and he was one of those rare people who think in three dimensions. At the Royal Academy exhibition devoted to the work of Norman Foster, Richard Rogers and Stirling in 1986 the public had the opportunity to see his remarkable axonometric drawings, which both explained how the buildings were conceived and how they would look. I remember introducing Stirling at his Royal Institute of British Architects lecture, when he explained his enthusiasm for the marine engineering drawings produced by his father. There was definitely a fusion between his understanding of engineering and his love of form that brought an unusual plasticity to his architecture. He also saw, as sculptors like Anthony Caro saw, that the materials of engineering have in themselves a sense of art. Stirling was an artist. He saw the world as an artist and possessed that vital ability to refuse to compromise, which can mark genius. As an artist/architect he fed his sensibilities widely. His house in Hampstead demonstrated how much he was a man of taste and sensibility - and how well he was supported in this by his wife, Mary, a furniture designer and daughter of the writer P. Morton-Shand. There are very few contemporary architects with the originality to collect from the past and not just to acquire fashionable works of art from their friends. The Stirlings gave substantial dinners on a dining table laden with neo-classical plate and silver. He would show you with pride a chair he had acquired by Pugin or Thomas Hope - his taste, like his later architecture, was inclusive and catholic; in private he was surprisingly undogmatic. His architecture is strong meat. The Leicester University Engineering Building (1959-63) that he designed with James Gowan is an essay in geometry and engineering that appears to test both structural and visual credibility. In its red brick and steel it is aggressive and powerful. But it is as nothing to the later buildings of this genre which Stirling designed alone - the History Faculty Library for the University of Cambridge and the later Florey Building for The Queen's College Oxford. There have been strong reactions to these buildings because they seem to have a capacity to auto-destruct. Indeed the Cambridge building, which has one of the most exhilarating interiors in that city, has been technically so unsatisfactory that the University has considered demolishing it. Stirling moved on from engineering architecture to the more sober combination of a new sort of neo-classicism combined with references to the immediate past of the Modern Movement. Much influenced by the teachings of his mentor Colin Rowe (of Liverpool and Cornell universities), Stirling was the only contemporary architect to understand the idea of 'architectural collage'. Rowe is an important critic of modern architecture and Stirling was very much in sympathy with his idea that modernism itself is a part of history. A glance at the State Art Gallery in Stuttgart - which in my view is one of the most interesting post war buildings in Europe - shows a completely original architectural mind at work. It is no secret that Stirling wanted very badly to win the competition to design the Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery, the Getty Museum in California and the new Glyndebourne Opera House in Sussex. In all these important international competitions Stirling came a close second. His schemes are all powerful, and in the case of the National Gallery he seems to have demonstrated the gift of carving space out of unpromising solids. He did succeed where others had failed in winning a planning permission for the development of No. 1 Poultry in the heart of a conservation area in the City of London. His scheme has still not been built its future is probably now uncertain. The loss of 'Big Jim' long before his time is extremely sad. He was a good friend and a fierce opponent - rightly fighting for architectural integrity. He was really one of the only architects in the world prepared to chance everything on a design. Not all his designs came off, but all were full of ideas. He nourished the profession world wide - and it is hard to believe that the big heart under the blue shirt is now suddenly stilled for ever.</p>

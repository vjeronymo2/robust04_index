			<p><P> June 22, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> A woman who underwent back surgery on live TV in Philadelphia earlier this week  says she agreed to do it in hopes of helping others who may need the operation.  "I don't feel invaded at all," says Deborah Arizin, 27, a sales representative  from Haddonfield, N.J., who had suffered from back pain for more than half her  life. The 2 1/2-hour operation to help correct a 50-degree curvature of Mrs.  Arizin's spine took place on public television station WHYY. Station executives  said the operation, broadcast live "for its impact and educational value,"  brought at least 330 calls from viewers who mostly found it "absolutely  breathtaking" and "magnificent," though a few called it gory.

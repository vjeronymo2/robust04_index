			<p><P> May 25, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Idled Acres Go Back to Work: Farmers are putting millions of idled crop acres  back to work this year, according to sign-up figures for 1989 commodity  programs announced by the Agriculture Department. Under this year's programs,  farmers will idle 29.2 million acres, little more than half of the 54.2 million  acres contracted to be taken from crop production under the 1988 programs,  officials said. Despite the decline from last year, the prospective 1989 idled  acreage would represent an area larger than the state of Pennsylvania.  </P></p>

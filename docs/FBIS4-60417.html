			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with David Brodet, director of the Finance </F> Ministry's Budget Department, by Sever Plotzker at the Finance  Ministry in Tel Aviv on 3 May]    [Text] [Plotzker] What are we leaving the Palestinians in  the Gaza Strip and Jericho? How much money is left in the till?    [Brodet] We are not petty. When Israel withdraws from the  Gaza Strip there will be tens of millions of shekels in the  Civil Administration coffers; all of the planned budget for May.  This money will be turned over to the Palestinians and will  suffice to finance the daily activities of the Palestinian  authority in the Gaza Strip and Jericho for two or three weeks.  After that, they are in charge.    [Plotzker] Will they manage?    [Brodet] They have no choice and they have no money. This  is a great organizational and managerial incentive. There will  also be debts to pay immediately. Water, electricity.    As a goodwill gesture, we are leaving them the Civil  Administration's computer network and a package of diskettes  with detailed budget software programs free of charge. As soon  as they load the software, they will know who to pay, when, and  how much. They will be able to make use of an efficient tax  collection system, the same system used by the Civil  Administration and its Palestinian employees. They wanted  overlapping and that is what they will get.    We are handing over to them an effective and well-equipped  administration machine with enough gas to reach the next gas  station. Money, however, is something that they will have to  raise by themselves, and immediately.    [Plotzker] The World Bank announced today that it would give  them $1.2 billion. That sets them up pretty well, does it not?    [Brodet] Far from it. The World Bank, as the representative  of the countries contributing to the Palestinian entity, has  solicited commitments of $1.2 billion in aid for the Palestinian  self-governing authority. This sum will be spread out over  three years, which means about $400 million annually. The  Palestinians will get a bit more in the first year but right now  there is no point in talking about billions.    [Plotzker] Did you discuss this issue in your talks? Do the  Palestinians realize their needs?    [Brodet] Certainly. They lose sleep over this. When we  started the economic negotiations in November 1993, they stated  that they had no intention of collecting taxes from the  Palestinian population. Yasir 'Arafat sent Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad  Quray'], the head of the Palestinian economic delegation, his  grandiose plan for a tax paradise in the Gaza Strip and Jericho.  When the PLO came in there, it would make everyone happy and  cancel most taxes. Everything would be dirt cheap. When we  asked them how they intended to finance their budget they  replied that the donor countries would pay for it. In those  days, incidentally, the Palestinian delegation did not always  have enough money to pay for their phone calls.    [Plotzker] In the end, however, the economic agreement  signed with the PLO stipulates that the taxes in the territories  will be the same as those in Israel.    [Brodet] There was only one problem with the wonderful plan  for a tax paradise in the Gaza Strip and Jericho: its  implementation. The Western countries which promised money and  aid to the Palestinians took one look at the plan and  categorically rejected it. The Palestinians were very clearly  told that they would not get a red cent to just squander away.  Before giving the Palestinians any money, the Western countries  first demanded to know how much money the Palestinian authority  planned to collect in taxes from its constituents, which  projects it intended to spend the money on, who would oversee  expenditures, and who would submit the reports. Incidentally,  part of the money was given as bridging loans.    [Plotzker] Did the World Bank's tough approach have any  impact on the negotiations?    [Brodet] It had an immediate effect. We saw the  Palestinians' faces sink. At the end of February this year,  after three months of negotiations, they began to thoroughly  study the Israeli tax system. Several seminars were held for  them, and the Palestinians admitted they would have no choice  but to impose heavy taxes. The Israeli customs rate did not  seem excessively high any more, perhaps even too low. A value  added tax of 15 to 16 percent struck them as necessary. That is  how things are when you begin to stand on your own two feet.    [Plotzker] How big a budget will the Palestinian national  authority have?    [Brodet] In our assessment, the anticipated expenditures  during the first year will reach approximately one billion  shekels.    [Plotzker] What does that include?    [Brodet] Their budget will include one major item that the  Israeli Civilian Administration did not have to take into  account: the cost of establishing, equipping, and operating the  Palestinian police force. This will cost at least 450 million  shekels in the first year. The establishment and operation of  the autonomy institutions will cost at least 100 million  shekels. They will employ many new civil servants and have to  pay the salaries of officials from Tunis who have become  accustomed to living conditions there. They also told us that  they would have to expand administrative and social welfare  services for the local population.    [Plotzker] Will they have a budget deficit?    [Brodet] They will have a large deficit of 400 to 500  million shekels.    [Plotzker] Will they print money to cover it?    [Brodet] Fortunately for them, they are not permitted to  print their own money. The shekel will continue to be the  accepted currency in the territories.    The Palestinians assume that external aid will cover the  cost  of financing the police and the self-governing institutions for  the first six months. They believe that they will thus be able  to balance the budget and continue functioning. Maybe they will  be able to sell Gaza Municipality bonds.    [Plotzker] Did the Palestinians raise the issue of what they  call "compensation for the occupation." After all, they claim  that Israel appropriated billions of dollars in taxes from the  residents of the territories as well as national insurance  payments from Palestinian workers in Israel.    [Brodet] Now that the agreement is signed I can tell you  about this. This issue was mentioned at the first dinner  between Abu-al- 'Ala' and Finance Minister Avraham Shohat. We  decided to study the matter thoroughly and collected all the  relevant data starting from 1970, when the first group of  Palestinian workers were allowed into Israel. We compared the  income we received with the Military Government's and Civil  Administration's expenditures on behalf of the residents.    [Plotzker] What was the bottom line?    [Brodet] Between 1970 and 1994, the Israeli Government  collected approximately 2.5 to 3 billion shekels at today's  rates from the Palestinians, including VAT and income taxes in  the territories and income taxes and national insurance payments  from the workers who were employed in Israel. One must remember  that Israel only started collecting taxes from the residents of  the territories in a serious way in the 1980's. At the same  time, Israel transferred 7.5 billion shekels to finance civilian  budgets in the territories and awarded Palestinian workers  another 2.8 billion shekels worth of special tax credits. The  bottom line is that we gave the Palestinians a net sum of about  7 billion shekels. We presented this account to the Palestinian  representatives in Paris.    [Plotzker] So, are they going to return the money?    [Brodet] We presented the bill to underscore the fact that  the past must be forgotten. There must be no more settling of  accounts between Palestinians and Israelis.    [Plotzker] You sat down with senior PLO officials for  hundreds of hours, for whole days and nights, whereas just a  short while ago we were bitter enemies. How did that fact  influence the course of the talks?    [Brodet] If in the beginning there was a feeling of enmity  on the national level, it disappeared. We really became  friends. We celebrated birthdays and laughed together. We  passed each other phone calls. During Ramadan we were careful  not to offend their religious sensitivities. We ate kosher food  all the time. The Israeli Embassy in Paris took care of that.  Most of the time, the French paid and occasionally we did.  Sometimes the Palestinians invited everyone to a Lebanese  restaurant.    [Plotzker] When the talks began, you presented the  Palestinians a conception of an almost total economic union  between the Palestinian and Israeli economies. You proposed  that the PLO opt for an Israeli-oriented economy as opposed to a  Jordanian one. When did they become convinced that this was the  right choice?    [Brodet] In our assessment, they were already convinced of  this upon arrival. Their delegation included excellent  economists and professionals with doctorates from Western  universities, people with an international background who knew  very well that the Palestinian economy had no chance of growing  and developing without establishing tight links with Israel.  The Jordanian option, from the economic point of view, was very  unattractive to the Palestinians. The problem was with the  Jordanian pressure and the hesitancy of the political leadership  in Tunis, which obviously did not want to burn its bridges with  Jordan.    [Plotzker] Would you describe the negotiations as being  strewn with crises?    [Brodet] No. I remember two fundamental crises, both  political in nature, and many mini-crises which were resolved  without leaving any traces. I am not complaining about this.  The agreement we wanted to achieve was very complicated and  sets many precedents. Neither party had anything to base  themselves on. The PLO came to the talks out of a weaker  position. It is an organization that never dealt with building  an economy or planning a national economic policy. We dragged  suitcases full of position papers.    [Plotzker] What was the most serious crisis?    [Brodet] Contrary to the media reports in Israel, the most  serious crises did not pertain to the nature of relations  between the Palestinian and Israeli economies but rather to the  relations between the Palestinian economy, Jordan, and the Arab  countries.    The most difficult crisis occurred on the eve of the Hebron  massacre [25 February 1994], after the PLO delegation in Amman  signed a declaration of economic principles with Jordan.  Abu-al- 'Ala' proposed that the Palestinians be allowed to open  up the eastern border and establish a free trade zone with  Jordan as well as Israel. We could not accept such a proposal  because it would expose the Israeli economy to unrestricted  imports from all the Arab and Islamic countries, with no  reciprocity and no negotiations. Prior to all this, the  Palestinians were already angry at us for signing a banking  agreement with Jordan. One could sense an impending explosion  in the air. A marathon discussion, lasting almost a whole day,  between Abu-al-'Ala' and Shohat got the talks back on track.    Shohat was at his best during the last months of the  negotiations. He solved problems and radiated understanding.  Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala got along well. They loved each other's  jokes.    [Plotzker] Was there also a last-minute crisis of the kind  the PLO loves so much?    [Brodet] Shohat and Abu-al-'Ala' completed most of the  agreement before the talks were halted in the wake of the Hebron  massacre. All kinds of crises can pop up, however, even at the  last minute. They told us: after we sign an agreement on open  economic relations, on a bona fide economic union with Israel,  we cannot seal off the Palestinian self-government to goods from  the Arab world and Islamic countries. That would be simply  inconceivable. We could understand the political constraints  here, and agreed to prepare a detailed, precise list of goods  the autonomy could import from Egypt, Jordan, and other Islamic  countries with our approval.    For example, we authorized the import of several thousand  Jordanian-made television sets. Will that bother anyone in  Israel? Of course not. Israel imports 120,000 television sets a  year from all over the world. But this will enable the  Palestinians to tell the Arab world that they have not sold  themselves out to the Israelis.    [Plotzker] The Palestinians committed themselves in writing  to establish a national insurance institute, monetary authority,  and national insurance company, as well as other things. We  promised that when we collect custom levies and taxes for them,  we will transfer the money to these new institutions. Whom will  we send the money to if these institutions are not established?    [Brodet] When a product destined for Gaza reaches the Ashdod  port, Israeli customs inspectors will assess its value and exact  a customs tariff. The money will be deposited in an account set  up by the Palestinian authority. We will transfer the income  tax and national insurance we collect from Palestinian workers  in Israel in the same way.    During the first year, we will transfer approximately 150  million to the Palestinian authority in this way. We will not  stand around with a stopwatch in our hand henpecking the  Palestinians to establish their own stock market and pension  funds. As far as they are concerned the important thing is  organizing a budget, collecting taxes (they can collect about  300 million shekels in the Gaza Strip and Jericho in the first  year), and satisfy the demands of the countries donating funds  within the framework of the World Bank so that they will indeed  send the money.    [Plotzker] Which sectors of the Israeli economy will be  detrimentally affected by the agreement with the PLO?    [Brodet] We attempted to calculate the effects of the  agreement on each individual branch and sub-branch of the  economy. Except for certain farmers who grow three kinds of  vegetables, no one else will be affected at all, and with time  will even begin to make a profit.    [Plotzker] Will Israel's economy remain unharmed even when  the Palestinian economy takes off?    [Brodet] On the contrary. That is when we will really start  to enjoy things. What do we export to the Gaza Strip today?  Approximately $200 million worth of goods. I can see no foreign  element capable of replacing Israel's economic and commercial  presence there. Our produce is in very high demand in the  territories. It enjoys a good reputation for quality. Our  ports, in Haifa and Ashdod, will continue to serve Palestinian  importers, especially in the renovation, construction, and  development projects that will be implemented by the Palestinian  self-government.    [Plotzker] Have we guaranteed our participation in these  development and renovation projects?    [Brodet] The government cannot act in lieu of joint business  projects. The projects will start when the mutual feelings of  suspicion and fear have dissipated. We adamantly insisted on  one thing: The Cairo agreements clearly prohibit any  discrimination against Israeli entrepreneurs, companies, or the  State of Israel in general. We will be allowed to bid for any  tender.    [Plotzker] How much compensation has the Treasury allocated  for the expected damages to agriculture?    [Brodet] The Treasury will try to be understanding toward  the vegetable growers harmed by the agreement; however, we are  not talking about large sums. We are not even thinking along  the lines of compensation, we are thinking about growth.    [Plotzker] What do you mean?    [Brodet] Our model for the Palestinian economy foresees a  dramatic shift toward a 20-percent real growth rate beginning in  1995. The Palestinian economy's gross national product may grow  by 100 percent within three years. At the same time, we expect  a six to seven percent growth rate in the Israeli economy.    [Plotzker] At the same time? Will one not come at the  expense of the other?    [Brodet] No, both will come together. We will have  complementary economies.</p>

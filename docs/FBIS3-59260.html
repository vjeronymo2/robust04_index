			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Gao Shusheng (7559 2579 3932): "The Tax Sharing </F> System Is Spreading Like Wildfire"]    [Text] As fiscal system reform is playing a very key role  in China's reform process, the significant new fiscal reform  measures that are going into effect are arousing widespread  attention in all circles. As fiscal macroeconomic regulation  and control capability is being tightened, particularly over  central finances, the tax sharing system reforms that "seem  ready to happen" have naturally become the focus of attention of  people in all walks of life.  <H5>  "Down With the Package" Has Become a Militant Slogan </H5>   Is China now capable of carrying out tax sharing system  reform? Theoretical circles have not yet reached a consensus on  this. One of the focuses of the debate is how to assess the  fiscal package system. Academics who strongly oppose the tax  sharing system fully affirm the merits of the fiscal package  system, holding that it helps to stimulate local fiscal  initiative, while those who favor implementing tax sharing as  quickly as possible strongly attack the current fiscal package  system, on which grounds they promote tax sharing system reform.  These latter hold that while the fiscal package system has pros,  such as package figures being simple, clear, and easy for all to  grasp, its many existing practical defects fully prove that it  has completed its hstorical mission.    Scholars who favor tax sharing system reform list the  following major defects of the fiscal package system:    1. Fiscal package bases are set irrationally, protecting  vested interests, creating "injustice and taking more from the  best," and further widening the interregional economic and  social development gap.    2. The local revenue package weakens tax regulation  capability, reinforces "regionalism" and "feudal separatism,"  and blocks commodity circulation and the formation of a uniform  market.    3. The fiscal package slants revenues toward localities,  leaving state revenues, particularly central ones, without  strict guarantee and oversight mechanisms, and creating a severe  loss of central revenue.    4. The fiscal package contributes neither to the thorough  conversion of government functions or to genuinely pushing  enterprises toward the market, while causing local governments  to guide the disposition of resources unilaterally in the  interests of increasing local revenues, which leads to duplicate  production, construction, and importing, as well as to wars over  all types of raw materials and to the assimilation of local  industrial structures.    5. The fiscal "separate kitchens" results in localities  haggling with the center over the setting of sharing percentages  and contract bases, as well as causing lateral competition.  This makes central fiscal actions nonstandard, with arbitrary  borrowing from localities and income equalitarianism, while  localities take many fiscal accomodation steps to intercept and  keep revenue that should be paid to the center. This ultimately  limits the rational growth of state revenue and fiscal  macroeconomic regulation and control capability.  <H5>  There Is Still a Lingering Fear of "Tax Sharing" </H5>   Just as more and more people are shouting the praises of the  tax sharing system, theorists are singing "another tune," even  though it may be a very "faint" one. The current theoretical  stands against the tax sharing system can be summed up in the  following three key areas:    1. As the tax sharing system's point of departure and  grounds conflict with our overall reform objectives, the tax  sharing system should be firmly opposed. The scholars who favor  this view hold that the tax sharing system is focused on  increasing the [central] revenue percentage, by concentrating  central financial might, the grounds for which are that the  above base sharing part paid to the center in the fiscal package  is too small. But they say that promoting tax sharing on this  grounds ignores a fundamental issue, i.e., that increasing local  fiscal might was aimed at stimulating the fiscal initiative of  local authorities, with fiscal authority being devolved along  with administrative authority, meaning that a lower central  revenue percentage was inevitable. So tax sharing would be  bound to weaken the impact of local profit forces, causing a  tightening that would be adverse to stimulating central and  local initiative simultaneously, as well as to sharp economic  growth, and ultimately to increasing central revenues.    2. China is not yet fully equipped with the conditions for  tax sharing. The academics who favor this view point out that  standardized tax sharing requires: 1) a clear division of  central and local administrative authority; 2) a break with the  order of revenue division based on enterprise subordinate  relations; 3) a scientific revenue and expenditure base factor  appraisal law; 4) a relatively perfect local tax system; 5)  separate central and local tax management and collection. But  China is not yet fully equipped with these conditions. For  instance, current local taxation still involves many places  unsuited to tax sharing. This can be seen mainly in that local  taxes are more nominal than real, with the local tax revenue  percentage too small to meet local spending needs and unable to  increase along with local economic growth, and collection and  management in chaos. So as the terms for tax sharing do not yet  fully exist, rather than expanding the tax sharing experiment in  scope, it would be better to begin by studying and drawing up a  scientific methodology based on a factor appraisal of revenue  and expenditure bases, in order to make good preparations for  standardized tax sharing system reform.    3. The aim of fiscal reform should be not "tax separation,"  but rather "system separation," i.e., the establishment of a  graded budget system. This is because tax sharing actually  solves only the revenue division matter, not the system problem.  The graded budget system put forth by the scholars who hold  this view includes the following key substance: Drawing up  separate central and local tax revenue systems; giving  governments at all levels corresponding spending independence;  setting up a standardized system for the shift of payments from  the center to localities; establishing separate central and  local budgets for independent balance; and providing local  governments with the authority to issue local government bonds  to increase their capital account revenue.  <H5>  Tax Sharing: The Trend of the Times </H5>   With State Council approval, the Ministry of Finance began  in  June 1992 to conduct tax sharing experiments in nine provinces,  autonomous regions, and municipalities authorized to formulate  their own plans independently, striving to divide central and  local revenue sources through tax categories, in order to  standardize and rationalize central and local financial  distribution relations. These tax sharing experiments have  shown the following features:    1. They have expanded local fixed revenue limits and better  stimulated local revenue organization initiative, helping to  reinforce tax collection management, stop up system loopholes,  prevent revenue erosion, ensure basic central government  spending needs, and tighten central macroeconomic regulation and  control.    2. The tax sharing system turns flow taxes from most being  retained by local governments to a central local "50-50"  sharing, adjusting central-local distribution relations,  eliminating to a degree tendencies, such as unchecked local  development of high tax rate products and unchecked striving for  output value and speed, and helping to promote the state's  industrial structure and the formation of a uniform market,  eliminate financial distribution arbitrariness, adjust  interregional financial distribution, and appropriately shrink  the interregional economic and social development gap.    3. Tax sharing can play a promotional and driving role in  the  reform and opening of our whole economy. On one hand, all  areas will pay attention to managing the flow taxes shared by  the the center and localities. On the other hand, once all  state-owned, collective, and "the three kinds of foreign trade"  enterprise income taxes become local fixed revenue, this will  spur local governments to pay attention to enterprise economic  efficiency, providing more effective guidance and oversight of  enterprise operations.    Based on these tax sharing experiments, the state has  decided  to practice the tax sharing system on a wider scale beginning in  1994. So theorists have made the following suggestions on ways  to implement tax sharing in practice:    1. At present, due to a number of limiting factors, it will  be impossible to accomplish the tax sharing system all in one  move. Overall reform steps could proceed in the order of "the  current package -- a tax sharing package -- a tax sharing system  in which shared taxes dominate -- a thorough tax sharing  system." Meanwhile, based on conditions in various areas, we  could break down and apply varying methods for a tax sharing  system.    2. Tax sharing reform must be accompanied by reforms in  other  areas, most crucially: a) We need to clearly divide  governmental administrative and fiscal authority, particularly  construction investment authority, with central revenue  undertaking mostly key national and transregional project  construction, and local revenues being responsible for building  regional projects. b) We need to reform our tax system, by  establishing one conforming to market economy needs, as well as  a sound local tax system. c) We need to reform systems, such as  planning, pricing, investment, circulation, and social security.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At a time when the process of creating a dialogue  framework for the security of the Asia Pacific region is in  progress, it is learned that Australia has informally sounded  out Japan about military exchanges with a proposal to have  officers of the Self-Defense Forces study at Australia's  military academy. In the Asia Pacific region, ASEAN members have  been making brisk moves toward creating a regional security  system following the end of the Cold War, and Australia's bid  for exchanges with Japan in the defense area is interpreted as  an indication that nations in the region are showing great  interest in Japan not only in the economic area, but in the  security area.    Australia has begun reviewing its post-Cold War security  strategy. It has recently compiled a basic defense plan,  analyzing that, "although U.S. influence on the security of the  Asia Pacific region has waned, the military presence of China,  Japan, and India in the region has grown." Australia is believed  to have sounded out Japan about military exchanges between the  two countries with the aim of making it clear that it also  places importance on Asian nations in the security area.    Japan has responded to Australia's proposal by simply  saying,  "We will study" out of consideration for our position of  attaching importance to relations with the United States. Japan,  however, plans to make a final decision on the Australian  proposal after analyzing the situation in the Asia Pacific  region.    The Asia Pacific region has yet to build its own collective  security system because of its ethnic and cultural diversity.  With regard to multilateral dialogue for the regional security,  the "ASEAN region forum" is set to hold its first session this  year and it will be attended by ASEAN member nations' foreign  ministerial conference, Japan, the United States, China, and  Russia.</p>

			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / International Company News: US cable TV industry hit by FCC price move SHARES in the leading US cable television companies fell sharply yesterday when the Federal Communications Commission, the government agency which oversees the industry, took action which will lead to widespread cuts in the price of cable services. The FCC move stems from cable industry legislation, passed by Congress last year, which imposes rate regulation for the first time in six years and requires the commission to draft pricing guidelines, which would then be implemented by local governments. The commission yesterday set a price benchmark some 10 per cent below the average price charged by the cable companies before congress passed the regulation bill. Because many companies increased rates following passage of the bill, the total cut could be as much as 15 per cent for some consumers. Shares in cable companies fell by 5 per cent to 10 per cent following the announcement. Tele-Communications, the industry leader, fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 20 1/2 , Cablevision dipped 2 3/8 to Dollars 36 1/4 , Time-Warner dropped Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 33 and Comcast closed at Dollars 20 7/8 , down Dollars 2 1/2 . Sprint, the US long-distance telecommunications group, said yesterday that it expected to record after-tax charges against first-quarter earnings of Dollars 550m-Dollars 575m, mainly because of accounting changes and costs associated with its takeover of Centel, the Chicago-based local telecommunications group, writes Martin Dickson. The company said that it expected to lose 15,000 jobs after the takeover, up from about 1,000 when the deal was announced last year. Sprint said the merger was expected to produce minimum savings of Dollars 145m annually on a pre-tax basis within two years. Anheuser-Busch, the largest beer manufacturer in the US, yesterday announced a marketing and distribution agreement with Birra Peroni Industriale, the leading Italian brewer, writes Nikki Tait. The agreement is designed to push Anheuser's Budweiser brand in the Italian market. Under the arrangement, Birra Peroni will be responsible for distribution, while the US company will be primarily responsible for marketing.</p>

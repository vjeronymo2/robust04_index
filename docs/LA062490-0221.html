			<p><P> June 24, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> CRITICS' PICKS: JACKNIFE  </P> <P> Better scaled to TV than to the big screen, this admirable, affecting 1989  release illuminates the lingering effects of the Vietnam War on its veterans.  Robert De Niro (above left) stars as an uninhibited, exuberant man who  seemingly comes out of nowhere to disrupt the ordered lives of his Vietnam  buddy (Ed Harris, right)) and his sister (Kathy Baker). Extraordinary  performances all around.  </P> <P> Cinemax Thursday at 5 a.m. KEVIN THOMAS  </P></p>

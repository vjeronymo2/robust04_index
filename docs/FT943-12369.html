			<p>940726 FT  26 JUL 94 / World Trade News: Taiwan to open building sector to foreign companies Taiwan will open its construction industry to foreign companies as part of its efforts to further its application to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In recent meetings, the US, Japan and other countries have made support for Tai-wan's Gatt entry conditional on improved market access in government procurement and big infrastructure contracts, among other measures. The announcement on the contracting sector follows reports that US negotiators were largely satisfied with Taiwan's plans to liberalise services and government procurement as outlined during trade talks in Washington last week. More talks on Taiwan's Gatt membership terms are scheduled for next month. Taipei representatives of foreign construction companies were cautiously optimistic about the measures, which are to take effect by the end of this year subject to cabinet approval. 'It's a good step forward,' said an official at a European company involved in building Taipei's mass transit system. 'This means that foreign companies will be able to establish themselves properly here. But we will be watching closely to see whether the legislation is implemented in a transparent manner.' Under the draft, foreign construction companies with at least NTDollars 400m (USDollars 15m) in capital and NTDollars 4bn in total revenues over the last five years will qualify to set up an office in order to bid for big projects. The capital requirement for foreign companies is four times that for local ones. 'Opening the industry to foreigners already will give local companies a hard time. The aim is to slightly protect local companies,' said an official with the construction and planning administration. In 1990, Taiwan announced an ambitious long-range infrastructure development plan with projected spending of USDollars 300bn. Last year the plan was scaled back to USDollars 200bn, but most projects are well behind schedule and many are likely to be quietly jettisoned. Nonetheless, Taiwan has a substantial number of large-scale projects in the pipeline and foreign companies are vying for contracts. Especially keen are Japanese and Korean companies, which Taiwan has excluded from many government contracts in an effort to curry diplomatic favour with European and North American governments.</p>

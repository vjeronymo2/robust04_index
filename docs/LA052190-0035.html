			<p><P> May 21, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: PEOPLE WATCH  </P> <P> Stupid Legislature Trick: The Texas Legislature is trying to lure David  Letterman to Austin.  </P> <P> The House of Representatives borrowed Letterman's Top 10 list gimmick, and came  up with a resolution that listed the reasons why Letterman should do a show in  Austin. Reason No. 4: The Texas National Guard has agreed to keep Cher and  Shirley MacLaine outside the city limits during Mr. Letterman's stay, using  excessive force if necessary." The No. 1 reason: Texans will officially address  Letterman as "The Great White Enchilada From Somewhere South of Poughkeepsie"  during his stay. GREG BRAXTON  </P></p>

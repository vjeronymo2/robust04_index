			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Food &amp; Drink: Ready roses - Appetisers Some roses for immediate drinking (I have yet to encounter a rose which improves with age): Cotes du Luberon Rose 1993, Pounds 3.29 Safeway only, is a Hugh Ryman creation, and very successful too, with attractive Grenache fruitiness, appetising weight and a really dry finish. Bordeaux Rose 1993 Francois de Lorgeac, Pounds 3.49 Waitrose, has attractive bite, and is just off-dry. It would make a perfectly respectable lunch wine. A chance to savour Rajasthani cuisine at The Red Fort, in Dean Street, London, until October 23. Dishes include safed maas, lamb marinated in yoghurt and cooked with almonds, coconut and chillies to a white finish, and dal batti churma, a meal of mixed lentils, hard bread soaked in clarified butter and sweet, whole wheat marbles. A typical three-course meal will cost around Pounds 25, excluding drinks. Tel: 071-437 2115 or 2525. Fax: 071-434 0721. As is so often the case, for entirely unmerited reasons, the most memorable bottle drunk during a recent visit to Champagne was a still red, a 1987 Mondavi Reserve Pinot Noir from a champagne maker's personal cellar. Waitrose sells the regular Robert Mondavi Pinot Noir 1991 for Pounds 8.95. It should age every bit as well, although can now offer essence of true Pinot fruit - and is earthier, somehow more ambitiously 'Burgundian' than the Faiveley Mercurey La Framboisiere 1992 at Pounds 7.95 which is super-fruity, not to say super-raspberry-like. But since it is Faiveley, which is suing the American wine critic Robert Parker for his comments on their winemaking practices, I would like to make it clear that I very much enjoyed this splendid wine. Well worth a visit if you are in south-west London, is Sonny's at 92 Church Road, Barnes. The shop - more like a French traiteur than an English deli - and adjacent cafe are open Monday to Saturday, 10am to 6pm. Dishes such as chicken and choroso gumbo, char-grilled vegetables, and bread and butter pudding are on sale. Rebecca Mascarenhas stocks the best of everything that is homemade. It makes a handy one-stop-shop for a dinner party. If you are pressed for time, Mascarenhas will plan a menu for you over the 'phone and then taxi it to your home (and send a chef and waiter too, should you need them). Tel: 081-741 8451.</p>

			<p><P> August 8, 1990, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> VOTE SET ON BUILDING LEASE  </P> <P> A measure on the Nov. 6 ballot will ask San Fernando voters if they want to  lease the city's old police station to either public or private organizations  at fair market value.  </P> <P> The City Council on Monday night approved placing a measure on the ballot  asking voters what they want to do with the old building at 120 MacNeil St. The  San Fernando Police Department moved to a new station at 910 1st St. in 1988.  </P> <P> Under a voter initiative approved in 1986, the City Council is prevented from  selling, leasing or exchanging the police station property without voters'  approval.  </P> <P> The initiative, spearheaded by then-Councilwoman Carmillis Noltemeyer, was  aimed at thwarting a plan by the City Council to demolish the building, leaving  the 31,000-square-foot Civic Center land open for development. Noltemeyer has  since moved out of the community.  </P> <P> In other business, the council unanimously appointed Les Barnett as acting  director of the city's Parks and Recreation Department while a search is  conducted to replace Dave Watt, the former director who retired last month.  </P></p>

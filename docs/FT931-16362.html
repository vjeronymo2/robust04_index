			<p>930107 FT  07 JAN 93 / All things in moderation: Economic pressures are prompting Iran to mend fences with the industrialised world Alongside the toll booths at the end of the three-lane highway from Tehran to Qom, Iran's main centre for theological instruction, stands a huge hoarding proclaiming in English, 'Israel must be destroyed'. The meaning appears clear, but like so much else in Iran today it is now said to be capable of a different interpretation. According to Mr Javad Larijani, educated in Iraq and California, a member of parliament and special adviser on foreign relations to President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani, the one thing it does not mean is that Israel should be literally removed from the map. All it means, he says, is that the 'racist and religious ideas' that lie behind the state of Israel, just like those of apartheid which characterised the regime in South Africa, should be destroyed. Mr Larijani is regarded in Tehran as a prime example of the new breed of younger politicians promoted by Mr Rafsanjani to foster a more pragmatic Iranian view of the world. After more than a decade of revolution, war and being painted as the maverick of international politics, Iran is in the midst of a complex political adjustment. While remaining true to its Islamic principles, it is trying to win the confidence of the industrialised world to gain access to the technology and capital required for the reconstruction and modernisation of the economy. Much of the most visible fire has gone from the revolution that overthrew Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1979. One foreign diplomat described the country as in a state of national amnesia. Few people wish to recall the bitter struggle for power between the clergy and their former allies, the extreme left-wing Mujahadeen-e-Khalq, and the shocking toll of the eight-year war with Iraq which, when it ended in 1988, had cost more than 1m lives. Measured in terms of active domestic political opponents, the regime has never appeared so secure. Violent political challenges are still possible, but the durability of Iran's clerics is rapidly being tested in more sophisticated and demanding ways. Mr Rafsanjani and Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei, the country's spiritual leader and successor to Ayatollah Khomeini, have yet to prove that the world's only Islamic republican government can match the material aspirations of about 60m people, that it can administer the machinery of state, and ultimately that it can surmount the divisions within the administration which threaten the modernisation process. How the regime responds to these challenges will have an importance stretching well beyond Iran. Its successes and failures will provide ammunition for other struggles being mounted by fundamentalist groups trying to overthrow existing governments. Regimes in the Middle East, such as Algeria and to a lesser extent Egypt, accuse Iran of aiding Islamic dissidents. In the newly created central Asian republics, Iranian envoys have been building political and economic ties. In Sudan and in the West Bank and Gaza, the Arab territories occupied by Israel, the role of Iran is said to be becoming more influential. America's Central Intelligence Agency and Mr Robert Gates, its director, sharpened international fears last month by highlighting Iran's nuclear ambitions, suggesting that it might have a nuclear bomb by the end of the century. Some officials in Tehran believe that Iran and Islam are being set up as the replacements for the Soviet Union and communism in the lexicon of American demonology. So diverse are the official voices heard in Tehran that there is evidence to support almost any theory. Listening to Ayatollah Khamenei on the role of the US and Britain it sounds as if Iran and other large parts of the developing world are the continuing victims of the most pernicious conspiracy. The Tehran Times, the English language daily sometimes seen as a mouthpiece for moderation, recently provoked the withdrawal of Egypt's senior diplomat in Iran by suggesting that President Hosni Mubarak should be violently removed from office. Mr Larijani, on the other hand, talks about international compromise, understanding and mutual respect. He proposes a conference of British and Iranian intellectuals to discuss the problems of Mr Salman Rushdie, sentenced to death for purportedly insulting Islam in his book Satanic Verses. An hour with Mr Akhbar Tourkan, who must be a leading candidate for the title of the Middle East's most conciliatory minister of defence, creates the impression that Iran, so recently at war, has rarely felt less threatened. 'We have no enemies,' says the minister. As a result, Mr Tourkan says he can manage with one of the smallest military procurement budgets in the Gulf of about Dollars 1bn a year. One conclusion to be drawn from all this is that Iran, having defined itself primarily in terms of what it is against, is having greater problems in deciding what it is for. After the parliamentary elections last spring, many international observers were confident that a new political trend had emerged. Mr Rafsanjani had successfully eased out his most vocal, hardline critics and had replaced them with MPs of relatively liberal orientation. Iran's re-entry into international life would now accelerate in tandem with its economic development. This assessment has been proved at least temporarily wrong, not because Mr Rafsanjani's objectives were incorrectly interpreted but because of the changing pressures on the regime. A particular revelation last year was the extent to which the government felt obliged to meet consumer demand, a commitment reinforced by riots in Mashhad and other cities during the summer. The immediate cause of the disturbances is said to have been harsh official action against squatters, but there is no denying the pain that inflation and unemployment, both running at about 20 per cent, are causing. Sitting behind his desk in Qom, Grand Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi, a leading Shia jurist, refuses to accept even the concept of a division between people and the clergy. 'The government is Moslem and the people are Moslem. There is no possibility that the people might revolt. They would understand the problems and appreciate that the government is seeking to resolve them.' Mr Rafsanjani and the members of the Majlis (parliament) appear less sure and are taking serious risks with longer-term health of the economy to forestall any further confrontations on the streets. Even before the disturbances there was evidence that the authorities, and in particular the central bank, had partially lost control of the economy. Encouraged by the brief surge in oil prices which followed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, Iran cast spending caution to the winds. The trade deficit in the financial year to the end of March 1992 is estimated at about Dollars 10bn, exacerbated by the central bank's decision to allow the commercial banks to open letters of credit without supervision. With oil revenues this year unlikely to top Dollars 17bn it is not surprising that longer delays in payments are being experienced by foreign suppliers. Officially the delays are described as technical hitches and it is said that the payments backlog on letters of credit should be resolved within three months. Central bank officials have been reassuring foreign bankers that Iran has more than enough reserves to cover the payments deficit, but needs the liquidity to support the rial when the official exchange rate is floated later this year. Both assertions are open to doubt. Some bankers fear that Iran has already done serious damage to its international creditworthiness. More than Dollars 2.5bn is overdue on letters of credit, some of it by up to four months, and unofficial estimates suggest that there is another Dollars 7bn-Dollars 10bn in the pipeline with particularly severe bunching at the end of the current Iranian financial year. Several national export credit guarantee organisations are urgently reviewing their policies towards Iran and there are possibilities that cover could in some cases be withdrawn. One avenue of escape for Iran would be to convert some of its short-term commitments into medium and long-term debt, but this would have to be backed by sovereign guarantees. The central bank and the Ministry of Finance are balking at such a step, in large part because the issue would have to be brought before the parliament which is politically sensitive to foreign indebtedness. It is also probable that the parliament does not know how substantial the debt arrears are. Some Iranians argue that Mr Rafsanjani could force acceptance of sovereign guarantees through the Majlis, but watching him deliver his two-and-a-half hour budget speech last month was to appreciate how little he intimidates the assembly. At most times the chamber was only two-thirds full, MPs chatted among themselves as the speech was delivered, and a couple of times the president was mildly barracked for taking so long. The Ministry of Finance argues that the external payments situation will ease soon because 50 per cent fewer letters of credit have been issued in the current financial year. However all the visual evidence is that Tehran and other cities are still caught up in a consumer boom of considerable proportions. Shops are bulging with everything from perfumes to western fashions, most of which can never be worn in public, and from BMWs to video players, which are illegal but sold in their hundreds of thousands. Although most of the population is too poor to do more than gaze at the shop windows, the displays symbolise an end to the misery of the 1980s. With Mr Rafsanjani due to face a presidential election in June it is not a symbol that he wants to tarnish, whatever the consequences for Iran's international credit rating and the negotiations to secure loans needed to launch large-scale infrastructure projects. He also is unlikely, or unwilling, to check the relentless quest for additional sources of income from officials whose salaries alone are too modest for them to participate in the consumer boom. Although this has always been part of the Iranian way of doing business, those who have long associations with the country say that it has now reached epidemic proportions. One local businessman commented: 'In one sense it is worse than before the revolution because so many more people are involved. Everyone is trying to extract money from the system and too few people care whether what they are doing is of any value to the country.' Optimists who were chastened by the speed with which the political pendulum swung against the liberal trend following the parliamentary elections, are also watching anxiously the reappearance of the baseej, the irregular shock troops of the revolution. Under the ultimate command of the Ayatollah Khamenei, they are making their presence felt at checkpoints at night in Tehran and their activities could be linked to the the re-emergence of what some Iranians identify as hardline shadow organisations within government ministries. The complexity and obscurity of this continued jostling for influence in Iran will continue to pose hard problems of interpretation for western leaders and businessmen. With sustainable oil production targeted to reach 4.5m barrels a day later this year Iran's export earnings make it an attractive market, but only among the most courageous can it yet be seen as an investment opportunity. Its recently exposed lack of financial management and its willingness to put consumer demand ahead of urgently needed reconstruction projects underlines the need for caution. It may also serve to put into perspective the more alarmist American predictions about Iran's international ambitions. The revolution lives in the rhetoric of the country's leaders, but there are no queues of young men volunteering to fight in Bosnia. And as one senior official pointed out, huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons did not save the Soviet economy from disaster. In Tehran there seems a growing appreciation that the longevity of the regime will be decided within Iran's borders, not by its success in exporting revolution. The new Clinton administration and western European governments will make their own contribution to the evolution of Iranian politics. President Rafsanjani suffered domestically from the west trumpeting its belief in his moderation so loudly. Similarly, renewed efforts to cast Iran as a radical threat to western interests and Gulf stability will assuredly strengthen the most revolutionary elements in Tehran. Probably there is little the west can do that is guaranteed to assist Iran's pragmatists. But there is much it can do to sustain their enemies.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Mandarin </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By station reporter Huang Mei-ping; from the "Hookup" </F> program]    [Text] Huang Yen-chao, director of the International Trade  Bureau under the Ministry of Economic Affairs, will leave for  the United States on 17 January as the head a delegation to take  part in the talks between the Republic of China [ROC] and the  United States on variable tariff reductions [on U.S. exports to  Taiwan].    Before his departure, Director Huang said: According to  information from ROC units abroad, some U.S. congressmen are  doing everything they can to reinstate the Super 301 provision.  While Japan is the main target, the time is not favorable for  our side for the negotiations because this is the time when the  U.S. Congress and U.S. manufacturers are exerting pressure on  the U.S. Government. Because of this, as well as the fact that  only 40 or so industrial goods meet the terms of tariff  reduction, as pointed out by the units concerned, I can (?see)  that the negotiations will be very difficult.    According to Huang, (?agricultural and industrial)  departments do not have the so-called second optional plan. But  if the U.S. side insists on discussing the issue of the range of  variable tariff reductions, industrial departments should be  psychologically prepared to discuss this issue with the U.S.  side although they may not have to promise a specific range of  reduction. The U.S. side has indicated time and again that the  results of the negotiations will have a bearing on the timing of  the formal ROC-U.S. negotiations on tariff reductions.    As for whether or not the two sides will renegotiate a  variable tariff reduction prior to bilateral formal negotiations  on tariff reductions if the upcoming negotiations cannot satisfy  the two sides, Director Huang indicated that this is not very  likely because both the ROC and the United States intend to hold  formal negotiations on tariff reductions in February.    Huang also disclosed that of the list of 699 products which  the United States demands have their tariffs be reduced  flexibly, the percentage of tariff reductions for 31 industrial  goods has already met the U.S. requirements, and so there will  only be 668 products for which variable tariff reductions will  be discussed.

			<p>CSO     [Text] It has been learned that the Fair Trade Commission  has issued a warning that an agreement--between the banking and  securities industries which provided that the share allotted to  a bank and its subsidiary will not exceed that previously  allotted to a single firm--in managing a government bond  underwriting syndicate among bank-affiliated securities firms  "runs the risk of violating the Antimonopoly Law." The reason  cited is that, in order to hold down the total shares within an  upper limit, such agreements require participating firms to  engage in a voluntary arrangement which in turn obstructs fair  competition. Because of the potential increase in agreements  among securities firms to alleviate the effects of changes under  deregulation measures, the commission will maintain strict  surveillance over the situation in addition to exerting efforts  to promote free competition.    Bank-affiliated securities firms will begin participating in  government bond underwriting syndicates beginning with bonds  issued in April. The upper limit of a share to be controlled by  one securities firm has been set at "18 percent of the issue,"  in order to avoid the situation in which one firm wins in a  bidding for a large portion of the issue and distorts the price  formation process.    The securities industry had warned that entry of  bank-affiliated securities firms in the market place "could lead  to similar abuses if parent banks and subsidiary securities  firms joined and won in bidding for a large portion of issues."  In response, coordination between the banking and securities  industries resulted in an agreement whereby, "as a matter of  principle, the share of parent bank and subsidiary securities  firm will not exceed 18 percent of any given issue," and  bank-affiliated securities firms had informed the securities  industry that "they and their parent banking firms would not be  in a position to win bids for large portions of an issue."    The commission has stated relative to the one-firm limit  that, "The Ministry of Finance can mechanically reduce any bids  won beyond the one-firm limit and sees no problem in this  respect." However, relative to the combined bidding by parent  bank and subsidiary securities firm, it decided, "There is no  way we can mechanically combine figures and effect an  adjustment, and there is no way we can avoid a prior agreement.  Rates and underwriting shares should be determined on a  competitive basis." The commission takes the position that  excessive competition and distortions in price formation should  be handled under other procedures such as the Securities  Transactions Law.    The Fair Trade Commission recently submitted these ideas to  the Ministry of Finance, which is responsible for issuing  government bonds. In response, the banking and securities  industries decided to cancel such agreements and notified the  bank-affiliated securities firms of the decision. The banking  and securities industries now think it will be difficult to  arrive at such agreements in the future.    Banks intend to actively engage in the bidding for new  government bond issues to provide for management in investment  accounts, even after having established securities subsidiaries.  Bond trading departments provide for the primary source of  revenues and profits for subsidiary securities firms and many of  them will be actively bidding for government bonds beginning  with the April issue. Now that the decision has been made to  forbid combined bidding ceilings, the potential shares of  government bond issues for banks and their securities  subsidiaries could rise and the possibility has increased for a  stronger role to be played by banks.    Not only have business operations been deregulated through  the full-scale removal of market barriers between banks and  securities firms but we have now entered into the final phase of  deregulating interest rates. Some sources point to the potential  for moves to limit competition because of aversion to  disintegration of the existing order as a result of such  deregulation.</p>

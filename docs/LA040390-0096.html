			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INTO THE NIGHT: PHOTO OP FOR NASH COLLECTION  </P> <P> The Scene: Gazing (by invitation only) at rocker Graham Nash's photography  collection at Sotheby's auction house on Rodeo Drive. The collection goes on  the block April 25 in New York. To everyone's amazement, the walls of photos by  Edward Steichen, Diane Arbus, Paul Outerbridge, Pierre Dubreuil and others  represented just a tiny fraction of Nash's entire body of works.  </P> <P> Who Was There: Nash's friends such as David Crosby, Andy Summers of the Police  and Judd Nelson; photography-world types such as G. Ray Hawkins with wife  Susan, Stephen White, Weston Naef and Simon Lowinsky; plus assorted collectors  and wanna-be collectors.  </P> <P> The Buzz: On the one hand, how photography collecting has grown up; on the  other hand, how L.A. buyers are prone to buying famous-name, high-priced  photography.  </P> <P> Quoted: "Some of this stuff is pretty esoteric and esoteric in this city is  lost. If it isn't Herb Ritts or Mapplethorpe, forget it," said dealer Stephen  White.  </P> <P> One Moment in Time: "Part of me is in tears, but it's the part you can't see,"  said Nash with a brave smile, admitting that letting go of his collection  wasn't all that easy. "There's 20 years of my life in here. I keep going on  this fantasy of, OK, this is a gallery and everything's a dollar. Which ones  would I buy? I'm very partial to Dubreuil and Outerbridge."  </P> <P> Dress code: The same for men and women -- basic black jackets, shirts, leather,  turtlenecks, jeans and suits, plus assorted footwear including woven leather  loafers, bucks, cowboy boots and Judd Nelson's untied combat-style boots.  </P> <P> Chow: A Southwestern grazing field day, beginning with chicken and shrimp  chimichangas, tequila-marinated salmon, white sea bass ceviche, hand-shaken  margaritas, Evian water, Diet Coke and platters of ethnically original  "Southwestern tempura."  </P> <P> Overheard: "I'll just palm two of these and no one will notice," said David  Crosby as he returned for the crab taquitos.  </P> <P> Coveted: The beautiful Nash catalogues selling for $30 a pop.  </P></p>

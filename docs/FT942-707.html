			<p>940628 FT  28 JUN 94 / Business and the Law: Trademark rules accord with treaty - European Court National trade-mark rules which allowed imports to be banned because they might be confused with domestic goods were compatible with Rome treaty provisions on the free movement of goods, the European Court of Justice said last week. The case concerned the importation of heating installations into Germany from France. The goods, which were made in France, were sold under the trademark 'Ideal Standard'. Until 1984, an American company held the rights to 'Ideal Standard' and marketed sanitary equipment and heating installations under that name through subsidiaries in Germany and France. But in 1984 the French subsidiary was forced, due to economic circumstances, to sell its heating installation business, together with the trademark, to an outside company with no link to the Ideal Standard group. The trademark rights were later sold on to another company, also independent of the original grouping. It was the German subsidiary of this last company which found itself before the German courts for trademark infringement, having imported heating installations into Germany from France with the name 'Ideal Standard'. The plaintiff company still held the right to the trademark 'Ideal Standard' for both sanitary equipment and heating installations but it had stopped producing and marketing heating installations in 1976. The Dusseldorf court found in favour of the plaintiff. It said the French imports risked confusing consumers. It also found that the relevant EC law was clear and thus refrained from seeking a preliminary ruling from the ECJ. The German importer appealed. The Dusseldorf Appeal Court referred the case to the ECJ, asking whether there was an unlawful restriction on the free movement of goods under the EC treaty. At the time there were no harmonised Community rules on trademarks. The ECJ said it was common ground that the restriction on the German importer was a measure of equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction within the meaning of the treaty. The question was whether it could be justified. The Court had already ruled in the Hag II case that such restrictions could be justified, but in that case, not only was the name of the trademark identical but also the products concerned were identical. In the present case, although the trademark name was identical, the German holder of the trademark no longer sold the products being imported. The Court said that, where a risk of confusion existed for consumers between two products, it did not matter whether the goods were identical or sufficiently similar. In the present case, the national court had decided on the facts before it that a risk of confusion existed. The Court could not substitute its own findings on the facts; thus, given that a risk of confusion existed, the position was as if the goods in question had been identical. The question that remained was whether the Court's findings in Hag II could apply not only to the facts of that case - where the trademark rights were forceably removed from the holders by sequestration - but also to the present case where there had been a voluntary transfer of trademark rights. The Court said they could. The determining factor in Hag II had been the absence of consent by the trademark holder in the country of importation to the selling in the exporting country of similar products sold by the trademark holder in that country. In such circumstances, the free movement of goods would jeopardise the essential function of the trademark; consumers would not be able to identify with certainty the origin of the marked goods and the holder of the trademark could be held responsible for the poor quality of goods for which he was not responsible. The Court found this reasoning would not have been altered if the transfer of trademark rights had been made voluntarily rather than by sequestration. Therefore its findings in Hag II applied.

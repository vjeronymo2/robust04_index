			<p>930916 FT  16 SEP 93 / London Stock Exchange: British Steel busy Active trading in British Steel saw turnover jump to 24m after UBS, its broker, said it was a buyer of the stock. The shares bucked the poor market trend, closing 4 up at 110p, after the securities house, which hosted a dinner for the company on Tuesday evening, said its move was based on optimism concerning the progress of discussions with the EC on its plans to restructure the steel industry. A trading statement from Allied-Lyons at a meeting of more than 100 brewing analysts and institutions received a largely cool reception and the shares dipped in average volume of 3.3m. An analyst said the cautious tone adopted by Allied contrasted with a more bullish view espoused at its recent agm, with the resulting decline in the shares. Allied said the UK brewing market remained tough and that the recovery in the US was sluggish. Dealers said the fall in the Allied shares, which closed 18 down at 575p, was limited by yield support. Mining conglomerate RTZ dropped 20 to 676p as two securities houses reduced their forecasts for commodity prices and the company's profits. Goldman Sachs cut its estimate on copper prices to an average of 80 cents a pound for 1994, against a previous 85. A London spokesman for the US house said the cut was based on an expected slowdown in world demand for copper. Goldman estimated that a 10 per cent fall in copper prices could hit RTZ earnings by Pounds 53m. Meanwhile, Lehman Bro-thers downgraded its 1993 earnings forecast for RTZ. Analyst Mr Rob Davies cut his estimate on the group's underlying full-year earnings to 36.7p a share from 39p, and issued a profits forecast for the year of 28.5p a share based on the new FRS3 accounting standard. Stocks with heavy exposure to both London and New York suffered particularly badly yesterday. Reuters stood out with a fall of 31 to 1549p in spite of a positive seminar in New York. Shell Transport retreated 11 to 648p and Rothmans International 'B' shares, already suffering from worries over their Footsie status, fell 15 1/2 to 646p. Realisation that the sector had been left behind, coupled with specific factors, prompted early morning rallies in pharmaceuticals. But the gains proved unsustainable and most leading pharmaceutical groups barely held firm. Glaxo was up 14 at best on US buying but closed a net penny off at 624p. The US Food and Drug Administration failed to reach agreement on allowing generic companies to make versions of off-patent inhaler treatments for asthma. Agreement would have hit Glaxo's Ventolin and helped Medeva, which has a potential rival to Ventolin. Medeva shed 9 to 106 1/2 p. SmithKline Beecham 'A' closed flat at 409p after being up 9, and Wellcome retreated from a high of 730p to 718p, a net fall of 6. Profit-taking hit the regional electricity companies after a recent good run, Panmure Gordon arguing that the Recs 'are at both their absolute and relative all-time highs'. East Midland declined 8 to 529p, as did Yorkshire to 576p. Oil group Lasmo returned to profit and its shares rose 5 1/2 to 133 1/2 p. Mr Simon Flowers of NatWest Securities said Lasmo had set aims six months ago to cut costs, sell assets and refinance the balance sheet, and those targets had been 'not just matched but exceeded'. NatWest Securities was said to have been the big shopper for Tomkins shares, which hardened 2 to 228p in trade of 5.3m following a positive if exacting agm at the company.</p>

			<p>920918 FT  18 SEP 92 / Unemployment rises to 2.8m: Increase of 47,400 takes jobless figures to five-year high THE government released more gloomy economic news yesterday when it announced that Britain's unemployment total rose last month to a five-year high of 2.8m. The increase in the month - at more than 47,000 - was much higher than expected. The seasonally adjusted increase was the 28th consecutive monthly rise and the largest in one month since January. Other official figures disappointed hopes of recovery in UK industry. Manufacturing output was flat in July month on month and showed no growth in the three months to the end of July. Commenting on the unemployment figures, Employment Department officials yesterday stressed that firmer evidence was needed before a worsening trend could be confirmed. They said August could be a quirky month, partly because this year it incorporated five weeks and because of the effect of graduates claiming benefit. Analysts believe the rise may partly be a result of the general election. Mr James Barty, of Morgan Grenfell, said some companies had waited to see the effect of the result on the economy and were now putting into effect previous plans for job cuts. Another set of Employment Department statistics showed that the jobless figure is much higher when calculated by international standards. The new quarterly Labour Force Survey found that the number of people looking for work in the spring averaged 2.65m, against the 2.61m benefit claimants counted in the monthly total for May. Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said the government was reviewing the range of measures available to those without work. Ms Joyce Quin, shadow employment minister, said the figures showed 'yet more evidence of the government's appalling economic mismanagement. We have the fastest rising unemployment in Europe. It is no use blaming the Germans or the French referendum for that.' The new total of 2,807,500 represents 9.9 per cent of the workforce and is the highest since June 1987. Unadjusted unemployment jumped by 71,541 to 2,845,508 in August, 10.1 per cent of the workforce. Unemployment rose in every region, with the largest increase again recorded in the south-east.

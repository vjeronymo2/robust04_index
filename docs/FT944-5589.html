			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / International Company News: N American gold merger fails on lack of investors The proposed merger of four small North American gold companies into a medium-sized group has fallen through, partly because of lack of appetite among investors for gold equities. The new management team at Denver-based Atlas Corporation had hoped to raise USDollars 75m from international investors to buy: 37.2 per cent of Granges, a Canadian precious metals producer, for CDollars 50.7m (USDollars 36.9m) from MIM, the Australian resources group; 20 per cent of Dakota Mining, another Denver company formerly known as MinVen Gold, for between Dollars 15.3m and Dollars 18.4m; the rest of Grange's 50 per cent-owned Hycroft Resources. The merger, which Atlas wanted to complete before the end of this year, would have created a group that might have qualified for inclusion in the new Financial Times Gold Mines Index. Mr Steve Manz, president of Atlas, said yesterday the scheme began to look as if it might face problems when his company was able to raise only Dollars 50m of the Dollars 75m it was seeking, with the help of First Marathon Securities, in July. 'There was a strike by gold investors. Most junior companies looking for capital pulled their offerings,' he said. Subsequently, Atlas acquired the Granges stake but decided not to proceed with the Dakota acquisition, partly because the terms would have involved it paying Dollars 4 a share compared with a market price which had dropped to Dollars 1.50. Mr Manz says Atlas now has the support of enough other Granges shareholders to take control of that company's board at the annual meeting, which must be held before the end of June next year. The ultimate objective is a full merger of Atlas, Granges and Hycroft, to produce a group with an annual output in 1996 of at least 150,000 troy ounces of gold.</p>

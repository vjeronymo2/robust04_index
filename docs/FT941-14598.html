			<p>940119 FT  19 JAN 94 / Economic tide turns in Hungary Hungary's government yesterday signalled an end to four years of recession by declaring in strong terms that recovery was under way. 'Something is moving,' said Mr Ivan Szabo, finance minister, in his new year's economic report. 'Every indicator shows that some kind of growth has started.' Budapest's optimism adds to the growing consensus that eastern Europe is turning up economically. Poland's GDP grew 4 per cent in 1993, making it Europe's fastest growing economy, and that momentum is expected to continue in 1994. The influential Vienna Institute for Comparative Economic Studies forecast recovery for eastern Europe in 1994 and the region's stock markets, glamourised by the fashion for emerging markets, are booming. Mr Szabo said Hungary's industrial production rose 3-4 per cent in 1993, while infrastructure investment made the construction industry particularly lively. The conclusion of land reform in the first half of this year should allow a recovery in agriculture, which held back the economy in 1993. The government had forecast that GDP would fall by 0-3 per cent in 1993 and remain stable in 1994. But a surge in tax revenues from the Christmas shopping season might prompt a revision of output estimates, Mr Szabo said. Higher than expected receipts from value-added, income and company taxes also allowed the central budget to close with a deficit which at Ft200bn (Pounds 1.3bn) was considerably below independent forecasts.</p>

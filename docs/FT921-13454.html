			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / UK Company News: BAe faces setback in Saudi arms deal - Timing of finance director's departure adds to embarrassment BRITISH Aerospace faces further delays in its efforts to complete negotiations on a Pounds 10bn arms contract with Saudi Arabia. The company was hoping to complete soon the second phase of its Al Yamamah defence deal involving construction of a new airbase and orders for new Tornado and Hawk aircraft. But there are growing signs in the UK and Saudi Arabia that the Saudis are unlikely to make a decision in the government-to-government negotiations before a British election in April or May. The contract would give BAe a much-needed boost at a time when the company is still struggling to regain the confidence of the City after its unsuccessful rights issue and the resignation of Professor Sir Roland Smith, its chairman, last September. The setback in the delicate negotiations came as the company officially confirmed yesterday that Mr Dudley Eustace, its finance director, would leave the board 'by mutual agreement' after its annual meeting this spring. Although the departure of Mr Eustace was not altogether unexpected after the rights issue, the timing of the announcement was clearly embarrassing for BAe. The company, which was planning to announce Mr Eustace's resignation after a successor had been found at about the time of the annual meeting, has been desperately trying to portray a picture of corporate stability after last year's top management crisis. The announcement of Mr Eustace's resignation, coupled with disclosures that the company faced an Pounds 80m property claim from Asda, the supermarket group, hit BAe shares yesterday. They fell sharply in early trading from 314p to 288p, subsequently recovering to close at 302p. BAe said in its statement yesterday that Mr Eustace's departure had no connection with its discussions with Asda over the supermarket group's claim against BAe's Arlington property company. The statement said: 'The board of BAe announces with regret and by mutual agreement that Dudley Eustace, in whom the board has the fullest confidence, intends to stand down as a director of the company following the annual general meeting.' BAe insiders also confirmed that Mr Eustace was leaving amicably and that there had been no 'bust-up'. 'After Professor Smith's resignation we always felt there would have to be more scalps. We would have been surprised if it had not happened,' one City analyst said yesterday. 'Mr Eustace was well liked in the City but had to pay for the rights issue flop,' another analyst added.

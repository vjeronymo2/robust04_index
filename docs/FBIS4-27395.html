			<p>BFN     [Text] Dear friends; On the fifth working day of the  Ninth National Assembly's fifth session at the conference hall,  deputies continued to discuss the draft law on tax for the  transfer of land use rights and heard a report on the draft  amendment to the laws on organization and the election of  people's councils.    In the morning, the deputies listened to Mr. Ho Te, minister  of finance and chairman of draft law compilation committee, who  read a report summarizing the views of deputies on the draft law  on the transfer tax on land use rights. Seventeen deputies gave  their opinions on this draft law. Most of their views focused  on major issues such as targeted parties, the basis for tax  calculation, tax rates, tax reduction and exemption, and an  effective time frame of the law.    Those who voiced their views held that in order to maintain  fairness, the calculation of tax must be based on the source of  the land. They also agreed that tax reduction and exemption  must be given to state cadres and employees who have to move  house as required by public service, and also for those who have  completed their service in mountainous provinces and who have  decided to return to their hometowns for retirement.    In terms of tax rates, many deputies suggested the rate of  five percent for the mountainous and coastal provinces so as to  encourage investment. Others suggested that the transfer of  agricultural land use right must be limited to preventing land  from being used for other purposes. These limitation must be  stated clearly in the regulations to avoid loss of public funds,  and also to avoid negativity in the management mechanism.  Others held the view that distinctions should not be made  between the transfer of land use rights and a change in the way  land is used. With this, the National Assembly deputies have  completed their discussion of the draft law on the transfer tax  on land use rights.    In the afternoon, the National Assembly deputies heard  Comrade Phan Ngoc Tuong, minister chairman of state organization  and personnel commission, acting on behalf of the government,  read a report on the amendment of the people's councils and  people's committees, and the amendment draft on the law on  election of people's councils. They also heard Comrade Ha Manh  Tri read an investigative report on the two draft amendments on  laws regarding the organization of the people's councils and  election of people's councils.    The deputies will hold group discussions tomorrow morning on  the draft laws on organization and the election of people's  councils to prepare for the plenary session at the conference  hall in the afternoon.</p>

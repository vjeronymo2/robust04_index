			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Jefferson Smurfit's US side to be refinanced Jefferson Smurfit/Container Corp of America, one of the US's biggest paper and packaging groups, is preparing for a public flotation as part of a multi-billion dollar recapitalisation plan. The financial restructuring will also involve raising Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1bn) of bank debt, marking one of the biggest leveraged bank financings since the 1980s. The company, which is owned half by Jefferson Smurfit Group of Ireland and half by an equity fund run by Morgan Stanley, was the creation of two leveraged buy-outs in the 1980s. It has struggled through the 1990s under a heavy weight of junk bond-financed debt, exacerbated by the effects of weak paper markets. The paper industry as a whole has barely broken even since 1990. The company, with sales of Dollars 3bn in 1992, is the largest recycler of waste paper in the US, and one of the largest producers of paperboard, packaging and newsprint. The flotation would bolster the company's equity base and give it access to further capital. The strength of the stock market is believed to have led the company to bring forward plans for a flotation. Using bank debt to pay off some of the company's bonds, meanwhile, would reduce interest costs and strengthen its cashflow. The company carries a single-B non-investment grade (or junk) bond rating, though bankers hope an improvement in its financial condition will enable it to reach a double-B rating before long. While the US junk bond market reached record levels of new issuance last year, banks have remained cautious about backing large financings for non-investment grade companies. However, a lack of new opportunities to lend, at a time when banks in the US are in better financial health than for many years, is beginning to re-awaken interest in leveraged deals. The proposed bank deal has met a generally favourable reception among financiers in New York. 'The mills are world-class operating entities, and the company's management is very strong,' said one banker who had been approached about participating in the transaction. Recent experience at other paper companies suggested the industry had overcome some of its over-capacity problems and had been able to sustain price rises, he added.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shanghai, June 3 (XINHUA) -- Shanghai is striving to  regain its position as an international financial center,  according to Mao Yingliang, president of the municipal branch of  the People's Bank of China.    According to its plan, Shanghai will expand its monetary  market (China's largest), securities market, foreign exchange  market and insurance market, and open a gold market and a free  on board (FOB) market.    "To attain its strategic objective, Shanghai must further  reform its economic system and open wider to the outside world  while speeding up construction of its infrastructure  facilities," Mao said.    "Only by improving and fostering the market economy step by  step, can the banking reform be deepened and a standardized  international banking center be formed," he noted.    In addition, according to Mao, the modern banking system  needs to be coordinated with the modern enterprise system and  banking laws brought into line with international conventions.    At present, the Chinese Government is widely soliciting  opinions in order to formulate a package of laws covering the  operations of the central and commercial banks, securities and  the banking market, which are expected to come into effect soon.    Mao disclosed that, to develop the metropolis into an  international financial center, Shanghai's banking  organizations, under the leadership of the central bank, have  decided to compete with overseas banking organizations.    "Shanghai, China's largest economic center, is becoming the  country's largest monetary, securities, foreign exchange and  insurance market," the president said.    He explained that the monetary market, in terms of  inter-bank  loans, will make maximum use of short-term floating loans  between Shanghai and its nearby provinces.    Mao urged the Shanghai Stock Exchange to further standardize  and internationalize its operation so as to become a first-class  securities collection and distribution center in the Asian and  Pacific region.    The China Foreign Exchange Center, located in Shanghai, is  being encouraged to promote the stabilization of the renminbi  exchange rate to allow free convertibility.    Mao also called for the expansion of the insurance, gold and  FOB markets -- which started later than other banking markets --  the golden card project and the city clearing and settlement  system.    According to Mao, the Shanghai International Financial  Center  is being developed in three stages; construction of the first  stage will be completed in 1995, that of the second in 2000 and  that of the third in 2010.</p>

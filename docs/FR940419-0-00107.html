			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In &sect;92.300(b), the language concerning the availability of a percentage of the minimum CHDO setaside for capacity building is amended from ``may be expended'' to ``may be committed'' to allow participating jurisdictions more flexibility in using HOME funds for this purpose. Corrections are made to change the references in &sect;&sect;92.300 (e) and (f) from operating expenses provided under &sect;92.206(g) to operating expenses provided under &sect;92.208, and to change the reference in &sect;92.300(f) from administrative funds under &sect;92.206(f) to administrative funds under &sect;92.207, to conform these citations to this rule's reorganization of eligible costs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Section 92.354(a) is revised to clarify the applicability of the Davis-Bacon Act to the HOME Program. The revision makes clear that the Davis-Bacon wage provisions apply if HOME funds are used for  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> any <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  project costs (as defined at &sect;92.206), including construction or nonconstruction costs, of housing with 12 or more assisted units. Once applicable, these wage provisions apply to all laborers and mechanics employed in the development of the entire project, as defined in &sect;92.2, including portions other than the assisted units. The interim rule specifies that if HOME funds are only used to assist first-time homebuyers to acquire single-family housing and not for any other project costs, these wage provisions apply to the construction of housing containing 12 or more units when there is a written agreement with the owner or developer of the housing that the HOME funds will be used to assist first-time homebuyers to buy the housing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A conforming change is made to &sect;92.502(b)(1) that is necessary because of the amendment made to the definition of commitment in &sect;92.2, discussed above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This interim rule eases the requirements of &sect;92.504(e)(1) by permitting on-site review once within a two-year period for rental housing containing 25 HOME-assisted units or less.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, in &sect;92.508, paragraph (a)(4)(v) is revised to make a conforming change, related to the reorganization of eligible costs, from a reference to &sect;92.206(g) to a reference to &sect;92.208.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> III. Findings and Certifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment has been made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR part 50, which implement section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Planning and Review  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule has been reviewed and approved in accordance with Executive Order 12866, issued by the President on September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993). Any changes to the interim rule resulting from this review are available for public inspection between 7:30 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. weekdays in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Impact on Small Entities <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605(b)), the undersigned hereby certifies that this interim rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because jurisdictions that are statutorily eligible to receive formula allocations are relatively larger cities, counties or States.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Regulatory Agenda  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This interim rule was listed as item number 1472 in the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulations published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 56402, 56416) under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Federalism Impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel has determined, as the Designated Official for HUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, Federalism, that this interim rule does not have federalism implications concerning the division of local, State, and federal responsibilities. While the HOME Program interim rule amended by this interim rule was determined to be a rule with federalism implications and the Department submitted a Federalism Assessment concerning the interim rule to OMB, this amending rule only makes limited adjustments to the interim rule and does not significantly affect any of the factors considered in the Federalism Assessment for the interim rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Impact on the Family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606, The Family, has determined that this interim rule would not have significant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being. Assistance provided under this interim rule can be expected to support family values, by helping families achieve security and independence; by enabling them to live in decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and by giving them the means to live independently in mainstream American society. This interim rule would not, however, affect the institution of the family, which is requisite to coverage by the Order. Even if this interim rule had the necessary family impact, it would not be subject to further review under the Order, since the provision of assistance under this interim rule is required by statute, and is not subject to agency discretion.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Number for the HOME Program is 14.239.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 92  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Administrative practice and procedure, Grant programs_housing and community development, Grant programs_Indians, Indians, Low and moderate income housing, Manufactured homes, Rent subsidies, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Accordingly, the Department amends part 92 of title 24 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 92_HOME INVESTMENT PARTNERSHIPS PROGRAM  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1.

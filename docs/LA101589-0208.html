			<p><P> October 15, 1989, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> HOUSING PROJECT  </P> <P> On the front page of your Orange County Edition (Oct. 6), there was a story on  a housing project for low-income families to be built by a coalition of Habitat  for Humanity, the Fieldstone Co. and Rancho Santa Margarita.  </P> <P> While the great bulk of information you conveyed was correct, there was one  significant error. Your article stated that this project was basically my idea.  While I would like to take credit for it, it was the brainchild of Dave  Langlois, one of our corporate directors and manager of our Orange County  division.  </P> <P> Regardless of whose idea it was, we see this as a tremendous opportunity to use  our home-building skills in reaching out compassionately to some of Orange  County's hard-working but less fortunate families.  </P> <P> PETER M. OCHS  </P> <P> Chairman and chief executive officer, Fieldstone Co.  </P> <P> Newport Beach  </P></p>

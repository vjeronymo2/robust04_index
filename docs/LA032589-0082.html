			<p><P> March 25, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CHRISTIANS WILL GREET EASTER AT DAWN RITES  </P> <P> In a pre-dawn ritual throughout Southern California, thousands of Christians  will get up early Sunday for sunrise services on the most important holiday on  the Christian calendar, a day focused on New Testament accounts of Jesus risen  from the dead.  </P> <P> The Easter services -- some beginning even before sunrise at 5:45 a.m. --  typically feature familiar readings and musical presentations, with only  occasional departures from each annual event's traditions.  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the Hollywood Bowl sunrise service, this year dedicated to  Armenians affected by last December's devastating earthquake, will feature a  sermon by an Armenian churchman for the first time in the event's 69 years --  Archbishop Vatche Hovsepian of the Armenian Church of North America.  </P> <P> Armenian Christians, as well as Protestants, Catholics and Anglicans, celebrate  Easter this Sunday. Eastern Orthodox churches, whose tradition requires that  the holiday fall after the Jewish Passover period, will observe Easter on April  30.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Celebrities to Appear  </P> <P> The Bowl service, which traditionally involves entertainment celebrities, will  include Cyd Charisse reading "The Master Is Coming" and songs by Robert  Guillame, currently starring in the film "Lean on Me," and Rhonda Fleming. Bob  Ralston, long featured on the Lawrence Welk television program, will be an  organ soloist.  </P> <P> The 1989 Easter message of the Mormon Church's First Presidency will be read  during the prologue, and Pope John Paul II's Easter message will be read by  Auxiliary Bishop Juan Arzube of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese, prior to  the service's musical finale.  </P> <P> Other clergy participating include the Revs. Harry Durkee of Hollywood Lutheran  Church, Clarence J. Davis Jr. of Mt. Hebron Baptist Church, Patsy Nichols  Redwood of St. Paul's Presbyterian Church and Roy McKoewn, founder of World  Opportunities International.  </P> <P> Parking and admission are free for the service, which lasts from 5:15 to 7  a.m., but organizers also made their customary last-minute appeal for calla  lilies. People who bring lilies to the Bowl between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. today  were promised reserved seats.  </P> <P> The annual sunrise service atop Mt. Rubidoux in Riverside, which has an  interdenominational Protestant flavor, will have a sermon by Dan Matthews, host  of the Christian Lifestyle Magazine television program and executive director  in Newbury Park of the Seventh-day Adventists' Faith for Today productions.  </P> <P> Regular participants Robert Dyer and Horace Stevens, respectively, will read  the poem "God of the Open Air" and sing a solo. The Mt. Rubidoux service, which  usually draws about 2,000 worshipers, will be held for the 77th time since its  inaugural service in 1909. The tradition has been interrupted only by one  rain-out and three wartime cancellations. The service will begin at 5:30 a.m.  </P> <P> More than 11,000 persons are expected to turn out for sunrise services held at  four Forest Lawn Memorial-Park cemeteries and organized by a variety of  ministerial associations and church councils. All of them will start at 5:45  a.m.  </P> <P> The largest crowd is expected at Forest Lawn in Covina Hills where the speaker  will be the Rev. G. Michael Cocoris, senior pastor of Glendora's Church of the  Open Door. Rich Buhler, an ordained minister who hosts the syndicated radio  talk show "Talk From the Heart," will speak at the 28th annual sunrise service  at Forest Lawn in Cypress.  </P> <P> Auxiliary Bishop Carl Fisher of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese will speak  at the Forest Lawn-Sunnyside service in Long Beach, and the Rev. George Smith,  senior pastor of North Hollywood First Assembly of God, will preach the sermon  at the Hollywood Hills facility. In addition, a Spanish-language service will  be held indoors at 5:45 a.m. in the Hall of the Crucifixion-Resurrection at  Forest Lawn, Glendale, under the auspices of the Hispanic Baptist Churches of  the American Southwest.  </P> <P> Among other early morning outdoor services are the 6 a.m. service in the  amphitheater at Wayfarers Chapel in Rancho Palos Verdes; the 25th annual Morro  Bay service, starting at 6 a.m. adjacent to Morro Rock, and the 20th annual  Easter Service on Horseback, sponsored by the Valley Horse Owners Assn.,  starting at 9 a.m. at Orcas Park in Lake View Terrace.  </P> <P> In San Diego County, three traditional sunrise services will be staged. The  72nd service on Mt. Helix in La Mesa, sponsored by the Wesleyan Church, will  start at 6:30 a.m.; the 68th annual service atop Mt. Soledad in La Jolla will  begin at 6 a.m. and the 40th annual service at Cabrillo National Monument will  start at 6:30 a.m.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A stagnation in the management of foreign affairs  is becoming evident with the prolonged political vacuum  resulting from Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's resignation,  and the ensuing process to elect a successor.    Visits by Egyptian President Muhammad Mubarak and Thai Prime  Minister Chuan Likphai have either been canceled or postponed,  while discussions by the political authorities on how to deal  with the DPRK's suspected nuclear arms development remain  suspended. The government has also been unable to make  important decisions on improving relations with the United  States, particularly on the Japan-U.S. framework talks. The  Foreign Ministry is beginning to be irritated.    The Ministry is most distressed with the inadequacy of the  crisis management system concerning the DPRK nuclear issue.  While the Ministry has been holding regular working-level  liaison meetings with the Defense Agency, the Ministry of  International Trade and Industry, and other ministries and  agencies concerned to gather information and to analyze the  situation, ministerial level discussions, which would be  necessary to deal with an emergency, remain insufficient due to  the prolonged political turmoil.    The Foreign Ministry has done a simulation of probable  developments in terms of: 1) rescue of Japanese abroad; 2)  refugee relief; 3) restriction in personnel exchanges,  remittances and trade; and 4) assistance to the United States,  in the event the UN Security Council decides to impose economic  sanctions on the DPRK. However, a senior Foreign Ministry  official says, "No matter how much we discuss these issues, if  the range of policy measures a political decision would allow  remains unclear, what we can do is limited."    The Foreign Ministry is particularly concerned that a  conflict may surface among the ruling parties in terms of the  maintenance of secrecy, and assistance to the United States in  the event of an emergency due to the presence of the Social  Democratic Party of Japan [SDPJ] in the coalition.    A top ministry official says, "In the event of the  misfortune  of a war breaking out, how far can Japan deal with the situation  on its own? If we behave like we did during the Gulf war,  Japan-U.S. relations will further deteriorate."    While the ruling coalition parties basically agreed on 16  April on the policy of "abiding by the United Nations's  decision," some Foreign Ministry officials point out that this  is still "ambiguous because if, for instance, the Security  Council fails to pass a resolution because of a Chinese veto,  and a decision to impose sanctions in the form of multinational  forces is made, our response remains unclear," (according to a  senior Foreign Ministry official).    The cancellation of several visits by foreign VIP's also  undermines Japan's image abroad. President Mubarak's visit (18  to 21 April) is supposed to be an important diplomatic event in  that it will demonstrate Japan's vital role in the  reconstruction of the occupied territories after the historical  reconciliation between Israel and the PLO. On the other hand,  although Prime Minister Chuan's visit (22 to 27 April) has been  postponed purportedly under a request from Thailand, this will  create a bad precedent in diplomatic protocol because he has  been invited as an official guest.    There has also been issues in official development  assistance  (ODA) that require a political decision. The United States has  complained that yen loan to Iran, which was resumed in 1993,  "may constitute official recognition of a nation exporting  terrorism." Aid to Iran was resumed in May 1993, after an  interval of 17 years, and a loan of 38 billion yen as the first  phase of an aid program has already been agreed upon. Now, the  second installment of the financial aid is being questioned.  This problem has to do with a high-level political decision on  the position of the Middle East, particularly Iran, in Japan's  overall diplomatic strategy. The political vacuum has also had  its adverse effects on this issue.</p>

"You firmly built up the whole party, all the Army and the  entire people to be a powerful driving force of the revolution  united in one mind and made sure that a new upswing was effected  on all fronts of socialist construction," Han Tok-su notes, and  says:    "Last year you also powerfully aroused the entire fellow  countrymen in the struggle to realize the 10-point programme of  the great unity of the whole nation and wisely led hundreds of  millions of people who were struggling for independence against  imperialism along the road of global independence".    Han states that under the tested guidance of the dear leader  Chongnyon could last year more firmly unite the broad masses of  compatriots and honorably carry out all the patriotic tasks  including the struggle to defend the socialist country and the  work of national reunification to implement the 10-point  programme of the great unity of the whole nation.    Han Tok-su stresses the need to firmly establish the  leadership system of the dear leader in the Chongnyon  organisation and further strengthen and develop the Chongnyon  ranks into an unbreakable patriotic unit united in one mind.    He sincerely wishes Marshal Kim Chong-il a long life in good  health.</p>

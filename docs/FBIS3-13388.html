Brother Abu-'Ammar said the  meeting addressed the UN Security Council debate on the  al-Ibrahmi Mosque massacre in Hebron.    Brother Abu-'Ammar, who was speaking after the session, said  he had briefed the Tunisian president on the contents of the  message he received from the U.S. Secretary of State Warren  Christopher. He told him that the message pressed home the need  for keeping the peace process going. Abu-'Ammar reiterated the  Palestinian position on the need for the Security Council to  pass a strong resolution that takes into account the question of  Jerusalem and condemns the attack on the al-Ibrahimi Mosque and  decides on immediate measures to protect our Palestinian people.    Brother Abu-'Ammar criticized the council's inability thus  far to pass a resolution on the appaling massacre at the  al-Ibrahimi Mosque.    Cited by the French daily LE FIGARO, he said the council is  not debating a draft resolution submitted by the Palestinians  and the Arab and nonaligned group at the United Nations, but one  proposed by the U.S. Administration itself. The Americans, he  added, are opposed to any resolution that includes Jerusalem as  part of the occupied territory, despite the fact that Resolution  799 on the fourth Geneva Convention states just that.    Abu-'Ammar demanded that Israel honor the Declaration of  Principles agreement which Israel and the PLO signed in  Washington on 13 September, 1993. 'Arafat said he will give  Israel until 12 April to implement the Gaza-Jericho First  Accord. If the Declaration of Priniciples fails to be honestly  and accurately implemented, I will then have the right to put  the facts before my people, added Abu-'Ammar.    As to why he set the 12 April date, brother Abu-'Ammar  explained that it is the day fixed by the Declaration of  Principles for a completion of the Israeli withdrawal. If that  does not happen this means the Israeli Government has decided  not to honor agreements it signed. The responsibility then  shifts to the international community, particularly the U.S. and  Russian sponsors of the peace process, brother Abu-'Ammar said.</p>

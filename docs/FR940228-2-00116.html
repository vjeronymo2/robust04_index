BN had previously been granted a waiver of the requirements of portions of the Track Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213) to allow the carrier to apply Bulldog Clamps to certain internal rail defects in lieu of conventional rail joint bars on certain BN line segments. See 55 FR 50266 and 56 FR 13515. BN is presently required to remove the clamp within five days of its application to the rail. If the internal defect has not been removed in that time, bolted joint bars have to be applied. In its petition, BN also requests that the five day period be increased to twenty days.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FRA is seeking information and comments from all interested parties and are invited to participate in this proceeding through written submissions.

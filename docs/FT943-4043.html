			<p>940910 FT  10 SEP 94 / Fashion: The long, hard road to a couturier's heart - It's tough if you are a textile artist Textile artists are the unsung heroes of fashion - vital to the finished product, yet often unknown and unacknowledged. One has only to remember Paul Poiret's orientalism, for instance, which owed much to Raoul Duffy's painterly depictions of the Levant on cloth, and Keith Haring's graffiti, lifted straight from a Bronx subway which lent street credibility to Vivienne Westwood's sportswear. But for the would-be supplier of textiles to the Parisian fashion houses the road is long and hard. The back door of most Parisian couture houses is fiercely guarded by a manutentionaire or storekeeper, typically a woman with a Napoleon complex who will fob off any hopeful talent with a sharp, 'We have our suppliers.' If you do not happen to be French the rebuff will be even more crushing. In the 1960s, when the Azzarios, textile suppliers from Italy, approached the couture houses, they sensibly hid their origins behind the name 'Nattier', taken from the French painter whose favourite blue was a mainstay in their collection. They introduced their cardboard-stiff triple gabardine to Courreges, enabling him to carve his board-flat, space-age tunics. Without this French pseudonym, Courreges would probably never even have looked at their new fabric. Zika Ascher, a Czechoslovakian Jew who mixed mohair with nylon to give it stability and create new textural possibilities, became so desperate that he introduced himself to the world of couture by pushing fabric samples through the open window of Christian Dior's car. Sabina Fay Braxton, a 30-year-old Englishwoman, is the couture world's latest textile darling, but it took her three years to wheedle her way in. Her 'vintage' effects on modern fabrics, be it medieval alto-basso (varyingly cut) velvets, early 18th century Venetian and Lyon 'Bazaar' prints, or a pastiche of a Gericault equestrian scene, have been seized on by couturiers because of their passing resemblance to rich embroideries, at a third of the price. Braxton grew up in the Middle and Far East. Her mother was a painter and her father a writer and collector of ethnic costumes. She studied film and costume design in Nice and, while helping to restore a medieval hunting lodge in the south of France and the Provencal house of a Renaissance and Baroque art collector, she created mock-period fabrics for both. In 1990 she began supplying Christian Lacroix and, later, Emanuel Ungaro, Olivier Lapidus, Louis Feraud and Chanel in Paris, and Bill Blass in New York with her shimmeringly ornate renditions of historical fabrics. Indeed, she almost single-handedly diverted Ungaro from splashy, bright, geometric prints to muted and layered chiffons and velvets which evoke the Levantine concubines in Tales of Hoffman. Her signature is gaufrage or embossed velvets. The deep pile is stamped under heat with carved wooden blocks, invariably with silver or gold-leaf or bronze filings to accentuate the motif. The result is embellished with paint to give it the appearance of a splinter-cracked fresco that has been scattered with moondust. Christian Lacroix spotted Braxton's patinated velvets in Verseta, an interior design shop in Paris, and saw their potential at once. But Braxton had never intended to work in high fashion: 'I never thought there would be any money in it, for some of my fabrics cost up to FFr4,000 (about Pounds 480) a metre and much more for a one-off piece which is more like a painting.' However, it was too good a chance to miss. Together with Lesage, the master embroiderer, Lacroix and Braxton collaborated to create the most successful jacket of his spring and summer 1991 couture collection: a Chinese-yellow velvet embossed with a silver-leaf motif made up of griffins and gazelles, Byzantine squares, ultra-modern cubist flowers and a Moorish tile pattern. One would imagine that her path into haute couture was then assured but, in spite of congratulatory telephone calls from Lesage, the manutentionaires at Jean-Louis Scherrer were as obstinate as ever. 'They don't want to see anyone new . . . they wield a weird sort of power and if you can't get passed them you're sunk.' But Braxton persisted and was eventually granted an audience. Scherrer ordered immediately. Many couturiers live rather like renaissance princes, isolated from daily trivialities. A couturier's brief is passed down the line, like a Chinese whisper, from maestro to studio director to supplier, so it is not surprising that the end result is either vague, or distorted. At Ungaro, Braxton's brief was that the couturier was interested in 'patterns like a Persian miniature with striped borders'. That was it. No colour, motif, size or fabric instructions. And all to be delivered in 24 hours. 'Fortunately, I was very familiar with these miniatures from my childhood, so I went ahead,' she recounts. The studio is based in a quiet side street of the 14th arrondissement where, surrounded by paint pots, carved blocks and art books, Braxton conjures new processes. Her latest inventions are photo-printed suedes and fake furs embossed with tracery. Some of her specialist pieces can take as many as 120 hours a metre to create. What is maddening is that couture studios may prevaricate for weeks, holding on to a precious sample and then at the last minute rejecting it or, worse, ordering several metres for a couture show in a few days' time. To survive as a handmaid to French couture it pays to be unflappable and to require just snatches of sleep. Her insight into couture has led her to question its time-consuming methods: often the same effect could also be achieved by printing or using a machine, but the kudos of 'hand-made' means they often insist on unnecessary and expensive handwork. Braxton has used her partnership with couture as a means of promoting her own range of accessory clothing to be launched in September. It will be sold in department stores and boutiques in London and New York. It includes scarves, stoles, waistcoats, body suits and loose tunics and pants for women, and waistcoats, ties, scarves and handkerchiefs for men. She will also offer a small range of embossed leather accessories. Prices start at Pounds 20. They will be on sale in Harrods of Knightsbridge, London SW1 in time for Christmas and in the US at Barneys, Bergdoff Goodman, Neiman Marcus and I. Magnin.

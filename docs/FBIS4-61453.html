			<p>BFN     [Text] The state of emergency declared in Kazakhstan's  capital Almaty on April 29 due to the shortage of fuel was  lifted on 4 May. As the Deputy Mayor Yakov Zayts, who leads a  commission on emergencies, has told INTERFAX, there was fuel  rationing in the city on 29 April for all enterprises and  organizations not involved in vital urban services.    In his words, the city's administration were forced to take  extreme measures because of poor oil supply, slashed because of  the consumer debt. He reported that the debts had been  partially repaid at the expense of credits. According to his  information, a number of state oil refineries have already sent  about 3000 tonnes of gasoline to Almaty. He noted that "a small  fuel reserve" has been created in the city, and "the situation  is returning to normal."</p>

			<p>931231 FT  31 DEC 93 / Tough talks bring deal on trade within sight: Monetary policy remains stumbling block Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are close to finalising a free-trade agreement which will determine economic relations once Israel and the PLO conclude an agreement on the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza-Jericho. Both sides know the broader regional peace agreement - the subject of delicate negotiations in Cairo - will fail unless Palestinians, who have one-fifth the average income of Israelis, see dramatic economic improvements in the first few months after the troop withdrawal, due to be completed by April 13. Talks in Paris on economic issues have been tough but agreement in principle has been reached in most areas, including taxation, labour and trade. Monetary policy remains the biggest obstacle to a protocol, with the Palestinians demanding the right to establish a central bank and to issue their own currency. The main achievement in the Paris talks has been agreement on free movement of goods and services under one customs policy, with substantial exceptions to meet the special needs of the Palestinian economy. These exceptions have still to be negotiated but Israel has already conceded that Palestinians will be able to import vehicles at their own tariff rates. Other goods the Palestinians want to import at lower duties, such as construction materials, offer greater hurdles but Israeli officials say they are prepared to make concessions. The Palestinians will also have some exceptions from the joint customs policy to allow for imports from Jordan. In agriculture, Israel has agreed to end a ban on the importation of Palestinian agricultural produce which has been in force since 1967. As soon as the Palestinians take control of Gaza-Jericho, agricultural products - excluding poultry, eggs, tomatoes, cucumbers and potatoes - will be allowed free export to Israel. The excluded products will be subject to a quota system, with the quotas increased progressively over four years and phased out in year five. Israeli farmers, who have enjoyed years of protection, have already protested against this step. On taxation, the two sides have agreed to differing rates of income tax. Palestinians working in Israel will pay tax to the Israeli treasury while Israelis working in the territories will pay the Palestinian treasury. Both sides have agreed to levy value added tax but have still to work out how to meet Palestinian demands for a lower rate than that of Israel. On monetary policy, however, the two sides remain deeply divided. The Palestinians want the right to issue a currency with no limits on when the Palestinian pound would be minted. The Palestinians accept that the Israeli shekel and the Jordanian dinar will be legal tender in the short-term but want the right to print their own money. Israel believes this is not feasible and are hoping for what one official described as 'the Scotland model', with the Bank of Israel retaining control over the printing of money but minting a separate design for Palestinians. An Israeli official admitted the dispute would have to be resolved at a political level. Both sides hope they can reach an economic agreement by the end of January, although recent complications cast a shadow over the entire negotiating process. However, if all issues are agreed, the economic accord should cover Gaza-Jericho from April 13. Israeli officials said the deal would also apply to the rest of the West Bank, with minor exceptions, after the Palestinian elections due to be held in July.</p>

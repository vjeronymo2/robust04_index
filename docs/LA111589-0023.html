			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SILBERMAN CASE LEGAL JOCKEYING FOCUSES ON TAPS OF PETTI'S CALLS;  </P> <P> HEARING: DESPITE 15 YEARS OF FBI SURVEILLANCE, DEFENSE WILL BE GIVEN  TRANSCRIPTS OF ONLY 2 CONVERSATIONS.  </P> <P> The FBI has been wiretapping reputed San Diego mobster Chris Petti for 15  years, but only two conversations from that long history of electronic  surveillance will be turned over to defense attorneys representing Petti,  Richard T. Silberman and three other men accused in a complex money-laundering  case, a federal prosecutor said Tuesday.  </P> <P> And, although assistant U. S. Atty. Charles F. Gorder Jr. continues to maintain  that he will not call mobster-turned-informant Robert Benjamin to the stand  when the case goes to trial in April, defense attorneys insisted that they be  allowed to hear and challenge his testimony in court.  </P> <P> "I have the right to subpoena him," said Oscar Goodman, a Las Vegas attorney  representing Petti. "I want him in there so the jury can see what they're  dealing with, so the jury can see how this guy is not the paragon of truth."  </P> <P> Petti and Silberman, a San Diego businessman with ties to state Democratic  Party officials, along with three others were charged earlier this year in U.  S. District Court with carrying out an elaborate money-laundering scheme.  </P> <P> According to the government, Silberman, with the aid of Petti, attempted to  launder money he believed was proceeds from illegal Colombian drug sales, but  in reality was money from an undercover FBI agent.  </P> <P> In a status hearing Tuesday morning on the case, Judge J. Lawrence Irving  indicated he was reluctant to grant requests for delays in the case. He said he  hoped to have pretrial motions argued in January and the matter before a jury  in April.  </P> <P> Also at the hearing, Gorder acknowledged the federal government's longstanding  interest in Petti, once considered heir-apparent to Frank (the Bomp)  Bompensiero, a notorious San Diego underworld figure who was gunned down in  1977 in an alley in Pacific Beach.  </P> <P> In describing the FBI's wiretapping efforts against Petti, Gorder said there  are "a number of other applications and orders, primarily from other (federal  judicial) districts, authorizing electronic surveillance from 1974 through  1988."  </P> <P> He said those wiretaps are in addition to the roving wiretap used by the  government in making the money-laundering case against Petti, Silberman and the  other defendants. He said some of the taps covering the 15 years involved  criminal cases that are now closed, and only two of the overheard conversations  have any bearing in the money-laundering trial.  </P> <P> Gorder declined to identify the nature of those conversations, other than to  say that one occurred in Las Vegas and the other in Los Angeles. He agreed to  arrange for transcripts of both conversations to be turned over to defense  attorneys.  </P> <P> Goodman, however, said the Las Vegas conversation involved Petti and James  Skountzos, also known as Jimmy Skountz, whom FBI surveillance reports describe  as "a person known to be a convicted felon with a history of involvement in  robbery."  </P> <P> And he said the Los Angeles conversation was between Petti and Carmen DiNunzio,  an alleged mob strongman based in the Los Angeles area.  </P> <P> Goodman declined to discuss the nature of those conversations, and he  downplayed the significance of any information taken from the wiretaps.  </P> <P> He also strongly chastised the government for subjecting Petti to such a  lengthy period of electronic eavesdropping. He said he wanted transcripts of  all of the tapes, which he said was "way in excess of 10 tapes, even more than  30 or 40," to see if any of them were improperly ordered or conducted illegally  and therefore "tainted."  </P> <P> He said it is possible that, if these earlier tapes were conducted improperly,  the roving wiretap also might have been done incorrectly, or at the least the  information obtained for the indictment was gathered illegally.  </P> <P> He said the FBI often harasses targets of their investigations. He said a  former client of his, Anthony (Tony the Ant) Spilotro, was once the subject of  1,143 wiretaps obtained in just one year. Spilotro was reportedly the Chicago  mob's overseer in Las Vegas and a close associate of Petti; his body was found  in an Indiana farm field.  </P> <P> Silberman's attorney, James J. Brosnahan of San Francisco, did not attend  Tuesday's hearing. But, in a letter to Irving on behalf of all the defense  attorneys, Brosnahan echoed Goodman's concerns that Benjamin be compelled to  testify.  </P> <P> Benjamin, a Petti associate, was enlisted by the FBI to put Petti in touch with  the undercover agent posing as the money launderer. According to the  prosecutors, Petti in turn put the undercover agent in touch with Silberman.  </P> <P> Brosnahan, in his letter to the judge, said he wants the government to turn  over Benjamin's "conviction record and evidence of any criminal offenses that  he is known or believed by the government to have committed since he became a  government informant in 1977."  </P> <P> The letter also asks how much government money Benjamin was paid to work on the  case and whether he was involved in any other criminal investigation at the  time he was working for the FBI on the Petti-Silberman case.  </P> <P> Benjamin, the letter said, "is responsible for the government's decision to  target" the defendants. Background information about him "is critical to the  defense, whether or not Mr. Benjamin is called as a witness," the letter said.  </P> <P> "The nature and extent of Mr. Benjamin's criminal activity will bear, for  example, on the credibility of the information used to obtain the various  search warrants and wiretap authorization orders," the letter added, "and on  the materiality of omissions in the affidavits concerning Mr. Benjamin's  reliability."  </P> <P> Since the indictments were returned in April, Benjamin has been moved to an  undisclosed location under federal protective custody.  </P></p>

			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Bulldog Edition  </P> <P> PHOENIX GUARD HORNACEK PROVING A POINT  </P> <P> Phoenix Sun guard Jeff Hornacek admits, "Nothing's really been easy for me my  whole basketball career."  </P> <P> Sure, the points always seem to show up; his 17.9 average is third-best on the  Suns. And the assists are there; he's the all-time leader at Iowa State. Even  though he's a relatively small guard, the rebounds have been there, too; he's  averaging 4.7. "Not bad for a non-jumping, 6-3 white guy," Hornacek cracks.  </P> <P> But getting a chance to put up such numbers has been the hard part.  </P> <P> As a high school senior in LaGrange, Ill., Hornacek averaged 20 points on a  team that won regional and sectional titles. Yet few colleges sought him.  </P> <P> He wound up at Iowa State in 1981 as a walk-on. Playing small forward for Coach  Johnny Orr, Hornacek redshirted his first year. The following season, he was  awarded a scholarship and played five to six minutes a game as a backup  forward.  </P> <P> "Then Coach Orr asked me if I could play point guard," Hornacek said, "and I  told him I played it my first two years in high school."  </P> <P> Hornacek then started turning heads with his assists and scoring. And he was  always working hard.  </P> <P> "He was an unselfish, hard worker," Orr said. "A great shooter, a hell of a  rebounder, and instincts, boy, did he have instincts for the game. He was a  leader."  </P> <P> Then came time for the pros. Again, few teams were interested.  </P> <P> "I never thought about playing in the NBA," Hornacek said, "or let's say it  wasn't something I was counting on. It really came down to a predraft camp in  Chicago. I had a pretty good camp, and that is where the Suns saw me."  </P> <P> The Suns took Hornacek in the second round of the 1986 draft. Generally, 50  percent of second-round picks don't make their team. But as a backup point  guard to Jay Humphries, Hornacek averaged 20 minutes a game his rookie year,  much of that in the fourth quarter.  </P> <P> "I was pretty proud of the fact I played a lot in the fourth quarter," Hornacek  said. "I equated that as they had a lot of confidence in me to be out there at  that time."  </P> <P> Hornacek averaged 4.5 assists and 5.3 points as a rookie. His second year was  even more encouraging. Still a backup, he averaged 27 minutes, 6.6 assists and  9.5 points.  </P> <P> Then came the drug scandal that plagued the Suns in 1987-88 and triggered a  personnel shake-up. In February 1988, Cotton Fitzsimmons, then director of  player personnel and now the coach, got rid of Walter Davis, Larry Nance, James  Edwards and Humphries, four-fifths of the starting lineup. Fitzsimmons  seemingly was trying to wipe out the drug image being tagged on the Suns.  </P> <P> But Hornacek stayed. "Jeff was the only guy I thought had the character and  characteristics it takes to have a good team," Fitzsimmons said.  </P> <P> By the end of the season, the starting lineup was Hornacek and Kevin Johnson at  guard, Mark West at center and Eddie Johnson and Armon Gilliam at forward.  </P> <P> "When they traded Jay, I thought I would move into the starting point guard  spot," Hornacek said. "I had never seen Kevin play, but I knew he was good.  Cotton told me Kevin was going to be the point guard because he was more of a  penetrater. Well, that was fine because I was starting at the other guard. But  I thought at least they should make him come in here and earn the point guard.  They just gave it to him. I guess they knew what they were doing."  </P> <P> But despite a good working relationship with Kevin Johnson and a better scoring  average, Hornacek was on the bench when the 1988-89 season began. The Suns  started 6-6 Dan Majerle, their top draft pick, as the No. 2 guard. But after  only two games, both losses, Hornacek was back as a starter and increased his  scoring average to 13.5.  </P> <P> Guess what? Majerle again started this season as the No. 2 guard. But it didn't  last long. Hornacek moved back into the starting lineup, and when Eddie Johnson  was injured, he was asked to take up some of the scoring slack. Hornacek has  responded and is sixth in field-goal percentage in the league.  </P> <P> Once more, it seems as though Hornacek has established himself. But for how  long?  </P> <P> "It's a little frustrating," Hornacek said. "You think you proved something the  year before, and then you just about have to start over again. But like I said,  nothing's really been easy for me in my basketball career. I've had to earn  making teams, earn playing time. It's not that big of a deal, though, as I  don't mind working hard."  </P></p>

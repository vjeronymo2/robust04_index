Velliste suggested  that the deadlock on the border issue could be broken by moving  that aspect of the Estonian-Russian negotiations into the  framework of the European Stability Pact (Balladur Plan).    Velliste and Eino Tamm, both members of the Estonian  Riigikogu's [parliament] Foreign Affairs Committee, are in  Moscow at the invitation of the Russian Parliament's foreign  relations committees to discuss the historic, legal, economic,  social and other aspects of the Estonian-Russian border and  border areas. Also participating in the debate were many  Russian officials and representatives from oblasts and districts  on the Estonian and Latvian borders. Among those speaking were  Russian hard-liners from Narva, Vladimir Malkovski and Juri  Mishin, former Interfront leader in Estonia, Yevgeni Kogan, and  others.    The Russian officials and other representatives urged the  Russian parliament to support unilateral demarcation by Russia  of the current control line (essentially the same as the  Estonian SSR-Russian border). Sections of Estonia in the  southeastern corner of the country as well as territories east  of Narva were illegally incorporated into the Russian SFSR by  Stalin in 1944. Estonia is bound by its constitution to  maintain the borders as set in 1920 by the Tartu Peace Treaty.    The Estonian and Russian parliamentarians agreed to continue  contacts between the foreign relations committees.</p>

			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / Up to 25% of shops robbed in past year A QUARTER of shops in some parts of London have been victims of a robbery or attempted robbery in the past year, according to a report published yesterday by the Police Foundation, the independent research organisation. The report, in conjunction with the University of Sheffield, highlights crime affecting retailers. Mr Stanley Kalms, chairman of electrical retailer Dixons, warned in June that shops were being forced to adopt 'vigilante tactics' on crime, which was costing Dixons alone Pounds 20m a year. The report says a quarter of London shopkeepers and 17 per cent in the Midlands had experienced a robbery or attempted robbery with a knife, gun or imitation gun in the last year. The report also highlights a lack of contact between the police and some victims. Although offences such as robbery were normally reported to the police, shopkeepers in the Midlands said they rarely had any other contact with their local police and many had negative views of policing. Mr James May, director-general of the British Retail Consortium, said the report reinforced the consortium's own findings. He said a nationwide sample of 4,000 retailers with fewer than 50 staff found 1,317 incidents of serious violence reported last year. Violent Crime In Small Shops.

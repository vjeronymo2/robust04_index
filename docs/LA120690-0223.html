			<p><P> December 6, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAN TO STAND TRIAL OVER WIFE'S SLAYING  </P> <P> A La Canada Flintridge man who may have unwittingly given police the key to his  own arrest has been ordered to stand trial in Victorville Superior Court for  the murder of his wife.  </P> <P> A trial date is scheduled to be set on Dec. 13 for Donald Miralle, 46, who is  accused of strangling his wife, Tessie, 49, on Sept. 12, then dumping the body  in a remote desert region and setting it on fire.  </P> <P> San Bernardino County Municipal Judge John B. Gibson on Tuesday ordered Miralle  to stand trial for murder after a two-day preliminary hearing in Victorville.  The judge said the couple's history of marital problems and evidence found near  Tessie Miralle's body point to her husband as a prime suspect.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys for Miralle argued at the hearing that the evidence against  their client is flimsy and said they will appeal the judge's ruling to the  Superior Court within a few days.  </P> <P> Tessie Miralle was a prominent businesswoman in the affluent community and  active in charitable affairs. She disappeared Sept. 12 after she had gone to  her husband's civil engineering office in Altadena.  </P> <P> Her burning body was found Sept. 13 by a passing motorist in a remote area of  the high desert west of Victorville. However, San Bernardino County sheriff's  investigators said they had no clue to the identity of the body until Miralle  contacted county authorities Sept. 24 at the urging of a friend, who was  concerned about the missing woman and had heard about the discovery of a body  in the desert.  </P> <P> Miralle provided the county coroner with his wife's dental X-rays, which were  used to identify her charred body. He was arrested Oct. 3 after he attended his  wife's funeral with the couple's three teen-age children.  </P> <P> Evidence presented during the preliminary hearing indicated that the victim's  wrists had been bound with tape before she was choked to death with a cord or  rope. Investigators said they do not know where the murder occurred. The body  had been placed in a blue plastic trash barrel, doused with lighter fluid and  set afire with a long cannon fuse, experts testified.  </P> <P> Prosecutors presented evidence that Donald Miralle had purchased 100 feet of  cannon fuse from a mail-order military supply catalogue in 1988. Criminologists  also testified that tire tread marks and footprints found near the body matched  brands of tires and tennis shoes owned by Donald Miralle, although they could  not say the exact tires and shoes matched.  </P> <P> They alleged that Miralle traded the tires in on new ones with a Pasadena  dealer and disposed of the shoes, which police never found, shortly after the  murder. The tires have been recovered, but the shoes have not been found.  </P> <P> Defense attorneys A. Brent Carruth and Barry Post attempted to show that the  victim had made loans and sold jewelry and in doing this may have made enemies  with motives for killing her. They also challenged the evidence that  authorities said identifies the body as that of Tessie Miralle.  </P> <P> Although the judge said "there is precious little hard evidence in the case,"  he said the circumstantial evidence against Miralle is significant.  </P> <P> Witnesses testified that Miralle traded in the new tires on his Chevrolet  Suburban, got rid of tennis shoes that were only three months old and ordered  his wife's car telephone turned off before anyone knew about the murder.  </P> <P> An unidentified caller attempted to get the tires back from the tire dealer the  day after Miralle was questioned by deputies. Workers at the dealership said  the tires already had been picked up by police when they were contacted by the  caller.  </P> <P> Anita Miralle, 19, the couple's oldest daughter and a student at UC Santa  Barbara, testified during the hearing that her mother telephoned her during the  week of Sept. 10 and asked her to return home because of family problems.  </P> <P> Anita Miralle tearfully explained that her father, younger brother and sister  were at home when she arrived late on Sept. 12 but that her mother was missing.  She said she reported to police that her mother was missing the next day.  </P> <P> The oldest daughter also said her father told her several days later that he  had ordered her mother's mobile phone turned off. She said she called to have  the service restored, because she was concerned that her mother needed the  telephone.  </P> <P> Homicide investigators said the mobile telephone and other valuables were still  in Tessie Miralle's unlocked maroon Jaguar when it was found Sept. 26 parked  near Monrovia High School. The keys were in the ignition.  </P> <P> Sheriff's officials said Tessie Miralle hired a private investigator earlier  this year to determine if her husband was seeing another woman. No other woman  was identified during the hearing. However, prosecutors said letters allegedly  written by Tessie Miralle to her husband accused him of infidelity and  threatened a costly divorce and property settlement.  </P> <P> Anita Miralle and Donald Miralle Jr., 16, both testified that their parents had  argued for some time and said the parents told them they planned to divorce.  But all three of the children protested to deputies that their father was  innocent when he was arrested at their home in October.  </P> <P> Officials said Miralle posted $500,000 bail to return home to his children  during Thanksgiving. The two oldest children, who were called by prosecutors to  testify in Victorville, declined to be interviewed. They live with a  housekeeper, a cousin of Tessie Miralle, who also was a witness at the hearing.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Elwood of San Bernardino County on Tuesday told  the court that prosecutors have had trouble meeting with the Miralle children  since their father returned home. She asked that the court make special  arrangements for a meeting.  </P> <P> Gibson declined the request, however. "We are dealing with a situation here  where their mother is dead and their father is on trial for murder," he said.  Any further emotional stress on the children "is too much."  </P></p>

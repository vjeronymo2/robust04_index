			<p>920321 FT  21 MAR 92 / Bundesbank power shift a step closer A RESTRUCTURING of the German Bundesbank, to reduce the influence of the federal states in its ruling council, passed a key hurdle yesterday in the Bundestag. The lower house of the Germany parliament agreed to cut the number of separate 'state central banks' from 11 to nine, instead of raising the number to 16 to accommodate all the new states in the former East Germany. The move, backed by the government and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, is being pushed through in spite of opposition from most of the states. It is intended to prevent the German central bank from becoming unwieldy and from being dominated by potentially maverick state central bankers against the views of its full-time directors. In recent months state representatives have twice come into conflict with Mr Schlesinger and his full-time colleagues: in pushing through a half-point rise in interest rates when the Bundesbank president favoured a quarter-point; and in bringing reservations about European monetary union into the open. It now seems a deal will have to be negotiated in a conciliation committee between the Bundestag, in which the government has a majority, and the Bundesrat, which represents the 16 states, now with a Social Democrat majority.</p>

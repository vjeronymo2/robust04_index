			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article from Brussels EUROPE: "Ukraine: Kiev </F> Affirms That Some Countries Hope To Link Signing of EU/Ukraine  Agreement To NPT Membership"]    [Text] On the occasion of Sir Leon Brittan's visit, the  Ukrainian Foreign Minister Anatoly Zlenko reproached a number of  EU Member States with wanting to postpone signing of the  agreement between Ukraine and the EU until Kiev belongs to the  Non Proliferation Treaty [NPT]. "For the moment we are unable  to say exactly which countries are involved, but we reject such  an approach. We cannot accept such a link because Ukraine has  done everything to speed up joining NPT", he told a press  conference. Sir Leon Brittan said he was satisfied Ukraine was  proceeding with nuclear disarmament despite the Kiev  parliament's failure to join NPT.</p>

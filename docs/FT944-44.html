			<p>941231 FT  31 DEC 94 / Books: An Iliad for our age - War and Peace (Fact and fiction) / AN Wilson on the enduring impact and insights of Tolstoy's great novel The current pointless carnage in Chechnya, whose spirited Moslem mountaineers are so sympathetically evoked in Tolstoy's early stories, reminds us of the vast, peasant-simple questions which the greatest Russian literary giant of the 19th century poses in his writings. What causes war? The caprice of the gods, according to Homer. As Tolstoy so cogently insisted in the epilogues to War and Peace, once you have discarded this catch-all explanation, no post-Enlightenment theory of historical causation, no system of economics, no proto-fascist notion of heroes or the ambition of great men can fathom the mystery. Certainly, the impotence of peace initiatives at the moment in various parts of the world, the crass arrogance of foreign politicians thinking they can 'solve' the conflicts of Bosnians or Palestinians, sends us back to Tolstoy  -not so much the furious septuagenarian pacifist pamphleteer who wrote The Kingdom of God is Within You as the great novelist who at the height of his powers hacked five years out of a tempestuous life to write War and Peace. I never met anyone who had actually lived through a war who derived any comfort from reading historians or philosophers, but several ex-servicemen have told me that they read Tolstoy and Homer in the thick of battle - two comparable writers with similarly anti-rational views of what is taking place when the human race turns aside from its peaceful occasions - procreation, friendship, the manufacture of artifacts, the cultivation of crops - and devotes itself to wholesale murder. 'Why did millions of people kill one another', Tolstoy asks, 'when it has been known since the world began that it is physically and morally bad to do it? Because it was such an inevitable necessity that in doing it, men fulfilled the elemental zoological laws which bees fulfil when they kill one another in the autumn and which causes male animals to destroy one another. One can find no other reply to that terrible question'. When in the midst of war, the chief human concerns are practical: how to survive this night of shelling, or that month, that year, of life in a besieged town. Concepts of victory and glory might sound fine on the lips of demagogues, but when it is over, war can be seen to have created no more than the sum of thousands of individual torments and sorrows, and the best that can be said is that it is over. Prince Andrew's words after Austerlitz in War and Peace - 'We lost because we told ourselves we lost' - provide just one example among hundreds of what Tolstoy was up to in his masterpiece. We fail to understand what an act of artistic self-abnegation was involved by this most opinionated of writers unless we recognise the agenda of War and Peace, spelt out in the numerous asides, and in the epilogues, about the nature of history. Tolstoy is often accused of not understanding his own talents, or of wilfully destroying his own 'art'. It would be truer to see the historiographical asides and the formless gossipy flow of the book as all of a piece. He was attempting to provide a Homeric blankness; in the words of the John Cowper Powys, 'no philosophy - not even the philosophy of having no philosophy'. The formlessness, the cinematic details of War and Peace are what make us all remember this book as something almost more 'real' than our own lives - the excitement of Natasha at her first ball; the pride, turning to panic, of Nicholas Rostov when he first goes into battle; the drunkenness of Pierre at the debauch. Though Tolstoy was right, in a sense, to say that War and Peace was not a novel, he was able to use the unashamedly trivial conventions of fiction to illuminate, on every page, the significant mystery of human heings, by virtue of their moral responses to existence, transcending the impersonal forces which lead to cataclysms such as Austerlitz or Borodino or the burning of Moscow. 'There are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life which is the more free, the more abundant its interests, and his elemental swarm-life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down to him.' Unlike the great 19th century historical theorists - Carlyle or Hegel - Tolstoy deliberately cuts the 'great men' down to size. 'Power is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or tacit consent, to their chosen rulers'. It sounds almost Marxian, but, unlike Marx, Tolstoy does not believe that the inexorable march of events renders individual experience insignificant. In fact, the precise opposite. His Napoleon, therefore, has no more idea of what is going on at Borodino than the foot-soldier; but a common peasant taken prisoner by Napoleon alongside Pierre has a deeper understanding of life than any of Pierre's clever friends. Napoleon's belief in his own genius is ridiculed. The hideous war in which he and hundreds of thousands of others are caught up is portrayed as 'swarm-life'. The distinctive and significant life of a human being is found not in pretension to power but to an attentiveness to what eye and heart tell us. 'During the whole of that period, Napoleon, who seems to us to have been the leader of all those movements - as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel - acted like a child who holding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.' The book starts at a party. The war is a thing to be gossiped about amid the glitter of crystal wine glasses, the brightness of sashes, uniforms and gowns. We might be tempted to suppose that the 'real' story will only begin when we are introduced to the 'important' characters - the generals, the dictators, the emperors who believe themselves to be controlling events. We do not have to read far, however before we divine that no one is controlling events, that no character is more important than another and that the 'artlessness' of scene following scene is the whole point of the book. There is no immortal 'cloud-gatherer' plotting mortal destinies in this epic; God, if found, is 'within us'. An entirely Tolstoyan episode is the scene when Natasha Rostova goes to her mother's bedroom to chatter and giggle about the boys she is half in love with. It is the night before she goes to the ball where she is to meet, and fall seriously for, Prince Andrew. It is the tenderness of the exchange between the two women, and its humour which are so memorable - its conveyed sense of a happy family simply bubbling along. This is so much more successful than the frankly tedious moments when Pierre is thrashing out his ideas, and which oddly enough have so little to do with the main action. Tolstoy has a magnificent generosity as an artist in allowing characters simply to be themselves - and we see them in so many ordinary situations, playing cards, kissing a lover, hunting, borrowing money. This is where life  -life which raises us above the swarm - is experienced. This is 'peace'. In the decade after the book appeared, Tolstoy notoriously suffered an emotional collapse, followed by his 'conversion'. The latter half of his life was devoted to explicit exposition of his views - vegetarianism, anti-Shakespeareanism; sew-your-own-felt boots and passive resistance. In much of this urgently sincere attempt to discover the best way to live, there was heroism - not least when he risked his own liberty for defending eccentrics. But the pacifist tracts of these years are less powerful than the 'art' which he came to despise and which, in War and Peace, reaches a simplicity and gravitas unknown in Western literature outside the pages of The Iliad.</p>

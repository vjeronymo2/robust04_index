			<p>BFN     [Text] In an interview with MAINICHI SHIMBUN and other  media on 30 April, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai  commented on how Japan will deal with a possible UN decision to  impose economic sanctions over the issue of the DPRK's (North  Korea) nuclear arms development, saying: "We will abide by a UN  decision because Japan is a member nation. At the same time,  however, we have no choice but to act within the scope of the  Constitution." However, he avoided to comment on the issue of  the Self-Defense Forces' support activities, such as providing  supplies to the U.S. military's naval blockade, saying: "Since  I am a member of the government, I have to be careful about this  issue." On the government's policy that use of the right of  collective self-defense is contrary to the Constitution, Kumagai  said that "there is no need to change the interpretation of  previous administrations."    Moreover, on the coalition's policy to do its best to enact  a  rezoning bill for the single-seat and proportionate  representation system by having discussions during the current  Diet session, Kumagai said: "We quite agree with this idea."  He stressed that the bill should be approved even if the  government has to extend the Diet session.</p>

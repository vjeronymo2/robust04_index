			<p>920625 FT  25 JUN 92 / Israel Under Labour: Unlikely hero gave Labour its triumph THE resounding general election victory by the Labour party is more than anything a remarkable endorsement by Israelis of the leadership of a man who first became prime minister 18 years ago and who has never displayed the qualities of a natural politician. It was the enduring popularity of Mr Yitzhak Rabin that carried Labour to its triumph, overturning the long domination by the right-wing Likud party that began shortly after Mr Rabin was forced to step down as Labour leader in 1977 amid a scandal over his wife's illegal foreign bank accounts. Once he had at last unseated his successor Mr Shimon Peres in a party leadership ballot in February, Mr Rabin set about beating the Likud with a highly personalised campaign which played heavily on his record as a tough general and defence minister. The message was that voters fed up with Likud's poor performance in office could support Labour's more conciliatory stance on the Middle East peace process without worrying that the government would be 'soft' on security issues. Mr Rabin is an unlikely figurehead. At 70, his famous growling voice is prone to crack into a smoker's cough. His rhetoric is stolid, not inspiring. He appears flushed and weary and does not readily break into a smile. During the campaign, Likud tried to damage him by reviving stories of the breakdown he suffered as chief of staff on the eve of the 1967 Six Day War - he says it was exhaustion - and his reputation as a heavy drinker. These attacks apparently made no impact on Mr Rabin's electability - his most precious quality for Labour which had suffered four election failures under Mr Peres. But, judging by his rather frail appearance, there may well be a legitimate question mark over Mr Rabin's physical resilience. For now, however, the chief issue is how different his policies will be from those of the Likud which refused to give up any of the occupied territories in peace negotiations. Mr Rabin, born in Jerusalem under the British Mandate when only 150,000 Jews lived in all of what is now Israel, is committed to sustaining 'the Jewish State' - that is, an Israel in which Jews form the overwhelming majority. It is for this reason above all others that he is prepared to give up those parts of the occupied West Bank and Gaza most heavily populated by Arabs. 'I have never believed that by swallowing over 1.5m Palestinians of the territories Israel will be able to be a Jewish democratic state. It would become a bi-national state. That is not the way I interpret the Zionist dream and the dream of generations of Jews about the return to Zion.' However, he warns there is no 'short cut to peace', and that it has to be achieved without compromising Israel's security.  --------------------- SEATS IN KNESSET  --------------------- Labour              45 Meretz              12 Likud               32 Far right            9 Religious parties   17 Arab parties         5  --------------------- Total              120  ---------------------</p>

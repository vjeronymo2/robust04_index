			<p>940929 FT  29 SEP 94 / 'We have lost people to coaches and the airlines' Britain's fledgling privatised railway industry has spent more than half its young life under siege. The agreement reached in the early hours of yesterday morning between the RMT transport union and Railtrack heralds an end to hostilities - but raises serious questions about the long-term future of the network. British Rail handed over formal responsibility for its trains, track and stations to more than 50 semi-independent subsidiaries on April 1. The expectation was that managers could begin preparing their businesses to move into the private sector but two and a half months into this process the signalling staff began strike action. The train operating companies saw their plans to improve the operation of trains and the marketing of their services thrown into disarray. Their collective losses rose to Pounds 200m and a nonsense was made of their accounts, which were crucial if investors were to be found to back these companies. Railtrack, facing a strike bill of Pounds 100m, has been forced to cut back on maintenance and divert management time from planning ambitious projects such as the modernisation of the West Coast main line between London and Glasgow. And just when the expansion of high-speed train services around the world seemed to herald a new era for rail travel, Britain's railways seemed mired in a 1970s-style dispute. Passengers and freight customers were forced to shift to other means of transport. 'There are no two ways about it. The strike has caused us damage and we have lost people to the coaches and the airlines,' commented a spokesman for one of the train operating companies, South West Trains. 'The dispute has had a corrosive effect on the services we offer,' said an official of the East Coast main line, which runs from London to Edinburgh. 'Instead of growing the business over the next two years we will spend time getting back to where we were.' Investors who were considering backing management buy-outs have been forced to reconsider the proposition. 'On the minus side the dispute will mean it will take the train operators longer to demonstrate they have established a sustainable financial record,' said Mr Roger Brooke, chairman of Candover, a buy-out specialist. It will also raise fears in the minds of investors about the possibility of another strike in one small part of the railway empire damaging the other parts, he noted. It will certainly endanger the very tight privatisation timetable which aims to get half of railway services into the private sector by April 1996 - before the next general election begins to complicate the issue. Many Tory MPs would be reluctant to push through privatisation in the months ahead of a general election while a victory for the Labour party could stall the whole process. In spite of all the problems which remain to be overcome, there is some cause for optimism in both the timing of the strike and its conclusion. Coming almost at the beginning of the privatisation process, the dispute has raised - and hopefully resolved - the question of restructuring working practices before investors had made any serious commitment to the railway. 'It's a bit early in the process for fund managers to start looking at investing in the railway,' commented one analyst. It will be next April before the train-operating companies produce their first annual set of figures. By agreeing a more sensible set of working arrangements with the signal workers now, Railtrack should be able to reduce its costs. No other group of workers will have quite the power of the signal workers to shut down the entire network in future. Drivers will be employed by individual train operating companies while maintenance and modernisation work will increasingly be carried out by private-sector companies. Some train operators point to their success in maintaining services as proof of the robustness of their businesses. 'We have seen how our business can stand up to this sort of disruption,' said Mr Rob Mason, managing director of Gatwick Express. Some passengers have deserted to coaches and airlines while freight operators have shifted some consignments to road. But the convenience of rail means most will return, the operators believe. The end to the strike will mark the start of some tough negotiations over compensation to the train operators and to freight customers. It will also focus attention on the rail industry's plans to put in place a risk-sharing scheme to spread the cost of strikes and other calamities.</p>

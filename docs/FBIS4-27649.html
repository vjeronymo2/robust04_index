			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Rufina B. Alcanzo] </F>   [Text] The country's outstanding foreign debt as of  December last year reached $34.282 billion, up 10.82 percent  from the $30.934 billion recorded during the corresponding  period in 1992.    On a monthly basis, this represented a slight 1.47 percent  increment from $33.787 billion in November last year.    Official records from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)  [Central Bank of the Philippines] show 85.31 percent of total  foreign debt were classified as medium-and long-term  obligations, which rose 14 percent from $25.678 billion in the  same period in 1992.    On the other hand, short-term loans comprised the remaining  14.69 percent, which amounted to $5.035 billion.    By types of borrower, the public sector received the biggest  chunk of foreign loans. This was placed at $27.177 billion,  taking in a 79.28 percent share of aggregate loans.    The private sector was granted $5.817 billion, allotted  between corporate and financial firms. Corporate firms received  a bigger share of $5.296 billion while financial firms cornered  the rest.    Meanwhile, the BSP got a measly 3.76 percent or $1.288  billion of total borrowings.  <H5>  BILATERAL CREDITORS </H5>   Bilateral creditors extended the biggest amount, which stood  at $13.369 billion or 39 percent of total loans. This  represented an 18 percent hike from the $11.328 billion lendings  in the comparable period in 1992. All loans granted by  bilateral creditors have beyond one year maturity.    Among bilateral creditors, the country remains to be heavily  indebted to Japan which granted medium-and long-term loans  amounting to $7.577 billion. The United States came in next  providing $684 million while Germany lent out $489 million as of  the period in review.    Roughly 23 percent of aggregate foreign exchange liabilities  were extended by multilateral creditors. As in the preceding  months, the World Bank's International Bank for Reconstruction  and Development furnished the largest amount at $3.936 billion.  It was followed by the Asian Development Bank and the  International Monetary Fund, which shelled out $2.3 billion and  $1.312 billion, respectively.  <H5>  WORLD BANK </H5>   In a related development, the World Bank has lined up 12  more  projects for the next three years. These projects offer an  aggregate financing cost of $2.585 billion which is $853 million  more than the "shopping list" presented by the Philippine  Government.    These include agriculture support services, power  transmission, and AIDS emergency projects which are all set for  next year. For 1996, the following will be eyed: Central  Visayas regional project; and power distribution, capital market  development and urban water supply projects.    Meanwhile, by the year 1997, rural regional development,  private investment credit, water distribution, urban sanitation  and provincial road projects are expected to be put up.    It may be recalled a few weeks earlier, Senator Blas Ople  urged the National Economic and Development Authority to  undertake a full accounting of foreign loans that flow into  16,000 nongovernment organizations (NGOs) amid reports that  human rights groups in Europe have been subsidizing communist  insurgency in the country. He advocated the use of caution in  giving direct aid to local NGOs.</p>

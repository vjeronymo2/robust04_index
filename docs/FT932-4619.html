			<p>930608 FT  08 JUN 93 / Survey of Aerospace (2): Upturn is still awaited - Paul Betts on the prospects for commercial aircraft manufacturers COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT manufacturers around the world have been scrambling to cut production and employment so as to adapt to the siege-like conditions facing the industry. Boeing, the world's biggest manufacturer of commercial jets with about 60 per cent of the world market, is reducing overall production by 35 per cent. It announced this year it would cut 28,000 jobs over the next 18 months. McDonnell Douglas, now trailing behind the European Airbus consortium as the world's third commercial aircraft maker, is reducing its workforce by 10 per cent this year after cutting it by 20 per cent last year. By the end of 1993, the group's overall employment will have dropped from 121,000 in 1990 to about 78,000. All four Airbus partners - Aerospatiale of France, Deutsche Aerospace, British Aerospace and Casa of Spain - have had to scale down output to match the slowdown in the European group's expected deliveries of new aircraft during the next three years. Mr Jean Pierson, the Airbus managing director, says the consortium's production is now expected to grow from about 150 aircraft this year to about 170 in 1995, compared with an original target of 225 in 1995. The industry's cyclical downturn has been longer and fiercer than previous ones. Since the advent of the jet age, the world travel industry has suffered three major slumps which were followed by sharp recoveries. But the situation is different this time because the slump has coincided with a decline in the defence side of the aerospace business, which helped sustain manufacturers during the previous cyclical downturns. Although all three big manufacturers remain confident about long-term prospects for the industry, they are uncertain when the market will finally pick up. Most conservative estimates expect the upturn to occur around 1994 or 1995. Recovery is likely to be more gradual and less vigorous than in previous cycles. Airlines, which have made a cumulative loss of more than Dollars 10bn on international scheduled services over the past three years, are continuing to defer and cancel new aircraft orders booked during the buying spree of the late 1980s. Boeing now concedes in the 1993 edition of its annual industry market outlook that 'it was evident that airlines and leasing companies were ordering more aircraft than was necessary to meet demand,' and that the manufacturers in turn increased production to meet this demand. In 1989 alone, at the height of the order boom, a total of Dollars 90bn worth of new jet orders was booked by the manufacturers. Bookings last year fell to Dollars 29.9bn in reaction to overcapacity, difficulties in financing, slow traffic growth and monumental airline losses. Although cancellations and order deferrals will eventually slow down as the balance between capacity and demand improves, a significant problem will be financing. 'The airline industry is plagued by growing financial difficulties,' acknowledges Airbus in its 1993 market study. 'Current financial difficulties mean that many airlines are unable to raise funds to replace ageing fleets,' it adds. The replacement of older aircraft together with air travel growth are the two main components for aircraft demand. Airbus expects some 2,100 narrowbody jets and 500 widebody airliners to be retired over the next five years to make way for some 3,300 new aircraft. Boeing for its part estimates that of the 12,005 aircraft to be delivered between now and 2010, 25 per cent will be to replace older jets. So far, however, the rate of retirements has been much slower than the manufacturers had expected. Airlines have delayed ordering new equipment in the face of dire financial difficulties. New sources of financing will also have to be found to support the Dollars 815bn that Boeing believes airlines will need to invest in new aircraft over the next 18 years to meet traffic growth and their fleet renewal needs. In spite of the cost reduction and restructuring programmes launched by airlines during the latest recession, all are finding it hard to make any adequate return. One reason is the continuing decline in real terms of their revenue yields and margins are expected to remain under pressure even when stronger recovery finally occurs. In contrast, new aircraft prices have been constant or increasing in real terms. 'A quantum reduction in aircraft price through production cost improvements is necessary for the financial health of both the airline industry and the manufacturing industry,' British Airways, one of the few large profitable carriers, recently warned. Around the world more than 700 aircraft, which could be used, are grounded or for sale. While both the airline and aircraft manufacturing industries are near the trough of their economic cycle, BA says: 'Unless there is an early resumption of long-term growth, together with new aircraft prices that airlines can afford, current orders could be further threatened with implications for the whole supply chain.' Manufacturers have responded by introducing greater automation in design, manufacturing and assembly processes to improved dramatically productivity. But this has not been sufficient to offset the ever-increasing costs of new product development. Non-recurring research and development costs have been growing far more rapidly than inflation at a time when balance sheets have continued to be squeezed by the recession in the industry. At the same time, no manufacturer can clearly afford to risk abandoning or placing on ice future product development programmes if it wants to remain competitive in the longer term and take advantage of the eventual market recovery. This has pushed manufacturers towards increasing international co-operation and seeking risk-sharing partners for new project developments. Even Boeing, reluctant in the past to share its programmes, has been actively talking for the first time of forging equity links with other international partners. For Boeing the practice of contracting with global suppliers was at first small, but it has been steadily growing over the years. Its first 707 had almost no foreign content. The 727 had less than 1 per cent, the 737 slightly more. Collaboration with other partners expanded with the 767 when the Seattle manufacturer established risk-sharing agreements with Japanese manufacturers and the Italians. The Japanese subsequently took a 20 per cent risk-sharing stake in the 777, Boeing's big twin engine widebody programme, already at an advanced stage of development. McDonnell Douglas sees the solution of its problems in collaboration and global partnership. Mr John McDonnell, chairman of the US aerospace and defence group, wants to set up a new commercial aircraft company with a series of international equity partners prepared to invest in the development of new products. Mr McDonnell failed to clinch a partnership last year with Taiwan Aerospace, which was proposing to invest Dollars 2bn for a 49 per cent stake in the Douglas civil aircraft business based in Long Beach, California. But the US group says it is engaged in mature discussions with a number of potential partners, including several in the Asia-Pacific region. If successful, it would give McDonnell Douglas a similar risk sharing system operated by Boeing with the Japanese manufacturers and by the four European manufacturers in the Airbus consortium. 'Airbus has become a model for such ventures in the aerospace and other capital-intensive industries,' says Mr Pierson. In the span of 20 years, Airbus has developed a highly sophisticated system for the integration of complex industrial processes across Europe, created a network of co-operation between major European manufacturers, and set in motion an irreversible trend of trans-national co-operation in the industry. 'Investments in research and development, production and after-sales service for large civil aircraft were, are and probably will remain, simply enormous,' says Mr Pierson. 'A new aircraft programme today is in the Dollars 3-4bn bracket with a maximum risk of exposure close to Dollars 7-9bn. Such risks are simply too much for a single manufacturer to bear,' he explains. In the face of all these pressures, new realignments are starting to emerge which could lead to a profound transformation in the structure of the commercial aircraft industry over the next decade. The first eloquent signs that this is beginning to happen is the agreement at the end of January between Boeing and the four partners of Airbus, its main European rival, to study the joint development of a super jumbo capable of seating up to 800 passengers.</p>

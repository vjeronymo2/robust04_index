Not  only is the fact of inviting a professional economist "from  abroad" to take the post of premier interesting in itself, but  so is the possibility of verifying in practice the efficacy of  approaches to implementing reforms and overcoming the severest  economic crisis other than those applied in Russia.    Saburov's name first became widely known when in August 1991  he took up the post of deputy chairman of the RSFSR Council of  Ministers, and minister of the economy in I. Silayev's  government. He executed this role for just a few months,  however, and he was not invited to join the new Gaydar  "government of reforms."    Yevgeniy Fedorov is 48 years old. He was born in Yalta (his  mother still lives there). He graduated from the Faculty of  Mechanics and Mathematics of Moscow State University, gained a  profound knowledge of economics, and became the author of the  economic program "Twelve Steps From the Abyss." He is a man of  many interests, with a creative streak: He has published his  own play, and he is fascinated by philosophy, and theology....    He has been the director of the Center for Information and  Social Technologies under the Russian Government since January  1992. On becoming prime minister of the Crimean Government he  decided to remain simultaneously the center's scientific leader:  "The brain trust will help me resolve difficult problems...."    [Golovachev] Yevgeniy Fedorovich, to what extent has the  experience of Russian reforms fitted you for Crimea? How do  you, in general, evaluate what has happened in Russia in the  space of two years?    [Saburov] The situation in which the Russian economy now  finds itself is extremely complex. This, in my view, is the  consequence of major errors committed while implementing  reforms. What is most tiresome is that many errors could have  been avoided, as the government was warned about them in  advance; but, alas, the warnings were not heeded.    Take, for instance, the idea for the speedy integration of  our economy into the world market system. In the overall scheme  of things, this was an excellent, and right-minded idea -- there  is no argument about this. At the same time, however, it would  have been necessary to take account of the fact that our economy  is self-devouring, "inverted." The main economic "bricks" --  prices, profitability, profit -- are not compatible with the  world market. Because cheap raw materials, cheap transport, and  a completely different price structure lay at the basis of  accounting in our country. In Russia, whichever example you may  take -- a sofa, a door handle, a gadget of some description --  everything, by foreign standards, is loss-making, and elsewhere  they simply would not undertake to do this because, according to  that system of accounting and price structure, it is not  profitable.    Our reformers, of course, knew that the economy was  "distorted," but they did not understand the most important  thing: So monstrous is the extent of this distortion that no  monetarist methods, no financial manipulations will aid  "recovery" here. Yes, a rigid monetary and credit policy was  essential. But at the same time, institutional changes  concerning the infrastructure of the market, property, and so on  were also required. This sort of thing cannot be done in a  month, nor in three months. Without understanding all this,  they tried overnight, and without pause for thought, to combine  incompatible systems, and the result was the destruction of the  economy....    [Golovachev] Do you believe that there was an alternative  route to the market?    [Saburov] It is not just that I believe this, but economic  theory and the experience of other countries indicates this. To  be brief, it was necessary from the very outset to apply a  well-known tactic which is called "Go and Stop, Stop and Go."  That is, to go part of the way, stop, adjust, and then move on.    It is easy to see that we are talking about a gradual, more  harmonious restructuring of the economy. Take, for instance,  the fact that the correlation of prices has altered. The price  structure is, indeed, different, but it is still far from the  foreign mold. Now the economy must be given a chance to adapt  to these new prices, and specific structural changes in industry  must take place....    [Golovachev] This is all very well in theory. But what  about in practice? Prices were deregulated 2 January 1992, and  they took off [oni i poshli]. So what you are saying to them is  -- stop, take time to adapt, and then we will move further....    [Saburov] But why just talk when it is essential to act? It  is necessary to conduct reforms on the basis of a pact of  national accord. All social forces should agree on price  reform, and on the most important stages. A situation whereby  certain sectors, enjoying a monopoly position and the fact that  it is impossible to manage without their products, pump up  prices, profitability, and earnings for their workers while  other sectors end up in a state of collapse and impoverishment  -- this is not what it is about at all. To avoid this, it was  essential from the very outset to agree a restriction on the  transition period for income growth, a restriction on  profitability, and a number of other important things (including  the "currency anchor," that is, smoothing out the fluctuations  in the ruble rate against the dollar).    I am speaking precisely of a voluntary, conscious agreement,  because you will achieve nothing through an order "from above."  For 70 years directors learned how to deceive all controllers,  how to get around any rules. So what is needed is  self-regulation (within sensible, agreed frameworks) under the  eye of the state. This will help to slow down inflation, and to  render the process manageable.    But the reformers embarked on quite a different path. You  will remember the declaration of market prices and market wages.  This was a splendid slogan, but a profoundly erroneous  approach. The market does not exist yet, and market regulators  do not operate -- that is, prices will not be balanced by the  market, but "blown off course," and wages for some will be  enormous while for others they will be miserly. A sizable wage,  like an engine, will ultimately create a momentum in its wake,  dragging along with it the salaries in other sectors -- and an  inflationary spiral is guaranteed.    In the majority of countries which have attained success in  the economy it is obligatory at a specific stage to implement  sensible restrictions on the growth of incomes and  profitability. This, incidentally, was one of the fundamental  points of Balcerowicz's program in Poland. But in Russia, for  some reason, they decided to be "cleverer" than all the rest.  Today, we are reaping the results....    [Golovachev] But how is it possible to restrict income even  further, when one-third of the country is already on the poverty  line?    [Saburov] This is precisely the result of the fact that  there was no well-conceived incomes policy, there were no  restrictions: some sectors "got fat," and others are on the  brink of extinction.    Of course, the "Stop and Go" tactic -- with its pauses, its  delays -- will not be ideal. But the economy needs a breather,  it needs time to adapt. It is better to move slowly but surely  toward a goal than to charge at something head on and find  yourself in a dead end. Obviously, the former is far harder:  It requires daily, difficult, and painstaking work, great  skill, and professionalism -- and not only in the economic  sphere but also in the sphere of management. However, the road  to success is never easy....    [Golovachev] Okay, what is done is done. But how do we get  out of the crisis today? Nonpayments have almost paralyzed the  economy. If you print a heap of money, you will present  enterprises with hyperinflation. If you do not, the result is a  financial clinch, production stoppage, and mass unemployment.  What is the solution?    [Saburov] Indeed, it is always harder to extinguish a  full-blown conflagration than a small fire. But we must not, of  course, lose heart. Right now it is essential to steer the ship  with particular caution and the greatest of dexterity. Credit  must be issued very sparingly -- by no means to everybody -- and  for specific projects (not flimsy "rough sketches," but genuine  business plans.) Moreover, it should be issued under strict  controls.    And there should be urgent talks between the government and  the sectors, and between sectors and the various social forces,  on the new "rules of the game": a temporary restriction on  income growth, profitability, and so on. A great deal depends  upon the professionalism of the government -- it must come out  with very precise, specific proposals, so that it is clear what  needs to be agreed....    [Golovachev] In your view, is the economic situation in  Crimea better or worse than in Russia?    [Saburov] Worse, of course. A lot worse. There are bread  lines, there is poverty, electricity is cut off for long periods  at a time, health sanatoriums are not heated....    [Golovachev] Can you employ in Crimea the "Stop and Go"  tactic and other recommendations you have mentioned?    [Saburov] It is difficult to compare conditions for the  pursuit of reforms in Crimea and Russia. There is no Central  Bank in Crimea, and the Crimean Republic on its own is in no  position to rein in the devaluation of the currency (although we  will, of course, try to exert influence, pressure if you like,  on the Central Bank of Ukraine). Economic instruments in  conducting reforms are all we can use, as there are no others.    [Golovachev] Will the Russian ruble circulate officially in  Crimea?    [Saburov] This would be sensible. And to some extent this  situation already exists "de facto." However, it is vital to  work out mutually acceptable projections.    [Golovachev] How much Russian currency will be required?    [Saburov] It is hard to say. It is essential to bear in  mind that money for investments is one thing, and money in  current circulation is another.... But, in general, we could be  talking about hundreds of billions of rubles.    [Golovachev] Do you intend to bring in foreign capital?    [Saburov] Yes, and we will do everything possible to bring  this about. It is a matter of approaching banks and  entrepreneurs in distant foreign countries, and in Russia.  Their activity will be granted most-favored status. This  concerns taxes, customs policy, and much more. It is very  important to guarantee stability in the sphere of legislation  and finances. It is wrong to alter the laws every quarter. If  we create attractive, advantageous conditions, capital will come  flooding into Crimea. After all, this is a prosperous region,  one of the best resort locations, and it has considerable  industrial, scientific, and agricultural potential.    Particular attention will be given to creating new and  maintaining existing jobs, revitalizing sanatorium facilities  and local industry, producing competitive goods, and developing  the vacation industry and tourism....    [Golovachev] You talked to Russian Premier Viktor  Chernomyrdin a few days ago. What was your conversation about?    [Saburov] It was about the need to restore economic links  between Russia and Crimea, the possibilities for more extensive  Russian interest in vacationing in Crimea, and other questions.    [Golovachev] Nowadays only millionaires can take a vacation  in Crimean health sanatoriums.....    [Saburov] But why? There are Russian enterprises which pay  for trips (either completely, or in part) and send their workers  to Crimea. Moreover, this is cheaper than flying to Miami,  where, as TRUD reported, Russian oil workers are taking their  vacations. At the same time, there is quality medical provision  available in Crimean sanatoriums, which you cannot get abroad.    [Golovachev] A few days ago, an official in Kiev announced  that a citizen of another country (that is, you) cannot be prime  minister of the Crimean Government inasmuch as a foreigner  should not be given access to state secrets....    [Saburov] This is simply ludicrous. What state secrets are  there in Crimea? A ravaged economy? People have known about  that for a long time.... And what kind of "foreigner" am I? I  was born and raised in Crimea, and I have never considered  myself to be a "foreigner" there.    [Golovachev] When do you leave for your new job in  Simferopol?    [Saburov] In the next few days.    [Golovachev] Now for a few purely personal questions. Are  you a religious man?    [Saburov] Yes.    [Golovachev] I was told that you were christened by Father  Aleksandr Men....    [Saburov] This was a great moment for me. Incidentally,  this happened in 1968 -- at a time when the official authorities  did not look upon the church particularly favorably.    [Golovachev] You realized, of course, that you would no  longer be able to pursue a scientific career?    [Saburov] Just what is meant by a scientific career? I knew  that I, as a nonparty individual, would not climb any higher  than "lab chief" in the institute. This was my "ceiling." But  the scientific work I did do was pretty good.    [Golovachev] You write plays, poetry. How well do the  precise sciences -- mathematics and economics -- mix with the  unfettered imagination without which poetry is impossible?    [Saburov] They mix very well. Poetic thinking is very  specific. The poet sees not simply a bird but something quite  specific -- for instance, a white crane, sitting in a nest. On  the other hand, economics is a very "creative" science. Indeed,  is it a science at all? So in this sense I can see a  combination, a harmony of interests, and not their differences.  Incidentally, many poets in the pre-Soviet era occupied  government posts....    [Golovachev] And one final question. How do you view the  future -- more with optimism, or with pessimism? Will we get  ourselves out of this rut without bloodshed, and without  concentration camps?    [Saburov] We have to. People have become highly resistent  to "blood and concentration camps." And you cannot reverse the  course of history. We are merely required to make fewer errors.  Right now, an acute shortage of common sense and  professionalism is seen in the conduct of the reforms. But I am  convinced: Common sense will triumph, and good will be  victorious....</p>

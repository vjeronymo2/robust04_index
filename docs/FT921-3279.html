			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Inkatha leader in pact with S African right wing A SENIOR leader of South Africa's Zulu Inkatha party yesterday signed an agreement with leaders of rightwing parties, in an attempt to persuade whites to vote No in next week's referendum on whether the government should continue negotiations to end apartheid. Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, immediately repudiated the agreement, announced by the head of Inkatha in the province of Transvaal, Mr Musa Myeni. Mr Myeni, who is one of Chief Buthelezi's most powerful lieutenants, held a joint press conference with the leader of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (Afrikaner Resistance Movement, AWB), Mr Eugene Terreblanche, and Mr Ferdi Hartzenberg, deputy leader of the ultra-right Conservative party. They said they had signed a non-aggression pact aimed at persuading whites, in the words of Mr Terreblanche, that 'they will not be murdered by black people if the No vote wins this referendum'. This was a reference to a statement earlier in the day by Mr Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress (ANC), that race war would be inevitable if political reform is rejected in the referendum. The ruling National party has used the prospect of a race war to try to persuade whites to vote Yes in the referendum, which will determine whether negotiations on a new constitution continue. The announcement could undermine the campaign of President F. W. de Klerk, who was mobbed yesterday by rightwing students at Pretoria University. They tried to beat him over the head with a placard. Many National party supporters have long hoped for an alliance with Inkatha to prevent domination by the ANC in a future government. Yesterday's deal will shake their confidence in the prospect for such an alliance. The pact will also give credence to charges that rightwing whites have been involved in black-on-black violence which has left 11,000 people dead since 1984. Violence has flared again since the whites-only referendum was announced three weeks ago, with nearly 230 people dead in that period. Some 25 were killed yesterday alone. Chief Buthelezi reacted furiously to news of the deal between Mr Myeni and the leadership of the Conservative party and its paramilitary ally, the AWB. He distanced himself from the CP's policy of separate homelands for whites and blacks, saying the creation of racially-divided states was 'unthinkable'. Black community leaders said they feared news of an alliance between part of Inkatha and the white supremacists of the AWB - who dress in khaki paramilitary uniforms and carry guns - could inflame township violence. It was not clear whether Mr Myeni intended to lead a breakaway faction from Inkatha into a formal alliance with the AWB, nor was it clear whether Mr Hartzenberg spoke for the the CP leadership.

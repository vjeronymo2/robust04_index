			<p>930802 FT  02 AUG 93 / Indian police arrest truck strike leaders POLICE moved against a strike by India's 1.8m truckers yesterday, arresting 10 leaders at the start of a protest against transport taxes, Reuter reports from New Delhi. The Press Trust of India reported that police in the eastern state of Orissa arrested the leaders at their homes, while others went underground to evade arrest. Orissa authorities have declared illegal the indefinite strike, which started at midnight on Saturday. Under special powers, India's state governments can force drivers to carry essential supplies. Refusal could mean six months imprisonment and a fine. Rajasthan and Gujarat are two other states which have banned the strike. No arrests have been reported there. The truckers have vowed to immobilise all freight until New Delhi agrees to abolish road and inter-state taxes. The arrests, ahead of another round of discussions planned between truckers and government officials, were likely to harden the strikers' stand. The strike has been organised by the All India Motor Transport Congress.</p>

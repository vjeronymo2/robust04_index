			<p>BFN     [Text] A responsible source has denounced the new scandal  fabricated by the media of the renegade secessionist gang in the  Socialist Party headed by traitor agent 'Ali Salim al-Bid,  within the framework of a series of fabricated scandals and lies  propagated by this gang.    The latest of these lies claimed that our heroic Armed  Forces  fired a missile on Aden, and that shrapnel from the missile,  which was exploded in the air by the so-called air defenses of  the rebellious, secessionist gang hit a number of worshipers in  Aden during dawn prayers.    This false and fabricated report, which aims at concealing  the crimes of this gang in a manner that exposes it, included a  statement by a citizen who was forced to speak on television and  said the explosion occurred while the worshipers were kneeling.  Another citizen said the explosion took place during the final  stage of prayers. A third citizen spoke about prayers while the  announcer was telling him what to say. At the beginning of the  report it was said that the missile was intercepted by the air  defenses of this gang and exploded in the air.    This disgraceful contradiction shows the lowly means  employed  by the media of the renegade secessionist gang in fabricating  deceptive reports and falsifying facts.    The source said the masses of our Yemeni people know who  shells mosques, and who tortured to death our esteemed religious  scholars, and who attacked Sanaa, Ta'izz and Zinjibar, as well  as al-Rahidah and 'Ataq with missiles, in addition to what  happened in the economic and commercial capital, Aden, in  January 1986 during the bloody coup against the legitimate  leadership of the Socialist party at that time.    Our people in all governorates also know those who have  renounced the values of our Islamic religion and all deep-rooted  norms and heritage throughout their known criminal history.</p>

			<p>920618 FT  18 JUN 92 / C and W rules out global alliance: Telecommunications group unveils 5.7% profits rise LORD YOUNG, chairman of Cable and Wireless, the UK-based international telecommunications group, yesterday said he was talking to groups about partnerships for specific projects but ruled out a global alliance. His comments came as the group unveiled a 5.7 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 644m for the year to the end of March. Turnover increased from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 3.1m. The increase in pre-tax profits was achieved after Pounds 70.3m of exceptional items relating to group rationalisation, the merger of Mercury Personal Communications with Unitel, a US-owned operator, and the devaluation of the Jamaican dollar. Before the UK election in April Cable and Wireless was in talks with American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&amp;T) about a possible global alliance. The talks broke down because of AT&amp;T's concern about the election. Reports that AT&amp;T wants to reopen talks followed re-election of the Conservative government. However, Lord Young ruled out further talks about a global alliance. He said: 'We do not believe it is in our interests to form a global alliance with anyone. We are in talks with everyone about the possibility of establishing individual partnerships over individual projects.' Since Cable and Wireless rejected a BT Syncordia-type strategy - taking on the world's big telecommunications groups - it no longer believes a global alliance is in its interest. Lord Young said: 'We felt that there was not sufficient returns out of a Syncordia-type strategy taking everybody on everywhere.' Instead the group will concentrate on business services, basic telecommunications in its traditional areas of strength such as Asia and the West Indies, and mobile phones. It is looking at establishing a joint company with Intertelecom in Russia, to provide a service to western Siberia, the 'Golden Ring' of large towns surrounding Moscow, and St Petersburg. 'In 25 years people may say this was the best decision the group ever made,' said Lord Young. Earnings per share were down 4 per cent to 30.1p because of exceptionals and the higher tax charge of Pounds 134m compared with Pounds 115m. A final dividend of 9p (against 8.1p) makes a total of 13.25p compared with 11.8p. Lex, Page 22; Details, Page 26; Market, Page 48</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Manila, March 20 (XINHUA) -- Philippine President  Fidel Ramos today praised Filipino-Chinese for their outstanding  contributions to the development of the country.    "Chinese-Filipinos have help build this country -- with  their  blood, their toil, their resources, and their enterprise," the  president said during his speech at the 40th anniversary  celebration of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of  Commerce and Industry (FCCCI), an umbrella organization of  Filipino-Chinese corporations.    Ramos cited what the FCCCI have done in improving education  infrastructure, reducing impact of natural and man-made  calamities and providing free medical aid to poor residents.    "I must also acknowledge your contributions to help improve  peace and order, especially in Metro Manila," he added.    Ramos pointed out that the FCCCI have made contributions to  peace and order in the country by donating police patrol cars  and other equipments to the police and stabilizing prices of  basic goods through its influence on businessmen during abnormal  times.    "Your most important contribution, however, has been to help  develop our economy and generate jobs," the president stressed.    Despite accounting for only one percent of the country's 65  million population, he said, "Chinese-Filipino companies  generate a full third of the sales of all domestically owned  firms."    The president also reiterated his government's efforts to  level the playing field of business competition for all  businessmen, including Filipino-Chinese.    While praising the FCCCI's "sterling service" to the country  during the past 40 years, Ramos urged the federation to play "a  lead role in moving our nation towards our shared vision of  'Philippines 2000'."    The president has issued a proclamation declaring March 23  to  29 of every year as the "Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers  of Commerce and Industry Week."    "It is but fitting that it should be given a period within  which to focus public attention to the role being played by the  federation in national development," Ramos said in his  proclamation.</p>

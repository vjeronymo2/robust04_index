			<p>940526 FT  26 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Quality Software to raise Pounds 1.6m via placing Quality Software Products, the Gateshead-based developer of accounting software for large companies, is raising Pounds 1.6m through a placing to enable the development of international business relationships. The share price rose 4p to 405p. QSP has invested some Pounds 16m over the past few years in developing an advanced system, Universal Olas, which has now been sold to eight customers. Last year, it concluded a deal with Global Software, a US accounting software company, through which Global will distribute Universal Olas at minimum cost to QSP. It is understand that the company has been having discussions with potential partners in Japan, France, South America, the Middle East and east Asia, with a view to striking similar distribution arrangements. The company believes that Pounds 500,000 will be needed to finance the first of these deals. The rest of the money is being used partly for product development and partly as priming finance should opportunities from new business partnerships present themselves. QSP recently announced an alliance with Hewlett Packard, a leading US electronic manufacturer.</p>

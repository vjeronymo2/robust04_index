			<p><P> June 12, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PROFILE;  </P> <P> FANG LIZHI: THE DISSIDENT AS "FURNITURE.";  </P> <P> THE ASTROPHYSICIST AND HIS WIFE ARE LIVING IN THE U.S. EMBASSY IN BEIJING. HIS  LETTERS ABROAD OFFER DETAILS OF THEIR LIFE IN POLITIAL EXILE.  </P> <P> In effect, they are hostages and political exiles marooned on a tiny American  island amid a churning Chinese ocean. American diplomats have privately dubbed  them "the guests," or sometimes, "the furniture."  </P> <P> He is China's leading dissident, Fang Lizhi, and she is his wife, Li Shuxian.  And they've spent the last year, since soon after the bloodletting around Tian  An Men Square last June, in the American Embassy in Beijing, waiting for  statesmen to negotiate their future.  </P> <P> Fang dispatches frequent letters to his friends and relatives overseas from his  temporary home.  </P> <P> He often writes on a computer, apparently supplied by the embassy, that has  both English and Chinese word-processing software. His letters are full of  humor, but also, occasionally, touches of frustration and melancholy.  </P> <P> "I am an astrophysicist, and yet I cannot see the sky," Fang complained to one  Princeton University scientist.  </P> <P> In return, Fang's friends send him not only letters but voluminous reading  matter. Fellow scientists from around the world send Fang professional journals  and texts. Supporters of China's pro-democracy movement send him news clippings  and political material -- particularly the work of Soviet and East European  intellectuals who, like Fang, challenged the Communist system.  </P> <P> Fang's mailbag recently included Chinese-language translations of the famous  1978 essay "The Power of the Powerless" by Czechoslovakia's  dissident-turned-president Vaclav Havel, and a separate article by Polish  dissident Adam Michnik. American writer Orville Schell sent Fang a transcript  of the court proceedings against another famous scientist-dissident, Galileo.  </P> <P> As one of China's leading physicists, and as a senior administrator at the  Chinese University of Science and Technology, Fang was once a ranking and  well-rewarded member of the Communist Party he now so eloquently criticizes. He  was expelled in 1987 after encouraging students at his school to organize  demonstrations for democratic reform.  </P> <P> Those demonstrations in 1986 and 1987 turned out to be precursors of the  upheavals at Tian An Men Square last spring. And three days after the People's  Liberation Army crushed the Beijing demonstrations, Fang and his wife, Li,  denounced by the Chinese regime as traitors and counterrevolutionaries, sought  safety inside the American Embassy.  </P> <P> They have been there since -- unable to leave, surrounded by watchful Chinese  police on the streets outside.  </P> <P> Obscured from the outside world, Fang and Li nevertheless have remained at or  near the center of attention in the fitful efforts at reconciliation between  the Bush Administration and the Chinese regime of senior leader Deng Xiaoping.  </P> <P> The American sheltering of Fang was one of the principal factors behind an  outpouring of anti-Americanism by the Chinese regime last summer. Negotiating  Fang's release is believed to have been one of the top items on the agenda when  Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser, made his  controversial trip to Beijing last December. And China's failure to let Fang go  was one of the main reasons that Bush said earlier this year that he had been  disappointed by China's failure to respond to his overtures.  </P> <P> It is possible that the couple may be allowed to leave the embassy -- perhaps  even within the next few weeks. The broad outlines of a deal to accomplish  their release are easy to imagine.  </P> <P> For its part, the Bush Administration would like to end the standoff and have  China allow Fang and Li to leave the country.  </P> <P> The Chinese regime would like to regain its access to hundreds of millions of  dollars in loans from the World Bank and the Japanese government -- loans that  were frozen largely because of pressure from the United States. The blocked  loans to China are expected to be on the agenda at the economic summit of  leading industrial nations in Houston next month, and Fang's release might  cause Bush to clear the way for the loans.  </P> <P> But past efforts to work out a deal have failed. Before Fang and his wife can  be released, several sticking points need to be worked out:  </P> <P>  * What kind of statement would Fang have to sign?  </P> <P>  "He's offered to sign some document that tells the truth, but not to confess  to things he hasn't done," says one U.S. supporter.  </P> <P> The Chinese regime may want Fang to admit to orchestrating last year's  demonstrations. Fang stayed away from Tian An Men Square and denied that he  played any major role in organizing the protests there. So far, there is no  evidence to the contrary.  </P> <P>  * Where would Fang go?  </P> <P>  The Chinese regime does not want Fang in France or the United States, the two  centers of Chinese intellectuals and students pressing for democracy in their  homeland. Once there, Fang would quickly emerge as a leader and unifying force  for the now-fragmented opposition to the Chinese regime.  </P> <P> Other countries, such as Italy and Australia, have been mentioned as possible  new homes for Fang. Italy recently said he would be welcome there.  </P> <P>  * What restrictions would be placed on Fang's ability to write or speak out on  political matters while in exile?  </P> <P>  Chinese authorities apparently have sought a deal in which Fang would be  allowed to leave the country on condition that he refrain from all political  activity. Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger, who remains close to  Chinese leaders, once suggested that Fang be permitted to go overseas to pursue  his scientific career, strongly implying that Fang would have to stick to  science -- not politics.  </P> <P> It is not clear whether the Bush Administration would accept such a deal, or,  if so, how it could be enforced after Fang leaves China.  </P> <P>  * Would Fang's son, Fang Zhi, be allowed to leave China with his parents?  </P> <P>  Beijing might seek leverage over Fang's political conduct overseas by  requiring that one of his two children remain in China. Fang and Li's younger  son, Fang Zhi, fled into the U.S. Embassy with his parents a year ago, but then  left the American compound last summer.  </P> <P> Fang Zhi, who still lives in Beijing, has sought permission to travel to the  United States, where he might join his older brother, Fang Ke.  </P> <P> "They still will not give him a passport," Fang Ke, a graduate student in  physics at Wayne State University in Michigan, told The Times last week. "It  still seems impossible for him to leave."  </P> <P> U.S. officials decline to provide details on Fang Lizhi's daily life inside the  embassy. In turn, Fang, perhaps restrained by his American hosts, has said  almost nothing in public about his confinement.  </P> <P> "Because of the extraordinary circumstances under which we now live, I am  unable to tell you any of the details of our lives," he wrote in accepting the  Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights Award last fall. Since January, Fang has written  five articles for scientific journals, plus one for the magazine Omni.  </P> <P> Those who correspond with Fang and Li say the long confinement appears to be  harder on Li, who is herself a scientist, teacher and political activist.  </P> <P> "Fang may be doing better than his wife," observes Schell. "His work is more  cerebral. She is more of a teacher."  </P> <P> Friends also worry about the couple's isolation from Chinese society and  culture. "They only have each other to speak Chinese with," says Princeton  University professor Perry Link. (While some embassy officials speak Chinese,  even they would tend to speak with the couple in English.)  </P> <P> Still, their situation is not entirely gloomy. Fang has the opportunity to read  and to think. In one recent letter to an American friend, he noted that he can  obtain scholarly journals more quickly through the American Embassy than he  ever could through the Chinese Academy of Sciences.  </P> <P> Fang Ke, the couple's son in the United States, points out another benefit of  their confinement: Living together under one roof. In a country where husbands  and wifes are routinely assigned to jobs in different cities, that is not  always the norm.  </P> <P> His parents lived apart for more than 15 of the 30 years of their marriage,  according to Fang Ke. Now, inside the U.S. Embassy, they have more of an  American-style marriage. "My parents have been separated for a long time," said  their son. "I feel that it's better for them to be together."  </P> <P> Biography  </P> <P> Name: Fang Lizhi  </P> <P> Position: Astrophysicist and dissident.

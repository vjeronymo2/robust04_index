			<p>920429 FT  29 APR 92 / The world begins to believe in sterling: Currency rises STERLING has proved one of the main beneficiaries of the Conservatives' election victory. Since early April the pound has gained more than 10 pfennigs against the D-Mark. The rise is a result of the biggest sustained burst of international support for sterling since Britain joined the European exchange rate mechanism 19 months ago. Yesterday sterling closed in London at DM2.9375, unchanged on the day, just more than 1 pfennig below its central ERM rate of DM2.95. Behind the rise  - which has lifted sterling from a low of DM2.835 on April 4  - are investors from Japan, Germany and the US who interpret the Tories' election win as underlining Britain's commitment to the ERM. The rise removed nagging doubts that a new government might devalue the pound within the 10-currency grid as part of an attempt to engineer a reduction in the high level of UK interest rates. It caused international investors  - many of which had avoided sterling purchases during pre-election uncertainty  - to move funds out of currencies such as the D-Mark and the dollar and into sterling. One side-effect of the stronger pound has been to help the government sell about Pounds 4bn of gilt-edged securities in recent weeks  - up to about a half are believed to have gone to overseas buyers. A second factor helping sterling is that many in financial markets believe that over the next few months Britain will move sterling from its broad 6 per cent band in the ERM to join the majority of nations in the system whose currencies are held in narrow 2.25 per cent bands. This should reduce still more the possibility of any sharp falls in sterling, and is seen as further reason to buy. Third, recent economic evidence pointing to a weak UK economic recovery later this year is also helping to increase confidence in the pound. Fourth, the government appears to be in no hurry to cut base rates, held at 10.5 per cent since September. That gives investors another reason to buy sterling. Finally, sterling has benefited from the negative view many investors have taken about the economic and political prospects of other nations - including Germany, France and Italy  - leading to a tendency to switch funds out of the currencies of those countries and into the UK's. But in some senses the pound's increase in value has simply corrected for its fragility before the election, when it was the weakest member of the ERM grid. It is now fourth from bottom, above the Danish krone, the French franc and the Italian lire. Also, investor sentiment could easily switch from sterling, in the event of unsettling factors such as a burst of inflation. A sudden rise in German borrowing rates, which set the climate for monetary policy throughout Europe via the ERM link, could cause investors to sell sterling. Another important factor could be any deterioration in the UK's trade deficit over the coming months. Perhaps the best way of looking at sterling is to consider the difference between the yields on UK gilts and the equivalent government bonds issued by Germany. That underlines the difference in sentiment towards the pound compared with the D-Mark, which is the ERM anchor because of its record as the system's most stable currency. Before the election, 10-year gilts had yields a full 2 percentage points higher than the corresponding German bonds  - indicating the extra payment demanded by international investors for holding sterling assets as opposed to those denominated in D-Marks. After sterling's recent rise  - and a similar increase in gilt prices, paralleled by a decline in yields  - the yield gap has been brought down, but only to about 1.4 percentage points. Some gilt specialists reckon this will decline further to about 1.2 percentage points by the end of 1992. The difference is still substantial  - reinforcing the distance the pound has to travel before it is regarded on financial markets as being anything like such a good bet as the German currency.

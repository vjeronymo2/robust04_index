			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Making waves on the Spanish main: Peter Bruce and Peggy Hollinger wonder whether Bibby is merely tilting at windmills J BIBBY &amp; Sons, the industrial and agricultural conglomerate which is proposing to launch a hostile Pounds 75m bid for Finanzauto, Spain's only Caterpillar dealer, said yesterday that it was satisfied with progress on the offer. The statement was issued following confusion on Wednesday night surrounding the request by the Spanish stock exchange for official evidence of Bibby shareholder approval of the deal. 'We always knew the stock exchange would not be approving the offer until we delivered shareholder support,' says Mr Alan Gresty, finance director. A shareholders' meeting will be held in London on May 14 to get formal approval - although Bibby's 79 per cent shareholder, the South African group Barlow Rand, has already indicated it supports the deal. Following the EGM, the bid will become official. Finanzauto's board rejected the bid on Tuesday, saying it undervalued the company. Mr Gresty remains optimistic about Bibby's chances: 'We are still very confident as far as the way we have proceeded and the price we have offered.' Bibby's proposed bid is a brave adventure into unknown territory. One can count the number of successful hostile takeover bids in Spain on the fingers of one hand and they have all been mounted by Spaniards. The difficulty lies in the Catch 22 situation of cross-border bids for Spanish public companies. The Spanish takeover code - as implemented last summer - declares that cash offers for public companies must be virtually unconditional - ie, complete with shareholder approval. To gain that approval, however, a UK company must publish details of the bid, and allow at least 21 days for an EGM. That relatively untested conflict put pressure on Bibby's proposed bid, by forcing its hand rather earlier than it would have liked. The Spanish stock market commission (CNMV) said on Wednesday night that it would not consider the documentation - which it had asked for, following rumours of an offer - as complete until it had evidence that Bibby shareholders approved of the Dollars 133m offer. Bibby might have hoped for some flexibility on that particular clause given Barlow Rand's support. Still, Bibby denies that the CNMV decision alters its plans in any way, or that it represents a setback to the proposed offer. Finanzauto stock, meanwhile, will begin trading again on May 4 and investors will have almost two totally free weeks to drive up the price and, perhaps, make Bibby pay more than it had bargained for. Not surprisingly, Bibby says it has no intentions of making a higher offer and dismisses rumours of a white knight. 'If there is another player, it should make an offer as we have, through the proper procedures,' Mr Gresty says. The next two weeks will be uncomfortable for Bibby and Barlow Rand, which badly needs Finanzauto to break its machinery business out of the crippled South African market. Barlow is already Caterpillar's sole distributor in South Africa, where off-highway equipment sales have shrunk 80 per cent since 1983, and it has also just been appointed Caterpillar's distributor in Bulgaria. But Finanzauto operates in a market 10 times bigger than South Africa's in earth-moving products. While they wait, Barlow/Bibby will take succour from two things. First, Caterpillar is supporting the bid. The US group and Barlow Rand have developed close ties and Caterpillar stuck by Barlow Rand when many US companies were disinvesting from South Africa in the 1980s. Even if Finanzauto manages to find a white knight, any buyer would require Caterpillar's approval. Perhaps conscious of this, Finanzauto is believed to have approached a Caterpillar distributor in France. Second, analysts in Madrid are recommending the Pta1,300 (706p) being offered for Finanzauto's shares. 'Finanzauto may be worth more than Dollars 133m,' says one Madrid broker, 'but not with its current management.' The shares were trading at Pta1,075 when they were suspended last Thursday. But that criticism is not shared by analysts who track the world's cyclical off-highway equipment markets. 'Finanzauto is far and away the strongest and healthiest company in the equipment market in Spain,' says Mr Chris Barrow-Williams, a sector specialist with the Corporate Intelligence Group in London. This is where Bibby might find itself doing battle for market and shareholder sentiment as it waits to resubmit its offer. Mr Barrow-Williams says Finanzauto has substantially strengthened Caterpillar's position in Spain by widening its supply base and taking control of Stet, Portugal's main supplier. Also, he says the 30 per cent of Finanzauto turnover in spare parts is significantly higher than the industry average for equipment distributors. The sharp fall in Finanzauto profits - from Pta2.1bn in 1989 to Pta894m last year - may have irritated the markets, says Mr Barrow-Williams, but it is due solely to a dramatic collapse in construction activity in Spain as government efforts to slow down its booming economy have begun to bite. Caterpillar's overall market share in Spain has fallen from about 23 to 20 per cent in the process, mainly because of poor sales of crawler excavators. This could be recovered as Caterpillar brings new models to the market. Caterpillar's main rivals in Spain, notably JCB, have been hit even harder as sales of second-hand machines have plummeted. This is because sub-contractors, the main buyers of used equipment, have suffered worst of all from delayed payments in big state-financed projects. With Madrid showing little sign of easing the tight monetary policies which have slowed down construction activity, Bibby clearly believes it is the right moment to try to buy Finanzauto. Baring Brothers, the Barlow/Bibby adviser in Madrid, was confident yesterday that it would have little trouble completing the takeover. That is in spite of the fact that, even at Pta1,300, only Finanzauto shareholders who bought their stock after the middle of last year will make any money selling to Bibby. 'You would have to look at what their chances would be of getting Pta1,300 in the future,' said one Baring official in Madrid. Therein may lie Bibby's biggest risk in Spanish takeover practices. Finanzauto's stockholders, are, in effect, being asked to cut and run. That may underestimate the capacity of Spaniards to hold on grimly to their investments until they make even the tiniest of profits.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Good Morning From Mexico" newscast] </F>   [Text] The Standing Committee of the Congress of the Union  on 9 February condemned the new immigration measures adopted by  the U.S. Government as well as the intensification of military  surveillance along the Mexican-U.S. border. The measures  adopted by the U.S. Government do not solve the illegal alien  immigration problem.    An agreement approved by all political parties called for,  through the Human Rights and Border Issues Committees, public  audiences to discuss mechanisms to promote the defense and  protection of the rights of our fellow immigrant citizens.</p>

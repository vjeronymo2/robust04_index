			<p><P> May 12, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ON YOUR OWN: DEALING WITH THE IDEALIZATION OF LOVE  </P> <P> When an intense feeling of romantic love very rapidly fades and disappears, it  usually provokes hurt, disillusionment and puzzlement for both partners in the  relationship. This is reflected in the letters I have received from two  readers.  </P> <P> A 34-year-old businessman writes:  </P> <P> "In high school, when I would repeatedly fall madly in and out of love, I  understood it to be part of being a teen-ager -- and of mistaking lust for  love. But now the same thing has happened to me three different times in the  last 10 years, and I feel doomed never to be able to sustain a loving feeling.  </P> <P> "In all three instances, soon after I met the woman I was drawn to her, wanted  to be with her all the time and delighted in everything about her. I would  pursue her, and she almost couldn't help but respond to my ardent romancing. I  sincerely felt I wanted to spend my life with her, and I told her so.  </P> <P> "Then, after only a few months, the feeling would begin to fade. I would just  stop looking forward to being with her, and lots of little things would bother  me. I would try desperately to make the feeling come back, but it was like  trying to remember a dream that's getting away from you. I don't understand why  this happens. Do I fall in love too hard? Am I unrealistic to expect the  feeling to last?"  </P> <P> And a 27-year-old female fashion designer writes:  </P> <P> "A year ago at this time, I was the happiest woman in the world. I had met Dave  through my work, and I was almost instantly attracted to him. We flirted, but I  felt I was more serious about it whereas he was playful. Then we began to go  out, and we both fell deeply in love with each other. It couldn't have been  more romantic and fulfilling. I liked everything about him -- his looks  (particularly the sexy way he would narrow his eyes when he looked at me), the  way he walked, his ideas, his jokes, even the way he held his cigarettes (and I  hate smoking).  </P> <P> "We are gradually moving toward marriage, only I find I'm not in love with him  anymore, and I don't know why. He hasn't changed or done anything wrong. He's  just as loving and funny as ever. But little things that never bothered me  before are driving me crazy. The way he narrows his eyes now makes me want to  say 'stop squinting.' And the way he holds his cigarette seems posed and phony.  I can't figure out what happened and whether I should just hang in there hoping  the feeling of love will come back."  </P> <P> Many of us are familiar with the painful and mysterious disappearance of the  feeling of romantic love. The psychiatrist and psychoanalyst Dr. Ethel Person  has written a brilliant and enlightening book about the ups and downs of love  called "Dreams of Love and Fateful Encounters" (W. W. Norton, 1988). She writes  that passion inevitably has an element of idealization of the beloved. Some  quality or combination of qualities bathes everything about the other person in  a golden light.  </P> <P> Person writes: "Because romantic love is based on idealization, which is an act  of imaginative exaggeration, it is believed by skeptics that love will  inevitably fade when confronted by . . . daily life. But the fate of  idealization is variable. It may be preserved, diminished or utterly  shattered." For the two letter writers the idealization tends to get "utterly  shattered."  </P> <P> They ask why. One possibility is that there was too much idealization at the  beginning. This over-idealization, based primarily on the lover's need to find  someone perfectly wonderful, blotted out too much reality. Nobody could live up  to that perfect and unrealistic initial picture.  </P> <P> Another possibility is put this way by Person: "Perhaps the easiest of all  mechanisms to understand is best summed up by Groucho Marx's dictum: 'I  wouldn't join any club that has me as a member.' If the lover has sufficiently  low self-esteem, he regards anyone who truly loves him as, by definition,  deficient, wanting in taste." So sometimes the feeling of love is lost when it  is clear that the other person truly loves you back.  </P> <P> There are other reasons for rapid and destructive de-idealization. Sometimes  the fears of increasing emotional intimacy or moving toward commitment can  cause a focus on the negative as a way of sabotaging the relationship. A person  who wants his beloved to have no personal needs, but to live mainly to satisfy  him, is disillusioned to discover that his beloved has interests, goals and  desires that have nothing to do with him. His beloved may even have needs and  expectations that he is supposed to meet. This can destroy the idealization,  and then the feeling of romantic love evaporates.  </P> <P> It is understandable that the initial idealization will diminish or change. But  in cases where there is little understanding or expectation of this, the  disappointment may be too great and the love feeling may die.  </P> <P> Where some de-idealization is expected, it does not have to be destructive. The  remaining idealization, combining with growing realistic intimacy, can make for  a strong love relationship.  </P> <P>  Write to Howard Halpern with questions about the single life in care of  Special Features, 130 5th Ave., New York, N.Y. 10011.

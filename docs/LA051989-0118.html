			<p><P> May 19, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOME TECH: VIDEO . . . WHAT'S NEW;  </P> <P> METALLICA, WOODSTOCK TAPES COMING IN JUNE  </P> <P> The critically praised band Metallica has (almost) given speed-metal rock a  good name -- especially among video dealers, who have sold an astounding  175,000 copies of the group's "$19.95 Home Vid: Cliff 'Em All." Those same  video dealers -- along with fans -- will be happy to hear that June will bring  another Metallica cassette from Elektra Entertainment: "Metallica: 2 of One,"  consisting of two versions of the song "One," one of them about 10 minutes and  incorporating scenes from the film "Johnny Got His Gun."  </P> <P> If Metallica is a little too, uh, '80s for you, you might prefer this news:  "Woodstock" is coming out on video June 28 (August marks the 20th anniversary  of the festival). Warner will put out a letter-boxed version for $29.98  (laserdisc, $39.98). Cable channels MTV and VH-1 will also be showing the film  in August.  </P> <P> "Rain Man" arrives Aug. 30 from MGM/UA with a Buick commercial attached but  (uh-oh!) no price break for buyers ($89.95). Other coming releases: "Twins"  (June 15), "The Accidental Tourist" (June 28), "Bird" (June 21), "Talk Radio"  (July 13), "My Stepmother Is an Alien" (June 8), "Crusoe" (July 12), the Marx  Brothers' first movie "The Cocoanuts" (July 13) and, turning back to music,  "New Order: Substance" (June 6).  </P> <P> The Bargain Bin: "Beetlejuice," "Innerspace," "Barfly," "Dancers" and "The  Mosquito Coast" will be reduced by Warner from the $80-$90 range to $19.98 on  July 19.  </P> <P> The 1989 American Film Institute Video Festival will be held Oct. 26-29 in Los  Angeles, and the deadline for submitting videos is June 1. Meanwhile, tonight  AFI is hosting the L.A. premiere of "Motorist," a 70-minute video by Chip Lord  (co-founder of Ant Farm). Information: (213) 856-7787.  </P> <P> Like to add a videodisc player to your home-tech equipment but you've been  scared off by the high prices? Pioneer Electronics may have the answer -- it  will soon be marketing the cheapest combination laserdisc/CD machine yet. The  CLD-1070 retails for $600, which means it should sell for maybe $100 less when  it reaches stores in the next few weeks.  </P> <P> MOVIES  </P> <P> "Coming to America" (Paramount, no suggested retail price) came to video stores  Wednesday with a soft-drink commercial. Eddie Murphy plays an African prince  who chooses Queens, N. Y., to search for a bride. Arsenio Hall plays the  prince's best friend. John Landis directed this R-rated 1988 comedy, which  grossed about $130 million at America's theaters.  </P> <P> The sexy "Stealing Heaven" (Virgin, $89.95) came to theaters very recently, but  also arrived at video stores Wednesday -- in both its R-rated version and a  more explicit unrated version. The Clive Donner-directed film concerns the  legendary 12th-Century romance of Abelard and Heloise.  </P> <P> Other new movies-on-tape, all from CBS/Fox: "Halloween 4: The Return of Michael  Myers" ($89.98, 1988, R), "The Other" ($59.98, 1972, PG), "Spellbinder"  ($79.98, 1988, R).  </P> <P> OTHER VIDEOS  </P> <P> In the half-hour "Yellowstone Aflame," Holiday Video chronicles how the  national park looked before, during and after last year's huge fires. Holiday  also has a new 56-minute tape on "Everglades National Park," also for $29.95.  Information: (213) 945-3325.  </P> <P> Hanna-Barbera offers "The Jetsons First Episodes," four of them from 1963 on a  $29.95 tape. CC Studios has "The Amazing Bone and Other Stories" ($22.50); John  Lithgow narrates four animated versions of children's books on this 32-minute  tape. "Greenpeace's Greatest Hits" (J2, $29.95) is a 60-minute documentary  about the environmental organization's efforts.  </P> <P> You can make your own curry powder and much else after watching all 53 minutes  of "Paka-Sutra: The Art of Indian Home Cooking" from Well-Fed Productions  ($29.95).

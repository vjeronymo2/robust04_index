			<p><P> February 4, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIAL KILLER BUNDY'S EXECUTION AND DEATH PENALTY CONTROVERSY  </P> <P> McCarthy tells of 23 wrongful executions, and how many people find that  acceptable. It horrifies me, and I am ashamed for our country.  </P> <P> Doesn't anyone else remember civics classes which taught "innocent until proven  guilty," and "the burden of proof is on the prosecution," and "better that 100  criminals go free than that one innocent person is convicted"? I remember how  proud I was to learn that our justice system honored those exacting rules.  </P> <P> It wasn't just me. Everyone I knew really believed in those precepts. When did  that change?  </P> <P> Today, anyone speaking up for such ideals is ridiculed as "soft on crime" and  as "caring more about the rights of the criminal than the rights of the  victim."  </P> <P> No one sees any distinction between "accused" and "guilty" when it comes to  violent crimes; instead anyone charged with a violent crime is labeled a  criminal. The general public and, of course, all politicians, have joined the  prosecutors and police in decrying rules which protect the accused.  </P> <P> When did it change?  </P> <P> RODNEY HOFFMAN  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  There were several comments about the applicability of the rebuttable presumption to assessment costs. Some commenters stated that CERCLA provides a rebuttable presumption only for the actual damage assessment performed in accordance with this rule not for the costs of performing the assessment. Other commenters thought that trustee officials who comply with this rule, including the standards for reasonable costs, should be granted a rebuttable presumption that their damage assessment costs are recoverable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Section 11.91(c), which was not affected by this rulemaking, provides that when trustee officials perform an assessment in accordance with this rulemaking, the assessment receives a rebuttable presumption. The Department believes that the determination of whether it is reasonable to incur a particular assessment cost is an integral component of a damage assessment. The rule contains specific provisions to guide trustee officials in determining whether to incur a particular assessment cost, including a definition of reasonable assessment costs that was specifically upheld in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Ohio  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Interior <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Therefore, the Department believes that trustee officials that comply with this rule, including the standards for determining reasonable assessment costs, should be granted a rebuttable presumption that their assessment costs are reasonable and, thus, recoverable.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters thought that the Department should clarify that judicial review of an assessment is limited to the data in the administrative record. These commenters stated that, in the absence of such a clarification, PRPs would refuse to disclose any of their data until formal judicial discovery begins but would demand that trustee officials make all of their data available for public review and comment as early in the assessment process as possible. These commenters expressed concern that such a result would put trustee officials at a significant disadvantage in natural resource damage litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Clarification of the data that will be admitted in a natural resource damage case is beyond the scope of this rulemaking.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> O. Use of Collected Damages  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Some commenters stated that trustee officials should be required to spend all collected damages on implementation of the same restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative that was selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan as the basis for the damage claim. These commenters thought that without such a requirement, trustee officials would have little incentive to perform accurate assessments. There were suggestions that trustee officials be required to notify or obtain permission from the court or the PRPs before implementing a final Restoration Plan that differs significantly from the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department does not believe that the rule should explicitly require collected damages to be spent on implementation of the same restoration, rehabilitation, replacement, and/or acquisition alternative selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. Section 11.93(a) provides that upon award of natural resource damages, trustee officials must prepare a Restoration Plan describing how the awarded funds will be used. Section 11.93(a) states that the Restoration Plan shall be based on the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. The Restoration Plan is intended to be a detailed description of the implementation of the alternative selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan. However, the Department recognizes that there may be unforeseen changes in the condition of the natural resources between the time the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan is prepared and the time trustee officials actually collect damages. Also, the amount of damages ultimately collected may differ from the amount of damages claimed. Finally, the actual cost of restoring, rehabilitating, replacing, and/or acquiring the equivalent of the injured resources may differ from the estimated cost. Therefore, trustee officials may need to revise the alternative selected in the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Beijing, March 15 (XINHUA) -- China's environmental  quality has remained basically unchanged in recent years, though  environmental problems has posed a serious challenge to the  country, a senior Chinese environmental official said here today.    At a press conference given by the current session of the  National People's Congress (NPC), Qu Geping, chairman of the NPC  Environmental Protection Committee, said that the country's  environmental quality has "basically remained at the same level  of the 1980s."    He said that economic losses caused by environmental  pollution in China top about 100 billion yuan every year.    Asked about Chinese Government's spendings on environment,  he  said that China spends 20 billion yuan on environment protection  every year, accounting for 0.7 percent of its annual gross  national product. The figure leads all other developing  countries in the world, he said.    He cited the example of Beijing city, which spends an amount  of money that accounts for 2.4 percent of its annual gross  domestic product every year. In the past decade, the city has  spent over ten billion yuan on projects for curbing pollutions.    He noted that the government imposes very low fines on  enterprises which violate environmental protection rules,  prompting some enterprises to pay fines in exchange for  government consent on their spoiling of environment. The total  fines of last year only accounted for 0.11 percent of the  country's annual industrial output.    "We have raised the minimum of the fines by one-third last  year... and we are going to make it even higher, so as to compel  the enterprises to clean up the environment instead of just  paying fines," he said.    Asked about the actual figures for cancers and respiratory  diseases caused by pollution in China, he said that China has  yet to compile a set of complete figures on the impact of  environmental pollution on people's health.    "It is a very complicated job. We are still carrying out  researching programs in this regard," he said.    He said that the Chinese Government did not make public to  the people the World Bank reports on pollution-related diseases  in the country, because it has to consult with relevant  departments to "verify the preciseness of the international  figures."    Asked about China taking out gall bile from living bears, Qu  said that China's wild life protection policy is to "carefully  protect, actively reproduce and rationally utilize" wild animals.    "China has a large number of bears," he said. "On this  precondition, we should consider utilizing them for medical  purposes."    He said that keeping one bear for medical use will avoid the  killing of 220 bears. And the bear will not suffer great pains.</p>

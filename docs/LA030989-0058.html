			<p><P> March 9, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Sudan's Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi has sent an envoy to try to persuade rebels  in the south to accept a truce so that food may be distributed to 100,000  people reported starving to death in the famine-ravaged region. Mahdi told  reporters that he sent his interior minister to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to meet  with the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army. He also said he has accepted a  peace agreement that was previously rejected by his Umma Party and Islamic  militants in Parliament. Meanwhile, a U.N.-sponsored conference opened in  Khartoum, and relief officials said they hoped to get 100,000 tons of food and  medicines into southern Sudan before the spring rainy season.  </P></p>

During this reporter's coverage of the Second Session of the  Eighth National CPPCC Committee, the most intensely discussed  topic among CPPCC members was participation in the  administration and discussion of state affairs. The progression  from political consultation to democratic supervision to  participation in the administration and discussion of state  affairs is unquestionably a new leap in the work of people's  political consultation.    At 49 discussion venues in seven guesthouses and hotels in  the capital city, CPPCC members, citing a multitude of facts,  proved the creative work carried out in people's political  consultation over the past year, which had resulted in a higher  and new level of participation in the administration and  discussion of state affairs by CPPCC members. At the  secretariat of the session, the reporter leafed through special  investigative reports, all of which embodied the painstaking  work carried out by CPPCC members.    Members of the Economy Committee under the National CPPCC  Committee, when discussing their work over the past year, noted:  In participating in the administration and discussion of state  affairs, CPPCC members should adopt proper viewpoints and  correct topics. Since its formation a year ago, the Economy  Committee has carried out work in light of some important  problems in current economic construction and in reform of the  economic structure, producing six special-topic reports which  attracted the attention and favorable comments of the party  Central Committee, the State Council, and relevant central  departments.    "Several Proposals for Tightening Macroeconomic Regulation  and Control and for Reining in Inflation," made by the Economy  Committee last June to deal with problems in the national  economy, maintained: Inflation is now in evidence in our  country. Central policy-making organs should form clear  judgments and adopt forceful measures. The proposals suggested:  To rein in inflation, we must restore banking order and  strictly enforce fiscal discipline. Only by doing so can we  stop the runaway investments in fixed assets and thoroughly  dampen the property boom, the craze in building development  zones, and the stock market boom. The proposals emphasized: A  fundamental solution to economic problems is to allow the market  to play a primary role in deploying resources through reform.  Moreover, the government must establish an effective system of  macroeconomic regulation and control and introduce greater  changes to the banking, financial, taxation, and investment  systems.    After perusal by Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National CPPCC  Committee, the proposals were forwarded to the CPC Central  Committee's Political Bureau Standing Committee for review,  attracting close attention from central leading comrades and  relevant departments. Copies of the proposals were printed and  distributed to vice premiers and state councilors after central  leading comrades had provided written comments on them. They  were also forwarded to comrades in charge of the State Planning  Commission, the State Economic and Trade Commission, the State  Economic Restructuring Commission, the Finance Ministry, and the  People's Bank of China for careful study. The relevant  departments concurred with the National CPPCC Committee's  proposals, saying that they correctly analyzed and judged the  current economic situation. Many of the views outlined in the  proposals were incorporated into documents issued shortly  thereafter by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council on  tightening macroeconomic regulation and control and on reining  in inflation.    General Secretary Jiang Zemin, during an informal discussion  with non-CPC people last June, specifically talked about the  proposals. He said: "The National CPPCC Committee, various  democratic parties, and people with no party affiliation are  very concerned about the current economic situation and have  offered many valuable opinions and useful suggestions for  reform, opening up, and economic construction. The party  Central Committee and the State Council highly value these  opinions and suggestions, have forwarded them to relevant  departments for study, and are assimilating and adopting them in  their work."    Members of the Economy Committee under the National CPPCC  Committee, in reviewing work related to people's consultation  over the past year, said of their profound understanding: To  allow people's consultation to play a genuine role, we should  show concern for major state affairs, keep overall interests in  mind, adopt proper viewpoints and correct topics in light of our  own special conditions, and build on our advantages. Members  who took part in the Economy Committee's investigations said  that the reason their proposals were valued and adopted by the  CPC Central Committee and the State Council was because they  drew on the collective wisdom of members and offered sound  opinions and suggestions for solving the most pressing problems  in the current stage of national economic development.    Almost all members of the 15 committees under the National  CPPCC Committee shared the feelings of their counterparts on the  Economy Committee. Members of the Women and Youth Committee, in  discussing last year's special investigations, maintained: The  establishment of a sound socialist market economic structure  will surely lead to greatly expanded services for women, youth,  and children, as well as some new circumstances and problems.  The focus of the Women and Youth Committee's work in the period  ahead is to conduct investigations and study with regard to  certain salient problems and to offer feasible countermeasures  and proposals.    Last November, members of the Women and Youth Committee  conducted investigations in Guangdong and Fujian to ascertain  the conditions of female and young workers in "partly or wholly  foreign-owned" enterprises in open coastal areas. During their  investigations, the members were given to understand that some  "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises did not pay due  attention to the rights and interests of their workers and staff  members; that there were some problems regarding the employment  of workers, work hours, and the protection of workers and staff  members' dignity; and that some of those problems were quite  serious. To this end, the members made four proposals for  protecting the legitimate rights and interests of workers and  staff members in "partly or wholly foreign-owned" enterprises,  compiling them into a special-topic investigative report.    The report drew the attention of leading comrades at the  State Council and was very well received by leading party and  government departments in coastal areas who thought that the  Women and Youth Committee had addressed a currently important  problem demanding prompt solution.    Mindful of the widening gap in the levels of development  between minority regions and developed coastal areas, the  yet-to-be-solved problem of poverty in some areas, and the host  of new problems in the course of building a socialist market  economy, the Nationalities Committee under the National CPPCC  Committee sent two investigative teams last August to Sichuan  and Guizhou to investigate issues pertaining to poverty relief  efforts and economic development, producing three investigative  reports that served as very useful references. After reading  the reports, State Councilor Luo Gan convened a special meeting  of comrades in charge of relevant departments to hear briefings  by comrades on the investigative teams. Luo Gan fully affirmed  their investigative work, suggesting that the Nationalities  Committee's proposals be incorporated into the report being  drafted by the State Nationalities Affairs Commission on behalf  of the central authorities. Comrades from the the CPC Central  Committee's United Front Work Department and Policy Research  Office, after reading the reports, said that the reports were of  great value and that they were studying the problems reflected  in the reports.    When discussing their understanding during the session,  CPPCC  members who had conducted the investigations focused on this  topic: One of the important things to do in participating in the  administration and discussion of state affairs is to conduct  special investigations and study, which should be in-depth,  oriented toward practical results, and designed to aid practical  work.    According to statistics compiled by the National CPPCC  Committee's General Office, the various special committees under  the National CPPCC Committee have, over the past year, conducted  special investigations and study on some important issues  concerning the two civilizations and united front work,  producing 24 investigative reports. The views outlined in many  of those reports have attracted the attention of the CPC Central  Committee, the State Council, and the departments and localities  concerned, and quite a few opinions have been adopted.    It has become the keynote of the new term of the National  CPPCC Committee to guide participation in the administration and  discussion of state affairs by promoting awareness about reform  and opening up, and to encourage such participation by  harnessing the CPPCC's unique characteristics and advantages so  as to adapt participation in the administration and discussion  of state affairs at high levels to the need for establishing a  socialist market economic structure. During the current  session, CPPCC members noted: From now on, we will participate  in the administration and discussion of state affairs while  bearing in mind the central task of the party and the state;  improve practical results; harness the advantages of the CPPCC's  intellectual pool, information sources, and broad channels at  both higher and lower levels, so as to actively promote  socialist modernization.</p>

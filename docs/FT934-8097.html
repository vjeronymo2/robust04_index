			<p>931117 FT  17 NOV 93 / Observer: Archie derailed Now you see him, now you don't. Early yesterday morning Transport Secretary John MacGregor announced the board of Bob Horton's Railtrack, which will look after Britain's privatised railways. Two hours later the DoT added Asda boss Archie Norman's name to a revised list of Railtrack board members. But by teatime the DoT was saying that Norman's name was an error. When contacted, the DoT said that the problem was at Railtrack's end of the line. Its number was unavailable and Archie Norman was otherwise engaged. The word from Railtrack is that Norman will climb aboard when the documentation is complete. What's wrong? Doesn't he have the right sort of ticket? What a way to run a railroad.</p>

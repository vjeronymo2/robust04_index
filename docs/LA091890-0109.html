			<p><P> September 18, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> SIR SPEEDY PAYS $4 MILLION FOR ACCOUNTING FRANCHISER  </P> <P> Sir Speedy Inc., a quick-printing franchiser based here, said Monday it has  acquired Comprehensive Accounting Corp., an Illinois franchiser of accounting  services, for more than $4 million in cash.  </P> <P> The sale, which includes certain franchise contracts, trademarks, trade secrets  and accounts receivable, will mark Sir Speedy's entry into the financial  services industry.  </P> <P> Comprehensive operates 223 franchise outlets throughout the United States. The  outlets are staffed by certified accountants who provide monthly accounting,  bookkeeping, tax and business consulting services primarily to small and  medium-size businesses. Founded in 1949, the company had revenue of $10 million  in 1989.  </P> <P> Comprehensive plans to move its headquarters from Aurora, Ill., to Carlsbad in  San Diego County in November, said Don Lowe, Sir Speedy president and chief  executive. He said about half of Comprehensive's 37 employees have agreed to be  relocated to California and 20 more employees will be hired by the year's end.  </P> <P> The company eventually will change its name to Comprehensive Business Services  Inc. Sir Speedy plans to merge the operations of its subsidiary, California  Franchise Industries Inc., into the new company, Lowe said.  </P> <P> "What we liked about (Comprehensive) is that their customers and ours are about  the same -- small and mid-size companies -- and we're both in the franchising  business," Lowe said. As the service sector expands at a faster rate than other  U.S. businesses and new business formation continues to rise, Lowe said there  will be an increased need for accounting and printing services.  </P> <P> C. Robert Wissler, a Sir Speedy senior vice president, has been named president  and chief operating officer of Comprehensive, which will be operated as a  subsidiary of Sir Speedy.  </P></p>

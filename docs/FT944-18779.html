			<p>941001 FT  01 OCT 94 / Food and Drink: Sotheby's looks to Dollars 1m sale For all its louche image, New York can still show a puritanical streak, most notably over the trade in liquor. No retailer can own more than one outlet for selling wines and spirits and, until this year, wine auctions were forbidden in the city. The New York Liquor Board bowed to heavy lobbying from the retail and wholesale trades, which did not want a cosy duopoly threatened. So next Saturday is something of an occasion. Sotheby's, in co-operation with Sherry-Lehmann, which owns a well-respected liquor store on Madison Avenue, is holding its first sale in New York, and expects to raise more than Dollars 1m from almost 1,000 lots of wine. Oddly enough, Sherry-Lehmann was one of the fiercest opponents of wine auctions but it is under its licence that Sotheby's is conducting the auction in its York Avenue premises. There is plenty of wine to sell on the East Coast. The Americans were enthusiastic buyers of wine during the boom years of the 1980s and now that prices have recovered from the post-1990 slump there are many well-stocked cellars ready for thinning. Unlike London, where auctions concentrate on the wines of Bordeaux and, to a lesser extent Burgundy, New York will also offer Californian wines: included in the first sale is an Imperial of Caymus 'Special Selection' Cabernet Sauvignon 1986 estimated at up to Dollars 1,300. It comes from the cellar of Sam Kaplan, a noted Manhattan lawyer, who has consigned almost 375 cases of wine, including the much sought-after Cheval Blanc 1982, with a case estimated at up to Dollars 2,200. Even older wine comes from the cellar of John Packard and his father, the late Frank Packard, who, along with Alexis Lichine, Andre Simon and Frank Schoonmaker, is credited with popularising top quality French wines in the US. The wines have been stored at extremely cold temperatures and Sotheby's reckons they taste 'young and vibrant'. A case of the 1928 Chateau Lascombes carries a top estimate of Dollars 3,000. The Americans have lost their enthusiasm for oddities. In the 1980s an American collector, or merchant, (often the late Malcolm Forbes), could be relied on to bid thousands of pounds in the London auction rooms for some undrinkable 19th or even 18th century bottle. It helped if it had once belonged to Thomas Jefferson. The wines were placed in the windows of shops or graced wine lists. They were never meant to be drunk. One reminder of those dead days appears in the Sotheby's auction - a magnum of 1870 Chateau Lafite which carries the label of Glamis castle in Scotland, the home of the Queen Mother. The magnum was sold at Christie's in 1971 and was recorked at the Chateau in 1991. It is said to be very drinkable: 'For the wine lover who wants the ultimate experience,' oozes the catalogue. It can be yours for approaching Dollars 20,000. Sotheby's hopes to bring in Dollars 5m a year from four auctions in New York and has already scheduled the next sale for February 4. Christie's, which holds more auctions and brings in more turnover than Sotheby's in wine, is watching closely. If it can find the right New York partner it will certainly enter the field soon.</p>

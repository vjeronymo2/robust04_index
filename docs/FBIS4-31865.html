			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Pool" item] </F>   [Text] Belgrade, June 16 (TANJUG) -- Egyptian Belgrade  Embassy charge d'affaires Taysir Husayn was handed Thursday a  Yugoslav Government note in which Egypt, which hosted the  Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) ministerial conference in early May,  was requested to officially publish Yugoslavia's reservations  regarding the document adopted at the conference, especially the  part pertaining to the crisis on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia.    The Egyptian diplomat was told that the Federal Republic of  Yugoslavia (F.R.Y.) believes the document was one-sided, that it  based its conclusions on untruths and that as such aligned the  movement with one side in the civil war in the former  Bosnia-Herzegovina.    The document blames solely the Serbs for the civil war in  Bosnia, and totally exonerates from responsibility the Croats  and Moslems. It was unacceptable for a non-aligned conference  document to even negate the existence of the F.R.Y. (only Serbia  and Montenegro, the the F.R.Y. federal units, are mentioned).  It was also unacceptable to urge maintaining of the sanctions  against the F.R.Y., although the world was by large discussing  and considering modalities of their lifting, said the F.R.Y.  note.    The Yugoslav side expressed both regret and disappointment  that Yugoslavia, as one co-founders of NAM, was prevented from  participating in the ministerial conference in Caico. As the  Egyptian charge d'affaires was informed, this was interpreted in  Belgrade as violation of the democratic practice and tradition  of NAM. Also, it was emphasized that the statement of Egyptian  Foreign Ministry spokesman that Yugoslavia had refused to  participate in the conference was both unfounded and untrue.</p>

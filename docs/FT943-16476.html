			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Gonzalez 'needed in Madrid' The reluctance of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the Spanish prime minister, to run for the European Commission presidency was reinforced at the weekend in the form of a warning from his most powerful political ally about the problems it would create if Mr Gonzalez left Madrid for Brussels. Mr Jordi Pujol, the Catalan regional president whose party holds the balance of power in the Spanish parliament, said Mr Gonzalez would be 'a good candidate' for the Commission post following the deadlock at the Corfu summit. But he said that if Mr Gonzalez accepted the job it would create 'a very difficult problem for Spanish politics'. It was therefore logical that Mr Gonzalez should decline. 'There is a lot of work to do in Spain,' Mr Pujol said. Mr Gonzalez last week denied that he was interested in the Brussels post.</p>

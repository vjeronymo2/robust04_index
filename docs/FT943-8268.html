			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / People: Foreign holidays push UK into deficit on the tourism account Ministers currently on holiday on the Continent might fret about the UK balance of payments deficit. They will probably not reflect on their part in creating it. Foreign holidays helped push the UK into a Pounds 3.1bn deficit on the tourism account last year. Sir John Egan, chief executive of BAA, the airports group, wants to help return the tourism account to surplus. He has been named chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's Tourism Action Group. He is already chairman of the London Tourist Board and a member of the board of the British Tourist Authority. His interest is natural, he says. Most visitors to and from the UK pass through his airports. His new role follows the CBI's decision to become more closely involved in tourism, one of the UK's biggest industries. The problem is not so much one of attracting foreigners to the UK; a record 20m are expected this year. The difficulty is persuading more Britons to take their holidays at home. Sir John (below) says much of the problem is that UK tourist facilities are often of low standard and represent poor value for money.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> D. Selection of Basis and Level of Proposed Standards for New Sources  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 1. BLR Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> For new sources, the MACT floor shall be no less stringent than the level representing the best controlled similar source. For new BLR sources, the MACT floor for the portion of the source consisting of the combination of process vents, storage tanks and wastewater is achieved by: (1) Routing process vents and storage tank vents to a common water scrubber with an efficiency of 99 percent; (2) recirculating scrubber effluent back to the process, and (3) Controlling HAP emissions from wastewater by 99 percent. This strategy represents a 99 percent emission reduction for this portion of the source. No regulatory alternatives more stringent than the new source MACT floor could be identified for this portion of new BLR sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The MACT floor for the equipment leaks portion of new BLR sources is the LDAR program of 40 CFR part 60, subpart VV.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Regulatory Alternative I for new BLR sources would require sources to implement the subpart H LDAR program to control equipment leaks, in addition to the MACT floor requirement for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater. The subpart H LDAR program represents a cost-effective control option for equipment leaks with significant emission reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. For these reasons, the Administrator chose Regulatory Alternative I as the proposed standard for new BLR sources.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 2. WSR Source Category  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The MACT floor for process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater for new wet strength resin facilities is achieved by equipping the batch reactor with a cooling water condenser, and by operating the process without the use of hydrochloric acid and prohibiting the formation of methanol. This represents the highest level of control that is technically feasible. Therefore, no regulatory alternatives above the MACT floor could be identified.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because no existing facility in the WSR source category is controlling equipment leak emissions, the MACT floor represents an uncontrolled situation. Regulatory Alternative I for new WSR sources is the LDAR program described in 40 CFR part 63, subpart H for the equipment leaks portion of the source (the same as for existing facilities), and the MACT floor equipment standard described in the previous paragraph for the process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater portion of the source. In evaluating Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator considered the impacts (air, costs, water, and energy). Considering the emission reduction and cost of Regulatory Alternative I, the Administrator judged this option to be unreasonable. No additional water or energy impacts were associated with Regulatory Alternative I; therefore, water and energy impacts were not a factor in the decision to reject Regulatory Alternative I.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because the only Regulatory Alternative above the MACT floor was judged to be unreasonable, the control levels proposed for both the combined process vents, storage tanks, and wastewater emission points, as well as the equipment leaks portions of new WSR sources are the MACT floor levels. However, the Administrator proposes the implementation of the subpart H LDAR program for equipment leaks as an equivalent standard for new WSR sources. The subpart H LDAR program represents an effective control option with reasonable associated costs for the equipment leaks portion of the source, with significant emission reductions, no negative water impacts, and negligible energy impacts. The subpart H LDAR program was chosen as an alternative standard because it achieves an emission reduction which is equivalent to or better from that achieved by the technology basis for the floor level of control for vents, tanks, and water and because costs of implementation of this LDAR program are expected to be much more reasonable than those incurred from requiring compliance with the emission limit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

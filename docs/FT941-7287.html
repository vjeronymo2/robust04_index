			<p>940225 FT  25 FEB 94 / Letters to the Editor: Better to lock in directors with options - or offer them a riskier route? (1) Sir, While the position outlined by Mr C W Daws (Letters, February 22) regarding share options is correct it overlooked another central point. Share options, as well as rewarding directors, normally, by their structure, tie them to a company for a number of years as it is usual to have a waiting period before the option can be exercised. A cash bonus scheme could only achieve this same aim if payment were deferred for several years, perhaps on a 'rolling forward' basis.

			<p><P> October 29, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Applause for Randy Fitts and his chiding of the poor diction in TV (Viewers'  Views, Oct. 8). While it would be fine to get Martha Ray to put the "g" back in  "strength," there are worse offenses, such as anchorpersons who keep saying  "Bill," "Kel," "Linda," "Bree," "Keith," etc. to each other as they read the  news off the TelePrompTer.  </P> <P> Troxey Kemper, Los Angeles  </P></p>

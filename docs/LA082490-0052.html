			<p><P> August 24, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Marketing Deal Scrapped: Procter &amp; Gamble Co. and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.  said they are canceling a marketing agreement that the Justice Department  challenged on antitrust grounds.  </P> <P> The deal would have given Cincinnati-based P&amp;G, which makes the  Pepto-Bismol stomach remedy, exclusive rights to sell Ft. Washington, Pa.-based  Rorer's Maalox antacid. On Aug. 7, the department said it would challenge the  deal on grounds that it would reduce competition and raise prices in the  stomach remedy market.  </P></p>

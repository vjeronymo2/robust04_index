			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Steelmaking gear may be sold BRITISH STEEL is negotiating with an unnamed Indonesian company for the sale of plant and equipment from the Ravenscraig steelworks in Scotland, which closed in June with the loss of 1,200 jobs. The potential purchaser would transport the equipment to Indonesia to make steel for the Far Eastern market, which is expected to be the most important growth area in the world steel market over the next few years. Reports that the steel would then be exported back to the UK were being discounted yesterday. The dominant Indonesian steel company is state-owned Krakatau Steel, but there are smaller private producers and conglomerates such as Bakrie and Brothers which have steel interests. It is believed the Indonesian company is likely to be interested in steelmaking machinery and control equipment rather than blast furnaces. The equipment could include the hot strip mill, commissioned in 1962 and closed early last year. The mill was regarded as an efficient strip producer but too small to be economic except at very high throughput levels. The Scottish National party said: 'This gives the lie to British Steel's claim that Ravenscraig was clapped out or uncompetitive.' But Dr Jeremy Bray, Labour MP for Motherwell South, which includes the plant, said: 'Ravenscraig is never going to operate again so the sale of the plant doesn't affect Motherwell.'</p>

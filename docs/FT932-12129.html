			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / International Capital Markets: South Korean securities firms return to profit COMBINED net profits of South Korea's 32 securities firms jumped to Won451.7bn (Dollars 570m) in the year to March from Won15.8bn in the previous year as the Seoul bourse posted its first sustained recovery in three years, the Securities Supervisory Board said. All the firms reported profits during the year. In contrast, 10 of them, including six of the seven leaders, had losses in fiscal 1991. The general index of the Seoul bourse rose by almost 10 per cent during 1992-93, while trading volume rose by 50 per cent. Increased bond transactions also contributed to higher profits. Daewoo Securities was the most profitable with a Won57.1bn surplus, against Won10bn the year before. It was followed by Lucky Securities with Won44.1bn against a loss of Won2.5bn and Dongsuh Securities with Won40.1bn against a loss of Won5.8bn. Jardine Fleming has opened its first office in Pakistan, AP-DJ reports. The merchant banking arm of Jardine Matheson group said the office, based in Lahore, would provide fundamental research on companies listed on the stock exchanges of Karachi and Lahore. Jardine Fleming hopes to expand to other securities-related activities in Pakistan in due course. Alan Smith, managing director of Jardine Fleming in Hong Kong, is confident of Pakistan's long-term outlook for international investors, citing the country's potential for widespread privatisation of nationalised enterprises. The new establishment brings the number of Jardine Fleming offices throughout the Asia-Pacific region to 16.</p>

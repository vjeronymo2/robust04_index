			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> NATION;  </P> <P> RESIDENT IN $49-A-WEEK YMCA ROOM DIES, AND LEAVES $249,746  </P> <P> A former Pasadena, Calif., man who lived in a $49-a-week room at the YMCA and  spent as little as $6 a day on food died with $249,746 in eight banks across  the country and no apparent heirs.  </P> <P> Thomas Drummond's room had no bathroom, and he bought three $1.99 breakfasts  each morning, saving two of them in a knapsack for later meals, acquaintances  said.  </P> <P> Drummond, 77, died Jan. 28 in Sparrow Hospital. Unless relatives are found, his  money will go to Michigan's general fund, said Paul Rosenbaum, the  state-appointed lawyer handling the estate.  </P> <P> Rosenbaum said Drummond, a former bank employee and postal worker, had lived  and worked in Pasadena until he retired in 1973. He later moved to Denver,  where he stayed until 1981, then moved around until he arrived in Lansing in  1985.  </P></p>

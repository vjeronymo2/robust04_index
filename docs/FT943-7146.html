			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / Zedillo vote tops 50% mark Mr Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party won more than 50 per cent of the vote in Sunday's presidential election, according to the latest figures released by the Federal Electoral Institute, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico City. The PRI vote has edged above the symbolically important 50 per cent mark thanks to strong support in rural areas, where ballots have been counted last. With about 90 per cent of results in, the PRI vote stood at 50.1 per cent, the centre-right National Action Party at 26.8 per cent, and the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution at 17 per cent. Turnout was 77.6 per cent, far higher than predicted.</p>

Just a few "details of protocol"  still have to be settled, FRG Interior Minister Manfred Kanther  (Christian Democratic Union) said in an interview with  FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINE SONNTAGSZEITUNG.    More than a week ago the two countries agreed on the basic  text. According to this agreement, people who cross the border  illegally can be deported during a period of up to a year after  the crossing of the border. During the first three days it will  be possible to send them back without starting asylum procedures.    In 1993 about 30,000 people entered Germany illegally from  the Czech Republic, Kanther said. The focus is the Czech-Saxony  border, because there the country is "extremely difficult."  Prague has developed into the "center of criminal smuggling of  people."    The weekly FOCUS reports that the amount of money that  Germany has to pay in return for the agreement has not yet been  negotiated. Prague reportedly declared the sum of 120 million  marks to be a "yardstick," which had been promised to Poland  after the conclusion of a similar agreement with the FRG about a  year ago.</p>

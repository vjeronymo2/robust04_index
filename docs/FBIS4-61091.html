			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "Novosti" newscast] </F>   [Text] Public opinion believes that to rocket and space  technology have almost incredible power to do harm, though its  harmful effect on the environment is far smaller than that of  some chemical recovery carbonization combines or integrated pulp  and paper mills. Besides, Russian rockets do not destroy the  ozone layer, unlike U.S. and French ones, which use  powder-fuelled booster rockets. But the military-space forces  are trying to minimize even this small risk.    [Begin A. Kuzin, doctor of technological sciences,  recording]  We have raised the question of incorporating an ecological  element in every launch of booster rockets. This element will  include searching for and collecting metallic fragments and  utilizing them, as well as carrying out restorative work in  restricted areas. [end recording]    [Correspondent Galkin] There will soon be nowhere in our  country where someone wishing to sow or let cattle graze need  fear a piece of rocket falling on his head or poisonous fuel  pouring down on him. One can say that these problems have  already been solved. The military ecologists are turning their  gaze toward the next millennium, when space around the Earth  will have to be cleared of space flight debris.    [Begin Kuzin recording] These might be exotic methods using  high-energy lasers to disperse relatively small pieces of space  flight debris. These might also be minesweeper type facilities  in space to gather large fragments and bring them back to land.  [end recording]    [Galkin] So there is every reason to believe that earth-  dwellers can avoid a global ecological disaster, at least  according to these sources.

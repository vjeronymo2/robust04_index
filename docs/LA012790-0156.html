			<p><P> January 27, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STUDENTS MAKE HANDS ACROSS BORDER A SUCCESS;  </P> <P> FRIENDSHIP: ARIZONA PARENTS FIND THEIR CHILDREN DON'T GET SHOT GOING INTO  MEXICO. MEXICAN PARENTS LEARN THAT DRUG-DEALING PORNOGRAPHERS ARE NOT STANDARD  ON AMERICAN PLAYGROUNDS.  </P> <P> Palominas, Ariz., has always been only nine miles from Mexico, but it wasn't  until 1981 that the school district decided to take advantage of it.  </P> <P> A students exchange would broaden students' education, thought District Supt.  Gene Brust, so he formed a committee to look into it. Palominas parents were  alarmed: "Will our children be shot crossing the border? Isn't the water  dangerous to drink?"  </P> <P> Parents in Sonora, Mexico, were equally concerned: "Might our children be  accosted by drug-dealing pornographers on the school playgrounds of the rock  'n' roll society to the north?"  </P> <P> Such were the stereotypes that the Hands Across the Border program has helped  to erase.  </P> <P> A visit to Sonora by the Palominas planning committee completely changed the  direction of the parents' thoughts about Mexico, Brust says. "They realized  that they and the Sonorans had common desires, expectations and goals for their  children in the areas of education, family values and community social  structures.  </P> <P> "It caught fire with one or two other schools, won a few awards . . . , and  seemed to just take off from there," Brust said. Since that first trip in 1981,  about 1,000 students have participated in the exchanges.  </P> <P> The Hands Across the Border Foundation was established two years ago by Brust  and others to develop a model exchange program and to help other schools secure  funding for such programs. The foundation provides a workshop and consultant to  help schools work with their school boards and communities.  </P> <P> "Most importantly, we made new friends," said Cecelia Pasquiera, a student from  Arizpe, Mexico, who participated in a 1986 exchange. "We understand each other,  even though we speak different languages and have different customs. For me, in  particular, it's a way to move us to learn English in order to better  communicate."  </P> <P> Three years ago, Cecelia and her sixth-grade classmates visited Palominas.  Cecelia stayed with Becky Pickett, then a 13-year-old student from Palominas,  and went to her school.  </P> <P> "Playing on the school's computers was the highlight of U. S. school for me,"  Cecelia said. "The countries are so close to each other, yet very different. I  learned about American food, families and the way of getting along together."  </P> <P> Becky and some fifth-grade classmates then visited Arizpe for three days and  two nights. Becky stayed with Cecelia and her parents, played baseball in the  plaza, visited Cecelia's school and participated in a cultural night there.  </P> <P> Becky's schoolmates presented flags and information in Spanish about other  foreign countries. Cecelia and her classmates gave their new friends small  decorated boxes that they had made and filled with Mexican candy. "Language  didn't seem to be a problem -- if we couldn't figure out how to say a word,  we'd sign it," Becky said. "The best part for me was seeing how they live  differently and how close their family is."  </P> <P> Most participating students know a little of the others' language. English is a  required subject in Mexican schools, although Spanish is not in Arizona's.  However, most of the schools involved in the exchanges have set up volunteer  programs so that the children are exposed to some basic Spanish vocabulary  before visiting Mexico.  </P> <P> Hands Across the Border has been endorsed by the Arizona superintendent of  public instruction and the Sonoran secretary of education.  </P> <P> Arturo Silva, undersecretary of education for the state of Sonora and a board  member of the Hands Across the Border Foundation, said: "It is most wonderful  for children to learn to get along better and talk about the same things. We  are very excited with the success of the program and are looking forward to  expanding to more states."  </P> <P> The first International Conference for Hands Across the Border was held in  Guaymas, Sonora, last March.  </P> <P> "More and more people are concerned with where we are going in our  relationships with Mexico. We received inquiries from schools in California,  Texas and Canada about the model we've developed," said Carlos Nagel, the  program's consultant. Six new schools joined the program at the conference;  there are now 40 schools participating.  </P></p>

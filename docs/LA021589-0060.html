			<p><P> February 15, 1989, Wednesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION  </P> <P> The traditional classroom, with its lecturing teachers and workbooks, is  turning out students with basic skills but little more, a new report said. The  National Assessment of Educational Progress called for major changes in how and  what American students are taught, based on 20 years of evaluations funded by  the Education Department. The group credited "relatively traditional"  classrooms with gains at the lower levels of achievement. But it said teachers  will have to become less authoritarian and students less passive if more  sophisticated learning is to occur. The group has studied the math, science,  reading and writing performance of 9-, 13- and 17-year-olds for 20 years under  the auspices of the private Educational Testing Service.  </P></p>

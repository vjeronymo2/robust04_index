			<p>921010 FT  10 OCT 92 / Danes outline looser ties with EC to help ratify Maastricht DENMARK drew a cautious response from Brussels yesterday when it proposed a series of options for loosening its links with the European Community. Senior EC officials stressed that the long-awaited Danish white paper was just a first step in a lengthy process of negotiation between Denmark and her 11 partners on how to secure Danish ratification of the Maastricht treaty. Denmark put forward the proposals in an attempt to find a workable framework for its future relationship with the EC. These links have been put in jeopardy by Denmark's rejection of the treaty in its June referendum. One of the eight white paper options likely to be studied with particular attention is a proposal under which Denmark could ratify the Maastricht treaty, subject to a time limit. It could then withdraw if the Community develops in ways which are not compatible with Danish interests. Another option in the paper proposes introducing additional clauses to the treaty. These would affect all 12 member-states. The paper also proposes giving Denmark a special status in the Community. The EC's fundamental problem is that the treaty cannot come into force until it has been ratified by all 12 member-states. For the moment, there is a consensus among Denmark's partners that there can be no renegotiation of the treaty. Diplomats and legal experts in European capitals are urgently examining wording which could accommodate the Danes without amounting to an amendment of Maastricht, which would require re-ratification. One potential solution being studied in Brussels is to produce a declaration of 'common ground' on the need for subsidiarity - decision-making at the lowest appropriate level - signed by the 11 members and Denmark. A political declaration covering other specific Danish requests could be produced in a form short of a protocol. This would not require re-ratification of the treaty but would draw on specific EC laws and would offer reassurance to Danes on issues of concern - citizenship, defence and the environment. Danish officials say the white paper represents the starting point for negotiations between prime minister Poul Schluter's minority government and other parties in the Folketing (parliament). The Danish foreign ministry describes it as 'an analytical tool for the politicians'. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, said he hoped a Danish paper with more concrete proposals would be ready in November. This could allow a framework agreement to be reached with other EC governments at the Edinburgh summit in December. Multiple choice, Page 3</p>

			<p>940425 FT  25 APR 94 / International Company News: Australian gold miner up slightly Placer Pacific, the Australian-based gold-mining company majority-owned by Canada's Placer Dome, reported after-tax profits of ADollars 20.8m (USDollars 14.9m) in the three months to end-March, writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. This compared with ADollars 19.3m in the same period of the previous year. Revenues were ADollars 127m, up from ADollars 123.6m in the first quarter of 1993. Placer attributed the increased earnings to higher selling prices and reductions in operating costs. Gold production from its interests in the Misima, Porgera and Kidston gold-mines were 'ahead of target'. However, production from the Granny Smith mine was lower than projected. The average price received per ounce of gold in the first quarter was ADollars 550, against ADollars 516 in the first quarter of 1993. Placer also said its feasibility study on the Osborne copper/gold project in north-west Queensland was nearing completion.</p>

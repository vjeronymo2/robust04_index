			<p>CSO     [Text] The director of the Gachsaran Reconstruction Jihad  said: Natural resources are endangered in the province of  Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad due to utilization without regard to  technical and scientific principles.    Engineer Nehavandi said: The amount of livestock in this  province exceeds the capacity of the pastures and the fuel for  70 percent of the rural people is procured from the wood of  forest trees.    He added: In addition to this, the conversion of pastures  for  low-yield dry farming and improper plowing on slopes has  destroyed the plant cover and the good fodder. With the  destruction of the pastures and forests, the soil in this  province is eroding rapidly.    Among the damaging effects of the destruction of natural  resources in this province, he cited the harmful floods of the  last few years in Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad and the excessive  rural emigration to the cities.    Of the 16,000 square kilometers of total area in the  province  of Kohkiluyeh va Boyer Ahmad, 230,000 hectares is agricultural  lands and the rest is forest and pasture.</p>

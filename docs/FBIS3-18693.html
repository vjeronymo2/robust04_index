The prime ministers are,  however, allaying the fears of the EU, denying that a Nordic  bloc is being created within the community. Kimmo Henriksson  reports from Stockholm on the prime ministers' meeting:    [Henriksson] The future of Nordic cooperation in the EU has  aroused concern at the session of the Nordic Council that has  opened here in Stockholm, both at the level of parliamentary  deputies and governments. For instance, the main Swedish paper  DAGENS NYHETER thought today that the entire Nordic Council  would become unnecessary following possible EU membership. It  could concentrate merely on distributing cultural prizes.  Indeed, the role of the Council has for many years been  insignificant in sectors other than culture.    The Nordic prime ministers, who were also holding their  meeting here, do, however, give assurances that cooperation will  continue. Carl Bildt of Sweden pointed to the cooperation  during the EU membership negotiations and thought that it would  continue better than ever also during membership.    Esko Aho of Finland was of the same opinion, but at the same  time he reassured the EC, which fears internal blocs, that the  Nordic countries have no intention to organize themselves within  the Union as a pressure group of their own. It is a different  matter how convincing the talking seems at the EU end. As is  known, the Nordic countries have intergovernmental cooperation  that has developed more and more in the last few years and where  the role of host circulates annually from one prime minister to  the other. Whether this is described as bloc building is one of  the sensitive matters that will be heaped upon the Nordic  countries as a result of eventual EU membership.    As for Nordic cooperation on the level of parliamentary  deputies, the prime ministers promise that there will be room  still for that. For instance, Poul Nyrup Rasmussen of Denmark  found at least two specific issues in addition to culture on  which cooperation between parliamentarians could be concentrated  in the future, namely employment and environmental problems.    The Nordic prime ministers again urgently call for the  withdrawal of Russian troops from Estonia and Latvia. At their  joint meeting with the Baltic prime ministers in Stockholm, the  Nordic prime ministers pointed out that Russia has undertaken to  withdraw its troops by the end of August.</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the tests demonstrate that it is safe, then employees may enter the space. If the tests show that it is not safe, then the space must undergo further evaluation by a Marine Chemist or certified industrial hygienist, and corrective action must be taken before employees may enter. After further evaluation, the space must be designated as ``Not Safe for Workers_Enter with Restrictions'' (for example, when ventilation is necessary to maintain flammable concentrations below 10 percent of the lower explosive limit of a gas or vapor) or ``Not Safe for Workers'' (for example, spaces with atmospheres that are immediately dangerous to life or health). Spaces designated as ``Not Safe for Workers_Enter with Restrictions'' or ``Not Safe for Workers'' must be posted with their designation so that employees do not enter the spaces accidentally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Employees who enter confined or enclosed spaces or dangerous atmospheres must be trained to perform their work safely. The standard requires training in hazard recognition, in the use of protective equipment, and in self-rescue techniques. The employer must certify that entrants have been trained before they are allowed to enter confined and enclosed spaces or dangerous atmospheres. In addition, employers must provide for rescue, either by having an on-site rescue team or by arranging for the use of outside rescue services.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A space that has contained a flammable or toxic substance must be cleaned before it can be made ``Safe for entry'' without restrictions. The final rule sets requirements for performing the necessary cold work (such as cleaning, scraping, inspecting the structure, and surveying the space) usually to prepare the spaces for hot work. First, residues of hazardous materials must be removed (for example, flammable liquids are pumped out, then the space is cleaned). The atmosphere within the space must be tested for flammability, and these tests must be repeated as often as necessary throughout the course of work to ensure that the concentration of flammable gases and vapors is in a safe range. (These tests are in addition to the tests required before entry.) The standard also requires ignition sources to be controlled or eliminated during cold work to limit further the possibility of explosion or fire.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> If hot work is to be performed, confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres are classified in two groups. If the spaces contain or have contained flammable liquids or gases or if the spaces are adjacent to such spaces, then a Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person must test and certify the space as safe for hot work. Other types of confined and enclosed spaces and hazardous atmospheres must be tested for safety by a competent person before hot work is allowed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard also contains provisions for maintaining safe working conditions. Pipelines that carry hazardous materials must be blocked or flushed and cleaned to prevent hazardous materials from discharging into a space. The space must be tested periodically to ensure that safe working conditions are maintained. Additionally, work operations must be halted and the space exited when conditions change and the space no longer meets the criteria specified by the Marine Chemist or Coast Guard authorized person for safe work in or on the space.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The standard sets requirements for the posting of confined and enclosed spaces and dangerous atmospheres. The signs must be understood by all employees working in the area and must be posted at the means of access to the work area.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>930301 FT  01 MAR 93 / MPs 'support ending of tax relief' THE PHASING OUT of mortgage interest tax relief is supported by 55 per cent of backbench MPs, according to a survey commissioned by the housing charity Shelter, Alan Pike writes. Shelter says MPs of all parties endorse proposals, which it is publishing today, for better targeted help for homeowners. The charity wants the government to accompany the ending of tax relief - which costs the exchequer Pounds 5bn a year - with other arrangements for helping the needy. These might include a mortgage benefit scheme, based on existing housing benefit, or an alternative form of assistance for low-income home owners, and a review of further ways to help with housing costs. Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, said the recent record mortgage arrears and repossessions, had 'highlighted the absurdity of the current mortgage tax relief policy'. The call to abolish mortgage tax relief is supported by the Tory Reform Group, a moderate Conservative pressure group, in its Budget submission to the chancellor. It believes tax relief should be phased out over five years. In the meantime, the group argues the chancellor should stimulate the housing market by offering homebuyers a cash alternative to tax relief.</p>

			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / Italy's new newspaper alters its approach THE group of northern industrialists backing Italy's new daily newspaper, L'Indipendente, have forced a change of editorship less than three months after its launch. The backers, who include the Danieli, Falck and Levi families, have decided to replace the paper's detached up-market style, modelled on the Anglo-Saxon quality press, with an aggressive approach to try to prop up sagging sales and lack of advertising. Mr Ricardo Franco Levi, the founder editor, is to be replaced by Mr Vittorio Feltri, formerly editor of the weekly magazine Europeo. Mr Arrigo Levi, the former's uncle and one of Italy's foremost columnists, is also due to leave. The paper was launched on November 14. Although the backers hoped sales would stabilise around an 80,000 break-even point, they have fallen close to 35,000. The new editor is thought to be close to the populist Lombard League, which has broken the mould of traditional politics in northern Italy.</p>

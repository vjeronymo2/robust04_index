			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> All comments received are available for review in the Office of the Director, Recreation, Heritage, and Wilderness Resources Staff, Auditors Building, 4th Floor, 201 14th Street SW at Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC, during regular business hours (8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.) Monday through Friday. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Analysis of Public Comment <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Comments on the proposed rule dealt both with general issues, such as the scope and extent of the Secretary's authority under this rule, as well as discrete issues relating to specific provisions enumerated in the proposed rule. In addition, there were several comments urging that language in the Supplementary Information section of the proposed rule be corrected and/or clarified. A summary of the comments and the Department's response follows. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> General Comments <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Scope and Extent of the Secretary's Authority Under This Rule <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Two reviewers raised a number of concerns regarding the use of the Secretary's land acquisition authority to effectuate the standards set out in the rule for private land use and development. The comments reflected the divergent views of the reviewers and, to some degree, a misunderstanding of the system as envisioned in the proposed rule. The comments received on this issue and the Department's response follow. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: The Secretary is impermissibly engaged in the zoning of private lands in the HCNRA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One reviewer suggested that the process set forth in the proposed rule which establishes land use categories and allowable uses within those categories is ``zoning.'' Further, this same reviewer noted that the acquisition of lands without the landowner's consent is ``zoning.'' Finally, this reviewer noted that using condemnation to ensure compliance is an extreme measure and that the Forest Service should attempt to ``work in harmony'' with the private landowners in the HCNRA to ensure compliance. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The proposed rule does not vest the Secretary with zoning authority. Zoning is defined as the division of a community into areas in each of which only certain designated uses of land are permitted, so that a community may develop in an orderly manner. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> While the end result may be the same in terms of protecting an area against potentially incompatible land uses, there is an important distinction between the exercise of a local government's zoning authority and the federal government's eminent domain authority. Zoning laws are rooted in the exercise of a state's police power (usually delegated to a subdivision of the state) to prevent persons under its jurisdiction from using their property to the detriment of the general welfare. The power of eminent domain, on the other hand, is the power to acquire, or to authorize the acquisition of, private property for a public use or purpose without the owner's consent, conditioned upon the payment of just compensation. Because, zoning laws ordinarily do not constitute a taking of property for public use for which compensation must be paid, they differ substantially from the government's right to determine the use of real estate under the power of eminent domain, which requires just compensation. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In the preamble to the proposed rule, the agency went to great length to explain that the mechanism by which the Secretary would protect the HCNRA from incompatible private land use and development was through acquisition (condemnation) rather than regulation (injunction). In the conclusion to the preamble of the proposed rule [58 FR 65304, Col. 2], the agency expressly stated that: ``The proposed regulations have been carefully drafted to avoid any conflict with local zoning authority and any appearance that the Forest Service desires to regulate private land uses.'' Relying on acquisition authority to enforce zoning ordinances is entirely consistent with sections 9 and 10 of the Act. Moreover, this approach is the least intrusive to the private landowners in the HCNRA, and it will not duplicate the role nor supplant the authority of the local governmental units in the HCNRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Department agrees with the reviewer's observation that condemnation is an extreme measure to enforce compliance with the standards set out in this rule. As was stated in the conclusion to the preamble to the proposed rule [59 FR 65304, Col. 2], ``The agency views the use of condemnation authority as a last resort to protect the HCNRA,'' to be instituted only where other, more harmonious measures and attempts to cooperate with the landowners do not succeed. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: The Secretary should more actively regulate private lands in the HCNRA. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Ironically, while one reviewer asserted that the Forest Service had virtually usurped local zoning authority over the private lands in the HCNRA, another reviewer stated that the Forest Service was obligated to assert a more vigorous regulatory role over these same lands. In particular, this reviewer asserted that relying on the condemnation authority delegated to the Secretary in section 9 of the Act will not adequately protect the HCNRA and that the Forest Service must exercise its ``inherent regulatory authority'' over private lands that are adjacent to federal lands. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Response: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In order to properly respond to this comment, the following two questions must be addressed_(1) Does the Secretary have an ``inherent regulatory authority'' vis-a-vis private lands in the HCNRA? and (2) If so, is its exercise necessary to comply with the HCNRA Act? <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department does not dispute the proposition that, pursuant to the Property Clause of the Constitution, Congress has delegated to it the authority to regulate and administer National Forest System lands under the Organic Act; the Multiple-Use, Sustained-Yield Act; the National Forest Management Act; the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act; the Wilderness Act; the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act; and the HCNRA Act, to name just a few. In furtherance of those enactments, regulations throughout title 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations vest broad authority in the Forest Service to manage National Forest System lands and many of the activities that occur thereon. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, these authorities are confined to National Forest System lands and do not apply to private lands. The options regarding regulation on private lands are considerably more limited. To begin with, the Forest Service cannot ``zone'' private lands as that term is commonly understood. ``Zoning'' is an authority that is reserved to the States and their subdivisions under the Constitution. Congress examined this issue prior to the establishment of the Cape Cod National Seashore many years ago. Their analysis then is instructive today. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=21 g=1 f=1 --> The Federal Government does not have authority to directly enact zoning laws applicable to private property in any of the States. If it had such authority, the task of preserving an area such as lower Cape Cod in such a way as to safeguard the interests of private landowners might be somewhat simplified, for Congress could simply enact a zoning law for the area. However, in the division of powers between the States and the Federal Government, it is wisely left to States to adopt zoning laws *&blank;*&blank;* <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, [the Act] requires the Secretary of the Interior to issue regulations as soon as possible after the enactment of the bill setting forth the standards which must be met by town zoning bylaws for purposes of suspending his power of eminent domain. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 04 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The only regulatory authority that the Forest Service possesses relative to private lands is its authority as a landowner to enjoin activities on adjacent or nearby lands which threaten the National Forest land. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> It is the considered judgment of the Department that the acquisition of lands or interests therein, in conjunction with locally established zoning measures, remains the most efficient and viable system to legally control potentially incompatible land use and development in the HCNRA. This is the thrust of this rule. Its success depends on the best efforts of the Forest Service, State and local governments, and landowners in the HCNRA. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> November 30, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CIVIC FORUM: AN UNCONVENTIONAL -- BUT EFFECTIVE -- ENGINE FOR REFORM;  </P> <P> CZECHOSLOVAKIA: THE OPPOSITION GROUP'S OBJECTIVE IS 'NOT TO BE VERY SPECIFIC  ABOUT OUR OBJECTIVES,' ITS LEADERS SAY.  </P> <P> The only requirement for Civic Forum membership, the opposition group's  spokesman, Jiri Dienstbier, said the other day, is a desire to be rid of the  constitutional "leading role" of any political party.  </P> <P> By that standard, the entire, Communist-dominated Czechoslovak Parliament  became eligible Wednesday, when it voted unanimously to amend this country's  basic law to eliminate the controversial clause that for 41 years has given the  Communists a monopoly on power.  </P> <P> That the vote came only 10 days after Civic Forum declared its existence is  testimony to the effectiveness of what has, virtually overnight, become Eastern  Europe's fastest-growing and most talked about democratic movement.  </P> <P> It's an amorphous movement -- and not only proud of it but determined to stay  that way.  </P> <P> "It's growing spontaneously," said Martin Palous, a political scientist and  Civic Forum adviser during a 90-second "interview" as he raced to meet an  American diplomat. "I can't tell you how its organized, because it's not  organized at all. People are forming local centers, and we're putting pins in a  map."  </P> <P> As much as its leaders joke about their lack of organization, however, they're  planning a national congress, possibly in as soon as two weeks.  </P> <P> They talk about their objective being "not to be very specific about our  objectives" -- it keeps everybody on their toes, particularly the  representatives of the system they're determined to overthrow.  </P> <P> They claim to be political amateurs, but their tactics have so far won nothing  but praise, even from grudging admirers among their Communist Party  adversaries.  </P> <P> "They're using the same strategies against us as we used in 1948," when the  Communists took over Czechoslovakia, a party activist said to a diplomatic  acquaintance the other day.  </P> <P> Not quite. As far as anyone knows, Civic Forum hasn't shot anyone yet -- which  makes its record all the more impressive.  </P> <P> The group's temporary headquarters at Prague's Magic Lantern Theater attracts a  constant crush of visitors. On Wednesday, scores were watching a live  television broadcast from an extraordinary session of the Czechoslovak  Parliament on one of two outdoor sets.  </P> <P> Others read the latest handbills posted on the theater walls or taped to the  windows of the clothing store and bookstore on either side. "We Need a Merry  Christmas With a New Government," read one.  </P> <P> Another steady stream of visitors lined up for free literature. "Though I'm  Communist, I fully identify with the demands of Civic Forum," said Karel  Ksandr, 23, who was one of about 50 people queuing up at mid-afternoon  Wednesday. "It seems that these proclamations truly mirror the ideas of a vast  majority of people around me."  </P> <P> There are no dues for Civic Forum membership, although there are cardboard  boxes for donations.  </P> <P> When he announced its formation at a press conference in his living room barely  10 days ago, dissident playwright Vaclav Havel said that "perhaps something  like New Forum in East Germany can develop out of this," though he quickly  added that was probably too optimistic. In fact, the Czechoslovak group has far  surpassed its East German counterpart, and Havel's comment today seems an  extraordinary understatement.  </P> <P> While in the broadest sense both Civic Forum and Poland's Solidarity are social  movements, Czechoslovak activists strongly reject comparison with their  counterparts one country to the north.  </P> <P> "Solidarity had to struggle not for 10 days but for 10 years," said Dienstbier.  "And today there are problems whether Solidarity is a trade union or a  political party. This would certainly represent an obstacle to our main  objective, which is to establish a real plurality of forces."  </P> <P> "Civic Forum is a very loose grouping -- a broad forum," said Havel. "It is not  and cannot be a political party."  </P> <P> While it is negotiating with the government over the membership and program of  a new Cabinet to be nominated by next Sunday, Havel has pledged that "in no  case" will representatives of the group be directly represented.  </P> <P> Civic Forum's leaders appear genuinely uninterested in political roles for  themselves. Their concern is to see the society energized.  </P> <P> Its members scold people who ask them what to do. "We are not your superior  body," the group said in a statement addressed to burgeoning local Civic Forum  groups Wednesday. "You yourselves know what must be done today and what should  be done tomorrow."  </P> <P> Its own personnel seem to change jobs "from day to day," said a diplomat. "The  only thing that seems to be at the center is Vaclav Havel. And even he doesn't  have any formal role. They call him 'chief.' "  </P> <P> "There are a few people on top who consult with a body of about 100 other  people. And that's it," said Jan Urban, one of those 100 advisers. "It's a  group of amateurs, most of them dissidents" associated with the Charter 77  human rights movement here. For example, Urban, a former schoolteacher, was  fired for refusing to sign a condemnation of the original Charter 77  signatories and spent the next dozen years tending horses, working in a factory  and laying bricks.  </P> <P> Then there are the scores of volunteers, like Vladimira Zakova, 28, a Russian  and English translator. "It's just this feeling that we must all do something  to help," she explained Wednesday, during her fifth day on the job. "Earlier, I  was just going to the demonstrations. But then I realized that my knowledge and  abilities could be better used here."  </P> <P> Zakova said she was in the midst of translating an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel  into Czech when the revolution broke out. Because of her activity, "I'm  horribly late" with the job. However, she said, "I think this is more  important. F. Scott Fitzgerald is the only person who would regret this."  </P> <P> Urban describes Civic Forum's decision-making process as "theater revolution. .  . . People sit in the theater, and they discuss. Then they go into different  rooms and discuss in committees. They they join together again, discuss some  more and issue proclamations."  </P> <P> While they may not be practiced politicians, their political instincts have  been unerring so far.  </P> <P> After the brutal police suppression of a student demonstration on Nov. 17, they  recognized a political turning point and organized their movement before most  of the Communist leadership, unaware, returned to town from weekend homes in  the country.  </P> <P> This week, after leading an enormously successful two-hour nationwide strike  Monday, Civic Forum suddenly called off further demonstrations so as not to  risk dulling its main weapon through overuse.  </P> <P> Meeting with an Italian Communist delegation earlier this week, Havel stressed  that Civic Forum is not anti-Communist but anti-totalitarian. In fact, he said,  the group hopes that reform-minded Communists will "rejuvenate" the  Czechoslovak party.  </P> <P> This weekend, the group is supposed to move into new quarters arranged by  Prague's Communist Party leadership. Civic Forum's members were offered space  in the Palace of Culture -- which, ironically, was the site of a major Prague  party meeting last weekend. But they turned it down as too far from the center  of the city.  </P> <P> Despite the speed with which the democratic revolution here has unfolded, Forum  activists figure that much work remains to be done.  </P> <P> "Civic Forum has declared itself a guarantee of holding free elections, and  under no circumstances will it terminate its own activities unless a free  election is held," said Dienstbier.  </P> <P> And what role will it play in those elections?  </P> <P> An amorphous one, it would appear. "History began to develop very quickly in .  . . a country that has had 20 years of timelessness," Havel said earlier this  week while apologizing to journalists for not offering specific answers to  questions about the future. "So don't ask more of us than we are capable of  delivering."  </P></p>

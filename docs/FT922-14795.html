			<p>920404 FT  04 APR 92 / London Stock Exchange: Share prices weaken as election nears THE CLOSE of a two-week stock exchange account, which coincided with the tax-year end, left London's equity market looking worn out as the election campaign moved into its final week. The FT-SE 100-share index dropped a further 22.7 to 2,382.7, its fourth consecutive retreat and its lowest level this year. Yesterday's slide left the index some 65.2 points down on the week, and almost 74 points lower over the account, during which the market has adjusted to the increasing likelihood of a Labour government. There was considerable unease towards the close as sterling came under pressure against the D-mark, after widespread stories of selling by the Saudis. But equity dealers took heart from the fact that there was very little pressure on gilts; the long-dated ended unchanged having been up  1/4 earlier in the session. Equities opened with minor falls across the board, as marketmakers chopped their prices to head off end-account selling. They were also weary of fund managers trying to offload stock in front of the election. The Footsie began the day some 7.5 points lower and quickly lost ground during the early part of the session as the Footsie future dipped away. Dealers said there was 'plenty of stock around during the morning,' with much of it being offered at a discount to ruling market prices. These offers had a decisive effect from midday onwards when the Footsie came under some pressure. The day's low of 2,379.5, or a loss of almost 26 points, was recorded soon after the opening of Wall Street which, down 5 points during the first 30 minutes, was showing a 15 points-plus decline after two hours. Turnover was disappointing in the final trading session of the tax year. Customer business, which had been down on the first two days of this week, expanded rapidly in the middle of the week, after a series of big placings and a sharp expansion in the number of programme trades. Traders said one of the features of recent trading in equities has been the increase in the number of programme trades as well as the huge upturn in the level of business in derivatives. County NatWest calculated that Footsie futures activity ballooned by 60 per cent last week, with FTSE options volumes up some 40 per cent. Turnover, yesterday, reached 532.7m shares, well down on Thursday's 607.2m and the 702m traded on Wednesday - the highest so far this year. Equity retail business rose sharply towards the end of the week as fund managers made final portfolio alterations ahead of the general election.</p>

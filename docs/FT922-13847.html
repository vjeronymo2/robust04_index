			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / Election 1992: Murdoch solid - Ballot Box No election-eve nerves on the part of Rupert Murdoch. Some thought his British newspaper empire might at least hedge its bets in the face of a possible Labour victory, but yesterday demonstrated otherwise. Although Today, Murdoch's faltering middle-market paper, has conducted a fair-minded election campaign in terms of its reporting, its final editorial came down squarely behind John Major, as the man to trust with Britain's future. Predictably, The Times, having visited briefly the arguments for Labour, also argued for the 'likeable, competent and honest' Major. The Sun took a promiscuous two pages, including the front, to make the same point. Murdoch's Sunday papers have already assembled in the blue square. Labour has thus been given no reason to draw back on its manifesto threat to bring the Monopolies and Mergers Commission into the media industry, a move inextricably linked with the party's desire to roll back Murdoch. Some think that faced with a choice, Murdoch might go for TV rather than print. Given his sensitive relationship with his banks, however, it's hard to see him selling cash cows like The Sun, the News of the World and The Sunday Times. Today, however, could be gone tomorrow and, who knows, perhaps The Times would be vulnerable too.</p>

			<p>940323 FT  23 MAR 94 / International Company News: Air France sells duty-free chain Air France, the state-controlled airline, has sold Saresco, its chain of duty-free shops, to Vaturi-Pernod Ricard-Elig, a retail consortium that includes Pernod Ricard, the leading French drinks group. Saresco, which owns a number of restaurants as well as duty-free shops at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris and at Nice airport, is controlled by Servair, the catering subsidiary of Air France. Servair owns 60 per cent of the shares and Aeroports de Paris, the airport operator, has the remaining 40 per cent. The terms of Saresco's sale have been agreed in principle and the deal is expected shortly to be concluded. However, the value of the transaction has not been disclosed. Saresco last year made sales of FFr1.33bn (Dollars 459m), an increase over its FFr1.01bn turnover in the previous year. However, its net profits were depressed by increased investment costs - due to the refurbishment of a number of units - and slipped to FFr27.5m in 1993 from FFr34.4m in 1992. The acquisition of Saresco forms part of the expansion of Vaturi-Pernod Ricard-Elig.</p>

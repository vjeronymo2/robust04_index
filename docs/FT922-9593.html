			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Time Products down to Pounds 7.62m TIME PRODUCTS, the watch and jewellery distributor, yesterday reported a 19 per cent fall in profits but increased the dividend after deciding to close Remex, its uncompetitive Hong Kong subsidiary. Pre-tax profits in the year to January 31 fell from Pounds 9.37m to Pounds 7.62m on sales down 5 per cent at Pounds 51.1m. Earnings per share dipped from 12.16p to 9.74p but the final dividend is increased to 4.85p, giving a total of 7.5p, up 3 per cent on the year. Mr Marcus Margulies, managing director, justified the increase in the dividend on the grounds that the company had never been too generous in the past, had Pounds 20m of cash and was still covering the payment with earnings. Following the restructuring, including the closure of Remex, Mr Margulies said he was confident about the future. The closure of Remex led to a Pounds 4.9m extraordinary item. 'Against the Swiss and Japanese, it was almost impossible to compete,' Mr Margulies said. 'We would have had to jack up the sales in Hong Kong or reduce costs and we just couldn't have done it.' Last year Remex had sales of Pounds 12.2m but made a trading loss. It only reported an operating profit, of Pounds 78,000, after inclusion of property rental income. Margins in the UK were maintained at 12 per cent. 'Whilst the board is not expecting a rapid resurgence of consumer demand, it remains confident in the future of the company as the economy improves,' said Mr Richard Langdon, chairman. The group ended the year with higher stock and debtor levels, and a lower cash position. Mr Margulies said there had been no deterioration in working capital control; one large debtor had paid a bill three days after the year-end and the company had needed to build stock levels at Apollo, the watch strap manufacturer which was acquired last September.</p>

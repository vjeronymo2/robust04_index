			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / Business and the Law: The photocopier as money-spinner - A licensing scheme which seeks to make UK companies pay for reproducing copyrighted material No one is quite certain of the extent of illegal photocopying of extracts from books, periodicals and journals by businesses in the UK. A pilot study in 1988 showed that the annual use by commerce and industry of copyrighted material is about 1.7bn copy pages. That is equivalent to a pile of copier paper 107 miles high, the distance between London and Nottingham as the crow flies. It also represents an enormous loss of copyright income for authors and publishers, including lost revenue from the export of intellectual property of British rights holders. Copyright, which is just one form of intellectual property, is estimated to account for 2.5 to 3 per cent of the UK's gross domestic product. Attempts in the early 1980s by the Copyright Licensing Agency (CLA), Britain's organisation for licensing the reproduction of copyrighted material, to reach agreement with industry for such a scheme came to nothing. But following success in establishing licensing schemes for schools and libraries, and changes in the law made by the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act, the CLA was encouraged to make a further attempt to reach agreement with business. A joint CLA/Confederation of British Industry taskforce was set up in 1989 to examine the issue. Next week, after almost three years of discussions, the CLA will launch a copyright-licensing scheme for business, though complete agreement proved illusive and the CBI did not endorse the plan. Nevertheless, a licensing scheme is to become available from June 2, and that means industry will have to come to terms with paying for something which it is used to getting for free. Those companies which photocopy from books and journals but do not become licensed will face an enhanced risk of legal action by copyright holders. One of the key issues faced by the CLA/CBI taskforce was how to determine the volume, value and variety of copying by businesses without imposing unreasonable administrative costs on companies. As an alternative to a blanket licence, the taskforce looked at the merits of a 'transactional licence', where copies are cleared by the copyright owners as and when needed. Both the CLA and the CBI felt such a scheme would be too difficult to manage compared with a blanket licence. But the CLA argued that an unrestricted blanket licence could have a very damaging effect on primary sales of copyrighted works. In the end the taskforce settled on a two-tier system. Part A of the CLA's plan allows multiple copying up to a certain number of copies. Above that number the licence will not apply. Part B covers access to the CLA's Rapid Clearance Service (Clarcs), a telephone-accessed data-base designed to handle individual requests to copy specific titles outside the scope of the basic licence. Clarcs fees will be payable on a case-by-case basis. The CBI wanted to make Clarcs available separately from a basic Part A licence, but the CLA would not agree, arguing that it is uneconomical for small transactions. The basic licence will allow copies to be taken from publications within the CLA's remit. This includes all books and journals published in the UK except works in categories such as newspapers, maps, exam papers, printed music and industrial house journals. The CLA is also able to license copying from works published in other countries where reciprocal agreements exist between CLA and similar overseas bodies such as the US Copyright Clearance Center. The licence allows businesses to make up to nine copies of one article from a single issue of a journal, or one chapter of a book (or up to 5 per cent of the publication if this is greater), in connection with any single occasion (such as a meeting) or for any single purpose. Copies can be distributed freely within the licensee's business but external distribution is prohibited. Licence fees will be calculated by reference to the number of 'professional employees' within a company, defined as all staff except clerical personnel and apprentices. No price tags have been set out because collective price-fixing agreements are outlawed by competition rules. Instead the taskforce has proposed a basis for a tariff from which a company's charges can be negotiated. As the table shows, the tariff of fees proposed by the CLA will vary for different sectors of industry. This is to reflect the fact that the value of the material copied and the volume of copying will vary from sector to sector. According to Mr Colin Hadley, CLA's chief executive, the experience of foreign copyright licensing agencies, particularly the CCC, makes it possible to predict sector patterns in photocopying. Industries with intensive research and development functions such as pharmaceuticals and energy are by far the heaviest copiers. Nevertheless, if companies are going to feel confident that the licence fees paid are reasonable and the CLA confident of a fair distribution of licence income to individual copyright holders, detailed measurement of volume, value and variety of copying will be needed. It was this issue which proved the main sticking point for the taskforce. Recording the number of copies actually made was rejected by the CBI as too cumbersome. Eventually, it was agreed that companies taking out licences would carry out an 'information audit' once a year, the principal component of which will be a list of periodicals taken by the company. This will give an indication of the range of publications from which copies could have been taken. Licensees will also have to complete an annual return, the contents of which were not agreed by the taskforce. The CLA acknowledged that information audits of companies without a formal library or central information centre were impractical. This is likely to be taken into account when deciding what information should be included in the annual return. The issue of confidentiality of information gained through the audit was also of concern to the CBI. If, for example, information about the type of material being copied by a pharmaceutical company fell into the hands of a rival it might provide invaluable information about lines of research being pursued. But the CLA has assured the CBI that the confidentiality of any information it requests through the audit will be guaranteed. Will industry embrace the CLA's licence scheme? A great deal may depend on the extent to which companies feel they need to be licensed. Many of them believe their current copying activities are permissible as 'fair dealing' under the terms of the 1988 Copyright, Designs and Patents Act. Fair dealing is not defined by the act but is restricted to certain purposes (for example, single copies for research and private study by individuals), and it must be fair both to the user and to the copyright owner. Mr Hadley says fair dealing provides industry with 'a convenient excuse to justify what currently happens'. But multiple copying is unlikely to qualify as fair dealing, he says, and there is some doubt as to what extent routine single copying by individuals in businesses is likely to pass as fair dealing. If industry continues to assert that it is, the issue may have to be tested in the courts, he adds. A recent landmark decision in the US involving Texaco found routine single copying by individuals in businesses was not 'fair use' primarily because the copies were made in furtherance of Texaco's commercial purposes and the copying was not fair to publishers as it deprived them of subscription income. Lawyers predict the English courts will adopt a similar line. But short of legal action, the success of the licence scheme may depend on how successful the CLA is at selling it to businesses. The sales pitch will be concentrated on the heaviest copiers, as well as to law firms, which, if persuaded of the scheme's merits, are likely to encourage their corporate clients to become licensed. 'We won't neglect the publishing industry either,' says Mr Edward Barrow, the CLA's licensing officer. 'If it's going to work, our clients have to be seen to be taking the medicine too.'  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- TARIFF FOR BUSINESS  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Economic activity                   Annual fee per professional employee  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BAND A Nuclear fuel production                               pounds 18 plus VAT Chemicals; pharmaceutical products Man-made fibres Office machinery and data processing equipment Processing of rubber and plastics Research and development Medical, health and vererinary services  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BAND B Coal mining and manufacture of solid fuels         pounds 12.00 plus VAT Mineral oil processing Extraction and preparation of metalliferous oils Metal manufacturing Extraction of other minerals Manufacture of non-metallic mineral products Manufacture of other metal goods Mechanical engineering Electronic and electrical engineering Manufacture of cars and parts Manufacture of othe transport equipment; aerospace Instrument engineering Manufacture of paper and paper products; printing and publishing Business services; legal, accounting and technical services Public administration; national and local government  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- BAND C All other classes of economic activity              pounds 6.00 plus VAT  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Copyright Licensing Agency  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Other losses were precipitated by prior deterioration around windows and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> doors that had allowed moisture to enter, thereby weakening the resistance of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> surrounding wood framing and floor decking. Apparently this deterioration was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a result of inadequate design or enforcement practices, or a combination of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> both. In some manufactured homes the loss of opening protection resulted in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> increased internal pressures within the buildings, which contributed to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure of interior components including ceilings. In other cases, entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> sections of sliding glass doors on leeward walls were literally sucked out of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their frames because of inadequate resistance of the combined assembly to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> wind forces imposed during Hurricane Andrew.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Edges and corners of roofs and endwalls of manufactured homes appeared  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have been particularly vulnerable to the high wind forces, according to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> damage typically reported in these areas. Structural failures of endwalls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also occurred, but the presence of nearby interior shearwalls prevented  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> further losses (though not all designs are provided with interior shearwalls  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the vicinity of the endwall). However, in many other cases, the entire  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> superstructure was completely removed from the floor system.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Numerous anchor system failures were reported in the areas subjected to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the highest wind speeds. Many of the systems failed due to improper  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installation or the type of anchor used. In addition, anchor capacity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appeared to have been reduced further because of the saturated condition of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the soil.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Summary of NIST Report  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> As part of its review of the adequacy of the Federal Manufactured  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Housing Construction and Safety Standards (FMHCSS), the Department contracted  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for a study by Dr. Richard D. Marshall of the National Institute of Standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and Technology (NIST) [Report NISTIR 5189, May 1993]. According to Dr.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Marshall and several other investigative reports, damage to manufactured homes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in Hurricane Andrew ranged from loss of roofing to total destruction. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> general, HUD-labeled units suffered less damage than did pre-HUD units.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, conventional residential construction adjacent to manufactured home  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> parks performed better, in some instances significantly better, than did  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufactured homes. Based on wind speed assessments and damage surveys, it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appears that HUD-labeled manufactured homes began to experience damage to roof  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and wall coverings at fastest-mile wind speeds of up to 95 mph (43 m/s), and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> significant structural damage at wind speeds of from 100 to 120 mph (45 to 54  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> m/s).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Commonly observed failures included loss of roof membranes and blow-off  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of roof sheathing, failure of uplift straps at truss-to-wall connections where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staple crowns pulled through the strap, loss of cladding on endwalls and near  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> corners where large negative (suction) pressures developed, loss of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appurtenances with resultant missile damage and damage to the primary house  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unit at connection points, complete separation of the superstructure from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> floor and chassis frame, and loss of the complete unit because of the failure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of tiedown straps or the withdrawal of soil anchors. The NIST report also  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pointed out that the capacity of the anchors appeared to have exceeded the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> marginal resistance of the superstructure, and that if the superstructure  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> separation failures had not occurred, the number of anchor systems failures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> could have been much more widespread.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In almost every case in Florida, some form of anchoring had been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> installed. Outside the area of strongest winds, there were relatively few  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> anchor failures. Within the radius of strongest winds, anchor failures that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were observed involved 2 ft. (610 mm) helical ground anchors (some embedded in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> about 3 cu.ft. (0.8 cu.m) of concrete) or rock anchors into coral. No  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failures of 4 ft. (1.2 m) helical anchors were noted. However, it is not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> clear that any anchors of that length were actually installed in the area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> subjected to the highest winds.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Dr. Marshall of NIST compared wind load provisions of the current FMHCSS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> with the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Standard ANSI/ASCE 7&hyph;88,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the South Florida Building Code, the Standard Building Code, and wind design  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provisions proposed by the Manufactured Housing Institute. Based on these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comparisons of design loads for manufactured housing units of typical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> dimension and geometry, considering the rationale for using importance factors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and unreduced pressure coefficients, and in view of the fact that it is a true  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> consensus standard, Dr. Marshall concluded that ANSI/ASCE <!-- PJG 0320 forcenewline -->  7&hyph;88 should be the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> basis for updating the wind load requirements for manufactured housing. In  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> addition, since the NIST study only addressed design loads, in the interest of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> safety and economy, it was also recommended that prescriptive requirements of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the proposed standard be consistent with the specified design loads and that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> testing and analysis to assure this consistency be conducted.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> ASCE 7&hyph;88: Consensus Procedures for Development and Adoption  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ASCE, founded in 1852, is the oldest civil engineering organization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the United States and has a membership of more than 110,000. The ANSI/ASCE  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Standard 7&hyph;88, Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (November 1990) (ASCE 7&hyph;88, in this preamble), was developed by ASCE based on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> studies conducted at academic and research institutions in the United States  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and other parts of the world.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ASCE 7&hyph;88 is the only truly consensus minimum design load standard  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> currently available in the United States. The ASCE rules, approved by the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> American National Standards Institute (ANSI), require all standards committees  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to have a membership balanced between producers, consumers, building  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> officials, and general interest groups. Each of these groups represents  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> between 20% to 40% of the committee membership. At the time ASCE 7&hyph;88 was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adopted, 89 members were on the standards committee.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The approval or revision of an ASCE standard is an elaborate process,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which involves extensive balloting and resolution of all negative votes. When  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a standard is to be adopted, the standards committee is broken down by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expertise into task committees. Those task committees draft the standard and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> present it to the full standards committee for balloting. All objections  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within the standards committee are satisfied by one of three ways: (1) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objector agrees to withdraw the objection; (2) by a vote of 75%, the full  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee accepts the objection and changes the standard; or (3) by a vote of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 75%, the full committee rejects the objection. The full committee then votes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order for the standard to pass the full standards committee, at least  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 65% of the committee membership must vote and 75% of those votes must be in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the affirmative. Moreover, the affirmative votes cannot be less than 55% of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the approved voting membership. After the standard passes the standards  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> committee, it is issued to the public for further comment. As in the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standards committee, all objections are individually considered and processed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in the same manner (i.e., withdrawn or accepted or rejected by a vote of 75%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of the standards committee). After a certain cutoff date and after all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> objections are addressed, the standard is published as an ASCE consensus  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> TEEN WRITERS' HEARTS SURFACE IN WINNING PLAYS  </P> <P> A teen-age boy seeks to spark a friendship into a romance. A man, frustrated  with his job, reduces his wife to a prisoner. A hapless rich man in the 1930s  enlists the help of a talented but poor young woman to conceive a musical. Five  high school runners learn about themselves and one another on a cross-country  track. A boy agonizes about the choice between applying to the college he wants  to go to and his father's alma mater.  </P> <P> Such are the subjects on the minds, hearts and pages of the winning entries in  the fourth annual California Young Playwrights Competition. Three of the works  are being presented (through Jan. 22) as full productions at the Gaslamp  Quarter Theatre Co. The musical "Broads!" and the play "Not What the Doctor  Ordered" -- the conflict about college applications -- are scheduled as staged  readings Jan. 25-29.  </P> <P> When the California Young Playwrights Project (CYPP) debuted in 1985 at the  Gaslamp, even its founder considered it daring. Deborah Salzer, creator and  project director, remembers being "terrified" after getting the go-ahead from  co-founders at both the Gaslamp and San Diego city schools.  </P> <P> "For the whole first year, I didn't even believe  </P> <P> the program existed," she said. "I was afraid no one would write scripts and  afraid no one would show up to see them."  </P> <P> CYPP members began playwrighting workshops in local schools in March, 1984,  collected plays in June and presented them in January, 1985. Audiences gave  their approval, and the project, open to all California students under 19, has  since expanded northward, teaching students in Orange County and Los Angeles as  well.  </P> <P> Salzer's involvement with teen-age artists dates from a decade ago when she was  working in Harlem to start a theater company for young people. One challenge  was finding plays with parts for teen-agers. Then she met Gerald Chapman, a  veteran of a young playwright project in London, whom Stephen Sondheim had  brought to the United States in 1980 to start the Young Playwrights Festival in  New York.  </P> <P> Chapman, now deceased, gave Salzer a handful of scripts the Young Playwrights  Festival had produced for her student theater. In 1982, Salzer took the plays  with her when she moved to San Diego with her husband, Beeb Salzer, who had  accepted a teaching post at San Diego State University.  </P> <P> It was on the basis of these scripts that Salzer convinced the San Diego city  schools and Kit Goldman, managing producer of the Gaslamp Quarter Theatre, of  the potential of a young playwrights program.  </P> <P> In turn, the strength of the scripts at the Gaslamp has led to what Sarah Luft,  a producer at KPBS-TV (Channel 15), said may become a young playwrights series  on the local public broadcasting station.  </P> <P> Last year, Luft accompanied her teen-age daughter to the CYPP festival because  one of her daughter's friends was acting in one of the plays. She was so taken  with the work that she decided to produce for KPBS the play about the troubled  maturation of a young Mexican-American girl, "Simply Maria, or the American  Dream."  </P> <P> Josefina Lopez of Los Angeles, who wrote the semi-autobiographical "Simply  Maria," is now in town making revisions for the TV production. Shooting begins  in March for a summer airing.  </P> <P> At 19, Lopez is now too old to compete in CYPP contests. However, her friend,  Pamela Mshana, also of Los Angeles, is back for a second time.  </P> <P> Last year, Mshana's "Ebony" told the story of a daughter of an unwed mother who  tries to escape her mother's fate only to become an unwed mother in turn. Dell  Books will publish it in a collection next year.  </P> <P> This year, Mshana, an 18-year-old sophomore at New York University, addresses  the issue of a husband abusing his wife in "A Toast to Leslie."  </P> <P> Carla Kirkwood, an Emmy-winning director who was given her choice of CYPP plays  to direct, said she selected Mshana's work because she was stirred by what  Mshana was trying to say.  </P> <P> "The situation that Pamela's play deals with conjures up the Joel Steinberg  case," said Kirkwood, referring to the recent New York trial in which  Steinberg, a lawyer, was tried for beating his illegally adopted daughter to  death.  </P> <P> For Lopez, Mshana and Holly Frenzel, the 16-year-old sophomore at El Capitan  High School in Lakeside who authored "Broads!," the playwrighting contest was  an introduction to CYPP. The three were among the 2,500 students who started  their plays because of CYPP workshops in their schools.  </P> <P> "Searching for the Big Dipper," a story about friendship by Beckie Andersen,  17, a senior at Crawford High School in San Diego, was used in a workshop  taught by local playwright Janet Schechter-Tiger. "Runner's High," by Michele  L. Mitchell, 17, a graduate of Esperanza High in Anaheim who now attends  Northwestern University, was also developed in a workshop, as was "Not What the  Doctor Ordered," the story about a boy torn between applying to Stanford -- his  father's choice -- or to the school he prefers.  </P> <P> Lisa Kirazian, 18, a graduate of Patrick Henry High School in San Diego, who  wrote "Not What the Doctor Ordered," did not know she would be attending  Stanford University herself when she based the play on someone she knew in high  school.  </P> <P> Ironically, although CYPP's breadth and approval rating has never been greater,  the prospective audiences have never been smaller.  </P> <P> Salzer didn't realize that plays with modest casts would translate into modest  advance ticket sales. Last year, the winning plays had large casts, and the 30  actors brought friends and teachers to see their work. This year's full  productions call for a total of 12 actors, some of whom come from SDSU.  </P> <P> The important thing is that the students get a chance to see their work  professionally mounted in an environment where their work is "respected, valued  and safe," Salzer said.  </P> <P> At CYPP, the young playwrights get their work seen by critics and read by  theater professionals. This year, the selection committee included Robert  Blacker, associate director and dramaturge of La Jolla Playhouse; Jessica  Teich, literary manager, Mark Taper Forum; David Hay, associate director, Old  Globe Theatre; Michael Harvey, professor of drama, San Diego State University;  Margaret McKerrow, professor of drama, SDSU, and Will Simpson, artistic  director, Gaslamp Quarter Theatre Company.  </P> <P> Salzer said the rewards come opening night.  </P> <P> "I always feel wonderful watching the playwrights watching their work," Salzer  said. "When Josefina (Lopez) was working with us, she got accepted into a  playwrighting program in New York. The night she had to leave for New York, her  entire family came down to San Diego to see her play. She sat in a place where  she could see the show and see her parents, who spoke no English, hoping that  they would see the love and the humor in the work. Near the end of the play,  the heroine decides to go off and accept a scholarship. She writes a letter of  goodby to her family. She thanks them and tells them she will always be Mexican  in her heart but is leaving to embrace her new country.  </P> <P> "At that point Josefina started weeping because that was exactly what she was  doing in real life. She was weeping because she was relieved to see that her  family accepted her play and that she was sitting in a full house that liked  her work. And I was sitting right next to her, handing her Kleenex and hugging  her.  </P> <P> "I was very happy and felt very alive to be a part of this young woman and her  artistic development. A lot of what rewards me is the nurturing going on. I  felt like her producer and her San Diego mother and her friend all rolled up  into one."  </P></p>

			<p>941123 FT  23 NOV 94 / Tietmeyer rails at Emu criteria: Budget deficits twice what they should be, says Bundesbank chief After highlighting for months the inadequacies of the convergence criteria intended to underpin Europe's proposed monetary union, Germany's most eminent and garrulous spokesman on Emu yesterday came out with a comparatively clear counter-proposal. Mr Hans Tietmeyer, whose other job is president of the Bundesbank, said maximum permissible budget deficits for would-be Emu members under the Maastricht treaties were at least double what they should be. For a country such as Germany, he said, 1 to 1.5 per cent of gross domestic product was nearer the mark than the 'unambitious' 3 per cent written in the treaties. Addressing a seminar in Bonn, where, as Mr Tietmeyer acknowledged, there is a strong feeling that Bundesbank technocrats should run monetary policy and leave elected politicians to run the country and tend European affairs, he was careful not to present the formula as his own idea or one generated within the central bank. He used a routine trick to protect himself and the bank from charges of interfering in the political process, and presented his proposal in the form of a public endorsement of suggestions made by others. In this case, the deficit parameters were put forward last week by the so-called 'five wise men', a group of independent advisers to the finance ministry. Another increasingly familiar ploy was put to work in the same speech yesterday. 'Of course, the Bundesbank is no more responsible for social policy than it is for finance policy ..' he said, prefacing a catalogue of characteristically uncomfortable suggestions for the government. But as the increasingly prescriptive tone of Mr Tietmeyer's speeches and media interviews indicates, the convention that central bank officials should avoid political interference is one which chafes sorely. As a one-time state secretary in the finance ministry, and responsible for the Bundesbank's foreign relations before his elevation to the presidency a year ago, Mr Tietmeyer is well known internationally and well accustomed to agenda-setting. Partly as a result he is also proving to be far more confident than his predecessor, Mr Helmut Schlesinger - not to mention his current colleagues on the permanent directorate - at manoeuvring on the knife-edge between managing monetary policy and overt politicking. But his apparent command of the broad horizons is also due in part to the fact that he, with the occasional exception of Mr Otmar Issing, chief economist for the Bundesbank's directorate, has granted himself almost exclusive rights as public spokesman for the Bundesbank. Mr Tietmeyer took a firm hold of the Bundesbank's external communications after loose talk by some of his colleagues led to confusion about the directorate's policy aims early this year, and when confused explanations of rampant money supply growth brought the bank's prized credibility into question. He has not let up since. In the first 12 months of his presidency he has made more than twice as many speeches as Mr Schlesinger in his last year of office. Mr Helmut Scheiber, his own successor as Bundesbank 'foreign minister', has hardly been heard at all above the noise of the president's constant protests that the Maastricht criteria are too sloppy and that the EU is ill-prepared politically for the great leap into monetary union. Mr Tietmeyer's close personal knowledge of Chancellor Helmut Kohl has hitherto helped him judge how forcefully he can press for his rigorous European policy prescriptions without overstepping the mark. Now, with the weakened coalition government still unsure of its capacity to act decisively, he may feel even more confident of speaking his mind and issuing his prescriptions. He will certainly be encouraged to speak out further by the prospect of the looming EU summit in Essen on December 9 and 10 to seal Germany's six-month presidency. Whatever Mr Kohl's ambitions for the grand occasion, Germany's most listened-to Emu spokesman is unlikely to allow any of the leaders to return home burdened with any misunderstandings.</p>

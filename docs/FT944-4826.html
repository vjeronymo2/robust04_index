			<p>941207 FT  07 DEC 94 / Albania to free ethnic Greeks President Sali Berisha of Albania has said that five ethnic Greeks convicted last August of espionage and illegal possession of arms will be released from jail 'very soon'. Mr Berisha told the Greek newspaper, Ta Nea, that Greek-Albanian relations were on the road to recovery following Greece's decision last week to drop its veto on an Ecu35m (Pounds 27.5m) European Union loan package for Albania. The trial of the five, all members of Omonia, an ethnic-Greek political movement, triggered the expulsion of more than 40,000 Albanians working illegally in Greece and froze bilateral economic relations. Greek businessmen now hope to revive plans for investment in southern Albania, where the ethnic-Greek minority lives.</p>

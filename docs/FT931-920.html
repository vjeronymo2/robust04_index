			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Bankers fear exodus from British export support role BRITAIN'S export bankers fear that five months of incon-clusive negotiations with the government may lead to a cut in interest margins on project exports, prompting a steady withdrawal of bank support for exporters. Large exporters have expressed concern over the 'dwindling band' of banks able to support their export efforts. A leading capital-goods exporter said yesterday: 'Even with margins at their present levels, there is a very limited number of UK-based banks which maintain the size of team and have the necessary commitment to help UK exporters win major business in a range of overseas markets. 'To reduce their incentive to provide such help would not be helpful for the improvement in capital goods exports which the government is otherwise actively encouraging.' A five-year agreement reached in 1987 expired at the end of last November and no new agreement is in place. A stand-off has followed efforts by the Export Credits Guarantee Department, the government agency responsible for backing long-term export finance, to trim the nominal cost of supports to banks - fixed rate export finance, or Frefs - by 20 per cent from Pounds 44m a year to Pounds 34m. Banks insist that Frefs, ranging from  1/2 per cent to  7/8 per cent depending on the life of a loan and the currency it is denominated in, are at a bare minimum for covering the costs involved with aiding exporters in arranging financing packages for overseas projects. They argue that any further cut in margins would result in more bankers withdrawing from the business. Cuts forced on banks in 1987 are blamed for having pushed more than a dozen out. Just a dozen banks remain active in the business today, including Midland, Barclays, Lloyds and National Westminster, along with Standard Chartered Bank, Kleinwort Benson, Morgan Grenfell and ANZ Bank. The government appears to accept bankers' claims but continues to demand cuts. A spokesman for the ECGD said yesterday: 'We are still looking for some savings which will be significant for us, but are discussing a proposal which has been reshaped very much to take account of the preferences of the banks.' He said margin rate cuts should be offset by extra income from the higher volume of export business being handled by the ECGD.</p>

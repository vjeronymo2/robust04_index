			<p><P> September 26, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> THE SIDELINES;  </P> <P> BLACKS' GRADES FOOTBALL BARRIER  </P> <P> Blacks are more likely than whites to be barred from playing high school  football in Florida because of failure to meet academic standards, a University  of Florida study has found.  </P> <P> Fifty-seven percent of the state's high school students who failed to get high  enough grades to play football were black, even though they represent only  about 37% of all varsity football players, said Michael Ryan, a sports and  fitness instructor at the university.  </P> <P> Overall, 858 of 11,479 varsity athletes failed to get the minimum 1.5  grade-point average required to play football. Of those who didn't meet the  standards, 489 were black, 289 were white, 76 were Latino and four were other  ethnic groups, Ryan said.  </P> <P> Ryan's research is based on a survey of 76%, or 254 of the state's 334 high  school varsity football coaches.  </P></p>

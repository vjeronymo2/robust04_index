			<p>Language: <F P=105> Vietnamese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The paper CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC (CATHOLICISM AND  NATION) publishes in issue No. 947 an interview with Prime  Minister Vo Van Kiet by its editor in chief, Catholic priest  Truong Ba Can, on a number of issues related to the Roman  Catholic Church in Vietnam.    SAIGON GIAI PHONG has the honor of presenting this interview  to our readers.    [Truong Ba Can] Dear Prime Minister, does the religious  issue  ever pose any concern to you at all?    [Vo Van Kiet] As far as religion is concerned, the recent  incidents in Hue and Ho Chi Minh City have caused me great  concern.    I would like to point out here that our country was  dominated  and suffered from the consequences of war for quite a long time.  Since regaining national independence and unification, we have  set a clear direction for advancement and scored initial  achievements in the renovation process. Although there are more  issues to be discussed and developed, we must strive to maintain  stability in our country, especially the politico-social  stability so as to develop our economy more rapidly. This is a  very important experience we have had in the past period.    [Truong Ba Can] What is your assessment of the Ho Chi Minh  City Catholic community's role in maintaining stability?    [Vo Van Kiet] I have always highly appraised the patriotic  spirit of Vietnamese Catholics in Ho Chi Minh City. I still  remember, during the most difficult period when fighting erupted  at the southwestern border and the city experienced food  shortages, that the people had to eat sorghum and sweet potato.  Yet, Vietnamese Catholics and people in the city, together with  Catholic priests, participated in building water conservation  projects and setting up defense lines. Even Archbishop Nguyen  Van Binh went to the Thai My state farm to take the lead in  building water conservation projects, and to Hoc Mon District to  attend a ceremony launching construction of a border defense  line. Both the archbishop and I had very small roles in this  work, but the presence of the archbishop greatly encouraged  Vietnamese Catholics there to work selflessly to overcome the  difficulties and stabilize their daily lives, thereby sharing  the hardships with the other people in the city. Perhaps it is  for this reason that despite the confusion in the Vatican's  recent unilateral appointment of an apostolic administrator  [giams quanr toongr toaf] in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnamese  Catholics have firmly maintained their daily lives, carried out  their normal activities, and participated actively in various  socioeconomic development programs while organizing a solemn,  beautiful, and orderly Christmas celebration.    I should say that Vietnamese Catholics in the city realized  quickly that the Ho Chi Minh City administration's reaction to  this case was aimed at protecting national sovereignty, abiding  by the state law, and maintaining stability for the daily lives  of the people. Thanks to this awareness, the city's Committee  for Solidarity among Vietnamese Catholics successfully organized  its third congress recently with the participation of all  Catholic priests and adherents as in the past.    [Truong Ba Can] Dear Prime Minister, the appointments of  bishops and apostolic administrators are normally discussed with  and jointly approved by the Vatican and the State of Vietnam.  What is your opinion on the recent Vatican appointment?    [Vo Van Kiet] According to international practice, many  countries contend that the appointment of bishops should be done  in consultation with and with the approval of the governments of  the nations concerned. In the latest agreement between the  Vatican and Poland, this point was stipulated. Vietnam has no  such agreement with the Vatican because we have no official  diplomatic relations with the Holy See. We have, however,  reached consensus with the Vatican that the appointments of  cardinals, bishops, and apostolic administrators should be  discussed with and approved by our government in advance. There  were, however, abnormal cases, such as a number of bishops who  have been approved jointly by the government and the Vatican,  but official appointments from the Holy See have not been made.  It is regrettable that the Vatican recently appointed an  apostolic administrator for the Ho Chi Minh City diocese without  consultation with the Vietnamese Government. I think that the  Vatican should consider this issue carefully.    [Truong Ba Can] But Catholic bishops are dutybound to take  orders from the Vatican.    [Vo Van Kiet] I understand this point. We must not forget,  however, that these bishops are also Vietnamese citizens, and as  such they must abide by the state law as do other Vietnamese  citizens. Moreover, I think that, in some cases, the Vatican  has not firmly grasped the actual situation in Vietnam.    If provided with adequate and accurate information, the  Vatican would have arrived at the appropriate decisions. It is  firmly believed that Vatican does not want to create tension and  drive the local Catholic Church onto an unlawful path. We are  aware that since the Vietnamese Government's refusal to accept  the appointment of the aspotolic administrator of Ho Chi Minh  City Diocese, the Vatican has not made its official attitude  known, pending arrival of its delegation in Vietnam.    [Truong Ba Can] As far as we know, the appointment of  bishops is totally under Vatican jurisdiction. Prior to an  appointment, however, according to normal diplomatic practice,  the Vatican must consult with the government of the relevant  country over this. For its part, the relevant government may or  may not accept this appointment, depending on its political  considerations. You are therefore kindly requested to speak of  the conditions and standards for acceptance.    [Vo Van Kiet] As for the issue of appointing bishops in  Vietnam, I would like to clarify the following points:    1. At present, certain dioceses still have some bishopric  slots left unfilled. I would like to point out here that this  has nothing to do with the Vietnamese Government. This is  because the Vietnamese Government has, only in certain cases,  refused to accept such appointments, leaving the Vatican with  many options.    2. As for Ho Chi Minh City, over the past 18 years, thanks  to the presence of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh as the head  of the church, the Catholic compatriots have been experiencing  positive change and growth. Therefore, when the issue of a  successor to Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh was raised, the  Vietnamese Government made it clear that the new archbishop must  be the one who will carry on along those beautiful lines.    I believe that every government must have measures to  protect  its national sovereignty and maintain public order and security  in order to guarantee a peaceful and happy life for its people.  If the Vatican respects Vietnamese sovereignty and is interested  in bringing about a stable life for its faithful, it would not  be difficult for it to reach a consensus with our government.    I have the feeling that the Vatican has, in certain cases,  not been well-informed of the situation in Vietnam.    [Truong Ba Can] Could you, the prime minister, cite some  specific cases?    [Vo Van Kiet] The issue of Catholic fathers and clergymen  participating in people's elected organs or in Vietnam Catholics  Unity [VCU] committees was a case in point.    In 1982, there was a circular from Rome advising Catholic  fathers and clergymen not to stand for National Assembly or  people's council elections. It also prohibited them from setting  up or participating in any associations, as this may cause  division in the church. Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh and  some other bishops convinced the Vatican that in Vietnam joining  the National Assembly or people's councils is just for the  purpose of performing one own's duty as a citizen and not for  engaging in a power struggle as in other countries. VCU  committees are only popular political organizations designed to  promote patriotism among Catholic compatriots. The Vatican  seems to have been aware of this fact and most of the Vietnamese  bishops have let their subordinate Catholic priests and other  clergymen join Fatherland Front committees, elected organs, and  VCU committees. Nevertheless, I was advised in 1992 that due to  unknown reasons, the Vatican issued another circular, urging  Vietnamese bishops to prohibit their priests and other clergymen  from joining elected organs or VCU committees.    It took 10 years, from 1982-92, for Catholic bishops,  fathers, and clergymen and all other Catholic compatriots in  Vietnam to have become clearly aware that far from doing any  harm to Catholicism, those Catholic clergymen serving elected  organs or VCU committees have done good services to the region  and the country. Fully aware of this fact, why is it that  certain bishops have continued to cite the Vatican order as an  excuse to prohibit their subordinate clergy from joining elected  organs or VCU committees?    I think that by taking part in national construction  activities, Catholic compatriots are exercising their rights and  duties as citizens.    [Truong Ba Can] This issue has been raised partly because  the religious policy has failed to appease people's worries  about various issues such as the seminarian issue, the  operations and education of various religious orders, the repair  and construction of churches, and so forth.    [Vo Van Kiet] The reason why our government continues to  remain strict in certain areas is that we want to ensure  stability for social and religious activities. If everyone is  aware of this, the resolution of various matters would become  easier. Therefore, we must give specific consideration to each  particular issue. We must listen to public opinion and join  hands in resolving it. All for common stability.    [Truong Ba Can] You, the prime minister, just stated that  the lines to be followed are the ones advocated and practiced by  Arbishop Nguyen Van Binh in Ho Chi Minh City over the past 18  years. What did you have in your mind when saying so?    [Vo Van Kiet] I was thinking of those lines brought up by  various bishops in a joint letter dated 1 May 1980 which  advocates "leading a Gospel-directed life in the bounds of the  nation in order to serve the happiness of the compatriots."  This means that while caring about the religion, one must also  concern oneself with secular affairs. More precisely, religion  is designed to care for the people. Leading a Gospel-directed  life means serving the happiness of compatriots in general, not  just Catholic compatriots. This also involves the attitude to  be adopted in everyday life. We must support our nation,  respect our national interests, national sovereignty and state  law, understand difficulties facing it, and put ourselves in the  same difficult situation of the country whenever we discuss  national issues, including those related to church and state.    It is regrettable that all Vietnamese bishops have only  deployed and applied these lines within their own dioceses.    On the contrary, in Ho Chi Minh City, Elder Archbishop  Nguyen  Van Binh has constantly adhered to these lines since the  liberation of the south. As a high-ranking clergyman, he has  been caring and working for his religion and has, at the same  time, never allowed himself to forget his duty toward the  nation, as he has always cared for the national interest.    I have the feeling that the Catholic Church has yet to fully  appreciate the meritorious deeds of Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van  Binh or treat him fairly. As a man who has dedicated his whole  life to a cause, he has only one desire, that is to see what he  has done continue to be carried out. All of us must show  responsibility in this matter.    [Truong Ba Can] In 1994, the Ho Chi Minh City Catholic  Diocese will celebrate its 150th anniversary. This is an  opportunity for us to review our past in preparation for the  future.    [Vo Van Kiet] Yes, history has left us a very damaging  legacy, namely the prejudices between Catholics and  non-Catholics and between Catholicism and communism.    Today, this situation has changed greatly, though not  completely. If there are any points in the relationship that we  do not correctly understand, we must continue to resolve them.  The reason why there have been changes for the better in Ho Chi  Minh City is that we have practiced the policy on religious  freedom and satisfactorily achieved the goal of ensuring the  benefits of both the region and the people. It must be admitted  that the contributions made by Elder Archbishop Nguyen Van Binh,  the Catholics Motivation Committee, the Catholic Unity  Committee, and the journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TAN [CATHOLICS AND  THE NATION] are very important. Therefore, we must try to ensure  that the heir to the archbishopric of Ho Chi Minh City will not  follow a policy which run counters to that of Elder Archbishop  Nguyen Van Binh and that the Catholic Unity Committee and the  journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC can play bigger roles in helping  the Catholic community achieve progress together with the rest  of the nation.    Some people often complain about having difficulty seeking  permission to build churches. But everywhere I went, I saw many  newly built churches, including many large ones whose  construction cost billions of dong. Our Catholic compatriots,  of course, need comfortable and fine-looking places to meet and  worship. But in some localities, there have been expensive  churches built in the middle of slum areas. This must be  reviewed, taking into account the need to increasingly improve  the material and cultural life of the working Catholic people.    Although I still have many things to talk about, please  allow  me to stop here. Through the journal CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC, I  wish the readership and the city's Catholic compatriots good  health and happiness. As Vietnamese, irrespective of one is  Catholic or not, we share the same motherland. Formerly, people  thought of setting out in search of a new life in one area or  another. But now it has become evident that there is no area  for us to live in other than our own motherland. Therefore, we  must join hands in a bid to build a prosperous country for the  benefit of both the people and the region.    [Truong Ba Can] On behalf of the CONG GIAO VA DAN TOC  readership and the Catholic compatriots in the city, I wish you,  the prime minister, good health so you can continue to lead the  country forward.</p>

			<p>920909 FT  09 SEP 92 / Mandela urges removal of Ciskei leader MR Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress (ANC), yesterday called on the South African government to remove Brigadier Oupa Gqozo, the military leader of the Ciskei 'homeland', from power as a condition for resuming talks on South Africa's political future. Mr Mandela was speaking after laying a wreath at the site where at least 23 people were shot dead on Monday by Ciskei security forces. The massacre has provoked a serious crisis in relations between the ANC and the government, and could threaten early resumption of talks on a post-apartheid constitution. Britain condemned the killings and expressed fear that recent massacres threaten prospects for peaceful change. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, called on the Pretoria government to 'exert control over the security forces in the Ciskei and other homelands.' While Mr Mandela said the incident was a 'serious stumbling block' to resuming negotiations, his tone was far less confrontational than statements issued by more radical members of the ANC leadership, including Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, its powerful secretary general. Mr Ramaphosa led Monday's march on the Ciskei capital Bisho, along with Mr Chris Hani and Mr Ronnie Kasrils of the South African Communist party, who are also ANC officials. They have been widely criticised for pursuing the march after warnings that it would lead to violence. Church leaders, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, spent most of yesterday in talks with Brig Gqozo aimed at defusing the crisis. Church sources said they had proposed that Brig Gqozo hold a referendum to test his support among the homeland's 800,000 population, but he later rejected this. Mr Mandela made clear that the ANC's target was not only Ciskei, but also other black homelands where the ANC is prevented from mobilising political support by conservative leaders. 'A climate of free political activity throughout the whole country, including the bantustans (homelands), is an important condition for a return to negotiations,' he told a press conference. The South African cabinet was expected to meet later today to seek ways of dealing with the crisis, while officials of the government and ruling National party continued to attack the ANC publicly for using violence to further its political aims. About 1,000 ANC supporters who had remained close to the scene of the shooting, the border between Ciskei and South Africa, for much of the day, later left the area to attend an address delivered by Mr Mandela in a nearby sports stadium.

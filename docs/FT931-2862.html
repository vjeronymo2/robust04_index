			<p>930318 FT  18 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nymex vote goes against Guttman Mr Z LOU Guttman, chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange since 1988, lost his bid for re-election on Tuesday to Mr Daniel Rappaport, a 39-year-old independent floor trader who is also an attorney. The defeat came after a stormy year in which Mr Guttman was accused by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission of violating trading rules. Known for his brash style and his ability to get things done, Mr Guttman helped build the Nymex into one of the most successful futures markets in the world. The exchange had pre-tax earnings of Dollars 27m last year, and about Dollars 100m cash in reserve. Unlike some of its New York neighbours Nymex's volume is booming and seat prices have doubled during Mr Guttman's term in office. The exchange has the largest crude oil market in the world and has successfully diversified its energy lines into natural gas and other products. Despite the successes, Mr Guttman's legal problems were feared to reflect unfavourably on the exchange and its customers. The CFTC delivered its civil charges against Mr. Guttman less than a month ago, after warning him in July of a pending case. The Nymex Board immediately asked Mr Guttman to step down, but - true to his style - he refused, saying he would defend himself against the charges, and that the membership should have the right to choose its leadership. Some Nymex members thought Mr Guttman's efforts to keep New York's futures exchanges in business after the February 26 bomb blast at the World Trade Center would help his re-election effort. He is credited with convincing police and fire officials that the markets should open, despite impaired ventilation and fire protection systems at the WTC trading facility. Mr Rappaport defeated Mr Guttman by 386 votes to 213. The new chairman strongly supports the Nymex's move to a new trading facility in mid-1994 and he sees potential in the exchange's Access electronic trading system. Mr Rappaport also would like to see more co-operation between New York exchanges. His election could pave the way for another Nymex bid for the ailing New York Commodity Exchange. The Comex is currently entertaining takeover offers from the Chicago Board of Trade and a smaller New York market, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange.</p>

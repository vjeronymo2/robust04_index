			<p><P> April 15, 1990, Sunday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> THE WEEK'S FILM PICKS BY TIMES CRITICS  </P> <P> THE DRESSMAKER  </P> <P> Adapted from a Beryl Bainbridge novel, beautifully acted, full of grimness and  irony, this home-front British movie is set in Liverpool in 1944. It imprisons  us in one of those terrible claustrophobic households we get in plays by Harold  Pinter or Tennessee Williams: veined with dark secrets, buried hatreds and  fears, where propriety battles sexuality and both lose. It's a bleak view made  exhilarating by the acting, especially by Joan Plowright and Billie Whitelaw as  very different sisters engaged in a moral war over their niece (Jane Horrocks).  </P> <P> Sunday, KOCE at 8 p.m.; KCET at 9 p.m. Michael Wilmington  </P></p>

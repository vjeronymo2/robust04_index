			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> STAGE REVIEW;  </P> <P> STRONG STUDENT CAST PERFORMS 'SOUND OF MUSIC'  </P> <P> The message is familiar: Climb every mountain, and if you happen to stumble  along the way, get off your duff and keep going.  </P> <P> It's not only the theme of "The Sound of Music," but the attitude taken by the  Fullerton Children's Repertory Theatre in a crowd-pleasing performance of the  Rodgers and Hammerstein musical at the Fullerton Union High School last  weekend. The play about the singing Von Trapp family can be seen again this  weekend and next.  </P> <P> The occasional snafu -- a costume's hem trapping a wayward heel, a forgotten  line here or there -- was handled with good-natured ease by the cast of 41  fifth- through eighth-graders from the Fullerton area, who seemed to be on  stage as much to have a good time and to learn about drama as to tell the story  of Maria's quest to find her dreams. (The eight youngsters portraying the Von  Trapp children, especially, had a hoot with "The Lonely Goatherd" and "Do Re  Mi.")  </P> <P> Directed by Vickie Schindele and Alberta Strey, the show is designed to trigger  howls from the audience: In one scene, "Germans" searching for the Von Trapps  zero in on a few suspicious characters from the audience. Most of the players  met the musical challenges fairly well. Megan de Sales, an eighth-grader at  Parks Junior High, was a charming, sweet-sounding Maria; Joy Friesen as Sister  Berthe and Tami Griffin as Mother Abbess (both Acacia School sixth-graders)  also were strong. Bob Wilson's sets are elaborate, and the costumes by Lueraecq  Roberts and Bev Shirk are gorgeous.  </P> <P> Co-director Schindele says the play was double cast, with one set of players  performing one night and another set the next night, enabling every member of  the group to have both a speaking role and a secondary duty, such as work on  the stage crew.  </P> <P>  The Fullerton Children's Repertory Theatre's production of "The Sound of  Music" continues at the Fullerton High School Little Theater, Lemon Street and  Chapman Avenue in Fullerton, tonight and Saturday and next Friday and Saturday  at 7:30, with Saturday matinees at 1:30. Tickets: $4. Information: (714)  870-6911.  </P></p>

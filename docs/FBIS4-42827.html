			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Egon Klepsch, speaker of the European </F> Parliament, by Jacques Docquiert; place and date not given:  "Egon Klepsch: `Codecisionmaking Powers of Parliament Must Be  Expanded'" -- first two paragraphs are LES ECHOS introduction]    [Text] Since 1 January 1992, Egon Klepsch has been speaker  of the European Parliament. This influential member of the  German CDU [Christian Democratic Union], 64 years of age, is  very familiar with this institution because he has held a seat  in it since 1973, and from 1984 to 1992 he chaired one of its  most influential political groups: the European Peoples' Party.  So he is one of the authors of Parliament's increasing powers,  something which Germany in particular has wanted.    In his opinion, the only body of the European Union [EU]  which "meets and makes decisions publicly" should be given more  powers, in particular "codecisionmaking powers for all  legislative activities which are decided by the Council by a  majority vote." His successor will also have to guarantee "the  full implementation of the Maastricht Treaty" and "the  deepening" of the EU through future enlargement. Therefore, the  EU Parliament will have to "participate appropriately in the  preparations for the intergovernmental conference in 1996."    [Docquiert] What is the main lesson you have learned from  the  legislative session just ended?    [Klepsch] Since the third direct election of June 1989, the  European Parliament has increased its importance, influence,  powers, and prestige considerably. It has made a decisive  contribution to the economic and political progress of the last  few years. It participated in the implementation and entry into  force of the Maastricht Treaty, the European Economic Area, and  a number of agreements with third countries. It has managed to  strengthen its role as a democratic supervisory body defending  the interests of the people. Outside the Union, the European  Parliament is considered a model for democratic development.    [Docquiert] What strengths and weaknesses of the European  Parliament have been highlighted?    [Klepsch] One of the strengths of the Parliament lies in the  fact that it has continually managed to find compromise  solutions across national borders and the boundaries of the  political parties. Moving beyond national interests and  barriers, a European way of looking at things has taken root.  In some cases, however, the contradictions proved too great, in  particular with respect to the Commission's white paper on  economic growth and employment, on which it was impossible to  define a uniform position. This is undeniably one low-point of  the legislative session which has just ended.    [Docquiert] Do you feel that, because of Parliament's  debates  and work, the commitments made in Maastricht are beginning to  take concrete form?    [Klepsch] Even before the entry into force of the Maastricht  Treaty, the European Parliament had finished the preparations  needed to implement it. Several interinstitutional agreements  have entered into force since late October 1993. Since then, a  number of reconciliation procedures with the Council of  Ministers have been successfully concluded. The Parliament  stressed its point of view several times, especially during the  procedure for adopting the new multiannual research program.  The newly elected Parliament will shortly make use of its new  right to ratify the nomination of the president of the  Commission and the entire composition of the Commission. Thus,  the practical implementation of the provisions of the Maastricht  Treaty is continuing without a break.    [Docquiert] The Treaty on European Union grants new powers  to  the Parliament. How do you see its role in the future vis-a-vis  the Council and the Commission?    [Klepsch] The European Parliament, which is the European  Union's only directly elected institution, is also the only body  which meets and makes decisions publicly. The Council and  Commission work behind closed doors. It is important to make  the activities and decisions of these two bodies more  transparent. We must make Europe more understandable to the  people. The European Parliament must broaden the  codecisionmaking powers that it currently enjoys in the internal  market and the key sectors to include all legislative activities  which are approved by the Council with a majority vote.    In addition, the Parliament demands full budget powers,  i.e.,  powers which cover obligatory spending as well as "receipts."  Moreover, it demands the right to approve amendments to the  Treaty. Only under these conditions will the European Parliament  be able to fully assume its role in the democratic debate and in  the cooperative efforts with the Council and Commission.    [Docquiert] What must the priorities of your successor be?    [Klepsch] My successor, whether a man or a woman, should  make  it a priority to go after the full implementation of the  provisions set out in the Maastricht Treaty. The comprehensive  institutional reform and the parallel implementation of  enlargement and deepening demanded by the European Parliament  are still current issues. It is important that the European  Parliament participate appropriately in the preparations for the  intergovernmental conference to be held in 1996. The new  Parliament and its 567 deputies representing 346 million EU  citizens must make the most of this occasion to successfully  push through other legitimate demands.</p>

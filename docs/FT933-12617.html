			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / AT&amp;T seeks BT tariff disclosure AMERICAN Telephone and Telegraph of the US, which is pressing for access to the UK market, yesterday called for much tougher regulation of British Telecommunications. In a submission to the industry regulator Oftel, AT&amp;T said BT should be forced to publish tariffs for specific services which competitors require to interconnect with the BT network. BT should also have to publish details of all relevant costs justifying those tariffs, it said. This goes far beyond Oftel's draft plans, which would oblige BT to publish full accounts only for its broad 'retail' and 'network' businesses. AT&amp;T claimed that 'unbundling' BT's costs for interconnection 'is necessary to ensure that customers pay only for the services they receive'. At present competitors have to negotiate the tariff without detailed knowledge of BT costs. They can appeal to Oftel over unfair treatment. AT&amp;T, which is awaiting a decision by the Department of Trade and Industry on its UK move, also criticised BT's control of numbers, directory services and other structural advantages.</p>

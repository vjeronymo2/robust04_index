			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / Lloyds against full Abbey Life takeover LLOYDS BANK is unlikely to spend surplus capital to increase its 60 per cent share in Lloyds Abbey Life, its insurance arm, Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive, has indicated. Mr Pitman said that purchasing the remaining 40 per cent at a cost of Pounds 1.1bn would have 'all sorts of negatives'. He said a full acquisition could encourage a clash of cultures between employees. Mr Pitman's remarks at a banking conference organised by the stockbrokers Hoare Govett follow speculation that Lloyds might buy the rest of Lloyds Abbey Life rather than trying to acquire a bank such as TSB or Royal Bank of Scotland. He said Lloyds had gained from its Abbey Life stake because it had learned new methods of rewarding staff for achievement. However, a full acquisition could lead to a confusion between sales and service cultures. 'It is certainly not the case that in banking, the more products you sell the more money you make. It would be very dangerous for our managers to believe that,' he said. Mr Pitman said that Lloyds, which last year made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 801m and achieved a 16.9 per cent post-tax return on shareholders' equity, was now generating cash and would continue to strengthen its capital ratios. He said Lloyds wanted to retain strong capital rather than leverage assets excessively. But it would be uncomfortable if its ratio of shareholders' funds to total assets rose from the current 5 per cent to above 6 per cent. Mr Pitman said Lloyds hoped to increase its return on shareholders' funds to more than 18 per cent. Lex, Page 16</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article] </F>   [Text] Following the Easter holiday and without yet knowing  the definitive outcome to the elections, ARENA [Nationalist  Republican Alliance] and the coalition have already begun  campaigning for the runoff elections. Both assume this will  take place on 24 April, even though the Supreme Electoral  Tribunal [TSE] has not been able to officially decree the date  of the runoff.    Despite heavy technological investment in the TSE, after two  weeks, the country still does not know the official outcome of  the elections. It had been pompously announced that the results  would be available just hours after polling places closed, but  the TSE was not even able to supply overall preliminary figures.  A lack of openness, impartiality, and effectiveness on 20 March  hindered the vote count. The same structural deficiencies have  caused the opposition to report fraudulent acts and challenge  the election results in 44 municipalities. Nevertheless, the  most probable outcome will be that the TSE will dismiss these  reports to end, as soon as possible, an electoral process that  got out of control. The vote count in these elections has not  been much different from those in previous elections.    ARENA would like to avoid a runoff, because a first-round  victory would make the outcome indisputable and give ARENA a  pretext to continue ruling as if it has the complete support of  El Salvador's citizens. The truth of the matter, however, is  that ARENA only received 25 percent of the vote from those  citizens registered. ARENA's untamed ambition for power led it  to commit illegitimate acts on 20 March -- acts whose limits are  still unknown. If these acts were a determining factor in the  final results, ARENA will have to repeat them with the serious  risk of getting caught.    On the other hand, the coalition is ready for the runoff  elections, because it believes that the people's vote is a  commitment that cannot and should not be negotiated with the  ruling party, and because it wants to show its ability to  provide strong opposition in light of the fact that it will be  very difficult to win the runoff. The coalition's task is not  at all easy. The Christian Democrats, who were divided among  those who would like to support ARENA and the coalition, decided  not to support either. The small parties also do not appear  willing to back the coalition directly.    Even though the immediate electoral outlook does not favor  the coalition, the runoff election could be an important  contribution to the nation's democratic future, especially if  one seriously considers the need to totally reform the electoral  system after 24 April. Moreover, such a reform process should  begin immediately and, in turn, remedy the most easily  correctable anomalies in the little time remaining before the  runoff elections. Unfortunately, for the time being, it is  practically impossible to correct the most serious anomalies.  The runoff elections provide a new opportunity to move ahead  toward the democratization of the country, but for this to take  place, the electoral event has to be radically transformed.</p>

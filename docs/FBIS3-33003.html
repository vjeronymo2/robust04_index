			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 16 Feb (AFP) -- Colombian  President Cesar Gaviria officially announced on Wednesday [16  February] his candidacy for the post of OAS secretary general.  In a brief statement read at the Narino Government Palace,  Gaviria said his wish, if he is elected, is to strengthen the  continent's political and economic integration.    Gaviria decided to run for the OAS post in view of the  requests made to him by different world leaders since December.  Gaviria's candidacy is sponsored by the United States and has  received the official backing of Peru, Argentina, Mexico, and  Bolivia.    In his speech, Gaviria said that "America is concerned about  the future of the OAS." He added that "we all know that under  the current circumstances, the self-same future of the  inter-American system is at stake along with the election of the  secretary general. This is where Colombia faces a big  responsibility. If we have in our hands the tools, knowledge,  and experience, we must place it at the service of the  hemisphere." "I hope that my commitment can serve to unite at a  time when the OAS faces the responsibility of outlining new  paths within the context of a new, more just world order amid  solidarity," he said.    He also said he has great respect for his rivals (Bernd  Niehaus of Costa Rica and Miguel Angel Burelli of Venezuela).  He invited both of them to share their respective views in such  a way that, rather than reflect a race, which he considered  futile, it will show the wish to contribute to a peaceful future  for the continent.    The new OAS secretary general, who will succeed Brazilian  Joao Baena Soares, will be designated on 27 March.</p>

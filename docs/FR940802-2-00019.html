The draft EIS was prepared in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, and its implementing regulations and the Washington State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) guidelines. DOE and Ecology have identified the need to resolve near-term tank safety issues associated with Watchlist tanks identified pursuant to Section 3137 of P.L. 101&hyph;510, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1991, ``Safety Measures for Waste Tanks at Hanford Nuclear Reservation,'' while continuing to provide safe storage for other Hanford wastes. This would be an interim action pending other actions that could be taken to convert waste to a more stable form based on decisions resulting from the Tank Waste Remediation System (TWRS) Environmental Impact Statement (EIS). The purpose for this action is to resolve safety issues concerning the generation of unacceptable levels of hydrogen in two Watchlist tanks, 101&hyph;SY and 103&hyph;SY. Current planning considers retrieval in dilute form of waste from Tanks 101&hyph;SY and 103&hyph;SY, hydrogen-generating Watchlist double shell tanks (DSTs) in the 200 West area, to be the highest priority action.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  The Department invites comments on the Draft Statement from all interested parties.

In addition to tank-specific safety evaluations, DOE is currently mitigating near-term risk of fire or explosion involving hydrogen gas generation from Tank 101&hyph;SY by operating a mixer pump which modifies the rate and mechanism of hydrogen releases. Mixer pump installations in other hydrogen-generating Watchlist tanks may also mitigate the near-term risks of accidents. However, DOE has identified retrieval and dilution of the wastes in flammable gas-generating Watchlist tanks as the primary mechanism for resolving safety issues which would assure safe storage of these wastes during the interim time frame prior to implementing decisions based on the TWRS EIS that might change the form of the waste. Retrieval of the waste and storage in a dilute form would be considered remediation, the final step in safety issue resolution of the hydrogen under this strategy, while installation and operation of mixer pumps would be considered mitigation. Dilution would eliminate the generation of unacceptable levels of hydrogen by altering the reactions that result in hydrogen build up. Mitigation by mixer pumps would eliminate the mechanisms by which hydrogen gas concentrates to unacceptable levels.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Because most of the Watchlist tanks are at or near capacity, dilution can best be accommodated through the use of other tank space rather than dilution in place. Upon review of available tank space and considering the potential for chemical incompatibility if existing DSTs were to be used as receiver tanks for Watchlist wastes, DOE is proposing to construct additional tank space to meet the need in the near term for storage of diluted wastes that would be retrieved from Watchlist Tanks 101&hyph;SY and 103&hyph;SY.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Environmental Impact Statement Preparation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Draft Statement has been prepared in accordance with Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as implemented in regulations promulgated by the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR Parts 1500&hyph;1508) and by the Department's Implementing Procedures (10 CFR Part 1021). The Draft Statement has been prepared to assess the potential impacts of both the proposed action, and reasonable alternatives to the proposed action, on the human and natural environment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

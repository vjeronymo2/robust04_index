			<p>930119 FT  19 JAN 93 / Ward jury told of missing documents DOCUMENTS relating to the Pounds 5.2m allegedly stolen from Guinness by Mr Thomas Ward, the US lawyer, went missing after his attorney went through files on Mr Ward's transactions, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday. The files were held in the offices of Mr Michael Dee, a Jersey-based company administrator who looked after Marketing and Acquisition Consultants, a company owned by Mr Ward, the court was told. Mr Dee, a witness for the prosecution, said that in December 1986, Mr William Dwyer, Mr Ward's attorney, had been allowed to review the files on MAC. He was left alone in Mr Dee's offices for a hour or two to do this. When Mr Dee next looked at the files there were 'one or two' documents he could no longer find, he said. These included a file note recording Mr Ward's instructions to transfer Pounds 3m of the Pounds 5.2m to the Swiss bank account of Mr Ernest Saunders, the former Guinness chief executive, he said. A file note was 'in all probability' kept of Mr Ward's original instructions to invoice Guinness for the Pounds 5.2m. After Mr Dwyer's visit, there was no such note on the files, he went on. Mr Ward is charged with the theft of the Pounds 5.2m from Guinness, and single charges of false accounting and procuring the execution of a valuable security in connection with the alleged theft. He denies all the charges. Mr Dee said he had personally submitted the invoice to Guinness for the Pounds 5.2m which Mr Ward claims was his success fee for assisting in the company's successful takeover of Distillers in 1986. Mr Ward, instructing Mr Dee, had told him the payment was for services he and others had provided to Guinness during the takeover, he said. The trial continues today.</p>

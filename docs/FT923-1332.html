			<p>920923 FT  23 SEP 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Japanese institutions sidelined for holiday SMALL-LOT purchases by investment trusts and foreigners complemented arbitrage-related index buying yesterday, and the Nikkei average closed firmer after light trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo. The Nikkei gained 216.48 at 18,282.72 after fluctuating on arbitrage-related business, reaching a low for the day of 17,993.98 in the morning and a subsequent high of 18,450.62. Volume rose moderately to 280m shares from 237m, while advances outnumbered declines by 569 to 379, with 184 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks put on 10.65 at 1,366.16, but in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index softened 2.20 to 1,096.45. Institutional investors remained inactive ahead of today's national holiday. Financial institutions and corporations also remained on the sidelines ahead of the September book closing for the first six months of the fiscal year. Foreigners were seen buying large-capital issues such as steels. Traders said foreign investors who had sold steel and shipbuilding shares were covering their positions. Nippon Steel improved Y4 to Y304. Aids-related speculative shares lost ground. Terumo, which surged on Monday on reports that it had developed an anti-Aids substance jointly with a university in southern Japan, receded Y60 to Y890 on profit-taking. 'Japanese brokers are having a hard time finding a new theme to follow Aids,' said Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. Itoman failed to trade for the second consecutive day, and closed at an offered price of Y188, down from Monday's offered price of Y268. Five Itoman shares will be swapped for one share in the unlisted Sumikin Bussan, a steel trading company of the Sumitomo group which Itoman will merge with early next year. Aoki, the construction company that will become a Nikkei index component stock on Thursday, attracted heavy buying and climbed Y30 to Y580. Seika rose Y14 to Y698 and Yaskawa Electric gained Y25 at Y535 on expectations that the stocks will also be picked as index components. Public works-related issues advanced on hopes of higher earnings due to the government's additional fiscal spending. Nippon Road added Y40 at Y1,340 and Sumitomo Cement Y7 at Y557. In Osaka, the OSE average improved 120.67 to 19,604.69 in volume of 21.4m shares. Roundup MIXED sentiment ruled in the region yesterday. SEOUL continued to lose ground on political worries, although the market was supported by gains in Hyundai Group shares. The composite index dipped 2.38 to 519.16 in turnover of Won226.1bn. Hyundai companies rose on rumours that credit sanctions imposed when Mr Chung Ju-yung, the group's founder, announced that he was to enter politics were to be lifted. Hyundai Engineering and Construction rose by its daily limit of Won600 to Won11,700 on speculation that the company may be able to bid again for the contract to build the new Hong Kong airport. TAIWAN rallied after Monday's fall, the index closing 42.85 up at 3,524.75 in turnover down to TDollars 14bn from TDollars 16.2bn. Hualon preferred stock was one of the day's biggest losers, dropping TDollars 5 to TDollars 68.50. KARACHI saw its steepest rise this year as investors scrambled to snap up low-priced textile shares. The KSE 100-share index climbed 51.49, or 4.5 per cent, to 1,193.96. AUSTRALIA weakened on nervousness about uncertainty in European currency markets. The All Ordinaries index slipped 10.8 to 1,520.8 in turnover of ADollars 171.2m. MANILA lost ground as Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell sharply in overnight US trading. The composite index declined 14.50 to 1,396.15 in turnover of 91m pesos. PLDT lost 25 pesos to 970 pesos. Some analysts said investors were selling common shares in preparation to switch to the forthcoming offer of preferred shares.

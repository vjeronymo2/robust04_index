			<p>BFN     [Text] Industry Minister Eduardo Ache on 25 March fired  Industry General Director Andres Merino Pacheco because he said  he would resign if the government approved last week's gasoline  price increase. Sources close to Merino Pacheco told EL  OBSERVADOR that he sought to obtain "political profit" inside  his faction and this annoyed Minister Ache.    Merino Pacheco is a nephew of Jorge Pacheco Areco, Colorado  Party and Bettleist Union leader. He was also one of former  Industry Minister Carlos Piran's trusted men during the previous  government. Merino Pacheco will be replaced by current Deputy  Secretary General Santiago Urioste, of the Herreraist faction  [National Party faction].</p>

			<p>930911 FT  11 SEP 93 / Markets: DAX index closes slightly down on the week - At a glance The Bundesbank's move on Thursday to cut key interest rates by half a percentage point had been widely anticipated by German stock markets. The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt dropped 4.48 points that day to 1,880.81, rather than rising as might have been expected. The fall was attributed to an unexpected strengthening of the D-Mark against the US dollar, which could hit export earnings. The DAX index closed yesterday down 3.3 per cent on the week at 1,861.44. German equities have been falling since reaching a record high at the end of August, after a three-month rally.</p>

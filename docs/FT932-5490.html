			<p>930603 FT  03 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Slimmed-down creature keeps up guard - The continuing rehabilitation of Cannon Street Investments BY the recent standards of Cannon Street Investments, the mini-conglomerate trying to reinvent itself, the chairman's message to the annual meeting yesterday was upbeat. 'Our portfolio of businesses is still too large . . . There are thus a number of subsidiaries that do not have a long-term future . . . But they are under control and none of them are disasters waiting to happen . . . It is of course, rather early in the rehabilitation process to guarantee a bright future,' Mr Tom Long told shareholders. The priority of the new management, led by Mr Long, a former BAT director who became Cannon Street's chairman a year ago, has been to stabilise the group and end its cash drain. They have sold many of its disparate businesses and now face the task of building a new group from the less-than-promising remains. In the past two months the market value of Cannon Street has responded to this treatment, more than quadrupling to over Pounds 30m as the share price has jumped from a low of 7 3/4 p to 30p - despite a Pounds 115m loss last year. Although this is only a fraction of Cannon Street's Pounds 250m market capitalisation during its heyday in the 1980s, it is perhaps an indication of investor confidence that its results can only get better. Bank borrowings have fallen from Pounds 75.9m at the start of 1992 to Pounds 29.6m at the beginning of January and now stand at about Pounds 16m. This excludes Pounds 25m of preference stock mostly held by the Bank of Scotland, the group's principal banker, which could, at some stage, be converted into equity. Meanwhile, Cannon's raggedy portfolio of more than 50 subsidiaries has been pruned to just over 20 - almost all of which are now profitable at the operating level. But there have been penalties. Last year's pre-tax loss came after Pounds 57.4m of goodwill write-offs and Pounds 42.5m of losses on sales and disposals - the result of a 'kitchen sink' accounting exercise undertaken by Mr David Smith, the group's recently appointed chief executive, who led Isosceles' heavily indebted buy-out of the Gateway supermarket chain. The impact of these moves was felt not only by shareholders in their pockets, because the ordinary dividend has been suspended, but also in the shrunken balance sheet where shareholders' funds were reduced to Pounds 17.8m. Mr Smith joined Cannon Street's board last September and succeeded Mr Robin Binks as chief executive in March - Mr Binks, it has since emerged, received a 'termination settlement' of Pounds 366,100. Under Mr Binks and now Mr Smith, the aggressive acquisition policy of the 1980s, which had made the group virtually unmanageable and left it with gearing of 400 per cent, has been reversed. Last year alone the group realised more than Pounds 60m from disposals, including Pounds 42m from the flotation of Avonside, the housebuilder. Virtually all of the building and building services operations were sold or closed down. The priority, according to Mr Long, was to preserve operating cash flows, and withdraw from operations requiring significant cash input. What is left are three main divisions: hotels and leisure, electronics distribution and food and drink distribution with annual sales of about Pounds 170m. In addition there are a handful of businesses which do not fit into any of the three broad divisions and which will probably be sold. Mr Smith believes the best prospects lie in the hotel and leisure division and the electronics distribution businesses. The hotel and leisure operations, with annual turnover of about Pounds 35m, comprise three hotels in Scotland, including the four-star Cameron House resort hotel at Loch Lomond, timeshare operations and Cotswold Travel, a tour operator which trades as Four Winds. The electronics distributions businesses include Altai, which imports a wide range of electronic equipment from the Far East and Network Group Holdings, which designs electrical products like fridges, freezers and televisions, for manufacture in eastern Europe, pays for them with barter agreements and then re-imports the goods to western Europe. Dunnet, a Netherlands-based company, mostly trades computer manufacturers' surplus stock. Altogether the division has sales of about Pounds 100m. Although there have been a few management changes, the board plans to review how the remaining operations are performing at the interim stage. 'For the moment we are just looking to see how much they can produce themselves,' said Mr Smith. However much tighter financial controls have already been installed and Mr Smith said most of the businesses were working with real budgets for the first time and the group now had a single auditor across all of its subsidiar-ies. Last year the group posted a loss from continuing operations of Pounds 7.45m, reflecting the recession and particularly poor performances by some operating subsidiaries, including Cannon Material Handling, a fork lift truck distributor and lessor which is the only remaining cash drain. Nevertheless, Cannon Street is now cash-positive, and Mr Long, predicts, will return to profits this year. The real question is just how much profit can be squeezed out of the remaining business portfolio. Mr Robert Gibson, an analyst with Robert Fleming, is impressed with the new management so far. 'They have overhauled the balance sheet and seem to have turned the group around.' Though he acknowledges that these are early days and 'there is still a certain amount one has to take on trust.' That trust has probably been enhanced by Mr Long's recent purchase of a small stake in the group. In total he now holds 97,000 shares, although Mr Smith has yet to make a similar move. Mr Gibson believes it will not be too difficult for Cannon Street to achieve modest pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 4m this year. Further on, he suggests pre-tax profits might be boosted to about Pounds 12.5m, but he believes this is probably also 'the potential and the limit,' because of the quality of the businesses, and the relatively low margins they are likely to generate. 'They are not really futuristic businesses that will take them through the 90s,' he says. To paraphrase the old joke, if you want to build a high-flying mini-conglomerate you probably would not start here.</p>

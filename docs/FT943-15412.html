			<p>940709 FT  09 JUL 94 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Tawse cuts loss to Pounds 4m Brown &amp; Tawse, the reorganised steel and pipes distributor, yesterday announced pre-tax losses narrowed to Pounds 3.77m for the year to April 3, compared with last time's Pounds 36.5m which was struck after restructuring costs of Pounds 6.1m and a provision of Pounds 14.8m for loss on disposal of operations. Directors said that substantial progress had been made in the implementation of the two year recovery plan involving disposals and widescale restructuring. Mr Don McFarlane, chairman, said trading was at a reasonable level in the current year. However the general recovery was continuing to be patchy and the construction industry, in which B&amp;T was heavily involved, was still particularly weak. Turnover fell from Pounds 119m to Pounds 94m, including discontinued activities of Pounds 12.9m. Losses per share were 8p (111.2p).</p>

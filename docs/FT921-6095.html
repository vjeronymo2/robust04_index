			<p>920229 FT  29 FEB 92 / Letter: Appalling administrative burden Sir, I was today visited by local officials of Customs and Excise to explain to me the responsibilities that major importing and exporting businesses will have imposed on them from January 1993 under the EC trade statistics collation scheme known as Intrastat. I am appalled (and I use that word advisedly) by the scale and complexity of the administrative burden that is in the making for those of us involved in industrial and commercial management. All credit to Customs and Excise authorities for embarking on their consultative exercise - but I am fearful that the penny has not yet dropped for many businessmen and they are in for a shock when they come to grips with the extra workload that will be thrust upon them next January. Desmond Goch, managing director, Coster Aerosols, Babbage Road, Stevenage, Herts</p>

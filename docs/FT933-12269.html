			<p>930724 FT  24 JUL 93 / The Property Market: Mooring charges THOSE WHO spend their leisure time on the water quickly find there are plenty of hidden extras such as insurance, supplies (including paint for the boat), repairs, membership of a club, and harbour dues. Berthing charges are probably the heftiest item, though. Swinging moorings on a buoy in the harbour or estuary are cheaper than renting a berth in a marina; but for such a lovely spot as the Beaulieu river in Hampshire, they are still pricy, with an annual charge of Pounds 42 a foot plus VAT. For a typical 30ft boat, that is Pounds 1,480 before you raise a sail. Marinas are dearer, even though some prices are reduced slightly from last year and could come down further in 1994. Lymington Yacht Haven in Hampshire charges Pounds 2,908 for a 30ft boat, to include everything except electricity, while Swanwick at Hamble, Hampshire, is Pounds 2,820 (at Pounds 80 a foot, down from Pounds 82). Brighton Marina is cheaper, giving a 20 per cent discount on the list price of Pounds 225 a metre (including VAT) which makes Pounds 1,710 for the 30-footer (9.5 metres). On the Isle of Wight, Cowes Yacht Haven has a two-tier system, with provisional charges for October 1993 to March 1994 of Pounds 45 a metre, and for April to September 1994 of Pounds 170 a metre, both plus VAT.</p>

Colonel Arsenio Nardo Cruz, chief of the Infantry Division  Unit 1700, explained to Gen. Castro and the Minfar officers the  achievements attained by the unit that contributed to its  satisfactory results during the ministerial inspection. The  unit was graded as good and outstanding in sharpshooting. Raul  visited several other units and expressed interest in the living  conditions of the soldiers, their health care, the quality and  quantity of food the soldiers are getting, and other matters  that affect the discipline and political and moral state of the  soldier. Raul was very pleased to see a plaque that was drafted  and built by Military Unit 2100.

EJT chief Brigadier General Ramon Valle Lasso in Havana  Province met with Raul and the other comrades at Farm No. 2, in  Quibican Municipality, one of the state-owned farms where  various crops are grown. This farm is run by the EJT. The  visitors talked about the plans for the farm next year and the  EJT goals for 1994 in Havana Province. The EJT is currently  running 19 farms in the area.

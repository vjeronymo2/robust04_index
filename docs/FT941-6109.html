			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Name of the game - As the value of unit trusts hits new highs, Scheherazade Daneshkhu looks at the industry's marketing methods The value of unit trusts in the UK climbed to Pounds 99.9bn by the end of January. The disappointment of just missing the Pounds 100bn mark and the excellent marketing opportunity that would have afforded the industry was palpable. Nevertheless, the figure is the highest recorded by the industry and is almost three times the value at the end of 1987 (the year of the stock market crash). Last year alone, unit trusts attracted more than Pounds 9bn of net investment, the highest annual inflow recorded, and almost equivalent to the sum of net investment in the five years (1988-1992 inclusive) after the crash. In addition, the steady fall in interest rates, particularly since the UK left the Exchange Rate Mechanism in September 1992, has increased the popularity of pooled equity funds which offer investors a wide spread of holdings. Not surprisingly, this bonanza, and a favourable economic background for equity investment, have contributed towards a sharp increase in the marketing budgets of many fund management groups. 'The public gets interested in investments when interest rates are low. This is important to the sale of unit trusts - it is much easier to sell when the market and macro-economic conditions are right,' says Mark Sylvain, executive director of retail business at Fidelity, the US investment house established in the UK for 15 years. Figures from Register-Meal, the media research company, show that the advertising of unit trusts (which does not necessarily include unit trust personal equity plans), based on the rate card costs of advertisements in the media, increased substantially in 1993. The fund management groups with the highest spending were Fidelity, M&amp;G and Save &amp; Prosper. Fidelity, for example, spent Pounds 2.2m compared with Pounds 738,000 in 1992, according to Register-Meal, while the comparable figures for Save &amp; Prosper were Pounds 1.2m in 1993 compared with Pounds 245,000 in 1992. It is still far short of what the industry would like, however. In the US, about 27 per cent of households invest in mutual funds; in the UK, less than 3 per cent of the adult population has a unit trust. Most unit trusts sold to the public are through intermediaries, such as financial advisers, but direct promotion is regarded as an important marketing tool, not only as a way of attracting investors but also to increase name recognition. With more than 1,400 unit trusts and 100 unit trust management groups, investors do not lack choice, so an investor consulting an intermediary is more likely to agree to invest in a recommended fund if he has heard of the company. Roger Jennings, M&amp;G's unit trust marketing manager, says: 'We want to have a constant presence and we spend at least Pounds 1m a year on the direct side  -that excludes special promotions - just to be present. It is still cheap compared with having to maintain a branch network like the building societies.' About 90 per cent of M&amp;G's marketing budget is spent on advertising. Mike Ryder Richardson, marketing manager at Save &amp; Prosper, says the company has increased its marketing budget in the last two or three years, but: 'We kept our promotional spending high in the bear market because we thought that since it was a less competitive market we could gain high visibility.' Ryder Richardson says S&amp;P's recent promotion of rugby at a cost of Pounds 750,000 for a year has been particularly successful in increasing its name awareness. Mercury Asset Management has turned to radio to increase brand awareness. It has been sponsoring London Broadcasting Centre's financial news updates since 1992. Richard Royds, managing director of Mercury fund managers, says the drawbacks of radio are offset by the advantages. 'The problem is that people cannot cut out a coupon as they can in a newspaper but it is awareness-building at a reasonable price.' None of the advertising attempts to define a unit trust. Victoria Nye, director of communications at the Association of Unit Trust and Investment Funds, the industry body which has just started a campaign to attract what it terms the 'missing millions' of potential investors, says: 'We did not want to pose a boring question: 'what is a unit trust?' but prefer to say why it is useful to you. It becomes clear through our literature what a unit trust is.' Unit trusts have to compete with investment trusts and insurance-linked products for equity investors' money. Sylvain says it is imperative to attract the investor's attention through advertising. His is one of the few companies to advertise on television with the goal being to get the viewer to call a freephone number. Newspapers and posters remain the backbone of advertising because of the amount of information they can contain. 'Investors tend to blank out the ads of companies they have not heard of and somehow you have to break through that,' says Sylvain. 'We will advertise in five to six pages of a paper with a huge ad to begin with, and ads on every page after that.' Fund launches and personal equity plans, which allow investors to save money in equities without having to pay income or capital gains tax, are vital marketing tools. 'For some reason, people seem to think that buying a new fund is better than an existing one so we try to promote old funds by giving them a new spin, such as adding a PEP facility,' says Sylvain. M&amp;G relies on consistency to convey reliability. Peter Emms, group marketing and sales director, says: 'Kit-Kat has always been promoted in the same way and we believe consistency in the style of our advertisements to get across the message of value and simplicity is important. Our posters are a permanent thing and people do notice them over a period of time.' The challenge to unit trusts will come when interest rates rise again. If the companies can retain investors' money, they will be able to regard their marketing efforts as a success. Says Jennings: 'We actually believe that equities are what people ought to have. What a great pity that typically women, whose husbands have died, have put their money in the building society and put a tiny amount into equities. Now, after 20 years they are enjoying a very poor lifestyle. It's a pity we have not been better at persuading them to do the opposite.'</p>

			<p>930918 FT  18 SEP 93 / Shops give Sunday pledge: Big retailers seek to overcome concerns over workers' rights THE FIRST salvo in the autumn campaign to secure a change in the Sunday trading laws was fired yesterday. Retailers in favour of Sunday opening pledged to defend shop workers' rights and said they would support statutory controls. The move is an attempt to overcome a controversial aspect of the government's options bill on Sunday shopping, published in July. This is the lack of protection for future shop workers against being forced to work Sundays. MPs are due to debate the four options for replacing the widely flouted 1950 Shops Act in England and Wales in the coming session of parliament. An intense round of lobbying from groups supporting the different options is expected. The options include unrestricted opening, partially restricted opening, and two alternatives for limited opening. The options do not extend protection to future shop workers, only existing ones - an omission which some MPs and retailers have warned could derail the attempt to reform the legislation. Some of the UK's biggest retailers yesterday pledged to follow a formula ensuring that no existing or future shop worker would have to work on Sundays against their wishes. Sunday workers would also be guaranteed premium rates of pay. The retailers included J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Argyll (owner of Safeway), Boots, Asda, and Kingfisher (owner of Woolworths, B&amp;Q, Comet and Superdrug). The retailers, members of the Shopping Hours Reform Council, which is backing the option of partially restricted opening, hope to force other employers to follow suit or risk losing employees. But they would be happy to see the formula legally enforced. The group said: 'We wish to make it clear that as employers we have no objection to statutory enforcement. On the contrary, if MPs indicate that they will settle for no less, we would urge parliament to enshrine our formula in law.' The latest in the growing band of campaign groups, Consumers for Sunday Shopping, a group supporting the SHRC proposal, has designated tomorrow National Sunday Shopping Day. Some 3,000 stores will collect shoppers' signatures in favour of Sunday shopping, and 5,000 balloons will be released at 16 locations throughout the country, symbolising the 16m people said to shop on Sundays.</p>

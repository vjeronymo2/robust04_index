			<p>930619 FT  19 JUN 93 / International Company News: New system for Nordic securities THE stock exchanges of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Finland have agreed to establish Nordquote, a common Nordic securities trading system. By bringing the four, relatively small stock markets together, the Nordic exchanges hope that it will make their markets more attractive and stop the tendency for trading volume to drift away to London, said Mr Bent Mebus, managing director of the Copenhagen Stock Exchange. Initially, Nordquote will include about 20 shares, but Mr Mebus said he expected that as the system develops around 100 Nordic blue-chip shares in which there is a 'significant international interest' will be traded through the system. Mr Mebus said that as far as he knew this was the first time that the stock exchanges of different countries had agreed to establish a joint trading system, an aim which has so far eluded other European stock exchanges. Nordquote will be open only to Nordic brokers. It means that an outside investor will only have to contact one Nordic broker in order to trade in the shares of any one of the four countries.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105>Slovak </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] At a news conference in Bratislava today, Slovak  Minister of Foreign Affairs Jozef Moravcik reaffirmed his  intention not to leave Slovak politics. Together with the group  that, as a part of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,  supported the Alternative of Political Realism, he intends to  form a strong bloc oriented at the center of the political  spectrum. This group counts on Cernak's [National Democratic]  wing of the Slovak National Party and on the Alliance of  Democrats of the Slovak Republic. But talks with other parties  are also in progress.    Asked how he sees frequent changes in the post of Slovak  foreign minister, inasmuch as in other countries foreign  ministers retain their posts regardless of changes in the  composition of elected coalitions, Jozef Moravcik said: A  mechanism allowing this practice to be implemented should be  created in Slovakia. Slovak foreign policy does not benefit  from frequent changes.</p>

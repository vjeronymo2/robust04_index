			<p>920805 FT  05 AUG 92 / Tough tactics behind the unit trusts: Norma Cohen on Fidelity's attempts to achieve better returns for its managed funds The public confrontation between Fidelity Investments and the lenders and management of WPP, the worldwide media services group, has brought the institution's role as an aggressive shareholder into the spotlight. For Boston-based Fidelity, the world's largest institutional fund manager, has been exporting US-style institutional activism into Britain with mixed results. So far its UK arm, Fidelity Investments International, has helped oust two managements - at Brown and Jackson, the retailer, and Great Western Resources, the natural resources company. The share prices of both companies have since soared. But in no UK takeover battle has it won better financial terms for shareholders. Fidelity Investments International has long been a maverick among UK institutions, both for its perception of its role as a shareholder and its investment style. Its senior investment director, Mr Anthony Bolton, engineered spectacular results for the company's unit trusts in the mid-1980s by concentrating on small companies and recovery situations. However, the recent recession has particularly hit share prices in those sectors and Fidelity's investment returns have suffered accordingly. According to FinStat, the unit trust statistical research service, Fidelity's Pounds 485m European Fund ranked first out of 88 funds measured by performance over the past five years, but over the year to this June, it ranked 83rd out of 125. Similarly, its Special Situations Fund, once its pre-eminent investment vehicle, ranked sixth out of 69 funds on seven-year performance but 128th out of 146 funds over the past two years. That fund's performance has improved over the past year to June and its one-year returns rank 49th out of 147 funds in a similar category. Thus, Fidelity's attempt to achieve better returns for unit holders by trying to get the most out of the companies in which it has invested becomes more understandable. But many other UK fund managers face similar pressures on investment returns yet few have chosen to flex their muscle in such a visible way. 'We feel its much more effective to do these things in private,' said the corporate finance director at one large UK institution. Indeed, fund managers say that the very threat that their hostile actions may be made public often acts as a disincentive for any action at all. In the case of WPP, Fidelity led a group of preference shareholders who threatened to vote against a restructuring unless lenders offered them better terms. Fidelity was able to gather the support of 30 per cent to 40 per cent of the shareholders after compiling an extensive analysis of the terms of the deal which it circulated to other investors. In the end, Fidelity was forced to climb down after it became evident that the lenders were prepared to send WPP into receivership and render the shares worthless. But Fidelity says it has no regrets about its role in WPP or in previous cases where it has challenged management. 'This is the first large company where we have been the biggest shareholder,' said Mr Bolton. 'In retrospect, we might have been wiser to retain an investment bank to represent our interests but we don't think it was a mistake. It doesn't change our view that as a house, we will stand up for shareholders.' Mr Barry Bateman, head of Fidelity's UK business, said that perhaps the company's US parent had encouraged a degree of activism which, while uncommon in the UK, was increasingly prevalent in the US. 'As an investment house we encourage this (activism) amongst our fund managers whereas other firms discourage their fund managers from doing these things.' Fidelity has played a leading role in more management confrontations than any of its counterparts. It won two victories last year - at Brown and Jackson and Great Western Resources, a US-based but London-listed company - but failed in its efforts to oust the management at Cityvision, the video rental chain, after it agreed to be acquired by US-based Blockbuster at a price some shareholders considered too low. But Fidelity has at times been uncomfortable about such public activism. Earlier this year, it dismissed a corporate troubleshooter after deciding that his actions had received too much adverse publicity. His role was to try to turn losing investments around, frequently through management changes. Fidelity has also been active in the share trading settlements area. When a group of international banks refused fund managers access to Swift, an electronic worldwide messaging system for bank payments, Fidelity and Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank, proposed their own system, forcing thebanks to back down. Fidelity has also been an activist - generally unsuccessfully - on continental Europe. In November 1990, Fidelity baulked at selling its shares in Furness, one of Rotterdam's big shipping service companies, to its rival Pakhoed, arguing that the price was too low. In the end, it sold its shares to a third party, saying it believed that most of the remaining shareholders were likely to accept the deal. In March 1991, it joined a group of dissident shareholders in NedLloyd, the Dutch transport group, who unsuccessfully sought to force a radical restructuring of the board. But the big question for Fidelity is if, overall, its actions enhance returns to investors. Without better returns, it is likely to have fewer investors whose interests need safeguarding.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Korean </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Yi Sang-ki: "No Sign of North Korea's </F> Provocation Against the South"]    [Text] With repeated reports by the U.S. press on the U.S.  Government plan to deploy Patriot missiles and Apache offensive  helicopters on the Korean peninsula and on the state  intelligence support team dispatched to the ROK, people are  under the impression that tensions are being heightened on the  Korean peninsula.    In the annual report to President Kim Yong-sam on 20  January,  Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae reported: North Korea internally  completed war preparations last year. As North Korea has  designated 1995 as the year of reunification, it is making every  effort to achieve this end. Therefore, in the event that the  nuclear issue--its meaningful card--faces a deadlock and that  North Korea comes to a crisis in its political system, there is  a great possibility that North Korea will attempt armed  provocations in order to overcome the crisis.    It is indeed a matter of interest if the moves of the North  Korean Army are so alarming that the situation on the Korean  peninsula can be described as a crisis, as reflected in the  intensified armament by U.S. Forces in the ROK and by Defense  Minister Yi in his report, even indirectly.    Meanwhile, North Korea on 28 January denounced the plan to  deploy Patriot missiles to the ROK, stating that "the reckless  attempt of South Korea and the United States to bring North  Korea under their military control has passed beyond the  dangerous level" and that this plan is "a grave intolerable  military challenge."    In fact, many experts on North Korean affairs observe that  as  long as North Korea is under international pressure -- including  that of the United States -- concerning the nuclear issue, there  is nearly no possibility that North Korea will commit  provocations or start a war against the South unless there is a  specific change in the situation. This is because North Korea is  well aware that such a provocative act will give a justification  to the United States for a military attack and thus North Korea  will suffer military retaliation, like Iraq.    The Defense Ministry and Joint Chiefs of Staff [JCS] also  revealed that "preparations are always indispensable for one to  commit a provocation. However, military activities of the North  Korean Army regarding provocation against the South have not  been detected."    Nevertheless, military experts view that although there is  no  direct sign of provocation in view of recent movements of the  North Korean Army, North Korea is consistently maintaining the  policy of reinforcing its military power to safeguard its  internal system and to enhance the authority of Supreme  Commander Kim Chong-il as the military leader.    The North Korean Army has been constantly reinforcing its  fire power, including deployment of 170-mm self-propelled guns  and 240-mm multiple rocket launchers, in frontline areas south  of Pyongyang and Wonsan, including the Armistice Line. In  addition, it is continually building missile bases, air fields,  and military industry plants, as well as supplementary  underground facilities.    In other words, 65 percent of ground forces, 60 percent of  military vessels and ships, and 40 percent of fighters have been  deployed in the advanced areas. Relevant military officials said  that, in particular, ground forces are actively conducting field  tactical exercises for division-level units and general tactical  training for special troops during the winter training period.  The JCS also noted that training activities, which have been  decreasing since 1989, have recently been restored completely.    Besides, 16 battle squadrons were organized under the  command of the East and West Sea Fleets. Thus, the North Korean  Navy now has a total of 770 ships and vessels, including 26  submarines, 460 combat ships, and 310 landing ships and rubber  rafts. However, its exercise is inactive facing a winter  maintenance season.    On the other hand, the North Korean Air Force, composed of  three combat air force commands, has 850 tactical aircraft  including 60 ultramodern MiG-23 and MiG-24, and 480 supporting  aircraft including AN-2 [as published]. The number of aircraft  totals up to 1,620. By taking advantage of fine weather  conditions, the North Korean Air Force is actively conducting  exercises, and by mobilizing quasi-military units, it is also  actively staging mobilization training during the farmers' slack  season.    Military experts pointed out that the North Korean  authorities constantly reinforced conventional weapons and  conducted military exercises this year in a bid to increase  their military power, and that they will direct great efforts to  the development of mass lethal weapons, including biochemical  weapons and missiles, according to their political purpose.    The relevant military officials said: Although no sign of  direct and concrete provocations by North Korea has been  detected up to now, in the event that economic sanctions and  limited military sanctions are visible against North Korea after  nuclear negotiation is ruptured and that North Korea faces a  crisis in its system with internal discord to be erupted in the  course of establishing Kim Chong-il's hereditary system, the  danger of war on the Korean peninsula will certainly be  heightened.</p>

			<p><P> August 10, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOT TO SHOP : TOO THIN? TRY A LITTLE LEGWORK  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: I love leggings, but I'm extremely conscious of my legs -- they're  really skinny (my brothers used to call me Olive Oyl, OK?). Is there any way I  can wear leggings this fall and not look like a toothpick?  </P> <P>  -- N.G., Woodland Hills  </P> <P> DEAR N.G.: Don't despair, there's a solution that will pump up your legs  without leaving you looking like Bluto. Printed leggings are expected to be all  the rage this fall, and they also create an optical illusion, making your legs  seem heavier. Elaborate paisleys, large floral designs, geometrics, even Pucci  prints are decorating legs this season.  </P> <P> A plaid pair (pictured) by Tapemeasure sells for $52, and you don't even have  to roll your gams into a store to get them. They're from the Saks Fifth Avenue  1990 fall Folio catalogue. According to Patricia Fox, director of fashion and  marketing for Saks Beverly Hills, "We feel printed, patterned leggings will be  very strong this fall. Since skirts are so short -- they look like hand towels  -- it's important that the leg be covered with something opaque, either printed  leggings or ribbed knit stockings."  </P> <P> Merchandise from the Saks catalogue can be ordered by calling: (800) 345-3454.  </P> <P> DEAR HOT: When I shop in malls it's not long before I become exhausted from  going from store to store trying on clothes. My brain suffers from sensory  overload looking at everything, and then I get cranky. Is this just me or is  this a common problem? I love to shop, so I'm curious to know if there's  anything I can do about this.  </P> <P>  -- K.Z., Manhattan Beach  </P> <P> DEAR K.Z.: This sometimes happens to us too, especially after listening to  people trying out the merchandise at piano and organstores. So, to check out  remedies for mall fatigue, we checked with an architect/urban designer who  studies these things.  </P> <P> Stefanos Polyzoides, associate professor of architecture at USC, says that if  you tire while moseying through the mall, it's best to go to a section away  from shopping. Then relax and people-watch. Or have a snack.  </P> <P> He thinks it's even better if this area has some natural elements, such as  plants, fresh air, a fountain or, perhaps, sunlight coming through skylights.  In fact, Polyzoides doesn't really care for malls because, he claims, most of  them are "destroying traditional public street experiences. They don't have  sidewalks, birds, shady places and sunlit places. They're not active urban  areas. They're shopping traps."  </P> <P> There are those of us who thrive in such traps. But if mall fatigue is becoming  chronic, try some outdoor street shopping.  </P> <P> DEAR HOT SHOPPERS: How do you deal with mall fever? While you're scooping up  the last of the summer sales, sorting through the new fall styles and trying to  coordinate back-to-school wardrobes that don't include Simpsons T-shirts, how  do you cope? Send us your shopping strategies and we'll print the most amazing  ones in a future column.  </P> <P> WE BRAKE FOR SHOPPERS -- Hot to Shop recently spotted a license plate frame  with a message near and dear to our hearts: "I graduated from Cal State  Nordstrom."  </P></p>

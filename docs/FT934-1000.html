			<p>931222 FT  22 DEC 93 / Candidates closer to EU entry Talks to enlarge the European Union were given a boost yesterday when Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway agreed a formula to accommodate their environmental, health and safety standards. All four candidates also agreed they would fully support the foreign and security policy of the Union. EU negotiators said alarm over the swing towards the neo-fascists in the Russian elections had enhanced the desire of the four to belong to a common European security framework. All except Norway had previously been neutral countries. Yesterday's breakthrough - described by the EU and candidate countries as 'a Christmas present' - keeps alive hopes of concluding negotiations by March, in order to get the four in by January 1995. 'We are very much encouraged by what we have done today,' said Mr Bjorn Tore Godal, trade minister and chief negotiator for Norway, the most difficult candidate for the EU to take in, because of a range of special demands on fish, energy and agriculture. But all four candidates had felt vulnerable before their electorates on the environment, where the EU was seen as demanding lower standards in order to remove impediments to trade. In the event, EU negotiators came up with a three-pronged approach which on the face of it looks as though the 12 are adjusting upwards to higher Nordic and Alpine standards. If standards are equivalent, even though different - for example on car emissions - Brussels refused to budge. The candidates get transitional exemptions where the EC has decided to raise standards, but not yet (for instance on safety belts). Crucially, to deal with the most sensitive areas such as health labelling on products and pesticides, the candidates will get transitional exemptions with a review after four years, by when all four said yesterday they expected to be inside the EU with a full vote. Among other issues settled yesterday was a derogation to the Swedes on snus, or oral moist snuff, regarded as a health hazard outside Sweden and Norway. Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister for Europe, said it had 'saved my Christmas'. The accords received an enthusiastic welcome from Sweden's mainstream parties, with the leadership of the opposition Social Democratic party adding crucial support. Opposition to Sweden's membership stands at near 50 per cent, with less than 30 per cent in favour. As a result, winning over opposition among supporters of the Social Democrats, Sweden's biggest political party, is seen as vital to securing a 'yes' to membership in a planned referendum.</p>

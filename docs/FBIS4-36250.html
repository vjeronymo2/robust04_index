			<p>BFN     [Text] The leaders of the Wafd, National Progressive  Unionist Grouping, and the Liberal parties have issued the  following statement explaining their stand on the formation of a  committee to prepare for the national dialogue:    The leaders of the parties signed this statement;    Out of their concern to continue the national dialogue on a  sound and correct basis capable of achieving the hopes that the  Egyptian masses have pinned on it;    Out of their commitment to the homeland's interests that  require us to work together toward a real understanding  established on the basis of free and equal expression and on the  basis of the various political forces' direct and equal  participation in setting out its agenda, basis, and the rules  that govern it;    While noting that the committee to prepare for the national  dialogue was not formed in the right manner; both in form -- as  the committee was imposed by one party without consultations --  and in substance -- as the majority of the committee members  were chosen from the ranks of the ruling party [National  Democratic Party];    While noting that the choice of the rapporteur was  successful, and despite our respect for the rapporteur, we  believe that it would have been better if consultations were  held on the choice of the rapporteur, his role, whether he is  the chairman of the conferees, their sole spokesman, or whether  he is just the organizer of the sessions;    While reviewing the decision of the Wafd and the Democratic  Nasirite parties not to participate in the dialogue so as to  record their objections, most of which can be said to be  objective and should be taken into account;    They believe that it is necessary to review the issue and to  attempt to try to reach a common understanding over the  committee's form and composition, the rapporteur and his role,  the system of expressing views, and the various parties' right  to voice their opinions. This might make it incumbent upon us  all to participate directly in a common and constant dialogue  until we reach an understanding that will ensure that the  national dialogue will start properly and achieve equality and  which can achieve the desired outcome.    Hence, the signatories of this appeal call on all the  parties  to seek to hold collective and bilateral dialogues with the aim  of reaching a common agreement before the start of the national  dialogue committee's sessions.    There is a period of time between today and 12 June -- the  date set for the committee's second session -- during which an  attempt can be made to achieve an understanding on the needed  bases and avoid the mistakes which have invoked our  observations. While these consultations require more time, we  believe there is a need to give them ample opportunity for  unifying our views and uniting all the political forces within  the framework of the national dialogue for the sake of achieving  the desired national interest. Hence, being committed to a  fixed date might not be necessary. What is necessary is to find  an ample opportunity for real consultations and for reaching new  agreements.    Our objective from all this is the homeland's interest and  ensuring the success of the dialogue on a basis that achieves  equality and sufficient respect for all its parties.    God is our witness.</p>

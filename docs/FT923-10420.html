			<p>920730 FT  30 JUL 92 / The Lex Column: Taking a short break The FT-SE's rise of more than 3 per cent in the past two days is in welcome contrast to the recent mood of desperation. But it would be premature to assume a lasting change in sentiment. There is a natural inclination for London to follow Wall Street's sharp rebound while it lasts. Germany's June inflation figures were better than expected, which may go some way towards allaying fears of a rise in the Lombard rate after the summer holidays. Neither of these developments holds any promise of a sudden change for the better in the UK economy. The striking aspect of Wall Street's recovery is that companies such as Chrysler are starting to produce the kind of earnings recovery for which US investors had been nervously hoping. There is less chance of a pleasant surprise on earnings in the UK, notwithstanding the odd bright spot such as BAT. If there were, house repossessions would be falling faster and the latest CBI survey would not have made such depressing reading. Meanwhile, the rise in equities has not generated much end-investor demand. That smacks more of a market trying to establish a floor than one poised for real recovery.</p>

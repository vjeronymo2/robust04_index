			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] A demonstration is scheduled for 4 February.  Mobilization for National Development [MDN] plans to demonstrate  against the embargo and in favor of the employers' movement.  Professor DeRonceray, a fierce opponent of Father Aristide,  asserts that the embargo has only undermined our economy and  worsened the misery of the poor. It is urgent that he go down to  the streets to say no to the embargo. The demonstration, which  will begin in Colomb Quay, will stop in front of the parliament  and the U.S. Embassy. Let us listen to Hubert De Ronceray.    [Begin recording, in Creole] Through this demonstration we  will join with the businessmen, will say no to the embargo  imposed on the people by the international community, and will  say yes to a solution coming from inside the country. MDN  invites all its partisans and friends in Port-au-Prince to  participate in this demonstration, and all people living in the  provinces and the rural sections to organize peaceful marches to  force the deputies and senators to be done with the Aristide  matter and to implement Article 149 of the Constitution. We will  then have a provisional government of concord that will unblock  the country, and will hold elections for the installation of a  definitive government. [end recording]</p>

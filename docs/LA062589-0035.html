			<p><P> June 25, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RESIDENTS IN A STEW OVER SEA WALL SETTLEMENT  </P> <P> Take a few rotting sea walls and toss in the ocean's natural tendency to erode  anything in its path. Add one state bureaucracy. Stir in 94 property owners,  more than a dozen insurance companies and about 30 attorneys. Bring to a boil.  </P> <P> The ingredients add up to a lot of confusion, a long-simmering legal battle  and, for many of the Las Tunas Beach residents, an ill-tasting and costly  settlement to replace the group of deteriorating sea barriers near their Malibu  oceanfront homes.  </P> <P> In two weeks, officials from the state of California and the Ticor Title  Insurance Co. are scheduled to announce whether they will accept the proposed  settlement, which would require the Las Tunas homeowners to pay for partial  construction costs of new sea walls and assume liability for them for the next  50 years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 59 Agreed to Sign  </P> <P> More than one-third of the homeowners, many of them furious over the conditions  of the settlement, have so far declined to sign it, but only 51% of their  signatures are needed to enforce it. So far, 59 have agreed to sign, apparently  ensuring the deal will go forward. Last week, the state and Ticor extended the  deadline to July 7 in an apparent attempt to get more homeowners to sign the  agreement.  </P> <P> "I've felt from the very beginning that this was an awful agreement," said Lee  Crowe, one of the so-called dissident property owners. "The homeowners have  been led astray. Nobody has a grip on what this will mean for any of us."  </P> <P> The steel-reinforced concrete barriers, called groins, were built 60 years ago  at the eastern Malibu site to prevent further erosion of the beach. They were  built by Title Insurance &amp; Trust Co., Ticor's forerunner, to protect the  land it owned at the time. But after years of being concealed, the concrete  walls broke away and the corrosive salt water ate away at the exposed metal,  leaving behind a series of sharp, twisted spikes.  </P> <P> Several years ago, the state of California filed a suit against 92 Las Tunas  property owners and the insurer, seeking to force them to repair or remove the  dangerous groins and assume all future liability for them.  </P> <P> Since that time, more than two dozen lawyers representing the state, Ticor, the  homeowners and their insurance companies have been haggling over a solution.  </P> <P> Under the proposed settlement, a geologic hazard abatement district would be  formed to replace the rotting groins with eight "rubble mound" barriers along  the beach at an estimated cost of $3.05 million.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Pitch In $400,000  </P> <P> Ticor will put up $2.15 million, the homeowners' insurance companies will pitch  in $400,000 and the rest will be assessed to the property owners, an estimated  cost of $30,000 to $40,000 per parcel.  </P> <P> Several of the homeowners' attorneys say they are opposed to the agreement  because not enough study has been done to determine the exact cost of the  project or to determine future maintenance costs. And many of the homeowners  say that the new groins will have no effect on their beachfront properties, yet  they are being forced to join in the settlement anyway.  </P> <P> "The problem for all of us is that a tremendous amount of this agreement has  been left to speculation," said attorney Frank Hobbs, who represents one of the  property owners. "You really don't know how much it's going to cost because  there are no specifications for the groin systems. There is just so much that  is completely unknown. There's not a lot of substance to this settlement."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Supports Settlement  </P> <P> However, Craig Dummit, the attorney who represents about 62 of the 94 property  owners and supports the settlement, said there is no way to come up with exact  figures for a groin system. He said the cost of the project is known "as well  as humanly possible."  </P> <P> "It actually took a lot of creativity to get this agreement and frankly I was  surprised that it was signed by as many people as it was," said Dummit, who  said he wrote most of the 47-page settlement document. "But I guess I would  have made a bad playwright. I've gotten a lot of bad reviews."  </P> <P> Ticor attorney Don Franzen said the insurance company would not comment on the  proposed settlement until the sign-up deadline passes.  </P> <P> Those who sign the agreement must waive their right to sue Ticor over the groin  dispute. Several homeowners opposed to the agreement have lawsuits pending  against the insurance giant.  </P> <P> Thirteen groins, ranging from 80 to 455 feet long, were erected in 1929 at Las  Tunas Beach in eastern Malibu. Five of the groins stand in Las Tunas State  Beach, which is little more than a dirt parking lot fronting the Pacific Ocean.  Under the agreement, the state will assume liability for those groins, while  the homeowners will be liable for the replacement and maintenance of the other  eight. The state will not be required to pay any money under the agreement.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Houses Could Be Threatened  </P> <P> State attorneys have long maintained that the homeowners and Ticor should  either remove the groins or repair them. Property owners in the area claim that  the state threatened to pull the groins out if they were not repaired, even  though many experts believe that houses and portions of the beach could be  washed away if the groins were removed.  </P> <P> Several homeowners are upset over the agreement because they believe that they  could be forced to pay thousands of dollars in future assessments to maintain  the groins.  </P> <P> "The biggest problem is that it is a complete unknown how much the homeowners  would have to pay," attorney Jeanne Flaherty said. "There are just too many  ifs, ands and buts in this agreement. It's ambiguous and it is unfair."  </P> <P> The proposed settlement will be negated if the assessment district is unable to  find an insurance carrier, and several attorneys say that finding an insurance  carrier could be a problem considering the potential hazard created by the  groins.  </P> <P> There have been two lawsuits involving joggers during the past 10 years. In  each incident, the runners claimed that they impaled a foot on a hidden spike.  The suits were settled out of court for about $30,000 each.  </P></p>

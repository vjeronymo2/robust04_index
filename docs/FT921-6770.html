			<p>920226 FT  26 FEB 92 / French asylum plan ruled out FRENCH government plans to allow police to detain asylum seekers at airports for a month without access to a lawyer were deemed unconstitutional yesterday by the Constitutional Council, Reuter reports from Paris. The ruling is likely to embarrass the Socialist government which had hoped the creation of so-called 'transit zones' at airports would help identify bona fide asylum seekers and win the confidence of voters worried about the number of illegal immigrants in France.</p>

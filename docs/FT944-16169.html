			<p>941014 FT  14 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Eleco shares fall 7p as losses widen to Pounds 6.3m Shares in Eleco Holdings fell by 7p to 25p as the building products and construction group revealed an increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds 4.82m to Pounds 6.31m for the year to June 30. Mr Field Walton, chairman, said the outcome reflected 'the fundamental decisions taken during the second half-year on restructuring the group's activities'. Operating losses fell to Pounds 1.78m (Pounds 2.23m), including a reduced deficit from ongoing activities of Pounds 756,000 (Pounds 1.21m). A charge of Pounds 3.51m (Pounds 1.07m) represented the loss on the sale of discontinued operations. This was mainly accounted for by a Pounds 1.93m goodwill write-off. . Mr David Dannhauser, finance director, said the sale of the distribution arm was for less than net asset value. A further Pounds 424,000 of losses came from the termination of discontinued operations and a provision of Pounds 451,000 was made against losses from activities which are being discontinued. Group turnover rose to Pounds 52.6m (Pounds 47.9m), with continuing operations contributing Pounds 31.4m (Pounds 26m). Mr Dannhauser said that, except for some uncertainty over unresolved excess leasehold properties from the distribution side, the restructuring was complete. The structural products division, now the core activity along with cable management, pushed pre-interest profit to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 825,000) on turnover of Pounds 17.2m (Pounds 15.8m), thanks mainly to the upturn in housebuilding. Cable management, a separate and non-engineered activity, carried increased losses of Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 986,000), including Pounds 1.89m from the UK, on flat turnover of Pounds 8.21m. The division suffered from inactivity in commercial property construction. Borrowings fell to Pounds 7.71m (Pounds 11.9m) at June 30, and were now below Pounds 5m. Net interest payable fell to Pounds 724,000 (Pounds 1.11m). Losses per share were 21.6p (15.7p loss) and again there is no dividend.</p>

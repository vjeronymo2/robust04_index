			<p><P> December 17, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: LOUISIANA A-'BLAZE'  </P> <P> "This is probably the most exciting and glamorous thing that's ever happened to  our community."  </P> <P> That's how film commission co-chairman George Wyatt summed up the love affair  between the community of Winnfield, La., (pop. 7,500) and "Blaze" -- just  released in Los Angeles but still unseen by Winnfieldans.  </P> <P> Winnfield is hometown -- and final resting place -- to Earl K. Long, the  legendary Louisiana governor who made headlines with his love affair with  stripper Blaze Starr. It's also where about 60% of the movie was filmed.  </P> <P> What's being touted as "A Winnfield Celebration of 'Blaze' " will take place  Monday night in neighboring Alexandria (48 miles to the south), site of the  nearest walk-in theater. (Winnfield only has a drive-in.)  </P> <P> Following the Touchstone Pictures-sponsored screening, at the Alexandria Cinema  6, Winnfieldans will gather for a bash at the Bentley Hotel -- the campaign  headquarters where Long suffered his fatal 1959 heart attack.  </P> <P> Proceeds from the Bentley to-do will go to further the Winnfield Film  Commission's pursuit of Hollywood. "Our town can be Anytown, USA," bragged  Wyatt.  </P> <P> Still, it took some doing to convince the "Blaze" film makers to shoot there.  </P> <P> "We had to wine and dine them," said Wyatt, who brought out writer-director Ron  Shelton and exec producer Dale Pollock, feeding them Southern cooking at  Lynda's Country Kitchen and the Huey P. Long Motor Hotel Restaurant.  </P> <P> "We had to impress them with our rich political history -- and the fact that  this town has authorities on Earl Long. There are folks here who went coon  hunting with Earl."  </P> <P> Winnfield won out -- the state film commission estimates that "Blaze" brought  $13.5 million into the state, Wyatt said.  </P> <P> Also left behind -- in cement: hand and other body imprints of the cast and  crew. "We have Paul Newman's hand print and bare feet prints -- and Ron  Shelton's nose and eyebrows," said Wyatt.  </P> <P> "He kissed his (cement) block!" Pat H. Broeske  </P></p>

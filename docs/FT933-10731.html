			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / The ERM - Picking up the Pieces: Balladur blames crisis on high German rates MR Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, yesterday blamed high German interest rates for the currency crisis within the European exchange rate mechanism which has ended the strong link between the French franc and the D-Mark. The prime minister said he had favoured a temporary withdrawal of the D-Mark from the ERM to ease the strains on the currency system but that the French government had agreed to a widening of the bands within which ERM currencies can fluctuate to preserve the process of European integration. Mr Balladur said the French government would remain committed to the stability of the franc. However the French currency came under strong pressure on the foreign exchange markets. Political commentators in Paris said that a sustained decline in the franc would seriously damage the government's credibility. 'The strong franc has been at the centre of the government's policies,' said one Paris-based diplomat. 'The easing of the D-Mark link represents a big risk.' Mr Balladur said that the French government had favoured a 'holiday' for the D-Mark to allow Germany to absorb the impact of the costs of unification. But he expressed satisfaction with the compromise agreed in Brussels because it prevented a devaluation of the franc and ensured the survival of the ERM. 'The European Monetary System remains in working order with a considerable loosening, but its founding principles remain in effect,' the prime minister said. Mr Balladur admitted that the negotiations in Brussels had been difficult. Privately, French officials said that disputes with Germany had threatened to deadlock the negotiations on two occasions. But the French prime minister said that the Franco-German relationship 'remains the basis for any European construction that is solid and durable'. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economics minister, said that the decision to widen the margins for ERM currencies was 'the best solution for the crisis in the ERM'. He added that the franc 'would support itself well' over the coming days. Political commentators in Paris said that the weakening of the franc/D-Mark link could exacerbate divisions in the ruling RPR-UDF coalition. Such concerns were eased slightly by a vote of support from Mr Jacques Chirac, head of the prime minister's Gaullist RPR party. 'I fully approve of the government's stance, notably in the monetary negotiations of the past few days,' said Mr Chirac, who has previously displayed an equivocal stance on the strong franc policy. The Paris stock market reacted enthusiastically to the reform of the ERM. The CAC-40 index rose by more than 2 per cent to close at 2,129 on hopes that the easing of the currency link with Germany would allow interest rate cuts in France.</p>

			<p><P> May 4, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EC REPORT CALLS U.S. TRADE ACT DISCRIMINATORY  </P> <P> The European Community Commission on Wednesday released its 1989 report on U.S.  trade barriers, singling out 42 regulations and trade practices that it said  impedes imports from the 12 EC nations.  </P> <P> The barriers include quantitative restrictions, export subsidies, customs  barriers, public procurement policies, countervailing duties, anti-dumping  procedures and tax policies, the report said.  </P> <P> Its release came a day after the Bush Administration released its report on  foreign trade practices that it considers unfair.  </P> <P> EC Commission spokesman Claus Ehlermann said the timing of the release of the  EC report was not linked to the U.S. report. He said the EC report was an  annual event and its release simply "coincided" with the report by the Office  of the U.S. Special Trade Representative.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Permanent Discrimination'  </P> <P> The EC report criticized the 1988 U.S. Fair Trade Practices Act, which it said  will "make it more likely that unilateral action will be taken to redress  allegedly unfair trade practices.  </P> <P> "Such unilateral action . . . without authorization from the General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade is illegal."  </P> <P> The report also cited the "Buy American" provision of the U.S. Trade Act that  "has created permanent discrimination in favor of U.S. products."  </P> <P> The clause provides for action by the Bush Administration against foreign  countries that discriminate against U.S. products or services in government  procurement, including a ban against "offending" countries.  </P> <P> Another category of restrictions includes U.S. measures that have been found to  violate international trading rules and in which the United States has neither  modified nor offered compensation to its trade partners for trade damage  caused.  </P> <P> As examples, the report cites the "U.S. failure" to implement findings of GATT  on the illegality of the "Superfund" oil levy and the "nonconformity" of the  U.S. system of customs users' fees.  </P></p>

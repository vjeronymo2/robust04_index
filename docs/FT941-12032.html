			<p>940201 FT  01 FEB 94 / International Company News: A deluge of paper threatens investment in India - A flood of money has exposed faults in the antiquated stock settlement system The recent rush of foreign portfolio investment into India is threatening to overwhelm the country's primitive stock settlement system. The investments, more than Dollars 1bn, are generating so much paperwork that the Bombay-based foreign banks - which handle the transactions as custodians for foreign investors - are being buried in an avalanche of transfer forms, share certificates, cheques and revenue stamps. Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has stopped servicing new customers - including clients who have already opened accounts but not yet used them - and asked existing customers to limit trading volumes. Citibank of the US, Hongkong Bank's main competitor, has stopped taking on new business. Standard Chartered Bank, the third in the market, has only a small custody service in India - it says it has no backlog, but refuses to take on more work than it can handle. The bankers' informal ban on new clients mean that some of the India country funds launched in recent weeks will be unable to invest until the backlog of paperwork is cleared - which could take three months, according to Hongkong Bank officials. 'This is the world's largest paperchase,' says Mr GC Dobby, Hongkong Bank's chief executive officer for India. 'The three banks are struggling to cope with a tidal wave of paper which threatens to overwhelm us.' Some fund managers have postponed planned Indian investments until settlement procedures improve. Few people in India were prepared for the flood of foreign funds. The government, which is orchestrating radical economic reforms, opened the stock market to foreign portfolio investment only in late 1992 and, since foreign fund management companies had to register before being permitted to trade, it was not until the middle of last year that the first were ready to invest. Accumulated foreign portfolio investment soared from under Dollars 50m at the end of June 1993 to more than Dollars 1bn by the end of the year. The Indian settlement system dates back to the Victorian era. Procedures are designed for the country's millions of small private investors, some of them buying as few as 10 or 100 shares, not institutions wanting to buy 100,000. Even under normal conditions, 10 to 20 days elapse between placing an order with a broker and payment/receipt of shares. The investor or his custodian (if he has one), then has to examine the share certificates to see if they tally with the transfer deeds; Standard Chartered officials say 121 items must be individually checked, including dates, signatures and no less than four sets of serial numbers. Over a quarter of transactions contain errors. Once the mistakes are corrected, the custodians must stick revenue stamps to each transfer deed and send off the papers to specialist registration companies which, despite being required by law to complete the registration of shares in the new owner's name in two months, often take three or four. None of this is unique to India; practices in some other developing countries are similarly cumbersome. What compounds the problem in India is the country's size and the complexity of its stock market, which has 22 separate exchanges and about 6,500 listed companies. Shares are commonly traded in lots of 10, 50 or 100, a practice geared to the small investor. So a fund manager who wishes to buy 10,000 must purchase thousands of separate lots. The bundles of paper in Hongkong Bank's Bombay offices bear witness to the enormous workload - scores of clerks work at desks piled with certificates and transfer deeds bound together with string, surrounded by tin boxes containing yet more certificates and deeds. To help cope with work, the bank has rapidly expanded its custody staff from 30 at the end of October to 120 plus another 100 temporary clerks, working in two shifts six days a week. Citibank, with 70 people in custody services and Standard Chartered with 12 are also expanding. All three are trying to streamline their procedures and to secure more vault space. Foreign fund managers have generally avoided Indian banks because they lack experience in international custody work and often do not have the capital to meet minimum, internationally acceptable standards for custody work. However, the State Bank of India, the country's largest commercial bank - which does meet the capital requirements - is preparing to enter the market. In response to lobbying from the Hongkong Bank, the Indian finance ministry and the Securities and Exchange Board of India last month approved procedural improvements. These include the introduction of 'Jumbo' transfer deeds, which will allow the custodian to use one transfer deed for the whole order instead of one per lot of shares; 'Jumbo' share certificates, for lots of 1,000 shares or more; and the payment of stamp duty by cheques instead of revenue stamps. However, it could take months before these procedures are accepted by the whole market, including private investors, brokers and registrars as well as custodians. Eventually, the system will be replaced by computerised scripless trading and settlement. But this is unlikely to be introduced in India for at least two years and will at first be limited to leading shares. Even though the paperchase should steadily become less frustrating, it will remain part of the price paid for doing business in India for a long time to come.</p>

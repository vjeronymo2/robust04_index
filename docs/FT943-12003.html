			<p>940727 FT  27 JUL 94 / International Company News: Chevron disappoints as margins slip in quarter Chevron, the San Francisco-based energy group, turned in worse-than-expected results for the second quarter as profit margins at its refining and marketing operations slipped further than those of other big US energy companies. Like others, Chevron's downstream earnings were hit by the rising oil price, which pushed up the cost of supplies. Mr Ken Derr, chairman and chief executive, said US profit margins in particular had suffered, with a rise in the oil price of around Dollars 3 a barrel from a year before and an increase in prices of re-fined products of only Dollars 1 a barrel. US downstream operations recorded a loss of Dollars 42m, against a profit of Dollars 97m (before restructuring charges), while the non-US refining and marketing business saw profits fall to Dollars 27m from Dollars 107m. Upstream earnings of Dollars 152m were higher than the first three months of the year but failed to match the year-ago quarter's Dollars 207m. Overall, after-tax profits in the period were Dollars 257m (after a Dollars 5m charge,) against Dollars 50m (after special charges of Dollars 515m) the year before. Earnings per share were 39 cents, up from 8 cents a year ago (or 87 cents before charges). For the first six months, net income was Dollars 645m (after charges of Dollars 41m), compared with Dollars 551m (after charges of Dollars 517m).</p>

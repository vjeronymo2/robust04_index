			<p><P> August 13, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OUTTAKES: HORSE TRADING  </P> <P> Writer-director Christopher Coppola -- nephew of Francis Ford -- hopes to get  his "Black Stallion III" under way this fall in Northern Nevada, he told us.  He's just returned from North Dakota, where he found a new black Arabian to  star in the latest film installment based on the series of Walter Farley young  adult books.  </P> <P> The original Black -- seen in the first two films (1979 and 1983) -- "was too  old to be in the movie -- and he'd lost an eye in an accident," Christopher  explained.  </P> <P> Kelly Reno, now 22, who starred in the two previous films, is also over the  hill. His character -- a young boy who tames a stallion -- is in his mid-teens  in "III," coping with the Black becoming wild again, against a '50s American  west backdrop.  </P> <P> Mickey Rooney is expected back as the trainer, but casting is under way for the  plum role of the boy.  </P> <P> Uncle Francis is exec producer.

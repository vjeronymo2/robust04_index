			<p>931223 FT  23 DEC 93 / Prague awaits its spring chicken After the revolution came McDonald's. Now the famous hamburger will face much tougher competition from fast-food rival Kentucky Fried Chicken which plans to expand significantly its presence in central and eastern Europe. KFC intends to open up to 40 restaurants over four years in the Czech Republic, one of the region's strongest markets, as well as increase the number of its restaurants in Poland. KFC's move is its biggest commitment yet in the region. But it faces stiff competition from McDonald's which was quicker to take advantage of the opening of the former communist markets and of the popular appetite for western and American products and fashions - catching the headlines when it opened its Moscow restaurant in 1990. McDonald's began its activities in the region in 1988 with restaurants in the former Yugoslavia and Hungary, then rapidly built up its presence with more than 40 outlets currently operating in the region including Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, and Russia. But Pepsico, owner of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, which specialises in Mexican food, is fighting back in the war to win eastern European palates weaned on the more stolid fares of pork, goulash, dumpling and boiled cabbage. KFC's move into the Czech Republic is part of a strategy of rapid development in the region. 'We also have very aggressive growth plans in Poland where we will open at least another 10 outlets next year,' says Mr David Rutley, business development director for central Europe at Pepsico Restaurants' division in London. Pepsico currently has two restaurants in Warsaw, and three in Budapest. The company is upbeat about prospects in the Czech Republic where it will be partner in a joint venture with Motokov, a diversified Czech trading company. 'Our experience in Poland has been wildly successful,' a spokesman at the company's headquarters in Louisville, said. The Czech Republic has good economic prospects and chicken is already part of the local diet. KFC's first Czech outlet will be opened in the summer and offer its standard fare of fried chicken, mashed potatoes and biscuits. Encouraged by results elsewhere in the region, the company is confident of success. The main competition will come from McDonald's whose four outlets in Prague, and another three in provincial cities, have been highly popular among the younger generation. Pepsico admits there is sharp international competition between the two groups on the global market, but says it is misleading to talk of competition in individual markets. 'We offer very different products, so we don't really compete in that sense,' says a spokesman. But not everything goes according to plan. McDonald's closed three of its six restaurants in the former Yugoslavia because of the civil war and the United Nations embargo which prevents it from importing crucial ingredients. Three restaurants remain, but they have been downgraded, losing the characteristic red and gold arch symbol. Finding good local supplies is crucial for keeping prices low in an increasingly competitive environment. KFC says it normally uses local suppliers importing only the recipe's secret herbs and spices from the US, but the pale-fleshed Czech chicken may not be be up to Kentucky's standards.</p>

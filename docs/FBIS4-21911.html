			<p>BFN     [Text] Jerusalem, April 7 (AFP) -- The Islamic Resistance  Movement HAMAS warned Thursday [7 April] it will soon fire  rockets at Israeli homes and urged Palestinians to stock up with  food for war.    The threat in a communique distributed in the occupied  territories came a day after a suicide bomber from the HAMAS  armed wing 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam killed seven Israelis and  wounded 45 at 'Afula.    That was just the first of five major attacks to come on  Israeli targets in revenge for the Hebron mosque massacre of 30  Moslems by a Jewish settlers on February 25, HAMAS said.    "We are calling on settlers to evacuate now so no one will  be  able to accuse us of killing civilians," the communique said.    "Our al-Qassam units will shell their homes with rockets  that  we have received recently. Everyone knows we keep our word."    HAMAS called on "shopkeepers and the people to stock up with  foodstuffs because an atmosphere of war will prevail in the near  future."    The statement also urged PLO chairman Yasir 'Arafat to halt  negotiations with Israel for one year.    "Our units will force Israeli leaders to evacuate their  soldiers and settlers from Gaza, Jericho and Hebron without any  conditions as a first step to liberating the whole of the West  Bank and strip," HAMAS said.    "We will guarantee Arafat's position as president if he  agrees."    The communique noted that 'Izz-al-Din al-Qassam waited until  the traditional Moslem day of mourning 40 days after the Hebron  slaughter to carry out the bombing in 'Afula, northern Israel.</p>

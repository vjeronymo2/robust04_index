He said that, in the event of  endangerment, the entire peacekeeping forces would be pulled  out, and not just the units of individual states. He refused,  however, to assess the political situation and decisions by the  UNPROFOR commander in the Balkan conflict. He said that our  UNPROFOR members have been operating in Sarajevo for nine months  and stressed that "they want to serve there and do not even want  to be replaced." Their "general security" in the Bosnian  capital is guaranteed, he said.    In reply to our question about his view of the stand adopted  by Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Kozyrev, who,  according to a TA SR report, rejected the possibility of UN  military intervention in the area of the Bosnian conflict,  Slovak Minister of Defense Imrich Andrejcak said that the  Russian Government had not officially issued any such statement.  "I do not know the statement to which you refer, and,  therefore, I am not going to comment on it. As for the operation  of our battalion, with the deadline mentioned [in the NATO  Council ultimatum] approaching, the UNPROFOR command will adopt  measures to protect its own units. We need not worry."  According to Minister Andrejcak, at present there is no reason  to withdraw Slovak UNPROFOR units from former Yugoslavia.  "Measures will be adopted so that they are not in the  endangered zone," he added. According to information provided  by the Ministry of Defense of the Slovak Republic, the  engineering battalion of the Army of the Slovak Republic on the  territory of former Yugoslavia is deployed in Croatia and is  subordinated to the UNPROFOR command.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Quotation marks as received] </F>   [Text] Kiev, 12 Apr -- Ukrainian parliamentary chairman  Ivan Plyushch made a speech on Ukrainian TV. Replying to  questions, he noted in particular: "On the whole, I am satisfied  with the elections to the new parliament but I expected somewhat  better results... I think (and I am not the only one: the  overwhelming majority of Ukrainian citizens are striving to  create a democratic, law-based society) that it would have been  impossible not to have held the elections. A competent and  full-blooded Supreme Council was elected which, I think, will do  everything to continue and improve drafted legislation and  continue the legislative process."    Touching on the issue of political forces which are now  emerging on the political arena, Ivan Plyushch stressed: "This  is an ambiguous issue. Today, in my view, some journalists and  politicians are attempting to draw hasty conclusions such as  whether the `left-wing' or the `right-wing' gained victory. If  we had a structured society, a `left-wing' and `right-wing',  then one could draw such conclusions. There are now accusations  that almost 100 `left-wing' deputies won seats in the new  parliament. I personally know many of these people and am  familiar with their elections programs. I would not be able to  find a single person among them who would state that he is  taking up his seat in order to fight against the process that is  currently taking place. They have different views as regards  the tactics... We cannot unequivocally accept the assertion  that the democratic forces suffered defeat. In the new  parliament there is a strong center. It is a constructive force  that will be the base which will attract both the `left-wing'  and the `right-wing'... Obviously, there will still be a  radical `right-wing' and `left-wing,' but this situation also  exists in civilized and democratic countries.    The speaker expressed his views on the defeat at the  elections of famous politicians. "I think this is a perfectly  normal phenomenon for a young democracy and for our society  because when they were in parliament many of the deputies often  spoke in the name of our people but had contacts with an  insignificant part of the population. They would express the  `people's views' from such a small number of people but when  they went to the masses it transpired that their views were not  shared or there was a lack of trust that these deputies  reflected these views and actions.    Second, I am not making a tragedy out of the fact that  people  expect changes. Objectively, people always relate this to hopes  for a new democratic or political force and to its arrival in  parliament..."    The chairman of the Supreme Council also touched on  relations  with Russia. He noted: "When I met representatives of the Duma  after 27 March, I thought that the forces in Russia who  understood that Ukraine is here to stay would begin to mature.  The latest actions by the Ukrainian president and the Supreme  Council give no grounds for an aggravation of relations between  Ukraine and Russia and other countries. But recently, for some  reason, just when the shoots of political stability appeared in  Ukraine, when a positive tendency was observed in the economy,  and when debts began to be paid back to Russia, political forces  appeared in Russia which attempted to convince everybody that  Russia could not live without Ukraine and Ukraine could not live  without Russia.    Obviously, the `Crimean card' is being played more and more  although in a conversation with members of the Duma, I said that  I could not imagine resolving the Crimean issue in favor of  Ukraine or Russia. There are representatives of three nations  there. Who is going to say that the Crimean Tatars do not have  the right to their own autonomy? Who is going to say that  Crimea's Russian-speaking population is guilty of something?  What is going to happen with the Ukrainians who make up a third  of the population? Crimea should be Crimean. It should be an  autonomy within the composition of Ukraine. The borders have  already been recognized. Treaties have been signed within the  framework of the CSCE and the United Nations and interstate  treaties have been concluded. A tripartite statement was signed  between the presidents of the United States, Ukraine, and Russia  on the recognition of borders.    I estimate that the population of Crimea is very cautious  about all these processes and people there are now troubled by  where President Meshkov's policies could lead to..."    The speaker noted that provided deputies support the  proposal, the first session of parliament will take place  between 10-15 May.</p>

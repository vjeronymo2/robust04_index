			<p>Language: <F P=105> Portuguese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] The Workers Party [PT] national board has postponed  until 17 February the meeting to debate the 15 controversial  points of the party's government program. Presidential  candidate Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and the party's bloc of  federal deputies will also participate in the meeting. Here is  a list of the issues on which Lula particularly disagrees with  the PT program:  <H5>  Privatization </H5>   PT proposal: To end the National Privatization Program (PND)  and review some sales already made.    Lula's proposal: To view the privatization of nonstrategic  state- owned companies. To preserve current monopolies but open  them to participation by the private sector through risk  contracts and sale of shares.  <H5>  Foreign Debt </H5>   PT proposal: To adopt unilateral measures, such as  suspending  the foreign debt payment followed by an audit. In other words:  Moratorium.    Lula's proposal: To renegotiate the foreign debt. He  believes a government that wants to negotiate cannot declare a  moratorium. Trade debts will be honored. The foreign debt will  be handled from the political viewpoint and not from the  economic and financial one.  <H5>  Anti-Inflation Policy </H5>   PT proposal: To postpone the choice of anti-inflation policy  tools until the conjuncture of problems inherited from the  previous administration is defined and identified.    Lula's proposal: To socially control inflation through  negotiations by sectorial groups. To gradually reduce inflation  instead of implementing shocks, seeking to suddenly reduce  monthly rates from 40 percent to 0.9 percent.  <H5>  Domestic Debt </H5>   PT proposal: To convert the domestic debt into bonds, thus  suspending the pact for automatic repurchase of public bonds.    Lula's proposal: To negotiate a rescheduling of the domestic  debt. Contracts will not be unilaterally broken.  <H5>  Foreign Trade </H5>   PT proposal: To end the policy of mega-trade surpluses and  to  stimulate the domestic market growth by creating a market of the  masses.    Lula's proposal: To concurrently export and create a market  of the masses are not opposing models. The goal is to  strengthen the domestic market, but without hindering the level  of exports. This would become possible through an overall  increase in production.  <H5>  Foreign Investment </H5>   PT proposal: To channel foreign capital into productive  investments.    Lula's proposal: Foreign investment will return to the  country as a result of economic stability. The government must  be credible if it is to attract foreign investment to the  productive sector.  <H5>  Agrarian Reform </H5>   PT proposal: To settle one million of families over the next  five years. Sugar mill owners land will be negotiated in  exchange for their debt to the government.    Lula's proposal: To implement an agrarian reform and settle  one million families over the next five years. The process,  however, will have to be accompanied by an agricultural policy  aimed at stimulating small farmers and cooperatives.</p>

			<p>940523 FT  23 MAY 94 / Media Futures: Faxing daily papers around the world A rather special edition of the Financial Times popped out of fax machines in Australia and New Zealand last week. The first fax edition of the paper is also on its way to Bermuda and South Africa and other places where its international edition still arrives late in the day or after the day of publication. Wednesday's four-page fax edition - on pink paper - led with news of the latest losses at Lloyd's, the London insurance market, and naturally carried the Lex column. There was also a list of all the companies mentioned in the main edition, to encourage readers to buy the full paper. The special edition is free to readers - although providers such as hotel owners pay a fee based on the number of rooms they have. Distribution by cruise lines and airlines is also being explored. The modest testing of a faxed FT is the latest sign that, after seven years of trying, Vince Waterson, business development director of Faxcast, is getting somewhere in marrying fax technology and the vertical blanking interval in television pictures to create something new. The data carrying capacity of the spare lines in the television signal, satellite and cable as well as conventional TV, is enormous and is much cheaper than international telephone lines. Add a special receiver linked to the fax machine and you have a new international publishing tool. Waterson is already running trials on fax editions of the New York Times and is looking at everything from transmitting meteorological information to credit card validation. He has backing of Dollars 25m from investors ranging from the Bank of Bangkok to Compagnie General des Eaux of France.</p>

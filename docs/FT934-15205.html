			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Management: A border terrier - Ben Verwaayen of the Netherlands' PTT Telecom welcomes change / Euromanagers to Watch watch THE last thing you would expect to find hanging in the office of one of Europe's top telecommunications executives is a McDonald's advertisement. But Ben Verwaayen, president of PTT Telecom, the Netherlands' telephone operator, has enshrined the US company's Big Mac on his wall for a very good reason. For nearly five years, Verwaayen, 41, has been telling his 33,500-strong staff that if PTT Telecom is to survive in the turbulent, competitive world of international telecommunications, it must be customer-led, not simply technology-driven. 'At the end of the day, it's like McDonald's: they don't just sell hamburgers, they sell a service as well.' The Big Mac on the wall is a reminder to all that they are, at heart, in a service industry. 'When I came here people were convinced that we sold technology. To me that's really nonsense,' says Verwaayen. 'No one is interested in opening up a telephone set to look at the circuit boards and admire their quality.' What they want, he says, is reliable, quick and imaginative service. Verwaayen, who came to the job with a degree in law and an extensive background in personnel management, public relations and business development at ITT in the Netherlands, makes no claims to being a technical wizard. 'I have two left hands,' he jokes. 'If I have to change a light bulb at home, I have to call on my wife to give me assistance.' But self-deprecating humour does little to disguise Verwaayen's central role in telecommunications, both at home and, increasingly, abroad. His company is the main operating subsidiary - as measured by turnover and by profit, not by employees - of Royal PTT Netherlands (KPN), the Dutch state-owned postal and telecommunications authority due to be floated on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange in several tranches starting next year. KPN, the biggest corporate employer in the country, with a workforce of nearly 102,000, has undergone rapid internal change since it was turned into a limited company in 1989 and allowed to operate at arm's length from the government. PTT Telecom is also a founding partner of a three-way European joint venture called Unisource, which is designed to enable the telecommunications companies of the Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland to compete with the industry's giants for the lucrative but demanding business of operating internal communications networks for the world's multinational companies. Given his role and his company, Verwaayen is closely involved not only in managing a change in corporate culture but also in the art of conducting cross-border joint ventures. When he arrived at the company in 1988, PTT Telecom was a state agency with a hierarchical top-to-bottom structure. Telephone operators and repair staff were at the bottom of the pile, carrying out duties according to a rule book rather than in keeping with customers' demands. Verwaayen and his team turned the structure by 90 degrees, emphasising contact with the customer rather than internal bureaucracy. 'We now have a front office and a back office, and I'm sitting all the way in the back,' he says. 'Everyone in the back office is only to be measured by what they do for people in the front office.' Verwaayen's approach to shaking up the company cannot be reduced to any easy formula or any standard method of presentation. 'I take every soapbox that I can find,' he says. His message, delivered energetically and often, is that change should be embraced, not avoided, and that everyone in the front office with direct contact with the customer should be an 'ambassador' for the company. Compared with the task of making PTT Telecom a service-orientated outfit, next year's privatisation is expected to have only a minor impact on Verwaayen's management style and priorities. However, Verwaayen, who admits to being blunt, says stock exchange rules on disclosing profit forecasts mean that 'I'll have to be more careful about what I say and when I say it'. So far, progress has been made in shaking up PTT Telecom. Verwaayen says the company is half-way through its process of internal reorganisation, and about three-quarters of the way home in changing its business mentality. But more needs to be done. At the level of individual employees, for example, the results are more mixed. 'There's a certain percentage, though less than 10 per cent, which still thinks the old days were better than the present days,' he says. 'We also have at least 25 per cent of people who think that we are not moving quickly enough.' Of all the decisions he has had to take, the single most important was the agreement to launch Unisource. This had the effect of carving out PTT Telecom's most international business and putting it in a separate joint venture with the Swedes and, later, with the Swiss. Verwaayen, who spends up to 60 per cent of his time on Unisource-related business, rejects the view that cross-border joint ventures are a recipe for failure, especially if they involve three partners in three different countries. The key to Unisource's success, he believes, is that the Dutch, the Swedes and the Swiss not only share the same objective but also the same motivation in pooling their international activities for multinationals. Each, he says, is convinced that a joint approach is the only way they can survive and, at the same time, remain the masters of their own destiny. The arrangement inevitably brings to the fore cultural differences. 'The Dutch are not great diplomats. We are very straight-forward,' Verwaayen says, noting that the Swedes and the Swiss have 'subtle methods' of correcting traditional Dutch bluntness. PTT Telecom's move to spin off services to multinationals into a joint venture is a serious step for any organisation to take, but Verwaayen believes that his staff have come to accept the step, despite the challenges involved. Those employees who relished the thought of greater international travel now also realise that decision-making has shifted to a European rather than a national plane. 'I'm convinced that if I were replaced in this organisation tomorrow for one good reason or another, my successor would find an organisation believing in Unisource and working as well with our partners as they do today, perhaps even better,' he says.</p>

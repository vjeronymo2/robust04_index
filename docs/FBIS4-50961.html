			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, May 21 (XINHUA) -- The China World Trade  Center, a widely-known Sino-foreign joint venture in China,  presented 380,000 yuan (about 43,700 U.S. dollars) to the "Hope  Project" here today.    The donation will be used to build a primary school in  Qidong  county of central China's Hunan Province and help Hunan's 600  school drop-outs to return to school.    The Hope Project, sponsored by the China Youth Development  Foundation (CYDF) in 1989, is aimed to help school drop-outs in  China's poverty-stricken areas to return to school.    It has received more than 200 million yuan in donations from  home and abroad during the past five years and helped over  540,000 drop- outs to get back in the classroom. In addition,  it has helped to set up more than 200 "hope primary schools" all  over the country.    According to an official from the CYDF, this year many  domestic industrial and commercial enterprises have contributed  money to the hope project. A number of hotels and some  enterprises from service trades in Beijing have organized  donations.    "This shows the industrial and commercial enterprises'  concern for the school drop-outs and the development of the  country's primary education," said the official.    However, donations from domestic industrial and commercial  enterprises are still less than two percent of the total  donations the hope project has received, said the official. He  called for more support to be given to the project by domestic  enterprises.</p>

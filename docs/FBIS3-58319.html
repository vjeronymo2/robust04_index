"I do not  think it is possible to be pleased about this sort of work in a  country with bloodbaths and atrocities. On the humanitarian  level, however, I have helped to create something extraordinary."  <H5>  A Talk in UN Headquarters in Sarajevo. </H5>   A few shells go off within hearing distance of the residence  in which Lieutenant General Francis Briquemont is staying. He  beckons to his colleague: "We have to call Milovanovic." He  then explains to us: "If the shelling starts up, we telephone  to try to calm things down. Sometimes that helps." It helps  this time. For a little while, at least; you cannot expect  anything more.    The lieutenant general, who in normal life is the commander  of the 1st Corps (including the Belgian troops in Germany), is  living these days with the failure of the laboriously achieved  Christmas and New Year's truce. On 23 December, some 1,300  projectiles fell on and around Sarajevo. Five were killed and  68 were injured -- a miserable way to begin a truce. "I had  resolved never to let any more documents be signed. They (the  leaders of the fighting parties) never respect their signatures.  We have signed 25, 35, or is it 40 cease-fire agreements, and  they have never been respected. The Christmas truce was proposed  by the Croats, and then accepted by the Bosnian, and later the  Serb military officials. In Brussels, the political officials  ratified it. And what was the result of all this? The fighting  in Sarajevo over the past few days has been more intense than in  the last five months. Something like that therefore has a  political meaning. Since (the breakdown of) the negotiations in  Brussels, none of the parties wants to appear weak; none of the  parties wants anything that has been imposed. I feel this very  strongly in the talks. In the meantime, military activity has  again dropped somewhat."    [Rotthier] Relatively speaking...    [Briquemont] You can get used to anything, you know. When I  came here in July, there were 3,000 shells falling every day.    There is always provocation in the southern part of the  city,  and the Serbs react -- how should I put it? -- too strongly.  They have problems with the concept of an "appropriate reply."  I tell them that, too. Shelling Sarajevo is stupid from the  military point of view, and always a tragedy from the  humanitarian point of view.    On the other hand, I cannot understand why there are always  talks about Sarajevo. To me, the Croatian shellings of Mostar  are just as questionable as the Serb shellings of Sarajevo -- or  what the Bosnians are doing in the area around Vitez.    [Rotthier] Do you think that all the parties are equally  bad?    [Briquemont] If you judge the situation on the basis of  international principles of law, it is difficult to see how the  Bosnian Government could be wrong. It is an internationally  recognized state, so the Bosnians feel it is difficult to be  placed on the same level as the Serbs or Croats who are  attacking their state. I personally have always tried to  approach the situation as it is, and not as people would like it  to be. It is clear that, in order to reach an agreement, all  three parties must sit down at the table. In the beginning, we  thought in terms of a multicultural, multiethnic Bosnia with  perhaps 10 provinces. We have now ended up with a division of  the land, and even the Bosnian Government is now agreed that  there must be a Muslim state alongside a Serbian state and a  Croatian state. There has been talk of a Union of Bosnian  States. President Izetbegovic has admitted that it is no longer  possible to keep a central government.    All three parties break the truces. They tell us: "We will  comply with them [the truces] if the others do." But there is  always some hothead who fires off a cannon or who empties a  machine gun. As for atrocities, these happen on all sides, but  I have noted for some time now that the military leaders --  especially the Bosnian and Croat ones -- have been trying to  bring their armies under control. In Sarajevo, we almost saw a  purge of disobedient units. A number of corp commanders have  been replaced. A British vehicle was hijacked in the Vitez area  a couple of days ago. The Bosnian commander did everything  possible to restore the vehicle to its owners. The same is true  for the Croats. I am not saying that nobody steps over the  line, because in this country it is difficult to keep everyone  under control. However, the military leaders are doing what  they can.    [Rotthier] But you will not sign any more agreements with  them?    [Briquemont] That serves no purpose -- literally. My  predecessor, Gen. Morillon -- and this is not a criticism --  clung to this in order to meet with the commanders. He hoped to  drag the parties along and to get signed agreements. I rapidly  became aware that meetings in front of journalists would only  lead to posturing. People were not coming to negotiate, but to  see the spectacle.    This is not directed just at journalists, but also at  ourselves. In the beginning, the officials always came with  three, four, or five colleagues: Not so they could negotiate  better, but to show their own delegation that they were the boss  and capable of imposing their will on others. After two or  three weeks, I then decided only to negotiate with the generals  -- as confidentially as possible. Since then, I have realized  that it is difficult to have all three of them together. Many  problems are better discussed with two parties, or even in a  tete-a-tete. The negotiations are always tough, but at least  the atmosphere is calm, and from time to time they even discuss  the problems seriously. [Briquemont ends]    [Rotthier reports] The general (58) received us in a very  modest office in the residence that used to be reserved for  Marshal Tito. The building is currently being used as the  UNPROFOR headquarters for Bosnia. It is from here that  Briquemont coordinates operations, negotiations, transportation,  and the distribution of food and other vital supplies.    He has a reputation for being straightforward, someone who  pushes things through, energetic, and a committed negotiator.  He is certainly not displeased to see us -- we are the first  Flemish journalists to visit him in Sarajevo-- but the Bosnian  mess is taking its toll.    [Briquemont] "I am tired," he said. "I will admit that. We  had hoped to reach an agreement in August, then in October, and  then in December. We have to start the same negotiations every  time, and every time we run up against the same problems, the  same breaking points. I have the feeling that it would be easier  to reach an agreement between the military men than between the  politicians, which is pretty amazing."    [Rotthier] Is that because there is a better understanding  between military men?    [Briquemont] They know each other. Generals Dilic and Mladic  (the Bosnian and Serb commanders) served in the same Army. They  had the same training; they know each other. I recently had a  meeting with both generals. I said something like: "So, now  you two have spoken with each other." "That is true," said one  of them, "Why aren't we talking." To which the other one  replied, "And why are we fighting anyway?" That is  extraordinary, is it not?    It is unbelievable to see the politician at work in Geneva  during the negotiations. All too often they do not think of  their own people. There are quite a few who are still covered  in a thick layer of Communism and who manipulate the gibberish  in all its glory. Western politicians assume the generals will  automatically apply the agreement that the politicians sign.  They are mistaken. It is almost funny. I was once going over a  political agreement from Geneva with the generals. I said  thoughtlessly: Seeing that the politicians are agreed about  this section, then everyone here should also accept it. Gen.  Mladic looked at me and said: "Cospodine generale, non" ["My  dear general, no."] He later added: "What the politicians  discuss in Geneva is their problem. They do not know anything  about the military aspect, general. We are going to rewrite  this section, and then they will have to carry it out." That was  how Gen. Mladic reasoned.    [Rotthier] So do the generals really have an eye on the  needs  of the people?    [Briquemont] I would not dare say that. But they are  certainly aware of the situation of their own troops. Military  men think in terms of balances of power. The Croats realize the  Serbs are on the sidelines watching how they fight the Muslims.  Military men know they must not needlessly exhaust their  troops. They know that perhaps better than the politicians do.  Time is beginning to be of the essence. It would be very bad  if no agreement were reached by the end of winter. We are here  to provide humanitarian aid on site. Almost every week, someone  dies at the steering wheel of a vehicle that is supplying aid.  A few days ago a Belgian was brutally murdered; there is no  other way to describe it. A few weeks ago, a French soldier was  seriously wounded by a Bosnian sniper, while he -- get this --  was distributing food to the Bosnian population. Public opinion  is becoming increasingly less acceptant of this.    [Rotthier] Has a perpetrator ever been found?    [Briquemont] No. Listen. We return aggression, since our  political officials agree to this. It is very difficult to get  a sniper, however. He shoots once and disappears -- in the city  and in the woods. In the city, returning fire could have  horrible consequences. Even their own army chiefs cannot find  them again, because we must admit: Often, the discipline at  lower levels is lacking. Perhaps you have already noticed this  at a checkpoint. They are 18 years-old. They think they are the  kings of their turf, and that they can threaten anyone or make  anyone wait half an hour. The big bosses do not have much to say  to units that, in some places, are surrounded or, in any case,  are distant. Weapons were stolen from the British vehicle.  Gen. Dilic said they would be recovered. Well, that is not  the case. Those weapons were dispersed in no time. They are  sold or kept as souvenirs.    We are in a nasty predicament. We came as a peacekeeping  force. As you know, peacekeeping in a country at war is not  very gratifying. Gen. Cot (UNPROFOR commander in chief) said  last week: It would be easier to wage a war than do what we are  doing now. We wear blue helmets; we ride in white vehicles. We  are a perfect target, and can be recognized at a distance. We  only have very light weapons. It is not easy.    [Rotthier] If I question people in Sarajevo, they say: What  does UNPROFOR bring us? There has not been water for days in  the house where we live, and there has not been electricity for  even longer.    [Briquemont] Recently, I heard someone say: If my child has  something to eat, it is thanks to UNPROFOR. I think the people  certainly respect the work we are doing. In the beginning,  there was an enormous misunderstanding. People thought UNPROFOR  had come to fight the aggressor. That was not our mandate.    [Rotthier] No, but is it really not possible, with the  troops  and resources you have, to provide electricity, water, and gas  to the city?    [Briquemont] Gas is a separate problem. It comes from  Russia, and passes through Hungary and Serbia. We checked more  than 117 km of gas pipes between Sarajevo and Zvorni (a border  town between Bosnia and Serbia), and after a few problems  everything was in order. I have not managed to find out where  the real problem lies. Sometimes the pressure in the pipe is  normal, but usually it is too low. The gas has been played  around with, which is extremely dangerous. People "tinker  around" with the pipes. If the pressure should return to  normal, there will be a risk of accidents. I met with Mr.  Kozyrev (Russian foreign minister), who told me Russia would  continue supplying [gas], even if the Bosnians did not pay.  This is a matter between Bosnians and Serbs. It is also a  question of money, since the Bosnians are refusing to pay their  bills because they suspect they would be contributing to the  Serbs share, too.    As for electricity: If we get 35 megawatts, we are in good  shape. You might be staying in a place that depends on a  generator. In Sarajevo, there are 227 generators in all. At the  beginning of the war, all the coolant oil was taken out of them  because, as chance would have it, you could drive using these  oil tanks. We now need 100 or 150 liters of oil per  transformer. We had all the authorizations to supply this  special oil according to a fixed quota: two-thirds for the  Bosnians, one-third for the Serbs. But now there is another  problem: The oil is being stolen. The police commissioner and  I have looked for a way to protect the oil -- so far  unsuccessfully. We should be able to add something to it so  that it can no longer be used for cars. There is water when  there is electricity, so electricity is the key.    We are now trying to repair a tram line. That would be  something very concrete. People are tired of walking around.  There are 20 tram cars left.    [Rotthier] And electricity is needed for them too?    [Briquemont] The snipers are a bigger problem. At a tram  stop it would be all too easy to find some victims. We are  thinking about painting the tram cars white and putting UN  insignias on them.    Generally speaking, the situation is rather disapppointing  for the people -- that I can understand. You must also realize,  however, that every day the French distribute 80 to 100 tonnes  of foodstuffs to all the population groups. Naturally, the  ministers do not like this, because then there is nothing for  them. I have been told that people lost an average of 15 kilos  in weight last winter. We are once again inviting artists, who  can eat their fill. We received a visit from an opera singer  who probably used to look like Montserrat Caballe. When I saw  her, she was like...    [Rotthier] Callas.    [Briquemont] Yes. Certain products are lacking. Not enough  sugar is distributed. People crave sweets. If you offer  someone a piece of chocolate, it looks like you are giving away  gold. And that is not just because it is Belgian chocolate.    However, it is wrong to busy ourselves just with Sarajevo.  Other parts of Bosnia are worse off: Tuzla, for example, where  800,000 people, including many refugees, are stuck.    [Rotthier] UNPROFOR is bound by a mandate that says it must  be limited, for the most part, to a humanitarian role. What  would your ideal mandate be?    [Briquemont] According to me, it is not so much a problem  of mandate. It does not please me to repeat it: There is a gap  between the resolutions in the UN Security Council and the  resources the military personnel receive on the ground for  applying the mandate. That is the problem. Recently, [Belgian  Foreign] Minister Claes invited me to Luxembourg to talk about  the plans for a humanitarian corridor. Gen. Cot said: We need  an extra 4,000 men for that. During a subsequent meeting, all  possible subjects were discussed, but nothing was arranged for  these 4,000 men. The meetings continued. People would say: We  should have this, and we should have that. But if we asked for  resources to carry it out, we got nothing. I am now going to  welcome a battalion from Malaysia. We have been asked to help  them with their equipment. I do not know if Malaysians know  what a snowflake looks like. I pity these soldiers. They are  coming in midwinter, when temperatures are minus 20 degrees  celsius. What will they do? Sit around a fire hoping not to  die of the cold. I cannot put them at the checkpoints; I cannot  let them go on patrols. I will probably not be able to use them  properly before spring. I do not resent them; they are doing  what they can, but they are a strain on the troops that are  already here, and they are going to have a tough time all winter.    This is an army that has been cobbled together. Each country  has its own equipment. There are just 400 Ukrainians, which  means they have difficulty keeping their logistics up to the  mark. There are differences in training. There are problems  with language. The Ukrainians speak no English or French;  communication is achieved through an interpreter. In periods of  crisis, this is not feasible. At such times, you must be able  to communicate directly.    There are also governments that do not accept all the  assignments. The Scandinavian battalion came under certain  conditions: It only wants to operate in Tuzla. The Danes  wanted to come with tanks as a matter of course. I do not want  to go into this too much, because there is little sense for me  to moan the entire time about what the political officials in  charge decide; but for the first time in my career as an  officer, a battalion commander has refused to carry out an order  because his government did not allow it. You must realize what  that means for an officer: refusing an order. I wanted to put  the Scandinavians in Srebrenica temporarily, while awaiting the  arrival of the Netherlanders. That was rejected. The Danes have  been stuck in Belgrade for two and a half months because the  Serbs are refusing to let their tanks through. They regard  tanks as weapons of war, not as peacekeeping instruments.    Generally speaking, the problem is that we have to make  compromises without a clear goal. As long as there is no  military agreement, we will divide our attention between  providing humanitarian aid, accompanying convoys, the mission on  Mount Igman, defending not very well defined safe areas, and so  on. I can assure you: It is not easy.    [Rotthier] A few months ago, reports appeared about  irregularities within UNPROFOR: the black market, prostitution,  drugs. How much of this is true?    [Briquemont] There was an inquiry. I have just read the  results and I am somewhat reassured. There were a few  individual deeds, which, in a couple of cases, were punished.  In a city like this, it is hard to stop an individual from  selling a pack of cigarettes, or to pay for a girl with a carton  of cigarettes. I was afraid there was an organization behind  it, but that was refuted by the inquiry.    [Rotthier] What about prostitution?    [Briquemont] Not especially. There is prostitution in all  cities. So why not in Sarajevo, too?    [Rotthier] Drugs?    [Briquemont] Very little. The main problem is fuel. The  black market prices are so high (700 Belgian francs per liter --  DE STANDAARD editor's note) that it is difficult not to find  oneself short of a liter now and then.    [Rotthier] About one year ago, in an interview with DE  MORGEN, you spoke of your concern for the future of the Belgian  Army. How are the Belgians doing here?    [Briquemont] Well. Very well. However, they are involved  in special programs: engineering and transportation. I am still  uneasy about the future of the Belgian Army. Following the  abolition of military service, we had to form units by going  virtually everywhere to look for men. Some had to alter their  function, which -- we must admit -- caused extensive  disorganization. Because, giving you just one example, who will  maintain the tanks if their drivers are being retrained in  communications? We must look to find sufficient professional  volunteers. We will also suffer Flemish-Walloon problems, about  which we can do nothing. For a whole series of historical,  political, social, and economic reasons, it is easier to find  recruits in Wallonia. We used to be able to compensate by using  militiamen, but what shall we do now? I heard one former  general say that a professional army is not more expensive --  but that is nonsense. You have to offer the soldiers something,  training, specialization.    Here I have come up with a whole range of ideas for  training.  I have discovered that everyone -- officers, even young  noncommissioned officers -- have to display tremendous  cool-headedness. They often find themselves alone in extremely  difficult situations. Yesterday, a mortar exploded 10 meters  from my vehicle. They must act. They must be capable, for  example, of being detailed to Mount Igman, where the Serbs are  50 meters to the left and the Bosnians are 50 meters to the  right; and of not losing their cool if the two sides start  shooting at each other. In conventional military situations,  you fight for four or five days before being relieved. Here it  never stops, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. It may meet  with resistance, but when I return to the 1st Corps, they will  realize it is not a matter of forming a professional army on the  basis of acquired rights such as a 38-hour work week,  recuperation days, and so on. We must have fresh, trained men.  A professional army will not accept simply anyone. Soldiers  must be in good condition. That is the only way to limit  losses. And it is the only way to be capable of handling  situations of this kind.    [Rotthier] Turning to your own future, how long will you go  on doing this? Your assignment is of no fixed duration.    [Briquemont] No, but fatigue plays a role. I have been here  for six months. In principle, all assignments last for six  months.    [Rotthier] Are you thinking of retiring?    [Briquemont] Ha! No, not at all. The defense minister and  my superiors see what I am doing and are aware of the limits of  what is tolerable. Anyone who becomes too tired makes wrong  decisions.    [Rotthier] How do you see the future in Bosnia? Two months  ago, in an interview with VOX [Belgian Armed Forces magazine],  you were still conspicuously optimistic. That would now seem to  be less the case.    [Briquemont] That is true. I believed an agreement would be  forthcoming. There was a period of international consensus that  an agreement had to be reached. I was optimistic. I am not a  pessimist by nature. The agreement never materialized. Lord  Owen is now maintaining once again that an agreement is not far  beyond our reach. I have become more cautious. Never again  will I say that I am optimistic. Should an agrement come about  quickly after all, then that would be wonderful.    [Rotthier] There are signals emanating from Great Britain  and  France that could be taken to indicate that these countries are  considering withdrawing their troops. Is there a chance  UNPROFOR will withdraw from Bosnia?    [Briquemont] Many countries are asking themselves questions.  That is normal. However, suddenly pulling out, even if no  agreement is reached, would be difficult to understand. By the  way, I too wonder whether the inhabitants of Sarajevo would  allow us to withdraw. We are strongly criticized -- and I can  understand that, because the people are suffering -- but we are  nonetheless guaranteeing the civil population minimal security,  merely by virtue of our presence.    Our presence makes a difference. That is what I find  disturbing about the criticisms leveled at us. We have few  resources, but I can say we have saved the lives of hundreds of  people. Our soldiers realize full well what their work means.  When I see the enthusiasm with which French Legionnaires  distribute food...well, that is not something you expect of a  Legionnaire. They even do puppet shows for the children. We  receive our fulfillment from the population, which expresses its  gratitude to us.    [Rotthier] Are you satisfied that you have fulfilled your  duty?    [Briquemont] I do not think it is possible to be satisfied  with this kind of work in a country ravaged by bloodbaths and  horrors. You must bring yourself to display great modesty. I  came here to take sides with the population. If I succeeded in  helping to save human lives, then I would consider my assignment  to be partly successful. I am disillusioned that we have still  not made very much progress along the road to a peace  settlement, but at the human level I have experienced something  extraordinary. I have reached the conclusion that this kind of  conflict can never be solved by violent means. I have also  grown aware of the fact that in this kind of operation you have  to switch off at the personal level, which is not easy for a  general to do. You must listen, exercise patience, and be  modest. Incidentally, I already said to my wife: "When I  return, you will have another husband." [end Briquemont]    The interview is over. The general poses, rather  uncomfortably, for the photographs. He refuses to smile. "That  would not be appropriate," he says.</p>

			<p>920623 FT  23 JUN 92 / Versailles relives old days TODAY'S joint sitting of the two French houses of parliament for the Maastricht vote, in the parliamentary chamber of the palace of Versailles, is a rare event under the Fifth Republic which is now only staged for the purpose of amending the constitution. Since the Republic was founded in 1958, there have been only three previous parliamentary sessions in Versailles; but all of these so-called congresses were held to introduce technical reforms of the constitution, minor affairs compared with today's heavily loaded session. In 1963 the congress adjusted the dates of the annual sittings of parliament; in 1974 it allowed parliamentarians to appeal to the constitutional council; in 1976 it adjusted the rules for a presidential election, to cover the death of a candidate during the campaign. A much more important reform, to reduce the presidential term from seven to five years, was launched by President Pompidou in 1973. But after it had passed the national assembly and the senate, he allowed it to lapse, because he did not think he could secure the necessary three-fifths majority in the congress. By contrast, the most important constitutional reform of the Fifth Republic, the direct election to the presidency, was introduced by General de Gaulle in 1962, through a popular referendum. In the late 19th century, however, the Palace of Versailles was for a brief period the regular seat of the French parliament. After the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871, and the outbreak of the Paris Commune, the French government and parliament retreated to Versailles. At first the parliament met in the Versailles opera house, but in 1875 they built a new assembly chamber in the Southern or Princes' wing of the palace. After that the parliament met regularly there from 1875 until 1879, when it moved back to the Palais Bourbon in the centre of Paris. But the Versailles chamber remained in use during the Third Republic for the parliamentary election of the president, and it continued to do so in the Fourth Republic after the Second World War for the election of Presidents Vincent Auriol (1947) and Rene Coty (1954).</p>

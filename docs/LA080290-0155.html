			<p><P> August 2, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> WESTSIDE DIGEST: LOS ANGELES;  </P> <P> FIRM PAYS FOR UNRULY FANS  </P> <P> Wherehouse Entertainment Inc. has paid the city of Los Angeles $18,076 to cover  costs for quelling a disturbance that erupted last March when thousands of fans  attempted to see the British band Depeche Mode at the Wherehouse record store  on La Cienega Boulevard and 3rd Street.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the area, said he and Wherehouse  President Scott Young negotiated the amount.  </P> <P> "I hope this will serve as an incentive to other companies to think a little  more responsibly before they leap into ill-advised promotional events,"  Yaroslavsky said. "Because they, not the taxpayers, are going to foot the  bills."  </P> <P> More than 130 police in full riot gear were called out to disperse at least  5,000 fans who gathered at the Wherehouse store where members of Depeche Mode  were signing records. Seven people were hurt in the ruckus that occurred when  excited youths tried to crowd into the store.  </P> <P> Young said record store officials were shocked by the high attendance at the  event and agreed shortly after the incident to reimburse the city. Yaroslavsky  praised the company for "exhibiting an admirable degree of corporate  responsibility."  </P></p>

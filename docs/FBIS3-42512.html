			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Viktor Ilyukhin, chairman of the State Duma </F> Security Committee, by Valentin Maslennikov; date and place not  given: "Without Bias or Timidity" -- first paragraph is  introduction]    [Text] In 20 years Viktor Ilyukhin progressed from  ordinary investigator in a Penza backwater to First Deputy Chief  of a USSR Procurator's Office Main Administration; he headed the  administration overseeing the application of laws on state  security. He became politically known after he instituted  criminal proceedings against Gorbachev, General Secretary of the  then-ruling CPSU, for which he was dismissed from the  Procurator's Office. He is now Chairman of the State Duma  Security Committee. At the editorial office's request Viktor  Ivanovich shares his thoughts on the plans and prospects for the  work of this most important section of the new parliament:    [Ilyukhin] Many people are troubled by my party membership:  How come a communist has been elected to such a responsible post  in a legislative organ of a democratic state? But I do not see  that this interferes in any way with a collegial organ's  fruitful work. Incidentally, all three of my deputies belong to  different parties which society also regards equivocally.  Viktor Pimenovich Mironov represents "Russia's Choice," Sergey  Semenovich Boskholov the Party of Russian Unity and Accord, and  Nina Viktorovna Krivelskaya the Liberal Democratic Party of  Russia. They are all first-class jurists and professionals in  the best sense of the word.    From the very first steps in our joint work we have set  aside  our party bias and sought a common language and mutual  understanding. The committee has a total of 20 members and the  volume of work is enormous. It is encouraging that the other  committee members are also highly qualified jurists. We have  expert lawyers, people with experience of working in courts and  internal affairs organs, and attorneys with a wealth of  practical experience.    At our very first session we found out that a collective of  like minds is forming and that everyone is concerned about one  thing: The lack of a clear concept of the country's national  security, thought out in the finest detail. So first of all we  will be working hard to elaborate one.    Not an easy task, because we are faced with a whole range of  interconnected problems which are difficult to solve. Taking  national security to mean first of all the consolidation  of a state's territorial integrity and unity, we are  singling out four main facets. They are borders, customs,  federal security services including border troops, and, of  course, economic security. All this needs to be clearly  enshrined in legislation.    The next set of pressing problems is legal support for  the fight against crime on the basis of a long-term,  wide-ranging program which includes scientific substantiation,  finances, cadre policy, and many other things.    The implementation of this program is also directly linked  with the direct protection of the person and his  individuality, which we are wont to talk about a lot but  which we in fact push into the background. So an urgent change  of emphasis from words to deeds is needed. Incidentally, what  is required in this respect is a review of the state of  emergency legislation, which must also protect people first and  foremost and not be reduced to sharing out authority.    Finally, the fourth set is an expert criminological  assessment of all draft laws passing through the Duma,  irrespective of who has prepared them. It is up to us to detect  all the flaws in legislative acts which could substantially  complicate the criminogenic situation in the country.    Of course, the committee will not be able to cope with this  volume of work alone. We plan to bring in expert specialists  and scientific subdivisions of practical experts. Discussion  papers are already available. We are finding good understanding  in other Duma committees.    At the very first session we defined our priority tasks.  They include finalizing work on the Law on Combating  Corruption. The attention to this question is easily explained:  The crime rate is increasing, there is a tidal wave of illegal  acts, and bribery and mercenary string-pulling have corroded the  entire state executive mechanism, including the law-enforcement  organs. This retards any healthy transformations in Russia.    Mafia clans are already dictating their policy not only at  the neighborhood level but also in entire cities and oblasts,  and in some places they are even taking control of legislators'  activities. This will continue as long as an official at any  level is dependent on his boss' will and whim. He must obey  only the law and must serve it faithfully and truly.    The law had already been prepared by our predecessors and  adopted by the Supreme Soviet, but it was not signed by the  president. In my view, the reason is not the shortcomings it  undoubtedly contains but the struggle between several schools of  law, whose representatives were unable to agree among themselves  but were able to persuade the president to postpone the law's  adoption. Through the efforts of two committees -- ours and the  one on legislation and judicial reform -- we have already held a  first hearing on the law and we will soon be submitting it for  consideration at a Duma session sitting. It cannot be postponed  any longer.    Two other draft laws are next in line -- "On the State  Protection of Judges and Employees of Law-Enforcement and  Control Organs" and "On the Protection of Witnesses, Victims,  and Other People Assisting in Legal Proceedings." They brook no  delay either. Because judges and MVD [Ministry of Internal  Affairs] employees are being murdered, witnesses and victims are  being intimidated, and their families are being kept in fear.  How can a judge or court official who is besieged, totally  dependent, and lacking life's essentials be objective? What is  the use of a militiaman who does not feel that he is backed up  by state protection? How can the evidence of a witness be  relied on if, outside the precincts of the court, he is not  protected from the criminals he is accusing?    We predict that these laws will not have an easy passage  through the Duma. Not because deputies do not understand their  importance and timeliness but because some legislators will  think that the state cannot afford them at the moment.  Nevertheless, this expenditure must be made if we seriously  intend to fight crime and really protect people.    The committee has extensive plans. We have a great deal to  do to improve the criminal and criminal-procedure codes and we  will be taking part in the drafting of laws on the Prosecutor's  Office, the legal profession, the Constitutional Court, and many  other things.    I want to single out especially the upcoming work to  legislatively enshrine the new status of the Federal  Counterintelligence Service [FCS]. This is a difficult question  which will certainly provoke many disputes and disagreements.  In my opinion, the president exceeded his powers by disbanding  the Security Ministry. The new Constitution does not give him  the right to autonomously destroy and reform institutions of  state authority. In place of what is, especially now, a vitally  essential part of the law-enforcement system yet another  presidential special service has been formed. There are too  many of them as it is.    Something similar can be observed with the MVD. Essentially  the enforcement structures are being removed from Prosecutor's  Office oversight and judicial and parliamentary control, and  levers of authoritarian power are being strengthened. During  its reorganization the FCS lost its investigation apparatus.  This is a blow to its capability. The shield remains but the  sword has been taken away.    I grant that some people will not agree with me, but I will  defend my opinion both inside and outside committee sessions. A  considerable number of these complex debates lie ahead of us.    Just take the question of borders. It is no longer possible  to put up with the large-meshed sieve into which they have now  turned. But to construct new ones will require at least five to  seven years of intensive work and expenditure equal to twice or  three times Russia's annual budget (without drinking, eating, or  spending a cent on anything else). There is one solution: To  agree with our close neighbors on a single external CIS border.    They cannot protect it by themselves -- as eloquently  demonstrated by Tajikistan's experience. That means that we  must form joint border troops -- which requires an interstate  accord. We must not shy away from each other but act hand in  hand. What is of help here is both our historical experience  and the recognition of the prospect of the inevitable  unification of the collapsed Union on a new basis.    West Europe's experience indicates the same: Strength  through unification. Most of our countries' inhabitants think  the same: Because they were cut for real when they were  separated, borders were drawn through families and futures. In  my opinion, the only obstacle now is leaders' political  ambitions.    I by no means want to switch the conversation about our  committee's plans to the political plane. But when national  security is being discussed there is no escaping politics. Our  committee does not consider itself to be exceeding its powers in  putting forward some urgent demands and recommendations to the  Federal Assembly, the country's government, and the Russian  president. In particular, in order to achieve our national  security the country's and the Foreign Ministry's leaders must  urgently agree with all CIS countries that the latter will not  wholly or partly join any military bloc opposing Russia. And I  believe that a strict demand should be put to our Baltic  neighbors: One of the mandatory conditions for the withdrawal  of our troops from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia is a pledge on  their part not to join any military bloc with other states and  not to allow foreign military bases to be located on their  territory.    So, the tasks facing our committee are complex and crucial,  just like the concept of security itself.</p>

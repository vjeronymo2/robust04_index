			<p>941121 FT  21 NOV 94 / Renamo leader accepts party's defeat at polls Fears of renewed war in Mozambique have receded now that Mr Afonso Dhlakama, the former rebel leader, has accepted defeat for his Renamo movement in last month's first multiparty general elections, Reuter reports from Maputo. The October 27-29 poll was won by his civil war foes, President Joaquim Chissano and the Frelimo party, which has ruled since 1975 independence from Portugal. Mr Dhlakama insisted, however, that final results announced by the independent national electoral commission on Saturday contained irregularities and were not free and fair as declared by international observers. Nevertheless, he said he would play a constructive role as head of the opposition in parliament, adding: 'I send a message of peace to the Mozambican people.' The results gave Mr Chissano 53.3 per cent and Mr Dhlakama 33.73 per cent of the 5.4m votes cast in the presidential election. Frelimo won 129 seats in the 250-member parliament. Renamo won 112. A small coalition, the Democratic Union, won the rest. Mr Aldo Ajello, the United Nations representative who has been overseeing an October 1992 peace accord that ended 16 years of civil war between Renamo and the formerly Marxist government, gave his seal of approval. So did the Organisation of African Unity and the European Union. 'Problems have occurred, irregularities were recorded and disruptions did take place,' Mr Ajello told a news conference. 'However, throughout the entire process, there has been no event or series of events which could affect the overall credibility of the elections.' Diplomats said the risk of fresh conflict now seemed remote. 'Dhlakama had to say there were irregularities to save his pride. But Mozambicans are tired of war. He knows there is no point going back to the bush,' said a western diplomat. Mr Dhlakama boycotted the first day of voting because of fraud allegations, prompting fears that he might plunge Mozambique back into war as happened in Angola, southern Africa's other former Portuguese colony. But pressure from the the UN, which had spent Dollars 1m a day on the peace process, and from neighbouring states, which threatened intervention, persuaded him to rejoin the elections. Mr Chissano, in a victory broadcast, called for peace among the 16m people, most of whom have lost family, friends or limbs in the war, which reduced Mozambique to one of the world's poorest countries. 'War was defeated at these elections,' he said. 'All have the patriotic obligation to heal the wounds.' While promising to open dialogue with opposition parties and urging that Mr Dhlakama be treated with respect, Mr Chissano revealed no plans to include his former foe in the cabinet due to be formed by mid-December. Hardliners in Frelimo balk at international pressure to form a national unity government.</p>

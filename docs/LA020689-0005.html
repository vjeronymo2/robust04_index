			<p><P> February 6, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER PAY RAISES  </P> <P> This Congress that now wants thousands of dollars in pay raises has presided  over the dismantling of the family farm, the misallocation of taxpayer  resources to a corrupt Pentagon, and has protected industry that pollutes our  earth in the name of free enterprise. It has allowed the American taxpayer to  be raped by our own government officials who have arranged for the buyout of  savings and loans knowingly run by the greedy and corrupt, has encouraged by  its tax legislation the merger-acquisition-buyout mania that makes a few men  wealthy but puts the average man out of work, and is allowing the sale of  America to foreigners.  </P> <P> These men and women in Congress have the power, authority and responsibility to  deal with these and our many other serious problems, yet they refuse to do so  until the situation reaches "meltdown."  </P> <P> Sadly, our members of Congress seem to be concerned with only two things:  retaining their seats and increasing their salaries and benefits.  </P> <P> We, who scramble for pennies at a personal level, pay the bills. Congress  spends our pennies into the billions, often paying for corruption and  ineptitude at the highest level without oversight and accountability. This  misallocation of our tax resources contributes to the lack of resources for  domestic programs to alleviate the suffering of many of our fellow citizens now  out of work, living in shelters, many of whom are children.  </P> <P> It is incredible that under these circumstances our Congress has the temerity  to come begging for thousands of dollars in pay raises, saying they are long  overdue. This "let them eat cake" attitude on the part of Congress is immoral.  </P> <P> It is my feeling that when Congress has the fortitude to handle some of this  nation's problems on a bipartisan level with the best interest of the country  in mind, there will be overwhelming public support for a pay raise. At this  point, I think we deserve a refund.  </P> <P> LAURELLA CROSS  </P> <P> Irvine  </P></p>

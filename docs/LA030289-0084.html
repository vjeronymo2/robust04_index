			<p><P> March 2, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Three animal-rights protesters, who ended their weeklong occupation of a huge  construction crane in Berkeley, face misdemeanor trespassing charges, a  University of California spokesman said. But UC Berkeley spokesman Ray Kolvig  said the three could also face felony charges if damage to the crane is found  to exceed $1,000. Kolvig said the stunt, to protest construction of a new  animal research facility on campus, cost the university and construction  companies an estimated $30,000 a day by disrupting work on a new genetics and  plant research building.  </P></p>

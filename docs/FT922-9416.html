			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Silentnight ahead to Pounds 12.4m but loses sleep over first half SILENTNIGHT Holdings, Europe's biggest bed maker, yesterday warned over the outlook for profits in the first half, with deep discounting by retailers having eroded margins in the first three months of the year. Mr Bill Davies, chairman, said that sales were currently ahead of last year. However, he said high street discounting was affecting margins in the group's two middle market bed businesses - Silentnight and Layezee. 'The first half is going to be very difficult,' he said. Unless there was a change, 'profits will be affected.' The warning accompanied record profits of Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 11.5m) for the year to February 1. Turnover fell 9 per cent to Pounds 137.6m, following the disposal in 1990 of the upholstery division for Pounds 9m. On a like-for-like comparison, sales were 5 per cent higher at Pounds 137.8m. The profits advance was helped by interest gains of Pounds 690,000 on the group's Pounds 13m cash balance, compared with a charge of Pounds 97,000 last time. The final dividend is increased by 1p to 5.75p for a total of 8p (7p), payable from earnings per share ahead 7 per cent to 17.92p. Mr Barry McKenzie, finance director, said all four bed companies had improved their contributions with sales rising from Pounds 90.7m to Pounds 94.9m. He said that the group had, by his calculations, improved its market share in the UK from 30 per cent to 31 per cent. In the cabinet furniture division, sales rose by 18 per cent in a declining market. Homeworthy, the lower-to middle market range of furniture, was strongly ahead following heavy capital investment, although Silentnight Cabinets produced disappointing results. Gross margins improved from 34.8 per cent to 36.7 per cent due to a better product mix, said Mr Davies. The US division suffered losses, although Mr McKenzie said they were not significant in terms of the overall group. Sales in the US were down 20 per cent at Pounds 9.5m. Mr McKenzie added that Silentnight did not expect the US business to 'come back rapidly' this year. COMMENT These figures begin to show the benefits of Pounds 11.5m in capital spend, but there is more to come. The Pounds 8.5m pencilled in for this year will be spent on more plant and also on a TV advertising campaign to maintain the Silentnight brand. That is good news for the medium-term investors, who will be less shy of the fact that the shares have had a good run lately, rising by 88p in 12 months to last night's 245p. The balance sheet remains strong although critics would argue that the family-controlled company could use the cash to better effect. Forecasts are for Pounds 14m this year, in spite of the cautious noises about margins, and the shares look attractive with a prospective p/e of about 12 times.</p>

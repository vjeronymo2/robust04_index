			<p>920207 FT  07 FEB 92 / UK Company News: Senior pays Dollars 40m for US group - Tube and hose acquisition funded by Pounds 26.6m rights issue SENIOR Engineering Group is to pay Dollars 40m (Pounds 22.1m) for Flexonics, a leading US manufacturer of flexible tube and metal hose, expansion joints and bellows. Mr Don McFarlane, managing director, said the purchase would make Senior a leading international force in one of its business areas. Senior, which specialises in ductwork, heat treatment and tubes, is funding the acquisition by a 1-for-4 rights issue at 58p per share, which will raise Pounds 26.6m. Senior's shares closed 2 1/2 p down at 69 1/2 p. The group, which has been sheltered from the downturn in the engineering sector by supplying ducting to big construction projects such as Sizewell power station, is also maintaining its record of resisting recession. It yesterday forecast that pre-tax profits for the year to December 31 would increase by 13 per cent to Pounds 18.1m, with earnings per share up by 6.6 per cent to 6.5p (6.1p). The group said it did not have a significant presence in the US flexible hose and expansion joint business, so Flexonics would be a good fit with its existing plants in Europe and the Far East. Flexonics, a private company with headquarters at Bartlett, near Chicago, made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.4m on turnover of Pounds 28.5m in the nine months to end-November. Despite the recession in the US, it continued to operate at a satisfactory level, and was not expected to dilute the enlarged group's earnings. Senior intends to keep all the key operating management within Flexonics, In particular, Mr Stephen Perkins had signed a new contract as president of Flexonics, which employs 650 people, all of them in North America. Mr Perkins will now oversee of all of Senior's flexible hose businesses worldwide. Mr McFarlane will take over as chairman from Professor Sir Roland Smith, who said last year that he would step down in May. Mr McFarlane will be succeeded as group managing director by Mr John Bell, who has been chief executive of engineering products for several years. Senior forecast that it would recommend a final dividend of 1.95p (1.78p), giving a total for the year of 3.15p (2.86p), an increase of 10 per cent. The rights issue is underwritten by Schroders, with Hoare Govett and Albert E Sharp as brokers. COMMENT The need to forecast profits for yesterday's cash call meant that Senior is one of the first engineering companies to report on calendar 1991, but it is already a safe bet that few other will do as well in the forthcoming results season. Senior still gets lumbered with labels such as solid and respectable, which seems unfair to a company which has doubled its share price in the last year. Although the market now feels gloom about engineering was overdone, the very elements about Senior which kept earnings up during recession may now prevent it being seen as recovery stock. Construction services, which provides ducting to big infrastructure projects, seems to have had a record year. The US acquisition looks shrewdly-judged, and positions the engineered products division to benefit from any upturn. Forecast profits of Pounds 22.5m next year put the shares on a multiple of about 10, which still seems undemanding for a company with no gearing and a solid track record.</p>

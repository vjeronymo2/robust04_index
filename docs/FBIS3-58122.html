			<p>Language: <F P=105> Greek </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Brussels correspondent Nikolaos Belos; date not </F> specified --recorded]    [Text] Ioannis Kranidhiotis, Foreign Ministry secretary  general in charge of European affairs, today outlined the  priorities and goals of the Greek presidency [of the EC] to the  European Parliament's Foreign Relations Commission. Mr.  Kranidhiotis also answered a series of questions from the  foreign European Parliament deputies. This was the first  official briefing of the European Parliament on the Greek  presidency's program.    In his address, Mr. Kranidhiotis presented the general  guidelines of the program on joint foreign policy and security  of the European Union [EU]. Concerning the Community's  expansion, Mr. Kranidhiotis stressed that the Greek presidency  will pursue the conclusion of negotiations with Austria, Sweden,  Finland, and Norway by 1 March, while also promoting the  accession of Cyprus and Malta. Referring to the Cyprus issue, he  noted the important decision by the Council on the appointment  of an observer, who will be briefing the Council on the  development of the intercommunal talks in New York. He also  informed the Commission members that a meeting on the EU-Cyprus  association will be held in Brussels in May. Mr. Kranidhiotis  then referred to the EU's joint action in foreign policy issues  and pointed out that the presidency will primarily deal with  former Yugoslavia and the effective promotion of humanitarian  aid to Bosnia-Herzegovina. He then answered questions from  foreign Eurodeputies on the situation in Bosnia, the Palestinian  issue, and Skopje.    Responding to a question on Skopje from a Dutch deputy, who  alleged that Greece has proceeded with a de facto closure of its  borders with that republic, Mr. Kranidhitios categorically  denied this allegation, stressing that most of Skopeje's imports  come through Greece, including 80-85 percent of its oil.  Concluding this issue, Mr. Kranidhiotis reiterated the  well-known Greek positions on Skopje and stressed that, in  addition to the well-known issue of the name, we expect from  Skopje a series of moves such as the abolition of the Greek  emblems and the amendment of the preamble to the constitution,  which implies clear irredentist and expansionist intentions.</p>

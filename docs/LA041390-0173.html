			<p><P> April 13, 1990, Friday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> STUDY POINTS TO THE TOXICS AMONG US;  </P> <P> ENVIRONMENT: THE GROUP BEHIND THE COMPILATION OF STATISTICS HOPES SAN DIEGANS  WILL USE THE INFORMATION TO FIGHT THE POLLUTION THAT MAY BE HIDDEN IN THEIR OWN  BACK YARDS.  </P> <P> Millions of pounds of toxic chemicals and gases are used, stored and disposed  of throughout San Diego county each year, some of them in crowded residential  neighborhoods, according to a report released Thursday that urges communities  to demand that their industrial neighbors help prevent pollution.  </P> <P> The report, compiled by the San Diego Environmental Health Coalition, states  that 20 companies in the San Diego area generate 70% of the more than 214  million pounds of hazardous waste made in the county each year. In addition,  the report said, companies store more than 500 million pounds of toxic  chemicals and more than 9 million cubic feet of toxic gases around the region,  from Chula Vista and Oceanside to La Jolla and Ramona.  </P> <P> In short, the report says, toxics are everywhere.  </P> <P> "This report shatters any illusions that any of us might have had that toxics  are somebody else's problem," Diane Takvorian, the coalition's executive  director, said at a news conference in Barrio Logan, the San Diego neighborhood  where the most hazardous waste is generated. "It is saying people have a right  to know and a right to act."  </P> <P> The report, titled "Communities at Risk: Your Right to Know About Toxics in San  Diego," is the first comprehensive compilation of local, state and federal  statistics on hazardous materials. It is also the first-ever ranking of  companies that generate and store toxics and of the communities where those  companies reside.  </P> <P> The information is intended, Takvorian said, to inspire San Diegans to find out  about the often hidden dangers in their own back yards -- the toxic chlorine  and arsine gases; the heavy metals, like lead, mercury and zinc; the  carcinogens, like chromium and arsenic. Even if the companies deal responsibly  with the materials, she said, the more toxics there are, the greater the chance  that an accident could occur.  </P> <P> Joy Williams, the primary author of the report, agreed.  </P> <P> "Even a well-managed facility can have an accident," she said. "And, when  they're located right on top of a community and there are workers involved,  there's nothing to prevent them from being hurt."  </P> <P> The report documents 179 accidents involving hazardous chemicals that occurred  between 1983 and 1989 -- a non-comprehensive sampling that Williams says is  probably incomplete. Members of the public and workers were exposed to  chemicals in 48 of those incidents, and in 31 others employees only were  exposed, the report said.  </P> <P> "We need to move these toxics away from people," Takvorian concluded, adding  that, if companies are not able to reduce the volume and the toxicity of the  materials they use, "they may need to move. We're not trying to put them out of  business, but we want them to be good neighbors."  </P> <P> Part of being a good corporate neighbor, the report said, is creating strong  pollution prevention plans, reducing the use of hazardous chemicals by changing  manufacturing processes or reformulating products and using good housekeeping  measures to prevent the dissemination of toxics. In addition, the report calls  for local industries to commit themselves to eliminate their discharge of  toxics to the air, land and water by the year 2000.  </P> <P> Of the top 20 waste generating companies, the report found four -- National  Steel &amp; Shipbuilding Co., Rohr Industries, Southwest Marine and Pacific  Steel -- generated more than the other 16 combined.  </P> <P> Fred Hallett, a vice president at Nassco, the top-ranked waste generator, said  his company supports the coalition's goals.  </P> <P> "When you see a can of paint today, you can't just throw it in the trash. We in  industry have to appreciate the same things," he said. "But to say that we  handle the most (hazardous materials) doesn't mean that we are the most  reckless or inappropriate in the manner we handle it. We have what we believe  are very sound procedures to protect our employees, the community and the  environment."  </P> <P> Doug Baliss, the district representative of the Iron Workers' Union who was in  Barrio Logan Thursday to support the report, said that indeed, Nassco has  developed tighter inventory controls to reduce the amount of paints and  solvents stored at the shipyards and has developed good systems to protect its  workers from exposure.  </P> <P> Jerry Broening, a spokesman for Rohr Industries, the Chula Vista-based  aerospace manufacturer, said his company has also made strides.  </P> <P> "I think we've made great progress in the last few years," he said. "I don't  think our feelings will be hurt at all by the report, because those are our  objectives as well."  </P> <P> Of the 15 communities where the most hazardous waste is generated, the report  found three -- Barrio Logan, Chula Vista and National City -- have more waste  than the other 12 combined.  </P> <P> That came as no surprise to Al Ducheny, chairman of the Harborview Community  Council, a group of Logan Heights/Barrio Logan residents.  </P> <P> "This place has been a dump for many, many years," he said, adding that his  group has actively opposed the expansion of Pacific Treatment Division, a  hazardous waste handler in the area. "These industries are really incompatible  with the community. They're too dangerous. We can't take chances with our  families."  </P> <P> Maria Riveroll, a member of the Mt. Hope-Helix Heights Residents Assn., said  the most important thing about the report is that it will remind communities to  get involved.  </P> <P> "This report indeed will do its job by encouraging community members to stand  up," she said. Not so long ago, she said, California Creative Dynamics, a  metals-treatment firm near her home, was found to be dumping chemical wastes  into a storm drain and allowing a caustic mist to waft off the property.  </P> <P> The trees died on the street, Riveroll said, and some of her neighbors broke  out in skin rashes. Some had respiratory infections.  </P> <P> "But sometimes you just take that as a bad cold or allergy, not realizing that  they could be caused by the industry right next to you," she said.  </P> <P> The coalition has printed bulletins for the top 15 communities where hazardous  waste is generated. Those brief reports are available for free for Barrio  Logan, Chula Vista, National City, Downtown San Diego, Tierra Santa/Serra Mesa,  Mira Mesa/Sorrento Valley, Linda Vista, Oceanside, Spring Valley, La  Jolla/Pacific Beach, Santee, El Cajon, Escondido, Carlsbad and Southeast San  Diego. A brief countywide report is also available for free and the complete  report for the county is $10.  </P> <P> The report was based primarily on data from the County Department of Health  Services Hazardous Materials Management Division and from the federal  Environmental Protection Agency. The county data base contains information that  was compiled in 1987, 1988 and 1989 on 8,300 facilities. The EPA data was from  1987 and 1988.  </P> <P> </P> <P> TOP 15 COMMUNITIES -- HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATION (IN POUNDS)  </P> <P> 1. Barrio Logan: 62,958,357  </P> <P> 2.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Bratislava May 2 (CTK) -- Possibilities of economic  cooperation were discussed today by Slovak Premier Jozef  Moravcik, Foreign Minister Eduard Kukan and his Indonesian  counterpart Ali Alatas. After the meeting, Moravcik said no  problems existed between these two countries which would mar the  promotion of cooperation. He said he also briefed his Indonesian  partner on potential investments into Slovakia in view of access  to third markets.    Alatas described the strengthening of economic relations as  the aim of his two-day official visit to Slovakia which began  yesterday. The conclusion of agreements in the future on the  protection of investments and double-taxation could contribute  to it, he added. Last year Slovakia exported to Indonesia  machinery and chemical products amounting to 15 million USD, and  imported from Indonesia tin, rubber and textiles worth 3.5  million USD.    Alatas also met with Slovak Parliament Chairman Ivan  Gasparovic and will be received by President Michal Kovac.</p>

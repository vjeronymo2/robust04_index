			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] (DYN-NA) -- Both signatories of the Olivos Pact  on constitutional reform, President Carlos Menem and Radical  Party chairman Raul Alfonsin, moved yesterday [13 April] to  squelch continuing rumours that the accord would be opened up  for point-by-point negotiations yesterday.    The Radical leader also continued to defend his decision to  support the ruling Justicialist Party's reform platform last  year despite his party's distant second-place finish in Sunday's  [10 April] Constituent Assembly election.    "I have complete assurance," Menem said yesterday, "that no  matter how much (Radical Deputy) Jesus Rodriguez has expressed  his desire to support Frente (Grande) or make an alliance" the  pact will be fulfilled.    Rodriguez led the Radicals' Federal Capital slate of  candidates to a third-place finish in a district that until last  year's congressional election had been the party's stronghold.  Following Sunday's election he raised the possibility of forming  a broad opposition coalition to defeat Menem next year if the  Constituent Assembly approves the Olivos Pact, which would  permit the President to run for two consecutive terms in office.

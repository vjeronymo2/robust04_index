			<p>930420 FT  20 APR 93 / Survey of A-Z of Computing (14): Workhorse of data processing - . . . For Mainframes AT ONE time, a computer was a computer. Then Kenneth Olsen and his colleagues at Digital Equipment invented the minicomputer, small, comparatively inexpensive and environmentally friendly enough to sit in a corner of the office, and a new name had to be found for the water-cooled monster in the data centre. Today, the mainframe computer is still the workhorse of commercial data processing despite the advent of the personal computer and client-server technologies which some believe will consign large machines to the dust-bin of computer history. Certainly the omens have not been good. The dwindling band of mainframe manufacturers is in financial trouble because of a combination of price-cutting - International Business Machines, for example, no longer publishes mainframe list prices - and a trend among customers to networks of personal computers and network servers which seem to offer better value for money. Mainframes are now made by only a handful of manufacturers. IBM, Unisys, AT&amp;T through its NCR subsidiary, Control Data of the US, ICL of the UK, Siemens Nixdorf of Germany, and NEC of Japan build machines of their own design. Amdahl of the US, together with Fujitsu and Hitachi of Japan, are 'plug compatible manufacturers' (pcms) building mainframes that are functionally identical to IBM's and able to run the same operating software. While the financial problems mainframe makers face are real enough, the notion that customers are turning away in droves from mainframes is an illusion. There are many corporate data processing jobs which can only be carried out efficiently by a machine with the power and flexibility of a mainframe. The essential historical difference between a mainframe and smaller computer systems is the way information travels around the system. Mainframe computers have channels, high speed data paths controlled by microprocessors which move information to and away from the central processing unit at high speed. Minicomputers, on the other hand, typically use a 'bus', a single information channel. Different kinds of information are separated on the bus by elaborate timing mechanisms. Now with the development of powerful microcomputers, the dividing line is becoming blurred. Some manufacturers, NCR, for example, are committed to building their entire product line from personal computer to mainframe from combinations of microprocessors. Today, there is great interest in 'downsizing,' in moving from seemingly expensive mainframes to networks of personal computers and servers, larger machines which manage databases or carry out intensive computation. SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS Such client-server systems seem to offer substantial economies, and in many cases real savings can be made. Many application were run on mainframes only because there were no alternatives and these translate easily to smaller machines. The decision to downsize from a mainframe is complex, however. First, because some computing tasks - managing an airline reservation system involving 3000 terminals, for example, can only be handled by a mainframe with high speed channels. Second, because the cost of supporting a client-server systems can be substantially greater than for a mainframe. Xephon, a UK-based consultancy, has estimated the cost of mainframe computing over five years for a defined system configuration as between Pounds 5,282 and Pounds 5,973 per user. For a proprietary midrange system the cost rises to between Pounds 7,306 and Pounds 7,786, for Unix systems Pounds 7,180 to Pounds 7,740 and for networked personal computers, Pounds 9,400 to Pounds 15,500. You can argue about the assumptions Xephon made, but its conclusion seems clear: 'Far from being obsolete, mainframes currently offer the most cost-effective computing facilities for all but the smallest organisations - and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.' It is unlikely, however, that the value of the market for mainframe computers will grow in the future. The demand for raw computing power will certainly grow - at 40 per cent or more a year in some cases - but that will be satisfied at the same or lower cost by improved technology and falling prices. CHANGING ROLE The role of the mainframe is also likely to change. IBM , for example, which has seen its profitability hurt by declining mainframe sales, is arguing that the mainframe is the natural server in a client-server network, offering network management, security and data integrity. A second change is the emergence of open operating systems on mainframes. Customers, in the past, had little option but to stay with their mainframe supplier because of their investment in applications software designed to run on a particular operating system - IBM's MVS, for example, or ICL's VME. Particular operating systems were noted for particular qualities. Groupe Bull's GCOS system, for example, is recognised for the quality of its communications. IBM already offers a Unix-like operating system, AIX on its mainframes. This year it announced an open version of MVS in a move to make it easier to accept a mainframe in a client-server network.</p>

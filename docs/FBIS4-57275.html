			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Commentary by Fernando Rospigliosi: "Institutions Adrift"] </F>   [Text] Two years now since the 5 April coup d'etat, and  almost four since the start of Alberto Fujimori's  administration, many achievements and many failures have been  placed and weighed on the scale of evaluations. These have  ranged from the decrease in inflation and terrorist actions to  the president's authoritarianism. But very little has been said  of what is perhaps the decisive measure by which a regime can be  judged, namely, the state of the institutions. A careful  examination of a few of our institutions may help in arriving at  this judgment.  <H5>  The Judiciary </H5>   Following the coup d'etat, the government acted in a totally  discretionary manner, dismissing those it wanted to rid itself  of and appointing those it felt like appointing. Then a Panel of  Honor, appointed by the government itself, carried out an  evaluation and appointed a new Supreme Court. In sum, a  reorganization was made short work of by exercising powers that  no democratic government ever had. The result is devastating.    It is devastating not only because of unusual cases like  that  of the Cantuta Law, in which meddling by other powers clearly  demonstrates the subordination of the judiciary, or that of the  unconstitutional appointment of Miss Nelida Colan as the  nation's attorney general, owing to her well-known relationship  with the administration, but because the functioning of the  judiciary continues to be the same or worse than before: slow,  inefficient, corrupt. Any citizen who through misfortune falls  into its net becomes only too aware of this.  <H5>  Congress </H5>   Made exactly to measure for the regime, its characteristics,  prerogatives, and limitations were all decided by the regime  itself. And the regime is able to count on an absolute majority  to control the structure it has created. Congressional oversight  is a complete nullity, since not a single investigation  concerning the period of the present administration--which is  what matters--has produced any result whatever. Even  investigations concerning previous administrations--which the  present government seeks to discredit--have amounted to nothing  of any consequence.    The Constitution created by this Congress is a travesty that  is violated by the government itself, and that today, less than  five months after its promulgation, requires immediate  amendments, such as that of the wretched Habeas Data. As for its  legislative accomplishment, it is difficult to remember anything  remarkable.    And from the political point of view, it remains completely  subordinated to Fujimori, to the Armed Forces' leadership, and  to anyone who wields a modicum of power.  <H5>  The Police </H5>   The government or, better said, the SIN [National  Intelligence Service] and the Army leadership took control of  the Ministry of Interior on 28 July 1990. Their first step was  to remove the minister and reorganize the institution. Their  last step was to deal the coup de grace to the DINCOTE  [Counterterrorism Directorate], and begin its dismantlement on  December 1992, immediately after the capture of Abimael Guzman.    Today the Police as an institution are afflicted by the same  ills of yore, only modified and amplified: low salaries, faulty  equipment, demoralization, corruption, inefficiency. Up to a  certain point, the institution has begun being supplanted by  night watchmen.  <H5>  Armed Forces </H5>   Even though their morale and their image improved after the  capture of Guzman, their professionalism and their constituted  authority have been severely compromised. Politicization of  command, expulsion or retirement of many of their best officers,  factionalism, the system of internal espionage that corrodes  camaraderie and creates a mistrust bordering on paranoia, have  brought the Armed Forces to a situation of dangerous  fragmentation. To these must be added the penetration of drug  trafficking, a peculiar and extremely dangerous type of  corruption that is not being held in check.    The foregoing list of institutions is not by any means  exhaustive. It includes neither municipalities, nor ministries,  nor the diplomatic service, nor other public agencies; but it  exemplifies the situation.    The noticeable improvements in SUNAT [National Tax  Administration Superintendency] and a few in IPSS [Peruvian  Institute of Social Security]--the dismantlement of which is, on  the other hand, being sought--are not even remotely sufficient  to compensate for the government's systematic work of corroding  the institutions.    The importance of solidly-based institutions is paramount in  two respects. First, as to the long-term outlook, they are the  essential prerequisites to the modernization of a country. U.S.  political expert Samuel Huntington cites the  institutionalization process as the determinative factor in the  transition from a traditional society to a modern one without  falling into chaos and disintegration. "A government with a low  institutionalization level is not only weak; it is also bad,"  says Huntington. This is because, among other reasons, "a  society in which institutions are weak lacks the necessary  capability to contain the excess of personal and parochial  ambitions," and because a simple political system that depends  upon a single individual "is also less stable."    And second, institutions are a key factor in determining the  success or failure of the processes involved in a return to  democracy. As the Argentine Guillermo O'Donnell has stated, the  transition that has taken place in Latin America, from  authoritarian regimes to governments elected through clean  elections, requires a second transition, from those governments  to democratic governments. According to O'Donnell, this second  transition has not happened yet, except in countries that had a  developed institutional system prior to the establishment of the  dictatorships: Chile and Uruguay. The rest are still mired in  uncertainty.    Although today the merry beneficiaries of Fujimorism may not  care two hoots about institutionalized values, the consequences  for the future of the country will be far-reaching.</p>

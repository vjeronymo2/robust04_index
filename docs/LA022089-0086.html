			<p><P> February 20, 1989, Monday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> NORTHRIDGE TEAMS UP TO OVERCOME ST. MARY'S  </P> <P> By Cal State Northridge Coach Bill Kernen's way of thinking, Sunday's 2-1  nonconference baseball win over St. Mary's was a real team effort. Trouble was,  a big part of his team wasn't there to see it.  </P> <P> Outfielder Greg Shockey was scratched from the lineup and sent to the hospital  complaining of stomach cramps early Sunday, and shortstop Mike Solar joined him  a short time later after gashing the middle finger of his throwing hand during  batting practice. That suddenly left Kernen with two gapping holes to fill.  </P> <P> Which is where Vale Lopez and Ted Weisfuss come in. Lopez, making his first  start of the season, fired a masterful three-hitter and Weisfuss, subbing for  Solar, drove in the winning run with a double in the bottom of the ninth.  </P> <P> "That's exactly what a team does," Kernen said. "When someone goes down, you  pick up for them. When something happens, you overcome it. A good team will  overcome adversity."  </P> <P> To do that, CSUN (6-1) had to overcome another formidable foe: St. Mary's  left-hander David Norris. Though eight innings, Norris (1-2) had CSUN stymied,  scattering seven hits and allowing just two runners to reach second base.  </P> <P> But that was a ragged effort compared with Lopez's gem. Lopez (1-0) struck out  seven, did not walk a batter and set the Gaels (6-4) down in order six times.  </P> <P> "That was an outstanding pitching performance," Kernen said. "It was pretty  much of a domination. He only made one mistake all day."  </P> <P> But that mistake cost him a run. With the game scoreless in the third inning,  Lopez let a 2-1 fastball get away from him and James Mouton promptly lined it  over the left-field wall.  </P> <P> Lopez recovered quickly, however, setting down the next 10 batters in a row,  and his teammates got the run back in the fifth. After just missing a home run  with a foul drive down the left-field line, Kevin Ogle settled for a line-drive  double into the left-center-field gap. One out later, J.D. Haendiges blooped an  opposite-field single to left to score Ogle.  </P> <P> That was the extent of the offense until the ninth. Dennis Vigo led off with a  line single to left and after Rusty McLain dropped down a perfect sacrifice  bunt, Norris walked Ogle to get to Weisfuss. But the strategy backfired when  Weisfuss ripped a 1-0 fastball over the left-center-field wall on a bounce.  </P></p>

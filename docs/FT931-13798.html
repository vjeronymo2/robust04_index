			<p>930121 FT  21 JAN 93 / International Company News: Arnotts advances 33% at half way ARNOTTS, the Australian biscuit-maker, yesterday said a 33 per cent increase in six-month net profits to ADollars 37.4m (USDollars 26.7m) before abnormal items justified its rejection of a hostile takeover offer by Campbell Soup, the US food group. The company is increasing its interim dividend to 15 cents a share from the 10.5 cents paid a year ago. Mr Bill Purdy, chairman, said the result underlined the inadequacy of Campbell's 'final' offer of ADollars 9.50 a share, which values Arnotts at ADollars 1.3bn. 'Do not sell; the company is too valuable,' he told shareholders. Mr Purdy said Arnotts was on course to achieve its forecast net profit of ADollars 67.7m before abnormal items for the year ending June 1993. The board has also forecast a net profit of ADollars 80.9m for 1993-94. Arnotts said it would continue to urge Campbell to increase its offer to about ADollars 11, the mid-point of a range of valuations for the company's shares produced in an independent report by Grant Samuel, the merchant bank. A number of financial institutions are believed to be considering accepting the offer for part of their holdings, which would give Campbell more than 50 per cent ownership of Arnotts. However, the New South Wales supreme court has ruled that a 1985 agreement between the companies means that Campbell must acquire 85.1 per cent of the shares before it can take control of Arnotts' board. Analysts say Campbell would need to improve its offer or launch a new offer later in the year to achieve board control. Campbell has said it would not improve the offer in any circumstances. Arnotts said its improved result reflected improved productivity in its biscuit division following substantial restructuring, the disposal of non-core activities and the successful launch of several new products. The group said biscuit margins had improved 'significantly,' and forecast further benefits from the restructuring would flow through into profits in the second half. The improved profit was achieved on turnover up 6.7 per cent to ADollars 363.6m after adjusting for the sale of non-core businesses. The group said that biscuit sales volume was 'steady, in spite of the poor state of the economy.' Net profit increased to ADollars 53.3m after including an abnormal profit of ADollars 15.8m resulting from the sale of the group's White Rose flour mill operations and a packaging company, offset by restructuring costs and additional taxation.</p>

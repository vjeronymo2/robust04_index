			<p>920914 FT  14 SEP 92 / Survey on Mauritius (15): Just pick up that cellphone FEW business destinations can be as beguiling as Mauritius. Accessible government officials, a flourishing private sector, up-to-date statistics, good restaurants and delightful beachside hotels make even hardened workaholics relax. Life has been made even easier by the arrival on the island of the cellular telephone. Local and worldwide connections are so good that your caller will not know whether you are under a palm tree, putting the 25 minute journey from your Grand Baie hotel to Port Louis to good use, or telephoning from the capital itself. Local and international calls are at the standard phone call rate, so the saving on hotel surcharges can cover the MR400 daily rental. There are no first class hotels in Port Louis, but with some of the world's finest beaches a 30 minute taxi ride away, who would choose to stay in the capital? Most offices are within walking distance, so it's hardly necessary to hire a car. The taxi journey from Grand Baie area costs about MR200 (or you could help pay for the cellular telephone by using the efficient bus service - MR10 for the same journey). An alternative to hotel accommodation is a short term let of a serviced beachside bungalow; this can be arranged by Leisure Promotion (Tel/fax 2638812). A pleasant city rendezvous is La Bonne Marmite (2122403/4406 - wonderful palm heart salad); but one of the best restaurants on the island is Le Piscatore (2616337), near the Trou aux Biche Hotel: excellent sea-food, and special dishes for vegetarians. Galerie Helene de Senneville (2637426, Grand Baie) offers fine paintings and prints of Mauritius by local artists including Daniele Hitie, and look out for work by Michael Adams, who lives on the Seychelles but visits Mauritius frequently. For a weekend break, explore the island of Rodrigues - 'Mauritius before the tourists arrived'. Air Mauritius has a daily service to the island, and every room at the recently opened Cotton Bay Hotel (095-831 3000/1/2) opens up on to an unspoilt beach. But find time for a sundowner on the wood-slatted verandah of the Pointe Venus hotel, an elegant but fading reminder of the colonial era which overlooks the capital, Port Mathurin. Credit cards are widely accepted in Mauritius; business cards are regularly exchanged. No visas are required for Commonwealth passport holders, or from the EC, Scandinavia, Japan, US, South Africa, Oman, Quatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE. Yellow fever and cholera vaccination certificates may be needed if you arrive from infected areas. There is no malaria on Mauritius.

			<p>921007 FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hunter Saphir shares fall HUNTER SAPHIR shares fell 8p to 28p, yesterday following a trading statement given in a circular containing details of the disposal of Emil Tissot Foods to Cavaghan &amp; Gray. The chairman said that since mid-July, after an excellent first quarter, the fresh produce business had been adversely affected by the general price deflation. In the last three years profits have fallen from Pounds 6.05m to Pounds 2.51m for the year to the end of February 1992. As the major part of the business was commission based, the company had incurred no contractual losses. The company had continued to gain market share and to increase volumes but overall commission income had declined. British Pepper and Spice had maintained its recovery, with revenues up by more than 20 per cent, but it was not yet back into profit. Euroma, the Dutch subsidiary, continued to grow but margins were under pressure.</p>

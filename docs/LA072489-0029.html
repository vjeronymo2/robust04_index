			<p><P> July 24, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE WORLD  </P> <P> Britain is concerned about the whereabouts of the husband of Myanmar's  opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi, the Foreign Office said. Briton Michael  Aris left London on Friday, but when he arrived in Myanmar, formerly Burma, he  was not permitted to see a British diplomat waiting for him at the airport. A  Foreign Office spokesman said it was possible that Aris, an Oxford University  professor and an expert on Tibet, was under house arrest. The government has  placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest and accused her of trying to "revive  anarchy" in the country. She has been the most vocal critic of Gen. Saw Maung's  military government, which seized power in a coup in September and imposed  martial law.  </P></p>

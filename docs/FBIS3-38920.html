			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article by special correspondent in Athens Anne-Marie </F> Ladoues: "Alain Juppe's European High Mass in Athens"]    [Text] After taking over the presidency of the European  Union with a bang, Greece has reverted to a behavior more in  keeping with its partners's expectations. Forgotten, the  acrimonious exchanges between Greek European Affairs Minister  Theodore Pangalos and his French and German counterparts. Alain  Juppe, whose comment on the return of PASOK [Panhellenic  Socialist Movement] to power had been a scathing "how people  forget!," came to Athens on Thursday [3 February] to celebrate  the high mass of European solidarity. "Full French support to  the Greek presidency": The French foreign minister did not fail  to embrace the soothing European discourse. Just like German  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Helmut Schaefer, who came  a few days earlier to insist that there was not "the shadow of a  cloud" between his country and Greece. Invectives against  Germany seen as "a country with brutish power and the brains of  a child" were seemingly just as faraway as their author,  troublemaker Pangalos, gone to Africa...    Since 1 January the Greek Government has done all it could  to  be accorded its good behavior credentials. Over and done with,  the dream -- openly flaunted by Greek officials until the end of  December -- of replacing the embargo against their Serb ally  with one against the Bosnians, should they refuse to compromise  at the peace table. Theodore Pangalos will only repeat that  "the use of violence must stop" in the former Yugoslavia. He  hardly even questions any more the principle of air strikes,  which he judges would be fruitless and ineffective. "As the  Americans and the French found out in Indochina!," he taunted on  Thursday. Consigned to oblivion -- for the duration of the  presidency? -- Athens' rhetorics on the Republic of Skopje's  resolve to call itself Macedonia. Athens seems to have sized up  the decision of six of its European partners to establish  diplomatic relations with the former Yugoslav republic in  December.    Since early January, the Greek Government has shown some  eagerness to have its presidency taken seriously and to complete  by 1 March the Union enlargement process as regards four  countries: Austria, Sweden, Finland, and Norway. While it seems  unlikely that the four rounds of talks can be completed in time  for these countries to sign the Union treaty in early 1995, as  scheduled, Greece appears determined to advance the process as  much as it can. To this end, it has called two meetings of the  Council of Foreign Ministers for 21-22 and 25-26 February in  Brussels. Athens clearly expects to benefit should one or  several of these countries successfully complete the fast-track  membership process, but this would also afford it an opportunity  to push for the admission of a candidate particularly dear to  its heart: Cyprus.</p>

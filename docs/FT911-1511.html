			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / Finance &amp; The Family (Diary of a private investor): The rights of spring / Questioning companies' motives for raising money through rights issues I AM beginning to feel a bit left out. In the past few months, more than 50 UK public companies have announced rights issues. I have not had shares in any of them. Indeed, the last rights issue in which I participated was for Sycamore Holdings in September last year. I first bought shares in Sycamore in 1989. The company manufactured garden furniture and imported barbecues from the US. I thought that a hot summer would do wonders for its sales. It also had takeover attractions, as then the company was capitalised at less than Pounds 3.75m. I hoped someone might be interested in using it as a 'shell' for bigger things. However, I soon got bored with the company's lacklustre share price performance and reduced my holding. The company produced poor trading results, and last September announced a two-for-one rights issue at 10p per new share. I took up my rights in full because accompanying the rights issue was the statement that Bill Rhodes would be joining the board as a non-executive director and Peter Hopkins would become managing director. Both men had been directors of Williams Holdings and Thomas Robinson Group during a period when they had done much to improve the share price performance of those companies. I hoped they would do the same for Sycamore - especially as they would both be taking a large shareholding in the company. Sycamore's share price has now more than doubled from the rights issue price. It seems to me that in the current Gadarene rush to raise money by rights issues that investors ought to be asking themselves if the directors of those companies are putting their own money into the businesses, too. What is the rights issue money to be used for? If it is an attempt to help bail out the company from horrendous debts, and the existing management remains, then should the rights have much appeal? I think not. However, if the money raised is to be used for expansion purposes and the management is sound, or is to be assisted by new directors with good track records, then the rights could have some appeal. Before taking up a rights issue, I also ask myself: if the current share price was the same as the rights issue price, and the company was not having a rights issue, would I buy more shares in the company? If the answer is 'no', then I look for extra reasons (if any) why the rights issue should give the company increased investment appeal. When there is a flood of rights issues (like now), I begin to wonder if this is due to a pent-up demand for extra cash that has only just been released, or is this dash for extra cash simply that some company directors feel that, if their company does not raise extra funds now, it may soon be too late for them to do so. Are they expecting a downturn in the market - or even more difficult trading conditions - that would make it much less easy to have a rights issue later in the year, or even next year? In the past, when there has been a rush of rights issues, there has also been much more takeover activity than at present. Although takeovers have increased in recent months, it can hardly be called a boom. I find this somewhat disconcerting. For example, take a company such as Herrburger Brooks. It manufactures piano keyboards and office furniture. I bought shares in it in 1985 for 60p each, believing that it had considerable 'shell' potential. In April, its 71.1 per cent shareholder, Kimball International Inc, made a takeover offer worth 220p cash per share, valuing the whole company at Pounds 2.9m. If the market really was booming, with entrepreneurs looking to make fortunes, surely Herrburger Brooks would have attracted interest from someone months ago who could have sold the manufacturing interests of the company to Kimball, while keeping Herrburger's share listing in order to use it help expand the company into related or other activities. The lack of interest in investment trusts is also rather disappointing. Instead of yet another boring rights issue, a company seeking to raise extra funds could take over an investment trust standing at a hefty discount to its net asset value, liquidate most of the trust's shareholdings, and then utilise the cash proceeds. I bought shareholdings in a number of investment trusts earlier this year, hoping for such activity. It has not happened. Why? Because taking over a trust is not as quick as a rights issue? I also hoped that some smaller trusts, such as Gresham House and TR Technology with estimated discounts on net asset value of over 60 per cent, would find increasing appeal to investors. This, too, does not seem to have happened. Add to this the fact that the other companies in which I am a shareholder appear not to want extra cash for expansion, and it seems to confirm my view that there is considerable uncertainty among professional investors and company directors as to the future of the market and general trading conditions.</p>

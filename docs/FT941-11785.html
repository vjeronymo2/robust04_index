			<p>940202 FT  02 FEB 94 / International Company News: Hectic trading surprises dealers Shares in Banesto lost 57 per cent of their pre-crisis value yesterday when they were re-listed after a five-week suspension. In hectic trading on Madrid's Bolsa, the stock closed at Pta855 after opening at Pta800 and hitting a high of Pta894. At the closing price its market value was about Pta147bn (Dollars 1bn). The stock was suspended at Pta1,995 on December 28. Nearly 5m Banesto shares were traded yesterday - at least 10 times more than a high volume day before the suspension. The closing price surprised both Bolsa dealers and Banesto's management. Dealers said yesterday that foreigners were net sellers. They were matched by domestic buyers willing to speculate that Banesto's value was above that intimated by the rescue plan. 'If you are very rigorous, Banesto shares are worth at the very most Pta700,' said Mr Juan Bastos, of Madrid securities house Ibersecurities. 'This has been a one day wonder, or it could be a month long wonder, but the logic is that Banesto's price must come down,' said Mr Frederick Artessani, head of foreign trading at stock brokers Benito y Monjardin.</p>

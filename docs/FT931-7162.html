			<p>930225 FT  25 FEB 93 / UK's power sell-off under fire Leaders of state-owned Electricite de France's 130,000 employees yesterday unveiled a sharply critical study of the privatised UK electricity sector, to publicise what they see as the risks of tampering with existing energy monopolies in France or elsewhere in Europe, writes David Buchan in Paris. The report, carried out for EdF employees by the Paris-based Technologia consultancy, claims that the illusion of competition created by the 1990 privatisation masks an oligopoly of private companies, which have raised prices more sharply, invested less, and created more redundancies than the old UK state monopoly.</p>

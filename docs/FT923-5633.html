			<p>920829 FT  29 AUG 92 / Letter: Testing time for traders at the TSO Sir, Having just received a visit from a Customs and Excise officer in connection with the new Intrastat requirements from January 1 next year, I was intrigued by Alan Cane's article on new VAT rules (''Heads buried in the sand' over VAT rules', August 24). The officer was extremely helpful though somewhat embarrassed in that, as you report, final details of the legislation have yet to be settled. In contrast, the Trade Statistics Office is taking an extremely unhelpful attitude. I am informed that the commodity code booklet, which gives all the commodity codes we are likely to need as traders, is only available for sale, at Pounds 10. Consequently, British business is being asked to pay to find out the numbers they must include on their returns. Moreover, I understand that the TSO is refusing to send directly to traders the forms necessary to enable the TSO to maintain a register of traders. It will send them only to the relevant Customs and Excise offices. The result is traders are being asked to complete forms which they will have to find ways of ensuring they receive. My company has already spent much time and effort trying to ensure it complies with the regulations - so far as they are known. We also understand the need to provide information. But I do feel the attitude of the TSO should become more user-friendly - as has recently happened with Customs and Excise, and the Inland Revenue.

			<p>BFN     [Text] Brussels, May 6 (AFP) -- The European Union [EU] is  to send a mission to countries fringing Rwanda in order to study  the plight of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees  displaced by civil war, the EU said here Friday [6 May].    Theodoros Pangalos, the Greek chairman of the EU's Council  of  Ministers, said the mission would comprise high-level diplomats  of Greece, Germany and Belgium, the current and immediate future  and past presidents of the Union.    Speaking after a meeting of EU ministers of development  cooperation, he said the Union was also trying to broker a  dialogue between the parties to the civil war in Rwanda which  has reportedly claimed up to 200,000 lives.    Belgian Development Minister Eric Derijcke said the EU was  also trying to put pressure on the Organisation of African Unity  into playing a more active role in the search for peace in  Rwanda.</p>

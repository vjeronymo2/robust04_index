			<p>940920 FT  20 SEP 94 / UK Company News: Datrontech plans to come to market with Pounds 50m valuation Datrontech, a leading supplier and distributor of computer memory and other PC components, plans to come to market late next month through a placing with institutional investors which is expected to value the Aldershot-based group at about Pounds 50m. The company was founded in 1987 by Mr Steve King, managing and marketing director, and Mr Ian Boyle, sales director. Its expansion reflects the underlying growth of personal computer sales. These are expected to continue to grow at around 20 per cent a year, coupled with the strong demand for PC memory fuelled by successive generations of more powerful microprocessors and more complex software. Last year Datrontech, which has 96 employees, lifted adjusted operating profits to Pounds 2.6m from Pounds 1.9m in 1992 and Pounds 1.7m the previous year on turnover which grew by 86 per cent to Pounds 46m (Pounds 24.7m), up from Pounds 15.9m in 1991. It expects turnover to exceed Pounds 60m this year. Pre-tax profits in the half year to June 30 increased to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 1.4m) on turnover of Pounds 35m (Pounds 23m). Memory products accounted for 88 per cent of Datrontech's turnover last year  -the company has about 5 per cent of the combined UK and Irish memory market which was worth Pounds 646m, based on figures from Dataquest, the market research organisation. The company has a close relationship with California-based Kingston Technology, one of the fastest growing private companies in the US, whose memory products account for about 40 per cent of Datrontech's sales. Its suppliers also include most of the main computer technology providers including IBM, Intel, Microsoft and Creative Labs. Although the PC memory market has become increasingly competitive, Datrontech has managed to maintain above-average margins despite expanding into the lower-margin original equipment manufacturer (OEM) market in the UK. It emphasises its customer service policy and was one of the first IT companies to introduce 'just-in-time delivery' and 97 per cent of orders are met within 24 hours. Datrontech is expected to raise up to Pounds 5m through the flotation.</p>

			<p>930330 FT  30 MAR 93 / Italian spotlight on links to Mafia THE CORRUPTION scandals in Italy have reached a new and potentially far more explosive phase as magistrates focus on the inner workings of the Christian Democrat party and its control over the levers of power. Until now magistrates investigating corruption have attacked the outer core of the political system. Over the past year they have revealed a system of bribes and favours in which politicians received funds for themselves and their parties in return for awarding contracts and cartels to businessmen. In revealing this system, which got out of hand in the 1980s, the Christian Democrats and Socialists have been damaged and patronage politics has been discredited. But in the magistrates' warning to Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister, that he is being investigated for allegedly consorting with the Sicilian Mafia, and in conducting the same investigative process against the Christian Democrats' top two bosses in Naples, matters have changed radically. Mr Andreotti has insisted on his innocence as have Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino and Mr Antonio Gava, the Naples Christian Democrat leaders. But the process will be hard to stop. This involves a challenge to the Christian Democrats' near-exclusive hold over the apparatus of state since 1946. The party has undoubtedly been supported by a popular vote and been backed by the Church. But it has also sustained itself in power through control over the security services (the Interior Ministry has never left Christian Democrat hands), manipulation of the courts and unchallenged use of state funds. Italy has had a long list of mysterious events which have never been clarified for the simple reason that the truth would discredit or even bring down the Christian Democrat hierarchy. The events include the 'execution' of Mr Aldo Moro, the Christian Democrat prime minister, at the hands of the Red Brigades; the murder of police chief Carlo Alberto della Chiesa; the collapse of the Sindona financial empire; the death of banker Roberto Calvi; the role of the secret masonic lodge P2; the abortive coup of Valerio Borghese and a series of bombings including a disaster at Bologna railway station. The common link in all is either the suspected presence of the Mafia or the secret services - or both. Mr Andreotti, who has held every office of state save the presidency, has been in power throughout these events. In defending himself now, he may well be obliged to shed some light on them. Equally, politicians may well have to explain how it is that the Mafia in Sicily and its counterparts in Calabria and Naples have expanded in recent years.</p>

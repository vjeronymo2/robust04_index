			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Leonor Figueiredo] </F>   [Excerpts] Drug consumption among the youths in  compulsory military service has declined. The military claim  that this is the victory won by deterrence. Positive screening  test results dropped from 18.1 percent in 1989 to 5.8 percent in  1993.    A "conquest": a euphoric atmosphere prevails at the Army's  Analytical Toxicology Laboratory. The personnel exhibit the  declining figures on drug consumption as if a method for  recovery from drug addiction with proven success had been found.    "Soon, we'll reach three percent, and without coercive  action." Major Mario Pragosa, chief of the Clinical Pathology  Service at the Principal Military Hospital, where the laboratory  analyzing the urine collected in the barracks is installed,  emphasizes this to DN [DIARIO DE NOTICIAS]. The annual trends in  positive samples revealing drug consumption indicate an enormous  reduction since 1989, when the Army, simultaneously with the Air  Force, implemented the program to prevent and combat drugs and  alcoholism in the Portuguese Armed Forces, years after the Navy  had initiated its own tests.    In 1989, the first year of the testing, 18 percent of the  1,462 individuals analyzed revealed drug consumption. Since  then, the percentage has not stopped falling: 11.4 percent  positive among 4,445 members of the military in 1990; 10.7  percent among 4,920 individuals in 1991; 9.1 percent among 4,568  tested in 1992; and 5.8 percent among the 7,465 analyzed last  year.  <H5>  Deterring Tests </H5>   This indicator of a reduction in drug consumption is all the  more surprising when one realizes that it has not stopped rising  among the civilian society. According to Mario Pragosa, however,  the deterring power of the tests is what is mainly responsible  for this decline occurring among youths aged between 18 and 21  years. "The results have a great psychological effect, and no  one wants the stigma of being a drug addict. The same thing is  happening in the United States. Within 10 years, they managed to  reduce the figure from 46 to 3.5 percent," he argues. Other  factors could be associated with it: "There is more information,  prevention, and carefulness in detecting drugs in the barracks."    The prevention begins in the units, through officers trained  in courses on preventing and deterring consumption given at the  Armed Forces' School of Health, and created to supplement the  surveillance program. This program defines the dangers involved  in the use of toxic substances in the Armed Forces: "The  promotion of drug use among members of the military institution,  as a deliberate act, or for trafficking purposes, can have very  serious consequences, specifically, for military security, as  well as negative effects on the Armed Forces' discipline and  operativeness." It maintains: "The soldier taking drugs or  overdoing alcohol consumption jeopardizes the security of  personnel, materiel, installations, and intelligence, as well as  the organization's overall health. This entails grave  consequences for the performance of missions, and for the Armed  Forces' prestige."    In 1993, the drugs most consumed and detected by the tests  were still in the cannabinoids group (76 percent), followed by  cannabinoids combined with opiates (13.5 percent), opiates (7.8  percent), and various other combinations (2.7 percent).    According to the official in charge of the tests, the trends  in the drugs most used indicate that the cannabinoids are being  used less (in 1991, they accounted for 83.6 percent of the total  consumption). However, the combination of cannabinoids and  opiates (which was 8.2 percent in that same year) is rising.    Most of the urine tests are made on youths who have been  recruited, as well as among volunteers and those requesting a  deferment of their period of stay in the Armed Forces. However,  soldiers in the regular military ranks do not escape this  checking, which is random and without a set day or date.  Nevertheless, Mario Pragosa claims: "I can count on the fingers  of one hand the number of cases of drug addiction" among career  troops: equivalent to 0.05 percent. [passage omitted]  <H5>  [Box, p 20] </H5>    -  The cannabinoids remain the drugs most consumed among the  youths performing their compulsory military service.    -  Consumption is prevented on the unit level through officers  who  have taken specialized courses at the Armed Forces School of  Health.    -  The military want to reduce the consumption rate to 3  percent. And they are gratified by the fact that these results  will be accrued without coercive measures.    -  The number of  soldiers subjected to tests has gradually increased since  1989.        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Drug Consumption in the Army                                                 |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |The cannabinoids remain the drug most consumed by recruits in compulsory mil-|  |itary service.                                                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Year                                  |Percent                               |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1989                                  |18.1                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1990                                  |11.4                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1991                                  |10.7                                  |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1992                                  |9.1                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |1993                                  |5.8                                   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Source: Army Analytical Toxicology Laboratory                                |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

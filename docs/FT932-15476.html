			<p>930413 FT  13 APR 93 / The Lex Column: French privatisation The new French government will be disappointed to find the family silver so tarnished. The loss forecast last week by Pechiney, the aluminium group, was only the latest bleak statement from the state sector. Recession need not scupper the whole privatisation programme. The French equity market has risen by 20 per cent since last autumn in spite of the cyclical pain. Rhone-Poulenc's share offering in January showed that profits warnings and privatisation are not mutually exclusive. Interest-rate sensitive banks rather than industrial companies may now be front runners - provided their balance sheets can be cleaned up in short order. But privatisation on any scale will require a shift of domestic savings into equities. The government's manifesto pledge to raise FFr40bn-60bn a year for the next five years would test the domestic equity market. Equity issues in Paris amounted to little more than FFr15bn last year and FFr30bn in 1991. Lower interest rates and tax breaks might be required to attract the FFr1,300bn savings now held in money-market funds. That is not in the gift of a government committed to franc fort. The government will doubtless try to attract overseas capital without surrendering industry to the risk of foreign control. Relying on international capital will mean competing with other cash-strapped European governments, especially in sectors such as energy. Spain has already attracted foreign cash into Repsol this year. Italy may yet put Eni on the block. Elf Acquitaine will not want to be last in the queue.</p>

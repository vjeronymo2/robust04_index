			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:CSO     [Text] Bangalore, January 3--The Bharatiya Janata Party  (BJP) will be observing nationwide agitations demanding the  total rejection of the Dunkel proposals from February 1 till the  presentation of the Union budget, Mr O. Rajgopal, BJP national  vice president, announced yesterday.    Addressing the Karnataka state executive committee members  of  the party, he said the BJP would be organising seminars,  discussions and public meetings from January 15 all over the  country on the adverse implications of the Centre's signing of  the Dunkel proposals at the GATT [General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade] negotiations without consulting the opposition.    The Dunkel proposals, shamelessly signed by the Centre  without taking Parliament into confidence, was an affront to the  parliamentary system as it affects the country's sovereignty and  would harm all sections of people particularly the farmers, he  said.    Mr Rajgopal said the party wanted to censure the Centre in  Parliament on the issue but could not do anything as the left  parties shied away from the move. "We have now decided to take  the issue before the people and mobilise public opinion on the  dangers of the Dunkel proposals," he said pointing out that the  BJP would be campaigning on the Centre's failure to take any  action on the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) report on the  securities scam involving a loot of over Rs800 crore.    The BJP leader, who did not make even a passing reference to  the Ram mandir issue during his 90-minute speech, however,  asserted that BJP was not a "single-issue party."    Mr Rajgopal dwelt at length on the outcome of the recent  round of assembly elections in the north and claimed that those  who saw the BJP nearing its end were living in a fool's  paradise. Though the party's performance was not up to the  expected levels, the elections have clearly established that the  BJP's emergence as a major political party in the country, both  in terms of securing popular votes and in the number of seats  won.    Quoting electoral statistics, he said that out of a total of  9.84 crore votes cast, the BJP grabbed 3.57 crore accounting for  36 per cent of the popular votes cast, winning 448 seats against  the 2.59 crore votes (10 per cent less than BJP) and 348 seats  won by the Congress, while the Janata Dal got hardly 89 lakh  votes and 42 seats. The BJP suffered reverses in Madhya Pradesh  and Himachal Pradesh due to different local reasons, while its  performance in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan was better than  during the 1983 polls.    The setback in terms of number of seats for the BJP in Uttar  Pradesh was on account of the ganging up of the Muslims and  casteist forces under the Bahujan Samajwadi Party and Socialist  Party alliance of Mr Kanshi Ram and Mr Mulayam Singh Yadav, he  alleged.    Mr Rajgopal said the BJP would be concentrating its efforts  on Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, which were likely to go to the  polls in April or May "We are looking for spectacular gains in  Karnataka whenever assembly polls are held and make up for the  loss suffered by the party in the north," he said, pointing out  that the ruling Congress party's moves for advancing polls in  the two southern states would benefit the BJP.    Mr K.S. Easwarappa, MLA [Member of Legislative Assembly] and  state BJP chief, said the party would be launching a vigorous  state-wide campaign demanding elections to the taluka panchayats  and zilla parishada and for rejection of the Dunkel proposals.  "We are moving a resolution in this regard in the assembly," he  announced.</p>

His admission coincided with a police announcement that a  warrant will be issued tomorrow for the arrest of a suspected  international terrorist, and that other warrants may follow.    Police said at least four people collaborated in assembling  the truckbomb.    It was likely Thais were involved since it was difficult for  foreigners to buy all the components locally.    "I have learned that some Thais joined the gang. The  crackdown must be made at their grassroots," Chavalit said.    Citing a police report, the minister said one of the  suspected foreign terrorists is believed to be still hiding in  Bangkok. Police are trying to locate the others.    Metropolitan Police Commissioner Pol Lt Gen Chaisit  Kanchanakit said police will on Monday issue a warrant for the  arrest of a suspected international terrorist whose identity was  already known.    Chaisit said he met Israeli embassy officials yesterday  morning and they agreed to send anti-terrorism experts to  support the police hunt for the masterminds.    Police discovered by sheer luck on Thursday a tonne of high  explosive in a water tank on the back of a six-wheel truck  earlier abandoned at the busy Ploenchit-Chitlom intersection on  March 11 when the driver fled after hitting a taxi motorcycle.    The chance accident averted what could have been the most  disastrous terrorist attack in Thailand. Police said the truck  driver appeared to be on a suicide-mission to the Israeli  embassy, which is less than one kilometre away.    The truck-bomb was composed of ammonium nitrate fertilizer,  C-4 cxplosive and diesel oil with a detonating switch on the  vehicle's dashboard. The formula is similar to "witches brew",  the deadly mixture used to bomb the New York World Trade Centre  last year and police are investigating a possible link between  the two incidents.    A corpse also found in the tank was positively identified as  the Thai driver who delivered the rented truck to the terrorists.    Police on Friday found 25 sacks of ammonium nitrate-based  fertilizer and an empty water tank in an abandoned house in  Bangkok's Bung Kum District. The landlord said she had rented  the house to a group of Arab men.    Police yesterday produced a sketch of a second suspect in  the  sabotage attempt. An artist's sketch of the first suspect,  drawn from details given by the owner of the motorcycle hit by  the truck, had already been sent to all police stations.    Metropolitan Police Deputy Commissioner Pol Maj Gen, Thawi  Thippharat yesterday said the two suspects are from the Middle  East, but he would not specify their nationality.    Chawalit yesterday said some foreign embassies have assigned  officials to help the police investigation.    Commissioner Chaisit, meanwhile, said police are waiting for  more information from the Israeli embassy to determine whether  additional arrest warrants should also be issued.    He said police had lifted fingerprints from the Bung Kum  house and they should be useful in identifying the terrorists  and their organization.    The commissioner said he did not know whether any of the  culprits were still in the country.    If the perpetrators were found to be hiding overseas,  investigators could seek cooperation from local police through  Interpol to arrest and extradite them to Bangkok for legal  prosecution, he said.    Prime Minister Chuan Likphai said on his retum from Vietnam  yesterday that he expected a detailed report on the case  tomorrow.    He defended the government intelligence units against  criticism that the planned terrorist attack almost succeeded  because they lacked efficiency, saying they have been consistent  with their monitoring of possible terrorist activity in Thailand.    "We should be fair to them. Some kinds of work are not  easy," he said.    Foreign Minister Prasong Sunsiri, a former secretary-general  of the National Security Council, said he acknowledged that  terrorist groups had tried to use Thailand as a base to launch  their attacks.    He said the current efficiency level of Thai intelligence  units is good, but it is impossible for them to know everything.</p>

According to CARENA, some  of the arrangements include the formation of an ad hoc  government, a government of concord and of national  reconciliation under Article 111 of the Constitution, in  compliance with the resolution adopted at the national  conference on 6-8 February. The parliament is scheduled to  examine a law related to this resolution as soon as possible;  all the steps toward that end were laid out by the office of the  conference.    CARENA also advises that it has outlined to international  institutions the steps by which, on the one hand, the sanctions  against Haiti scheduled since the beginning of January 1994 can  be set aside and, on the other hand, the idea of not hastily  reinforcing those sanctions can be maintained.    CARENA asserts that contacts at the highest level have been  established for the purpose of immediately supplying the local  fuel market and that a solution is under study.    CARENA claims it is working day and night with national and  international decisionmakers on the Haitian issue and cautions  that the task of national reconciliation can not be fulfilled in  an atmosphere of pressure, tension, and sanctions.</p>

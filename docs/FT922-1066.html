			<p>920624 FT  24 JUN 92 / Ferranti shares gain 17% as losses are cut to Pounds 39.6m FERRANTI International, the electronics and defence group which came close to collapse following the 1989 discovery of huge fraud in its US subsidiary, International Signal and Control, yesterday appeared to be back on course for recovery. The company announced less severe losses than expected and said three 'life threatening' litigation claims against a problem US subsidiary, FICC, have been settled. Ferranti's shares jumped 17 per cent in response, from 8.75p to 10.25p. Ferranti reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 39.6m in the year to March 31, compared with losses of Pounds 98.1m in the previous period. The losses included Pounds 6.6m from discontinued businesses and exceptional costs of Pounds 13.9m from rationalisations and fixed asset write-offs. Mr Eugene Anderson, chairman since 1990, said Ferranti's markets remained tough, especially given the downturn in defence spending. 'We're getting close to (profits) but the key is winning more business,' he said. A disposal programme, which included the sale of its missile business to GEC, is continuing. Employee numbers fell to just over 5,000 at the start of this month, compared with about 27,000 in 1989. Disposals raised Pounds 69.8m and net borrowings fell from Pounds 94.8m to Pounds 66.5m. But gearing remains close to 100 per cent, and further disposals are due this year. Turnover fell nearly a quarter to Pounds 362.6m while turnover on continuing business was down about 17 per cent. However, the company won Pounds 249.4m of new business in the defence and civil sectors and the order book at year-end was Pounds 272.1m. Litigation stemming from the fraud, which Ferranti estimates cost the company more than Pounds 600m, is continuing. Mr James Guerin, former chairman of ISC, was jailed for 15 years earlier this month. Ferranti has recovered Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 640,000) from proceedings involving another ISC employee. About Pounds 41.1m of losses related to the fraud have so far been recovered. Some Pounds 40m was paid by Peat Marwick, auditor to ISC. There was a loss per share of 4p, compared with a 11.5p loss a year ago. No dividend is recommended. Extraordinary losses of Pounds 6.6m on the closure of businesses took losses for the year to Pounds 44.1m. Loss reduced, Page 22</p>

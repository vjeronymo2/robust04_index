			<p>940104 FT  04 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Good year for occupational pension funds British occupational pension funds performed impressively in 1993, with buoyant equity markets largely responsible for estimated real rates of return of more than 20 per cent. In its initial estimates, World Markets Company, the Edinburgh-based performance measurement specialist, says that funds made total investment returns - capital gains plus income - of 27.8 cent last year, compared to 18.6 per cent in 1992 and an average return of 15 per cent annually over the last 10 years. World Markets measures the investment performance of 1,900 UK pension funds with assets of Pounds 380bn, more than 80 per cent of the UK pension fund market. Emerging stock markets in east Asia, such as Hong Kong and Malaysia, provided the most exciting growth with returns in excess of 90 per cent. Overall, overseas shares earned returns of 37 per cent, compared with 19.7 per cent in 1992. Returns from North America amounted to 12.9 per cent down from 32.4 per cent in 1992. However, Japan and continental Europe both showed improvement on 1992, with increases of 35.3 (18.3 per cent) and 27.6 per cent (decline of 0.9 per cent) respect-ively. In Japan strong growth in the first half of the year offset a sluggish performance in the third quarter and a 13.5 per cent decline in the finalthree months of the year. In the UK total equity returns of 28 per cent were half a percentage point below the FT-A All-Share Index. Investment managers also saw a strong performance by UK bonds with returns in excess of 23 per cent on the back of falling bond yields and declining inflation. The 21 per cent return from index-linked gilts is the best annual return since their launch in 1982. The recovery in property values pushed returns up to 12.4 per cent after three years of losses. Returns increased steadily, rising from 0.3 per cent in the first quarter to 6.1 per cent in the final three months of the year. In contrast, returns from both overseas bonds (16.4 per cent compared with 29.1 per cent last year) and cash/other investments (7.1 per cent compared with 13.2 per cent) were both down. New money flowing into the schemes amounted to only 1 per cent of total assets - an amount equivalent to about Pounds 3.8bn. Some 82 per cent of fund assets are invested in equities, with 25 per cent in overseas shares. Money continues to be allocated to Europe and the Pacific at the expense of North America and Japan. Pension funds now have 4.8 per cent of total assets invested in east Asian emerging markets, compared with 4.7 per cent in Japan.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PENSION FUND RETURNS (%)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------                                      1992          1993(Est)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- UK equities                          20.8               27.9 Overseas equities                    19.7               37.3 UK bonds                             19.1               23.6 Overseas bonds                       29.1               16.4 UK index-linked                      17.8               21.8 Cash/other investments               13.2                7.1 Total assets (excluding property)    20.3               28.8 UK property                          -1.3               13.0 Overseas property                     0.8               -2.9 Total assets (including property)    18.6               27.8  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: WM Company  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

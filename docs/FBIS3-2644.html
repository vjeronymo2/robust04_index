			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Moscow, March 10 (XINHUA) -- Russian Foreign  Minister Andrey Kozyrev today stressed the need to make joint  efforts in building a new Europe.    Speaking at a news conference before the meeting of the  Council for Foreign Policy, the Russian minister said, "Russia  is set to prevent any weakening of partnership established with  the United States" and will "specify its substance on the basis  of full equality of rights and duties."    Kozyrev stressed that "It is necessary to begin joint  efforts  to form a strategic partnership in building a new Europe."    "President Yeltsin has put forth this initiative, which is  now being considered by the leaders of Western countries,"  Kozyrev added.    He said practical headway has been made towards making  former  enemies into friends and allies.    "The idea of cooperation with NATO has been given substance  in the U.S. concept of a Partnership for Peace, which opened a  period of drafting and implementing programs involving all  countries on an equal basis," the Russian minister noted.    He went on to say that "Russia is close to signing the  relevant documents."    Kozyrev warned however that "The NATO mania of impatience in  advocating others joining the alliance and the partnership,  accompanied by an anti-Russian hysteria, can lead to the  strengthening of the position of Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his  supporters."    The Russian minister rejected attempts of "certain circles  in  the West, Central and Eastern Europe to speculate on the  Zhirinovsky factor and revive the image of a NATO enemy in the  face of Russia."    "Those who insist on the thesis of a Russian menace begin to  believe it themselves," Kozyrev said, adding that the  artificially generated threat makes people blind and prevents  them from seeing the real problems of security.    "The victory in the Cold War was not won by the NATO  military  machine but by the democratic principles of the Conference for  Security and Cooperation in Europe (ESCE). It is the ESCE which  is bound to win a stable democratic peace in post-confrontation  Europe," the Russian minister concluded.</p>

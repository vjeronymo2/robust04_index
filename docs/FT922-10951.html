			<p>920428 FT  28 APR 92 / International Company News: Macy chief decides to step down MR EDWARD Finkelstein, chairman and chief executive of RH Macy, yesterday said he was stepping down from the helm of the company he had steered through a Dollars 3.6bn buy-out in 1986 and more recently into the bankruptcy courts. Yesterday's announcement follows growing speculation that outside directors of the New York-based department store chain are taking control of the board. Mr Finkelstein, 67, had been regarded as something of a retailing wizard through most of his 43-year career with Macy, before the company's troubles became apparent in late 1988. He masterminded the 1986 management-led leveraged buy-out, which was extremely successful. But he ran into trouble in 1988 after a bidding war for Federated Department Stores left Macy with Federated's California divisions and an additional Dollars 1.4bn of debt. Macy struggled for years under its heavy debt burden, estimated at around Dollars 3.7bn, and cash-flow was further depleted by the impact of recession in the US and weak sales during the important Christmas season. The company filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code in January. 'I believe it is best for the organisation to focus on the future, instead of the past,' said Mr Finkelstein, 'and that this is an appropriate time to turn over the reins to my able colleagues.' Mr Myron Ullman, 45, and Mr Mark Handler, 59, have been named co-chairmen and co-chief executives. Mr Handler has been with Macy since 1958; Mr Ullman joined the company in 1988. Mr Finkelstein will remain as a consultant.</p>

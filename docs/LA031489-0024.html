			<p><P> March 14, 1989, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> INFLATION PRESSURES  </P> <P> Kuttner failed to mention annual rent increases demanded by landlords of  residential and commercial property as a major inflationary factor. Today,  practically every lease for apartments, offices, and other types of property  contains a clause entitled, "Annual Cost of Living Increase." The terms of the  agreement give landlords the right to increase rent every year according to the  cost-of-living index published by the government that usually ranges between 1  and 7%.  </P> <P> A simple exercise in mathematics should convince anyone that businesses, large  and small, are compelled to increase their prices of goods and services to  compensate for this upward adjustment every 12 months. Multiply the outcome of  this annual increase by the number of residential and commercial tenants forced  to pay this tithe, and you will obtain a staggering profit for landlords not  based on principles of supply and demand.  </P> <P> JAMES W.

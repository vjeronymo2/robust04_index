			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Excerpt] France has lifted its ban on Thai fishery product  imports, ending a month-long dispute between the two countries,  according to official sources. French diplomats in Bangkok would  not confirm or deny the reports, but Deputy Commerce Minister  Chaiyot Sasomsap said the French Government had notified its  Thai counterpart through the Thai Foreign Trade Department that  Paris would abide by its commitments to allow the imports. The  source said the Thai Commercial Counselor's office in Paris had  reported that France would today freely allow the imports to  enter.    A Commerce Ministry source said the ministry could not  indicate why the process of adding Thailand to the list of  countries allowed to export fishery produce to France was  speeded up, after the Thai Government made diplomatic protests  last week.

			<p>930817 FT  17 AUG 93 / People: Signs of succession Meanwhile, Brian Harris's successor as president of the London Chamber next year is Brian Pearce who, at 62, is gradually lightening his commitments at family firm Pearce Signs. Pearce pere stays on as executive group chairman, but his 34-year-old son Nicholas, great great great great grandson of Samuel Pearce, who founded the company in 1791, moves from marketing director into the newly created position of deputy chairman. A chartered accountant who has been at the family firm for the past eight years, Nicholas Pearce says his promotion is 'a public statement to the doubters and interested parties that the line of succession is confirmed'. He is likely to take over as chairman in about three years' time. At the same time, Michael Short, who started at the company as Brian Pearce's PA, moves up from group managing director to chief executive, another new position. 'It is a recognition of the role he has been performing for the past 18 months anyway,' says the seventh generation Pearce. Pearce has a brother and sister, neither of whom is in the business which is the UK's biggest signmaker with annual sales running at Pounds 30m. He also has two sons, aged four and one. 'It is a little early to foist anything on them. If they want to be a doctor and a fireman, good luck to them,' he says. 'I'm very practical about this. Every new generation into the company is a bonus.'</p>

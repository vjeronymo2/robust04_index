			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Italian grand prix cancelled Fia, the governing body of world motor sport, yesterday decided to cancel the 65th Italian grand prix, due to be contested on September 11, ending weeks of uncertainty caused by a row between tree-hugging environmentalists and road-hogging Formula One drivers. Environmental groups have been protesting against proposals to fell more than 100 trees and extend the gravel-filled safety lane at one fast right-hand bend on the track. Drivers called for the improvement after the accident which killed Ayrton Senna at the San Marino grand prix earlier this year. Various local and national authorities failed to come to a final decision on whether trees or turbos should have precedence, until yesterday, when Fia decided it had had enough and cancelled the race. Mr Aldo Moltifiori, mayor of Monza and the grand prix's strongest advocate locally, claimed direct and indirect earnings from the grand prix amounted to L70bn a year, with 100 jobs depending directly on the race, and a further 1,400 temporary employees helping on race day itself.</p>

			<p>941026 FT  26 OCT 94 / Brussels warns of future steel industry crisis Europe's steel industry risks another crisis in the future because of its failure to deliver crucial capacity cuts, warned Mr Karel Van Miert, European commissioner responsible for competition. He was announcing the death of the Commission's steel restructuring plan, created two years ago to help restore the beleaguered industry to health during Europe's deep recession. Mr Van Miert said industry's failure to stick to the plan had left it with overcapacity in the EU of some 20m tonnes. 'It is unfortunate that in this plan not all the actors did what needed to be done,' he said. Under the plan, Europe's steelmakers were required to make minimum cuts in capacity of 19m tonnes, but fell short of this target by around 3.5m tonnes. Enthusiasm for the capacity cuts wore off as international steel prices began to recover steadily. Disbandment of the plan means that there will be no more discussion between the commission and industry over the state of the market, with the Commission dropping its quarterly guidelines for production and delivery volumes. In addition, measures to restrict imports from eastern Europe - in particular from Slovakia and the Czech Republic - will be dropped. 'Normal competitive conditions will apply,' said Mr Van Miert. The German Steel Federation criticised the decision, saying that its members had done their part to cut capacity, 'trusting that the European Commission would continue its efforts for market stabilisation until a successful conclusion'. Since 1992 German companies had made decisions to cut 6m tonnes of crude steel and almost 3m tonnes of hot-rolled products, it said. Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann has said the EU industry was wrong to put off needed restructuring because of a temporary recovery in the market. 'They'll be knocking (on the door) again in three years time,' said a Commission official. The recovery is in part due to increased exports to the US and Asia, said Mr Alan Coats, a steel analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London. He said the industry cannot depend on exports for continued health, especially since imports from eastern Europe and Russia were likely to grow. Despite the collapse of the rescue plan, a package of social subsidies, designed to ease the impact of steel plant closures, will continue to apply until the end of 1995, the Commission said yesterday. The Commission has also decided to recommend to member states that they accept the German government's bid to rescue Eko Stahl, east Germany's largest steel mill, through a hefty state subsidy.

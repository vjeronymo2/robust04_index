			<p>940725 FT  25 JUL 94 / Commanders defend privileges on the home front: Bruce Clark weighs the arguments over providing luxury abodes for senior officers in the armed forces 'When a civil servant who regards himself as comparable to me in seniority and age sees me living in a nice house, it makes him jealous.' That is the explanation offered by one senior commander for the recent controversy over high living by top servicemen. Distinguished officers in Her Majesty's forces require little encouragement to hold forth about such matters as peace-keeping doctrine or the future of submarine warfare. But there is another subject which can arouse equally strong passions, but is not so willingly discussed in front of outsiders: their own housing and privileges. This month's disclosure of a Pounds 387,000 refurbishment for the home of an air chief marshal has reminded the public of one of the things that distinguish service life from the civilian world - the glamour of life at the top. Many of the homes are listed houses. Among the finest is Admiralty House, a Georgian mansion overlooking Plymouth Sound. Others are simply expanded versions of the red-brick 'married quarters' on glorified housing estates where most officers and their families live. The commander of British forces in Hong Kong enjoys a lifestyle in the colony's most fashionable district which would be the envy of many a civilian millionaire. Until recently UK forces in Germany occupied some splendid mansions commandeered in 1945. There is no precise correlation between high living and responsibility. A decade ago the senior general in Northern Ireland was obliged by security factors to move from a mansion outside Belfast to more modest quarters inside a barracks. And the flat in central London that goes with the job of Chief of the Defence Staff is comfortable rather than opulent. Officers' residences are, of course, 'tied cottages', like a bishop's palace or an Oxford master's lodge. They go with particular jobs, and the service couples who inhabit them are only too aware that in a year or two they will be washing their own dishes in plainer surroundings. Senior officers will have to fight a skilful rearguard action to hold on to their privileges when defence costs are being trimmed and numbers reduced. There are 67 official residences for senior officers in the UK, 26 for the navy, 23 for the army and 18 for the Royal Air Force. Another 10 residences are located abroad. However, 14 residences have been sold in the past year and more disposals are expected. These establishments will hardly make or break the defence budget. Over the past two years the upkeep of senior officers' homes has cost the taxpayer about Pounds 5m, covering everything from new roofs to routine maintenance. A total of 278 domestic staff - 25 of them overseas - are employed in these houses, at an annual cost to the taxpayer of about Pounds 5m. Some of the most exotic homes to which an officer can aspire - as head of the garrison in Brunei or military adviser in Oman - cost the UK taxpayer nothing because they are paid for by local sultans. When set against total annual defence spending of Pounds 23bn, the sums spent on officers' homes seem paltry enough. But looked at from another angle, the figures can be embarrassing. The average staff costs for each senior officer come to about Pounds 65,000 a year, while the average value of each official residence is about Pounds 500,000. From the officers' point of view the trouble is that any case they advance in support of this state of affairs can sound hollow and self-serving. But there are some practical arguments in favour of the current arrangements. Senior service jobs include a public-relations function which is comparable to that of ambassadors. Their homes have to double as conference centres, restaurants and hotels for a stream of dignitaries ranging from parliamentary delegations to Middle Eastern potentates shopping for weapons. Jobs with responsibility for conflict zones such as Northern Ireland or Bosnia keep the holder on duty for 24 hours a day. He needs to be in frequent touch with operational headquarters and to live close to his place of work. Given that these positions are rotated every year or two, it makes better sense to keep permanent official residences than to provide officers with housing allowances and expect them to waste time searching for accommodation. But these bread-and-butter arguments are not the ones most officers would use in defence of their homes. In the end, they would say, a hint of mystique and glamour is one of the intangibles that draws talented people to service careers - and spurs them on to compete for posts whose salaries are modest by civilian standards. Like so many aspects of service life, from drill to military tattoos, this cannot easily be explained to accountants.</p>

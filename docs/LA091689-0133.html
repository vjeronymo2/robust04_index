			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> FOR LOARA, THIS VICTORY OVER ANAHEIM IS A SNAP  </P> <P> Pity Anaheim High School punter Abe Gomez. From the first snap he took on  Friday night, he was on the run.  </P> <P> By the time Gomez had controlled the high snap from center, a pack of Loara  defenders was upon him and his kick was not so much blocked as it was  smothered.  </P> <P> "I just looked back and I saw everybody (coming after me)," Gomez said. "It was  scary."  </P> <P> Gomez' terror was representative of Anaheim's night, as Loara (2-0) overwhelmed  the Colonists 36-7 in a nonleague game at Glover Stadium in Anaheim.  </P> <P> And it got worse for Gomez, who spent much of the night chasing errant snaps  and attempting to elude Loara rushers.  </P> <P> Besides the blocked punt, which led to the first Loara touchdown, Gomez had two  snaps clear his outstretched arms. The first time, in the first half, Gomez  managed to get off a short, bounding kick. But the second time, in the fourth  quarter, he was tackled in the end zone for a safety, which provided Loara's  last two points.  </P> <P> Except for a touchdown pass on a fake field-goal attempt at the end of the  first half, Anaheim (0-2) was moribund on offense. Halfback Sammy Serna  completed a 25-yard touchdown pass to fullback Ernie Akau, fooling the Loara  defenders.  </P> <P> But little else fooled any Saxon defenders. Anaheim's running plays were  stuffed and Colonist quarterback Robert Jones was harassed into two second-half  interceptions, both of which were returned for touchdowns by Greg Ramsey and  Brett Banta.  </P> <P> Loara's offense had taken a 21-0 lead in the first half behind the running of  tailback Coy Collins and quarterback Sean Conner. Collins gained most of the  Saxon yards in the half, scoring on runs of 1 and 34 yards. Conner kept the  ball on the option and scored after a 45-yard run.  </P></p>

			<p>921024 FT  24 OCT 92 / Kohl backs tax to paycosts of unification CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl has thrown his weight behind moves for a tax increase in Germany in 1995 to help pay for the accumulated costs of unification - but with a freeze on taxation for the next two years. The plan, proposed in a motion to next week's annual conference of Mr Kohl's ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU), is an attempt to reconcile the demands from the east for an urgent injection of funds, and strenuous resistance from the German business sector to any suggestion of an early tax rise. By postponing any tax rise until 1995, Mr Kohl is making further drastic cuts in state spending in the west inevitable in the next two years. It also means that he can keep his promise that there will be no tax increases in the life of his current government - which runs until elections in 1994. At the same time, it is clear that by 1995, accumulated debts for unification from the Treuhand privatisation agency, and the German Unity Fund, will all fall on the central exchequer, with devastating effects for the budget deficit. In spite of its political attractions, the call for a 1995 tax rise was immediately criticised by German industry. Mr Tyll Necker, the president of the BDI, the German federation of industry, said the government was putting the cart before the horse: the immediate requirement was for savings to be made. The German government yesterday announced a deal on who will pay for the huge backlog of environmental damage caused by east German industries, thus removing an important stumbling block to new private investment. The agreement means that the Treuhand privatisation agency will be responsible for 60 per cent of the cost of cleaning up the damage, and the six federal states in the east will pay for the remainder.</p>

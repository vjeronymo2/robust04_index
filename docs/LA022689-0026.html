			<p><P> February 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP EYE: IRON CITY  </P> <P> Twenty years after "Tommy," Pete Townshend is finishing work on a concept album  based on the children's story, "Iron Man." It stars blues great John Lee Hooker  as the title character (he eats iron in a junkyard) with Townshend on hand and  Nina Simone in a supporting role. . . . It's always a joy to hear a songwriter  describe the ideas behind his new material -- especially if he has the vivid  imagination of XTC's Andy Partridge. Asked how he wrote "Here Comes President  Kil Again," a song from the group's tart new "Oranges and Lemons" album,  Partridge explained: "When I walk the dog, I get ideas, and the pace I walk  determines the tempo of the song." . . . Meanwhile, the Cult is due back in  April with a new album called "Sonic Temple." Produced by Bob Rock (who's  worked with Bon Jovi and Kingdom Come), it features "Edie (Ciao Baby)," (a  tribute to Warhol-protegeEdie Sedgwick), "American Horse," "Fire Women," "Soul  Asylum" and "Sun King." . . . Harp magic man Lazy Lester has a new album out  from Alligator Records called "Harp and Soul," featuring such blues gems as  "Five Long Years," "I'm Your Man" and "Alligator Shuffle." He's also due in  town Saturday night heading a blues bill at the Music Machine. . . . And a host  of local bands will perform at a benefit Wednesday at the Palace for veteran  roadie Kent Symthe, who lost a leg in a severe motorcycle crash in November.  Performers will include Belinda Carlisle, Redd Kross, the Pandoras, TSOL and  the Lame Flames (with members of Guns N' Roses).  </P></p>

The list of  enterprises was published in the republican newspapers YEGEMEN  KAZAKHSTAN [SOVEREIGN] and KAZAKHSTANSKAYA PRAVDA. These facts  were given at a news conference held by Zhanibek Karibzhanov,  chairman of the State Property Committee.    He stressed that a new, very important stage of  implementation of the massive scale privatization program is  beginning for investment funds and for floated enterprises,  which will be sold at these coupon auctions. Practically all  inhabitants of the Republic -- 96.5 percent -- have already  received their privatization check books. A new deadline was  set and check books will continue to be handed out until 1 April.    The first auction will be held on 29 April with the  participation of 109 investment funds with licences from the  State Property Committee. Their applications for participation  will be taken on 28 April from 1500 until 1800 local time. The  starting price for a share of each of the 50 enterprises will be  announced by the state committee no later than 5 April. Among  objects to be put to tender: Profitable light industry  enterprises, large construction industry, and processing  industry from the various regions of the Republic will be sold.    Similar coupon auctions, starting from May, will be held  every two weeks. Until the end of the year, at 17 auctions,  shares of 1,200 enterprises are planned to be sold for  privatization investment coupons, and shares of 2,500  enterprises -- by the end of 1995.</p>

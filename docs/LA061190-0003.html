			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BOOK REVIEW;  </P> <P> MISERY, MADNESS AND FEAR OF INCIPIENT REVOLT FROM BELOW  </P> <P> THE HOME GIRLS by Olga Masters W.W. Norton $18.95, 194 pages  </P> <P> Olga Masters is dead now, and safe; the people she bad-mouthed may stamp their  feet and shout, but they can't get to her.  </P> <P> Olga Masters got a late start writing fiction. She married at 21 and raised  seven children. Not until her 50s did she find the time to write these scalding  stories.  </P> <P> By that age, people tend to think of you as invisible (especially with all  those kids).  </P> <P> It would be as if the dog you kicked for years and years suddenly came in  through the doggy door with a press pass tucked in his collar, pulled a chair  up to his computer, shook out his paws and began to tap out a story on the keys  -- a story of a lummox dog owner who not only kicked his dog, but had bad  breath, a disgusting paunch, vile sexual habits and a dull personality.  </P> <P> You would be taken off guard if you were that dog's owner. You might feel  aggrieved. If you had known that dog would acquire both an IBM computer and a  fine narrative style, then surely you would have treated the dog better --  given him canned food to eat, and saved your brutish kicks for guinea pigs, who  surely will never learn how to write.  </P> <P> But most of all, you'd feel sad, wouldn't you? Because dogs are supposed to  love you no matter what you do, and soon you would read that during all your  years together, your furtive, frightened cur hated you with all his canine  might.  </P> <P> And so women are supposed to love the men who beat them (or at least this was  supposed to be true in the Great Depression years when most of these stories  are set), and women are supposed to love the children who rob them of their  youth. And children are supposed to love fathers who beat them (and forget to  go to work, and lie), and children should love mothers whose only delight is to  inflict misery on anyone weaker and sadder than they.  </P> <P> Olga Masters had 50 years of injustice, of poverty, of disrespect, of contempt  in her life, and she finally responded with a hatred as cold and blinding as  sleet.  </P> <P> There are 20 stories here, 18 set in rural Australia, about two-thirds of them  placed in the Great Depression. The country is not important here; the poverty  is. Reading these pieces brings back memories, or memories of other people's  stories, to the front of the brain.  </P> <P> Who, reading this review, can remember being so poor that not finishing dinner  is a dreadful, dreadful sin? Or that using a match to light a cigarette --  instead of bending over the stove to use the fire already there -- is a serious  diminishment of the family wealth? Who, reading this review, rushes to make  beds as soon as the children are out of them, because good housekeeping is the  pride, the only pride of the very poor? Who, now, irons sheets all day?  </P> <P> "The Home Girls" of the title story come from an orphanage, but everyone here  is orphaned, miserable. The men have no work, or they work as hard as slaves.  In half a dozen stories, wives go mad from the strain of their dreadful lives;  they let the kitchen fires go out, they leave breakfast and dishes on the table  for weeks at a time. They mount pitiful campaigns to keep their kids from being  beaten.  </P> <P> Most of these stories are seen through the eyes of children -- children so  starved for love that just the use of a nickname -- "Pinkie" or "Honey" or any  careless endearment -- melts their hearts.  </P> <P> It would take so little to make these children happy. But a mother on a train  tells a stranger she's going to kill her two children. And in "The Snake and  Bad Tom," a brood of brothers and sisters sell out their half-wit brother to  their father's wrath.  </P> <P> The father is a sadistic sociopath. Well, Olga Masters seems to say, aren't  they all? It's poverty that does it -- close quarters, no hope, too many  children, no money at all.  </P> <P> Perhaps no one reading this review will remember or recognize these unspeakable  circumstances. But they can read about them elsewhere, in the Metro section of  this very paper.  </P> <P> And someday the survivors of all those crimes, misfortunes and disasters will  sit down at a computer and remember. Those who abused them will be, no doubt,  the astonished -- and aggrieved.  </P> <P>  Next: Lee Dembart reviews "Discordant Harmonies: A New Ecology for the 21st  Century" by Daniel B. Botkin (Oxford University Press).  </P> <P> </P></p>

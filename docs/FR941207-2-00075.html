			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicant's Legal Analysis  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Applicants request an exemption under section 6(c) of the Act from sections 18(f)(1), 18(g), and 18(i) of the Act to the extent that the proposed issuance and sale of shares might be deemed to result in the issuance of a ``senior security'' within the meaning of sections 18(g) of the Act and therefore might be deemed to be prohibited by section 18(f)(1) and to violate the equal voting provisions of section 18(i) of the Act. Applicants believe that the proposed allocation of expenses and the voting rights in the manner described above is equitable and would not discriminate against any group of shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. Applicants also request an exemption under section 6(c) from sections 2(a)(32), 2(a)(35), 22(c), and 22(d) of the Act and rule 22c&hyph;1 thereunder, to assess and, under certain circumstances, waive or reduce a CDSC with respect to certain redemptions of shares. Applicants believe that this request would allow shareholders the option of having more investment dollars working for them from the time of their share purchases than if they invested in a class with a front-end sales load. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants' Conditions <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 1. Each class of shares will represent interests in the same portfolio of investments of a Fund and will be identical in all respects, except as set forth below. The only differences between the classes of shares of a Fund will relate solely to: (a) The impact of the Class Expenses specifically attributable to the particular class which will be limited to: fees payable pursuant to a rule 12b&hyph;1 distribution plan and/or shareholder servicing plan, if applicable; transfer agent fees as identified by the transfer agent as being attributable to a specific class; fees and expenses of a Fund's administrator that are identified and approved by the trustees or directors as being attributable to a specific class of shares; printing and postage expenses related to preparing and distributing materials such as shareholder reports, prospectuses, and proxies to current shareholders; ``blue sky'' registration fees incurred by a class of shares; SEC registration fees incurred with respect to a class; the expense of administrative personnel and services as required to support the shareholders of a specific class; litigation or other legal or audit expenses relating solely to one class of shares; trustees' or directors' fees incurred as a result of issues relating to one class of shares; and any other incremental expenses subsequently identified that should be properly allocated to one class and which are approved by the SEC pursuant to an amended order; (b) the fact that the classes will vote separately with respect to a Fund's distribution plan and/or shareholder servicing plan, if applicable, except as provided in condition 17 below; (c) the different exchange privileges of each class of shares; (d) the conversion feature applicable only to Class B shares; and (e) the different class designation of each class of shares. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The trustees or directors of a Fund, including a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors, will approve the multi-class distribution system. The minutes of the meetings of the trustees or directors of a Fund regarding their deliberations with respect to the approvals necessary to implement the multi-class distribution system will reflect in detail the reasons for their determination that the proposed multi-class distribution system is in the best interests of both a Fund and its shareholders. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 3. The initial determination of the class expenses that will be allocated to a particular class and any subsequent changes thereto will be reviewed and approved by a vote of the trustees or directors of each Fund, including a majority of the trustees or directors who are not interested persons of a Fund. Any person authorized to direct the allocation and disposition of monies paid or payable by a Fund to meet class expenses shall provide to the board of trustees or directors, and the trustees or directors shall review, at least quarterly, a written report of the amounts so expended and the purposes for which such expenditures were made. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 4. On an ongoing basis, the trustees or directors of a Fund, pursuant to their fiduciary responsibilities under the Act and otherwise, will monitor the Fund for the existence of any material conflicts between the interests of the classes of shares. The trustees or directors, including a majority of the disinterested trustees or directors, shall take such action as is reasonably necessary to eliminate any such conflicts that may develop. The adviser or distributor will be responsible for reporting any potential or existing conflicts to the trustees or directors. If a conflict arises, the adviser or distributor at its own cost will remedy such conflict by taking such steps as are necessary, up to an including establishing a new registered management investment company. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 5. Any shareholder services plan that may in the future be adopted with respect to a Fund will be adopted and operated in accordance with the procedures set forth in rule 12b&hyph;1(b) through (f) as if the expenditures made thereunder were subject to rule 12b&hyph;1, except that shareholders will not enjoy the voting rights specified in rule <!-- PJG 0034 unknown -->  12b&hyph;1. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 6. The trustees or directors of a Fund will receive quarterly and annual statements concerning distribution and shareholder servicing expenditures complying with paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of rule 12b&hyph;1, as it may be amended from time to time. In the statements, only expenditures properly attributable to the sale or servicing of a particular class of shares will be used to justify any distribution or servicing fee charged to that class. Expenditures not related to the sale or servicing of a particular class will not be presented to the trustees or directors to justify any distribution or servicing fee attributable to that class. The statements, including the allocations upon which they are based, will be subject to the review and approval of the disinterested trustees or directors in the exercise of their fiduciary duties. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 7. Dividends paid by a Fund with respect to each class of its shares, to the extent any dividends are paid, will be calculated in the same manner, at the same time, on the same day, and will be in the same amount, except that distribution and/or shareholder service payments relating to each respective class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class and any incremental transfer agency costs and other Class Expenses relating to a specific class of shares will be borne exclusively by that class. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

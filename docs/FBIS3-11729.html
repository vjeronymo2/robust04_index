			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Finance Secretary Pedro Aspe by Francisco </F> Fortuno in Mexico City on 24 March; from the "24 Hours" newscast  -- recorded]    [Text] [Fortuno] Dr. Pedro Aspe, thank you very much for  these few minutes. Sir, what can we expect in Mexican economic  matters following the events of the last few hours?    [Aspe] Well, as we all know, following these unfortunate  incidents, in which our friend Luis Donaldo Colosio was killed,  the financial sector today joined the call made by the president  of the Republic and did not operate today because of the  national mourning. International markets, where transactions are  constantly taking place, such as public debt transactions and  the issuance of stocks at the New York Stock Exchange, were  somewhat nervous at the beginning. There was a certain decrease  in the amount of transactions. Throughout the day we saw a  return to stability, and it was a pleasant surprise. This means  that markets are much more mature. Banks and the Mexican Stock  Exchange and so on will return to normal operations tomorrow.  They will open their operations as any other day. The  important thing to note is the enormous stability that is being  observed despite the tragic events. We have bigger, more  stable, and more mature markets.    [Fortuno] Sir, the reaction by the United States, especially  by President Bill Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentzen,  was to give complete support to Mexico. Could you explain this  support?    [Aspe] Certainly. As you have seen, today the president of  the United States, after talking to the president of Mexico,  issued a series of very favorable statements for Mexican  institutions.    As you know, Secretary Bentsen issued two statements. The  first one conveyed his strong support for the implementation of  President Salinas' economic policy. His second statement was an  unexpected one. We have a mutual support agreement between the  U.S. Treasury and the Mexican Finance Secretariat, and one  between the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank and the Mexican Central  Bank. For many years these mutual support agreements had been  maintained in the range of $1 billion. In an unexpected action  and following many talks and negotiations that we were finally  able to speed up today, we agreed on increasing this credit line  from $1 to $6 billion. In other words, there was a one-time  600-percent increase.    Why is this important? What is truly important is that we  have a good economic policy -- one without deficits -- a prudent  monetary policy, and an autonomous Central Bank that will begin  operating next 1 April. But in addition to this, it is  important that we have sufficient international reserves, which  fortunately we do. What we have today has been built up for  many years. It is the result of the efforts of farmers and  businessmen, as well as the government. We have large reserves.  However, this mutual support agreement means that in addition  to that level of reserves, we have an additional $6 billion to  make the markets operate in an orderly manner by avoiding any  volatile movements and to support the stabilization of the  exchange markets, and needless to say, the economy as a whole.    I had the chance to talk with Secretary Bentsen yesterday  and  today, and this decision is truly flattering because it entails  great trust and the idea that we are commercial partners with  long-term plans. Also, in short-term troublesome times, it is  mechanisms such as these that help us move closer to stability.  However, we should not forget that true stability is achieved  at home. We have been working on this stability, and this is  why we will not have a fiscal deficit in 1994 because President  Salinas is committed to turning over an economy with very low  inflation, comparable to the international inflation level, an  economy that is growing and recovering, and one that has  reserves, order, vision, and direction.    [Fortuno] This is very clear, Mr. Secretary. Many thanks.  We are very grateful.    [Aspe] Thank you. [end recording]</p>

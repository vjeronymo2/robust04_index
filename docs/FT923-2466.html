			<p>920917 FT  17 SEP 92 / Roddicks in a tough environment / Analysis of why the 'pinstriped dinosaurs' of the City took the shine off the shares in the quirky natural cosmetics group Body Shop International has always had a highly ambivalent attitude towards the pleasures and pains of being a public company. The quirky natural cosmetics group, which was first floated on the Unlisted Securities Market eight years ago, has conspicuously enjoyed the glory of having one of the highest ratings in the retail sector. But this has never stopped Mrs Anita Roddick, the group's founder and managing director, from professing that finance 'bored the pants off her' and periodically denouncing the 'pinstriped dinosaurs in Throgmorton Street' for their short-sighted obsession with profits above people. Yesterday, however, the dinosaurs bit back with a vengeance. The announcement that Body Shop's interim profits were likely to fall by 12 per cent to not less than Pounds 8m drove the company's shares down 41 per cent to close at 158p. Some retail analysts argued that the sharp reappraisal of Body Shop's share rating - although appearing highly alarming - was little more than a natural readjustment to realistic expectations. According to the forecasts of the Nomura Research Institute, Body Shop was trading on a high prospective multiple of 26 before yesterday's fall and a more realistic 19 after it, close to the stores sector's rating. 'Obviously a lot of the glamour has now gone out of the stock but we think Body Shop's problems are essentially restricted to UK sales. The international business is still doing well and there are no worries over the balance sheet,' said Mr Ian Macdougall, retail analyst at Nomura. Body Shop was floated in 1984 at a time when 'the City was positively orgasmic about the whole niche-market concept', according to Mrs Roddick. The share price, allowing for share splits, rose from just over 5p in 1984 to a high of 370p this February. Spurred on by the unprecedented consumer boom of the late 1980s and the growing wave of environmental awareness which it did so much to encourage, Body Shop expanded at a furious rate. The seemingly ubiquitous Mrs Roddick energetically projected the image of an environmentally concerned company selling jolly good soaps and peppermint foot lotions. But below the surface, Body Shop created a relatively solid management team which avoided many of the financial excesses that characterised its more reckless rivals. A group of professional managers - many of them drawn from the ranks of the big multi-nationals which the company publicly professed so much to disdain  -ensured that Body Shop was able to show greater staying power than other niche retailers in tough times. In the last financial year to February, Body Shop pre-tax profits rose 26 per cent to Pounds 25.2m when most other retailers were bleeding badly. By the year-end Body Shop had built up a network of 727 stores in 41 countries and continued to open stores at a rate of one every 2 1/2 days. Body Shop was able to expand so fast by means of franchising. This enabled the company to open outlets without incurring huge capital commitments - although gearing stood at 43 per cent at the end of last year. The obverse side of expanding by franchising became painfully apparent earlier this year when a row erupted between the parent company and Mrs Pauline Rawle, one of its biggest UK franchisees. Body Shop had to resort to the courts to regain control of six branches which it alleged had fallen into a 'deplorable condition'. The disruption to sales was one of the reasons the company cited yesterday for its likely profits fall. Worries also extend to Body Shop's pricing policy and the growing power of rival retailers in the company's core markets. But it is almost certainly too early for the City dinosaurs to begin writing the Roddicks' epitaph as they have done for the founders of so many other 1980s retail glamour stocks such as Sock Shop and Tie Rack. Nevertheless, the volatile relationship between company and City is likely to continue. A taste of the mood to come was perhaps expressed by one City analyst who said the profits' fall was little surprise to him because the company had refused to return his phone calls for a month - 'no doubt because they were communing with their karma'. 'But,' he added somewhat cruelly, 'it now appears their dogma has been run over by their karma.'</p>

			<p>920314 FT  14 MAR 92 / Election 92: Whip withdrawn from rebel MP CONSERVATIVE business managers at Westminster have withdrawn the party whip from Mr John Browne, Tory MP for Winchester, after his decision to stand against the officially selected candidate in the seat on April 9. The penalty, the ultimate sanction of whips at the Commons, means Mr Browne is no longer a member of the Parliamentary party. However it will have little impact in practice, with MPs rising for the election on Monday. Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, said in a terse letter to Mr Browne that if he were ever re-elected to parliament he would not be offered the party whip.</p>

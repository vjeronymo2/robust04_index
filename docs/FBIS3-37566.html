He headed a delegation of  deputies sent by the upper chamber of Russian parliament to  North Caucasus.    After familiarizing himself with the situation in the zone  under state of emergency, Vassily Tarasenko came to the  conclusion that the content of the conflict is mostly connected  with issues of ownership and power". Therefore, according to  him, "the main thing for Russia now is not to give each side a  little more power but establish necessary state power, for  instance, in the form of a protectorate transferring to it all  financial levers, judicial system and armed forces".    Presidents of the republics will remain, chairman of the  committee says, but practically a representative of the center  will bear all responsibility for the state of affairs. However,  if this representative exceeds his powers or violates the  all-Russian interests he will be immediately held responsible  before the center.    During their stay in the zone of the conflict, the deputies  associated with leaders of both republics, clergy, national  movements, well-known representatives of intelligentsia,  ordinary people and military men, and got convinced that all of  them agree in one thing that "Russian presence is imperative  there". Otherwise, "there will be fight in which innocent  people will die as he who starts fighting, as a rule, does not  participate in it".</p>

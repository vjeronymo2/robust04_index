			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Pretoria March 23 SAPA -- The South African Defence  Force [SADF] on Wednesday [23 March] afternoon declined to  disclose the venue of its meeting with the Pan Africanist  Congress' [PAC] military wing, the Azanian People's Liberation  Army [APLA].    The international news agency REUTERS quoted the PAC's  Deputy  Secretary-General Tobile Gola as saying the meeting -- due to  last two or three days -- was being held at a conference centre  on Pretoria's eastern outskirts.    However, SADF spokesman Col John Rolt said as far as the  SADF  was concerned the meeting was taking place at a venue in the PWV  [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] area and was expected to  last until Friday. "The SADF cannot unilaterally disclose the  venue of the meeting and therefore we still stand by our earlier  information that the meeting is held at a venue in the PWV  area," Col Rolt said.    REUTERS, in its earlier report, said the SADF and APLA met  for the first time on South African soil on Wednesday to discuss  an end to hostilities.    According to the report Mr Gola said the meeting was  expected  to cover "everything". "It deals with all issues in relation to  the future situation, the integration and the amnesty for APLA  members. They will talk about the new army," he said. "There  must be agreement on all issues. We need peace in this  country," he added.    The report also quoted SADF spokesman Nick Sendall as having  described the talks -- with about eight people on each side --  as "very exploratory". They were about "what we do, what they  do, and what we both look like". They would attempt to find  common ground for further talks, he said.</p>

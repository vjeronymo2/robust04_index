			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Department believes that the same policy reason for applying strict standards in federal court litigation in civil rights cases applies equally to the administrative process, where litigants should not be forced to abandon their right to privacy by choosing the administrative forum rather than electing, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 3612, to have the matter tried in Federal district court. The current administrative standard has been interpreted in a manner that may make it easier for respondents to obtain orders requiring aggrieved persons to submit to physical or mental examinations than would be the case in Federal court litigation. Such a situation, if allowed to continue, could lead HUD complainants to elect to have their matter heard in federal court, rather than in the administrative forum, since the differing standards would make federal courts better protectors of their privacy rights. This regulatory revision is intended to ensure that aggrieved persons who have been victims of alleged discrimination will not be victimized again by being made to undergo unjustified probing into their physical or mental condition by respondents while the Government endeavors to protect their civil rights. The regulation, however, still allows for examinations in those limited circumstances where such examinations are shown to be necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A further negative consequence of recent administrative rulings on this issue is less expeditious and more expensive discovery and hearings contrary to the dictates of 42 U.S.C. 3612(d)(1) and (2); 24 CFR 104.500(b) (1992). See  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Downs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 2 Fair Housing-Fair Lending (P-H) para. 25,234 at 25,235 n.1 (Nov. 22, 1991). The cost of expert psychiatric or psychological testimony is prohibitive in many administrative hearings. While expert testimony for both sides in Fair Housing Act cases might be necessary to the trier of fact in limited circumstances, in general the time and expense involved in their use would clash directly with Congress's mandate that discovery and hearings be conducted ``as expeditiously and inexpensively as possible''. 42 U.S.C. 3612(d)(1) and (2). See also 24 CFR 104.500(b);  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> HUD  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Downs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> , 2 Fair Housing-Fair Lending at 25,235 n.1. Recent interpretations of the current regulation, which appear to order examinations without the need for the moving party to meet strict ``in controversy'' and ``good cause'' requirements, could lead to more time-consuming and expensive administrative litigation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 3. Examination by Non-Physicians  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This final rule is revised to conform to Rule 35 in another respect as well. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 35 was revised effective December 1, 1991, subsequent to the Department's promulgation of 24 CFR 104.540 at 54 FR 3232 (Jan. 23, 1989). That revision authorized courts to require physical or mental examinations conducted by any person who is suitably licensed or certified, rather than limiting such examinations to those conducted by a physician, as under the literal language of HUD's current regulation. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

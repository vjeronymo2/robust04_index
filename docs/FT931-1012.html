			<p>930326 FT  26 MAR 93 / BBC and ABC injoint news plan THE BBC and the ABC network in the US are joining forces to create one of the largest television and radio newsgathering operations in the world. The alliance, which will involve sharing bureaux and correspondents, means new international partners for both organisations. At present ABC has links with Independent Television News and the BBC's US partner has traditionally been the NBC network. Mr Tony Hall, managing director of BBC news and current affairs, said yesterday that the agreement brought together two of the world's largest newsgatherers. 'It will lead to greater efficiencies in the field and give us access to an even wider range of news material from across the globe,' he said. The BBC has more than 50 foreign bureaux and ABC has bureaux in Europe, the Middle East and Far East. The organisations will exchange news, will co-ordinate coverage of important stories, share technical and broadcasting facilities and will explore collaboration in current affairs. The deal will ensure that ABC material is available to BBC World Service Television, which is increasingly challenging Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network in international markets. The BBC is considering launching a 24-hour television news channel in the UK although previous talks with British Sky Broadcasting about a joint venture seem to have made little progress. Most large television news organisations are seeking to cut costs while expanding their operations. Negotiations between the BBC and ABC have been under way for several months. CBS, the leading US network in terms of audience share, has also been looking for an international partner. Mr Howard Stringer, the CBS broadcasting president, has had talks with the BBC and ITN. The ABC/BBC deal may lead to more intensive talks about the possibility of CBS taking a stake in a restructured ITN.</p>

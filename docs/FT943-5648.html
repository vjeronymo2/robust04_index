			<p>940902 FT  02 SEP 94 / International Company News: Charge puts Brambles into the red Brambles, the Australian transportation group, yesterday announced a ADollars 233.2m (USDollars 171.4m) loss after tax and abnormal items for the year to end-June, a sharp reversal from the previous year's ADollars 166.1m profit. The damage was done by a ADollars 378.1m abnormal charge, already reported in the first-half and mainly due to the write-off of goodwill at Brambles' US-based waste management operation, Ensco. The company said there were no abnormal items in the second half. Operating profits before abnormals and tax for the year were ADollars 242m, slightly below the previous year's ADollars 259.2m. Brambles said, however, that second-half results were in line with expectations and it had 'reached a turning point'. Revenues were little changed at ADollars 2.74bn, against ADollars 2.71bn.</p>

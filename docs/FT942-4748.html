			<p>940608 FT  08 JUN 94 / PM rules out curb on dividends in gesture to City The prime minister has ruled out any control of dividends in an attempt to reassure the City that the Treasury's review of savings will not lead to new regulation. Mr John Major, in an interview in today's Daily Telegraph, says: 'There's no question of dividend control from a Conservative government. Dividend control is socialism. I'm a Tory - dividend control is a non-starter.' The Treasury has angered pension funds and companies such as Hanson by suggesting that UK dividend pay-outs, which have risen significantly over the past decade, may have become too high and inflexible. Lord Hanson, chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate, recently accused Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury financial secretary, of 'sounding like a socialist' in questioning the wisdom of high dividends. Mr Major, while saying that people have wrongly interpreted Mr Dorrell's aims, appears to restrict the Treasury's room for manoeuvre by dismissing the argument that high dividends prevent capital investment. 'Dividends are part of people's income, I don't want to cut people's income. It is a legitimate reward from their investment. 'Neither do I personally believe there is any real problem in stopping fresh investment. Because the dividends are paid to shareholders who reinvest,' the prime minister says in the interview. The Treasury has said it is looking at whether companies are paying high dividends because of the tax system and whether companies would continue to pay out the same level of dividend if regulations were changed. In the interview, Mr Major refuses to be drawn on 'budgetary matters' but he leaves scope to allow the Treasury to make changes to dividend taxation, which is concerning the City. However, his officials made clear that the prime minister is taking a personal interest in the Treasury's review of savings and investment and no proposed changes to the taxation system will go ahead if they are seen as curtailing dividends. Mr Major goes on to describe the Treasury's aim of greater investment as 'self-evidently attractive', since all governments want more money invested in companies and industry. In the wide-ranging interview, Mr Major also said: If it was practical and prudent he would cut taxes, but added 'I cannot forecast when that will be' People had underestimated the importance of the Downing Street Declaration on Northern Ireland.</p>

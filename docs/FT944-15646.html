			<p>941018 FT  18 OCT 94 / 'Overhang mandates' help swell Kohl's majority Chancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrat coalition, which in the early hours of the federal count had its slender majority reduced to two, managed to increase it by eight because of the 'overhang mandates', a peculiarity of the German political system. The opposition Social Democrats gained four extra seats in this way, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin. The system works as follows. If a party gains more seats on the first vote (for directly-elected individual constituency seats) than its share based on the second vote (for the party) then the number of seats is increased by the difference. These are known as 'overhang mandates'. This is done on a state-to-state basis. For example, in the case of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the CDU won seven of the nine constituencies. In the second vote, it was allocated five seats. This number reflects the state's share of the overall federal CDU party vote, which was just over 34 per cent, the equivalent of 232 seats. But since the number of seats the CDU won on the constituency level exceeded by two the number of seats available to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern CDU on the federal party list, the party still retains the right to send the seven directly-elected deputies. The extra two are known as overhang votes. Through the overhang mandate system, the CDU won extra seats in several other constituencies, which helped boost Mr Kohl's majority. These include two overhang mandates in Baden-Wurttemburg, two in Saxony-Anhalt, three in Thuringia and three in Saxony. The outgoing Bundestag had six such overhang mandates. The incoming one will have 16.</p>

The Job Training Reform Amendments of 1992 (Amendments) also introduced significant changes in the way job training programs are designed and operated at the local levels. These statutory changes, combined with recent legislative and administrative initiatives to promote high-quality, results-driven, customer-oriented services throughout the Federal Government, are not only reshaping the way JTPA delivers its services, but also how to measure its effectiveness.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> National job training objectives have remained unchanged since 1990 and focus on enhancing the long-term employability and economic self-sufficiency of those most at risk of becoming or remaining unemployed. Current measures of the program's progress in achieving these objectives relate directly to near-term employment and earnings levels of adult program completers and levels of employment and skill enhancements of youth program completers. These outcomes do not, by themselves, measure the quality of the services received or the extent to which the program is able to improve upon participants' prior employment, earnings and welfare dependency. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For this reason, the Department will be undertaking a comprehensive review of its performance standards over the next year to examine alternative program measures and more cost efficient ways of assessing the program's long-term effects on its graduates. Ongoing surveys of JTPA's customers will also provide invaluable feedback on how helpful JTPA services are to its users, what other services are needed but not provided by the program, and the extent to which good outcomes are related to levels of customer satisfaction. Finally, the Employment and Training Administration will initiate a nationwide JTPA Report Card that will highlight programs showing the greatest returns on their human resource investments in terms of obtaining high-quality employment for those participants most at-risk of failure. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Outcome measures for Title II&hyph;A and C will be retained until this performance standards review is completed. Numerical levels for these core standards have been updated to reflect the most recent JTPA program experience. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

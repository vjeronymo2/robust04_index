			<p>940830 FT  30 AUG 94 / Belgrade ignores Bosnian Serb vote With diplomatic efforts under way to broker an agreement on supervision of Serbia's borders with Bosnia, Serbian leaders yesterday pointedly ignored the defiant vote of their one-time Bosnian proteges who decided in a weekend referendum to reject a UN-backed partition of Bosnia. After a marathon meeting lasting until early yesterday morning with President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia, Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russia's foreign minister, continued a diplomatic tour of former Yugoslavia, and met leaders of the Moslem-led Bosnian government. The Belgrade meeting remained shrouded in secrecy yesterday but diplomats believe Mr Milosevic was trying to see what concessions he could wring from Russia and the West in exchange for stationing monitors on the frontier with Bosnia. Serbia imposed economic sanctions on the Bosnian Serbs earlier this month for their refusal to endorse a peace plan. They believe the international community is keen to give the impression that Mr Milosevic is not under international pressure to put monitors on the border. This would ease nationalists' charges about betraying their kith and kin in Bosnia. The contact group - Russia, the US, Germany, France and the UK - is hoping that Mr Milosevic will tighten the noose round the Bosnian Serbs. But reports that he had proposed monitors on Bosnia's frontiers with Croatia too were dismissed as a 'non-starter'. The US has threatened to lift its embargo on arms sales to the warring parties in Bosnia if Bosnian Serbs continue to block the peace plan, but the Bosnian Moslem government has been bolstering its army with weapons smuggled through Croatia. Mr Milosevic's resolve to punish Bosnian Serb leaders may harden after referendum results from Serb areas in Bosnia yesterday, which showed that the partition maps proposed by the contact group had been overwhelmingly rejected. The results of the poll - dismissed as irrelevant by peace mediators - came as no surprise. While diplomats admit that the referendum may further entrench the Bosnian Serb leadership, they say it will have little impact on the peace process. More than 90 per cent of Bosnian Serb voters rejected the maps which divide the war-torn country roughly in half, said Mr Petko Cancar, head of the referendum commission.</p>

The general said he fully agrees with the major changes  the country requires to become an exemplary nation and that he  has no doubt that difficult work lies ahead. He will even have  to improve Disip's public image. He is aware of the difficult  times facing Venezuela and says he will make a huge effort to  perform the duties he has as a citizen of a nation that needs  him.    [Begin Rivas recording] I will try to wage a straightforward  struggle against crime, to be loyal to President Rafael Caldera,  and to strongly defend democracy and its institutions. I will  do my best to reach the primary goals, and above all, I will  work hard, especially in creative endeavors. I will work as  part of a team. We have good workers. As in every other  organization, we will reorganize what must be reorganized and  will leave untouched the good things we have. We have a very  good technical team. [end recording]    The new Disip director said his goal is not to fire workers  indiscriminately but to work hard. He will also respect human  rights but will be tough on crime.</p>

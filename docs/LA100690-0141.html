			<p><P> October 6, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY;  </P> <P> CRASH KILLS WOMAN AFTER BIRTHDAY PARTY  </P> <P> A 28-year-old Anaheim woman who had just celebrated her birthday with friends  died in an early morning car crash Friday.  </P> <P> Lori Hrifko spent Thursday evening celebrating with friends at a restaurant in  Newport Beach and was driving her 1985 Nissan 300 SX, loaded with presents and  flowers, home when she lost control and hit a tree at about 12:15 a.m., police  said.  </P> <P> The woman was on the northbound San Diego Freeway off-ramp at Brookhurst Street  when her car veered to the left, said California Highway Patrol Officer Lyle  Whitten.  </P> <P> When she tried to straighten the car out, she overcompensated and ran off the  right side, hitting a tree, Whitten said.  </P> <P> Police found a broken, unlit cigarette on the seat of the car and believe  Hrifko may have been distracted trying to light it when she veered off the  off-ramp.  </P> <P> "She was going much too fast in order to take that ramp safely," Whitten said,  estimating her speed at 55 m.p.h.  </P> <P> "It looks like something distracted her attention. She may have been reaching  for a match when she hit the curb, then just overcompensated to the right.  There was no other visible reason why she couldn't have stayed in control,"  Whitten said.

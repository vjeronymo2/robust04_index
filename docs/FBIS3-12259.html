['Abd-Rabbuh] Actually, there will be a great impact because  the first thing we now want from the world and from the Israeli  side is not just words of denunciation and condemnation. We are  waiting for two urgent measures: the first is a Security  Council meeting and the adoption of measures stressing the  illegality of the construction and presence of settlements on  Palestinian land. The second is the immediate disarming of the  settlers because these criminal gangs--gangs of  murderers--represent a time bomb threatening and undermining any  steps toward peace.    [Al-Hashani] Has the PLO received response from any Western  countries to holding a Security Council session?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Some preliminary responses have been received  by noon today and we expect some more...    [Al-Hashani, interrupting] Were they positive?    ['Abd-Rabbuh] Some were positive and we are waiting for  other  responses.</p>

			<p>930223 FT  23 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Queens Moat Houses Queens Moat's agreement to convert another eight hotels into Holiday Inn franchises is a sensible, if modest, step in its quest to improve room usage rates with the barest possible capital outlay. By tapping into Holiday Inn's international reservations network, Queens Moat aims to increase its occupancy rates from 65 per cent to more than 70 per cent. Its experience of running 19 Holiday Inn hotels in mainland Europe shows this to be feasible. Queens Moat shareholders would doubtless be pleased if their company could extend the arrangement, as suggested in yesterday's announcement. Investors in Bass, though, may balk at too great an entanglement, given Queens Moat's stretched balance sheet. The market was certainly relieved that Bass did not buy an equity stake, as had been rumoured. The far bigger challenge facing Queens Moat, however, is to drive down its borrowings, which may have escalated to close to Pounds 1bn by the year-end. The company cannot rely on trading income alone to make much of a dent in its debt. A rights issue seems impractical, given Queen Moat's profligacy with paper in the past. Asset disposals will remain tricky until the property market perks up. An additional worry is Queens Moat's heavy exposure to mainland Europe. Although this helped protect the company during the UK downturn, it may act as a drag on the share price just as recovery starts in its domestic market.</p>

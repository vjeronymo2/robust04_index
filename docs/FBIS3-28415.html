The fact that  Kim Il-song is personally handling state affairs has been  verified by visitors to the North. Kim Yong-chu, who returned as  a Political Bureau member, said that the succession to power  will not take place until Kim Il-song dies. In addition, as is  known, a resolution concerning the delay of succession to power  was adopted at a session of the Workers' Party of Korea [WPK]  Political Bureau in October 1993.    It has been learned that Reverend Billy Graham, based on  talks with President Kim Il-song during his recent visit to  Pyongyang, had an impression that Kim Il-song is personally  handling the nuclear issue more attentively than before and is  surely controlling state affairs.    According to an intelligence source, during his visit to  North Korea Rev. Graham presented gifts to President Kim Il-song  and Kim Chong-il and received a present in return from Kim  Il-song, but not from Kim Chong-il. When Rev. Graham visited  Pyongyang in March 1992, he received gifts, including return  presents, from both Kim Il-song and Kim Chong-il.    When Rev. Graham visited in 1992, President Kim frequently  mentioned Kim Chong-il, but he was never mentioned during this  visit. Moreover, he appeared to be avoiding mentioning Kim  Chong-il. This information, confirmed by close associates of  Rev. Graham, evokes speculation that certain abnormalities might  have been ignited in the succession to power in North Korea.    The atmosphere of Rev. Graham's visit to North Korea gives  an  impression that the situation has changed from the past and that  the responsible figure for state affairs is Kim Il-song himself.  Besides, sources on North Korean affairs confirmed that the  party Political Bureau meeting in October 1993 adjusted the  schedule of Kim Chong-il's succession to power.    A foreign news report noted that Kim Yong-chu -- who at one  time, it was learned, was nominated as successor to Kim Il-song  but disappeared from the power structure then returned to the  Political Bureau last year, said in a conversation with  diplomats from the third world that "Kim Chong-il will retain  the posts of secretary of the Workers' Party and supreme  commander of the People's Army until Kim Il-song dies." His  remarks mean Kim Chong-il's early succession to power will be  denied and suggest that something abnormal is occurring in the  succession to power.    Relevant officials observe that such a trend remarkably  differs from the remarks made by Kim Il-song in an interview  with THE WASHINGTON TIMES on 12 April 1992, when he said:  "Secretary Kim Chong-il is controlling the overall national  administration."    However, phenomena totally denying such observations have  been published by the North Korean press and mass media.    Since the beginning of this year, the North Korean press  has intensified its idolization campaign of Kim Chong-il, which  has even surpassed the idolization campaign of Kim Il-song. In  addition, Kim Il-song's New Year address, which has been  repeatedly broadcast on several occasions each year in the past,  was repeated only once this year. Thus, broadcasts related to  Kim Il-song have been reduced. On the contrary, intelligence  organizations have noted that the propaganda campaign on Kim  Chong-il's greatness and events inspiring loyalty to Kim  Chong-il have increased.    Concerning such two contradictory trends, relevant  high-ranking government officials and experts in North Korean  affairs cautiously put forward a hypothesis that "the schedule  of power succession is being readjusted and early succession  will be delayed."    They said: It is apparent that a session of the North Korean  Workers' Party Political Bureau on 18 October 1993 adopted a  resolution that Kim Chong-il temporarily retreat from the seat  of power and Kim Il-song again control the national  administration.    The intensive changes in the power structure, which took  place after the Supreme People's Assembly conference in December  1993, have aroused constant speculation concerning the change in  Kim Chong-il's position.    This speculation is based on the fact that Kim Yong-chu has  returned to power as a Political Bureau member and vice  president; Kim Yong-sun, secretary of the Workers' Party in  charge of South Korean affairs and close associate of Kim  Chong-il, was relieved from the post; and Kim Tal-hyon, vice  premier and chairman of the State Planning Commission, was  reassigned to a manager of a vinalon enterprise.    Viewing this, it is observed the present atmosphere  indicates  that by reshuffling his close associates, Kim Chong-il was  called to account for handling the national administration and  his early succession to power, which has been constantly raised  in the past, has become void.    In view of the characteristics in the power structure within  the North Korean system, adjustment of the schedule of power  succession is not meant to basically shake the structure of  succession and power organization, but to make Kim Il-song  appear as the seat of power to handle overall state affairs for  the time being. As a result, it is likely that even after Kim  Chong-il's retreat from the present position of power, a  propaganda campaign for him will be intensified in the future,  thus showing dual trends.</p>

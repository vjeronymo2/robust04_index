			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["Press Review" -- ITAR-TASS headline] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 3 TASS -- ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI, referring  to reliable sources, report an intention of the Russian  government to raise the minimum wage index by 40 percent from  July 1. Minimum wage will thus grow from 14,620 to 20,500  roubles. The same indexation coefficient will be applied to the  recalculation of wages in the budget-supported branches of the  economy.    ROSSIYSKIYE VESTI reports a statement by Russian  Vice-Premier  Yuriy Yarov that mass unemployment in the country threatens with  such a social outburst in comparison with which "the  consequences of hyperinflation would pale into insignificance".  If ways to resolve the problem are not found now, "the  situation will run out of control soon," he maintains.    RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA carries a series of articles about a  Bogychany hydropower station which has been under construction  on Angara River since 1976. It follows from an article by First  Vice-Premier Oleg Soskovets that the hydropower station will be  a highly effective one because it will operate at the place of  the Angara discharge regulated by Lake Baykal and Bratsk  man-made lake and will make it possible to effect a saving of  more than 5.5 tonnes of scarce organic fuel every year. It is  essential to take all measures to bring the station into  operation in 1997, Soskovets writes.    TRUD runs an article by Sergey Tsvetkov, chairman of the  ecological commission of the writers' union of St. Petersburg,  who urges a cancellation of the Russian governemnt instruction  to build transportation technology facilities in the gulf of  Finland. Tsvetkov maintains that an expert conlusion simply  baffles one with contradictions. "Of course, the development of  Russia is impossible without harbours, but at what price will  they be created? And who can prove what will be cheaper -- to  transport goods via the Baltics or our own ports?" the article  points out.    KRASNAYA ZVEZDA (RED STAR) points out the need to complete  the construction of a nuclear-powered guided missle cruiser  Peter the Great. "We need the Peter the Great cruiser to speak  to the United States, which regards its Navy as `the only one  dominating the world ocean', on a par, and to prevent a final  collapse of the Russian Federation's shipbuilding industry. The  cruiser should be commissioned without fail by the tercentenary  of the Russian Navy," the newspaper emphasises.    The press highlights South Korean President Kim Young-Sam's  visit to Moscow. NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA reports the visit under  the headlines "The Kremlin Is Prepared To Support Sanctions  Against the DPRK" and "Russia Needs a United and Non-Nuclear  Korea".    Touching upon President Boris Yeltsin's meeting with his  South Korean counterpart, the newspaper writes: "The fact that  Seoul needed such a meeting not less but even more than Moscow  was confired by the two presidents' talks and by the ensuing  joint press conference in the Kremlin. South Korea in principle  received what it wanted from Russia. Notwithstanding tentative  reservations, Boris Nikolayevich in the end uttered the word  `sanctions' (against North Korea)".    NEZAVISIMAYA GAZETA carries an interview with Yevgeniy  Kozhokin, director of the Russian Institute for Strategic  Studies, who calls for refraining from intellectual extremism.  Pointing out that the task of the institute is to participate  in the elaboration of Russia's national security concept,  Kozhokin examines whether it is worthwhile for Russia to join  NATO's Partnership for Peace programme, "it seems to me that we  shall be able to uphold our national interests more effectively  by accepting, not rejecting, this partnership".    PRAVDA runs an article by Viktor Veshnyakov, a deputy to the  State Duma, who opposes Russia's joining NATO's Partnership for  Peace programme. This kind of ideas, he believes, "erode the  collective security treaty which CIS countries concluded in  1992". Veshnyakov favours the establishment of an effective  defence union within the CIS framework as "the military basis of  a Euro-Asian collective security system". He calls for Russia  to hold arms reduction talks with NATO precisely from these  positions.    PRAVDA carries an article by Gennadiy Zyuganov, a State Duma  member and chairaman of the central executive committee of the  Russian Communist Party, who urges "the restoration of genuine  government by the people as represented by a single system of  councils of people's deputies".    KOMSOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA, referring to information from a  general  staff officer, reports the existence of "a huge underground town  near Moscow, with several thousand civilians and military people  working there every day -- state security, interior ministry,  and army people. The subterranean town is tens of meters below  ground, sometimes to a depth equalling to a 10-15 storey  building sometimes. If necessary it is possible to get by  special trains to practically any point of the capital."</p>

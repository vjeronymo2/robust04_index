Sethuraman: "`Super 301' To Stay Despite GATT </F> Accord"]    [Text] The Clinton Administration, which subordinates the  economic interests of other nations to its own, is confident  that the Uruguay Round Final Accord in no way limits its ability  to use its legislative "trade arsenal," especially Section 301  and its own anti-dumping and counterveiling duty laws.    US undoubtedly stands to gain the most from the Final Accord  for its agriculture, businesses, services other than financial,  and the economy in general. It has enumerated the benefits for  agriculture (with the phasing-in of global farm supports by way  of reductions in tariffs for market access, export subsidies and  internal supports) as well as gains for US pharmaceuticals,  construction equipment and the electronics sector.    Yet, a US administration `Fact Sheet' claims that  cross-retaliation, between sectors, would be possible if a  settlement procedure in the Accord would also not weaken US  trade laws or change the way it uses Section 301. "Our  negotiators made sure of that," it contends.    In textiles and clothing, where the developing countries had  merely to be satisfied with the phase integration of the  restrictive quota-based multi-fibre arrangement (MFA) over a  10-year period, with significant liberalisation back-loaded, US  has given notice that exporting countries would not receive  increased quota growth (in the intervening period) unless and  until they submit schedules which would open their markets and  bind their tariffs.    Although this approach is strongly opposed by several  textile-exporting countries--and India stood its position till  the end--US and the European Union propose to seek an amendment  to the textile and clothing text to "directly link the phase-out  of MFA with opening of markets by exporting countries."    While maintaining that several of its key objectives in the  Uruguay Round have been met in areas like anti-dumping,  procurement (to facilitate US bidding for goods and services  contracts), and intellectual property besides agriculture, the  Clinton Administration expects greater use of Section 301 in  areas not covered but where countries "do not meet their Uruguay  Round commitments."    Some American economists and trade analysts question the  assumptions of the Administration in regard to the use of  bilateral weapons after the Final Act of the Uruguay Round comes  into effect from January 1, 1995 as scheduled at present.    In any case, trade tensions, already at a peak with  countries  like Japan and China, are not likely to lower in the near  future, US is also likely to step up its anti-dumping actions.  The Commerce Department has ruled that companies in India and  Taiwan are dumping forged stainless steel flanges on the US  market.    Earlier, US had imposed anti-dumping duty on imports of  steel  pipes and tubes and sulfanilic acid imports from India. Trade  Commission has made a final determination of dumping involving  levy of 48.8 per cent duty affecting over seven million dollars  of imports from India. At the same time, US is pushing for more  "tied aid" loans by the Export-Import Bank for subsidising US  exports to Asian countries.    A major disappointment for US in the just-concluded Uruguay  Round was the failure to include financial services, like  banking and insurance, along with audiovisual and maritime  services, in the Accord. Given its stake in the 900 billion  dollar services market, the US Administration has decided to try  bilateral negotiations over the next two years, and if  unsuccessful by January 1, 1996, it would block firms of  countries like Japan, Korea and many developing countries from  expanding their services in US.    The hope is that though MFN exemptions would be obtained for  banking and other financial services, including insurance, for  an initial period, it would be able to pressure other countries  to open financial markets and put in place a solid set of  commitments in this vital area of interest to American services.</p>

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / Arts: Time to swat the fly on the wall - Christopher Dunkley seeks a change of direction in TV documentaries It is time the phrase 'fly-on-the-wall documentary' was banished. You can live for weeks with a fly on the wall and not notice it, but having a film crew in the kitchen is like living with an elephant; you cannot ignore it. Far from being inconspicuous, the camera crew, even with modern lightweight equipment, becomes the focus of activity wherever it goes. It is nearly 40 years since Lindsay Anderson, Karel Reisz and Tony Richardson started the documentary movement known as 'free cinema', and more than 20 years since Roger Graef, in making The Space Between Words for BBC2, made cameraman Charles Stewart shoot countless empty magazines before loading film, in order to make the presence of the crew in home, factory and so on seem so familiar as to be forgotten. Then came The Family, Paul Watson's 'elephant-on-the-floor' series about the Wilkins of Reading and, more recently, Watson's reprise, this time in Australia, with the astounding Noelene in Sylvania Waters. The latest example is The Living Soap, a weekly BBC2 series which started last October and documents the lives of six students sharing a house in Manchester. There have been 20 episodes, but now the series is being virtually abandoned. There are plans for just two future documentaries in a more conventional style to round things off. The series was promoted as a 'fly-on-the-wall soap-umentary' and it was the topical and continuing nature of the production which caused difficulties. Where most series are shot in their entirety, edited and then screened, The Living Soap was shooting and screening as life continued, and the outside world began to intrude. Stones were thrown through the window of one of the black students. A story about the sex life of one of the girls was sold to The Sun. Those living in the house found themselves suddenly famous, unable to go to the pub or a lecture without being pestered by their viewers. The strain began to tell and, unsurprisingly, half the students walked out. It is hard to avoid the feeling that the hybrid techniques being used to film were hindering rather than helping. Sometimes the camera behaved as a supposedly discreet onlooker, but at other times the students directly addressed the camera crew. Even more riskily, one room had a robot camera which the students could use to go behind one another's backs to explain or complain. But that is incidental. The important point is that although the fly-on-the-wall technique is presented to us as a means of getting at the truth about the way the subjects of a programme live, its true significance is as a means of getting the programme makers into the lives of the subjects. If your object is the most honest and accurate portrayal of life, you would almost certainly get closest to this by moving in for six months with those concerned and then writing a drama. But imagine Paul Watson telling Noelene, 'I'd like to come and live with you for six months then write a play about you'. It has none of the seductive power of 'Can I bring in a camera crew to film everything you do?' BBC1 recently screened Torvill and Dean: Facing the Music, a documentary presumably intended to capitalise on Olympic gold and set the scene for the World Championships. As we know, T &amp; D won bronze and decided to abandon their revived 'amateur' career. Yet that scarcely weakened the appeal. Here was a programme which never pretended to be anything but a contrived artefact, which is as it should be since it was made by one of Britain's best documentary producers Edward Mirzoeff. The script was important, the music counted, the distance of the camera from the subject was sometimes critical and, above all, the entire package was edited with tremendous care. The juxtaposition of sequences was often crucial. Mirzoeff's own perceptions and sensibilities were clearly involved. The cutting between partner and spouse, the way in which the now celebrated training session was shot, with Dean's heavy handedness producing Torvill's tears, was carefully thought out. In the sense that it was so calculatedly crafted this was half way towards the condition of a drama: no one was pretending here that the footage was untouched by human mind. It is conceivable that further truths might have been brought out by going the whole hog and creating an actual drama ('Art is a lie that tells us the truth,' said Picasso), but then you would have lost the authenticity and impact that come from the real people. It is difficult to foresee a time when there will be a satisfactory substitute for this sort of classic documentary. That said, the improvement in picture and sound quality available from camcorders - and their shrinking cost - has led to a new form of television exemplified excellently by Video Nation. Produced by the BBC's 'access' outfit, the Community Programme Unit, they have given cameras to 55 widely assorted people in Britain who are recording aspects of their own lives. So far we have seen a compilation called Money Money Money in which the participants all covered that subject, and a sequence of much briefer clips involving a variety of topics. It might be thought that by cutting out the professional camera crew you must get closer to the truth, and taking these contributions individually it seems almost certain that you do, though people are capable of lying even to themselves of course. But Money Money Money vividly illustrated the fact that editing can be far more important than any individual contribution. The general impression left by this programme was not of a country now preponderantly middle class, with more people better off than ever before, but of contrasting extremes, with the emphasis on the unemployed and the poor. Nothing much wrong with that, but it does highlight an important truth: that the intention of the programme maker is 10 times more significant the technique.</p>

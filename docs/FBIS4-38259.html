			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Negotiations on autonomy issues not yet  concluded, such as elections for the Palestinian council, got  under way this morning at the Eretz checkpoint in the Gaza  Strip. This is the first time the sides have met for formal  talks since the introduction of self-rule in Gaza and Jericho.  Jack Katzenell reports:    [Begin recording] [Katzenell] The talks ended a short while  ago. Major General Rothschild came out, and he said there would  be another meeting next week. He said he had not engaged in  negotiations proper, merely preparations, discussions of a wide  range of subjects, problems that had cropped up, and things that  had to be discussed.    I asked him if there was any truth in the report that Prime  Minister Yitzhaq Rabin was unwilling to proceed to the next  stage of the autonomy until the Palestinians had proven  themselves in the area of civilian administration.    [Rothschild] Well, the fact that I am here, dealing with Dr.  Nabil Sha'th on issues of the continuation of the peace process,  shows you that Israel will do whatever is needed as far as the  DOP [Declaration of Principles] is concerned.    [Katzenell] When the group convened this morning, Minister  of the Environment Yosi Sarid was also present. His meeting  with Nabil Sha'th was more like a reunion of old friends. When  Sarid came out, he was asked by a reporter when Nabil Sha'th  would be visiting Jerusalem:    [Sarid] There is no problem. Jerusalem is a free city, open  city, and the only problem is to coordinate Dr. Nabil Sha'th's  visit in Jerusalem. The problem is in coordination. [passage  omitted] [end recording]    [A related report on Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at  1000  GMT on 28 June adds: "Dr. Nabil Sha'th says he advised Yasir  'Arafat to postpone his arrival in the autonomy territories  because having visited Jericho himself, he realized that the  local security arrangements are inadequate."    [The report adds that Gen. Rothschild said "that in his  meeting with Sha'th, a decision was made to expedite the  resumption of the negotiations on the transfer of civilian  powers in Judaea and Samaria to the Palestinians."]    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 1005 GMT on 28 June  carries a report on an interview with Chief of Staff Ehud Baraq  by Army affairs correspondent Karmela Menashe, adding that  "Baraq said that the implementation of the agreement in Gaza is  making good progress." "In response to a question on whether  Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahaq has ended his role as head of the Israeli  delegation, Baraq said: Do not worry. Gen. Shahaq was not, is  not, and will not be removed from this activity. Who will  conduct the talks in Judaea and Samaria? we asked. The  composition of the delegation and the way it will be managed  will be determined by the government, along with the details as  to what will be discussed and when. Gen. Shahaq completed an  important circle in the signing of the agreement, and he will  continue to follow and coordinate the activities of the various  IDF branches vis-a-vis the Palestinians. On the practical,  civilian level, contacts will be managed by Maj. Gen. Dani  Rothschild, coordinator of government activities in the  territories. On issues regarding the security committee, in  which the Planning Branch takes part, the talks will be managed  by Maj. Gen. 'Uzi Dayan."]</p>

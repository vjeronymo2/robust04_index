			<p><P> September 20, 1989, Wednesday, Orange County P.M. Final  </P> <P> LOCAL;  </P> <P> SUSPECT IN EARLIER ROBBERY DIES IN ORANGE, SANTA ANA POLICE CHASE  </P> <P> A suspect in a children's clothing store robbery two weeks ago died early today  after he was shot by Santa Ana police while attempting to flee, authorities  said.  </P> <P> It was unclear whether the suspect, identified as Ernest Henry Nunez, 31, of  Orange, was armed or threatening officers when he was shot. As is standard  procedure in police officer shootings, the Orange County District Attorney's  office is investigating, police said.  </P> <P> The incident began at 10:02 p.m. Tuesday when Orange Police officers spotted a  Toyota driven by a woman whose passenger was thought to be Nunez, a possible  suspect in a Sept. 5 robbery of a Kids' Mart store in that city, Santa Ana  Police Sgt. Art Echternacht said. Officers confirmed that the passenger was  Nunez and requested assistance from Santa Ana police for "a felony car stop" as  the auto entered that city, he said.  </P> <P> The vehicle was southbound on Harbor Boulevard and turned left onto Camille  Street as Santa Ana and Orange police vehicles followed, Echternacht said. The  car slowed along the curb in the residential neighborhood, he said.  </P> <P> With the car still moving, Nunez jumped out and attempted to flee, Echternacht  said.  </P> <P> "The officers yelled at Nunez to stop, which he ignored," Echternacht said. "A  single shot was fired from a shotgun by one of the Santa Ana officers, striking  Nunez, who fell to the ground, and he was taken into custody."  </P> <P> Nunez was taken to UCI Medical Center, where he underwent surgery and died  about 3:45 a.m., Echternacht said. The officer who fired the shot was placed on  three-day paid administrative leave, which includes psychological counseling,  according to department policy. His name was not released.  </P></p>

			<p>940813 FT  13 AUG 94 / Markets: Insurers fail to inspire - Bottom Line Three of the UK's largest insurance companies reported impressive results for the first half of 1994 this week - but their managers can be forgiven if they feel aggrieved by the market's less than enthusiastic reaction. General Accident (pre-tax profits of Pounds 203.2m against a forecasted Pounds 177m-Pounds 200m) saw its share price marked down 40p over the week, and Commercial Union (which posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 181m, at the top of the expected range) was rewarded with a rise of only 12p to 562p. Royal Insurance did better, but it is the lowest rated of the composites. Its share price rose by 17p to close at 279p, after UK results described by chief executive, Mr Richard Gamble, as its 'best ever'. 'Most analysts' forecasts were blown out of the water but the markets' reaction has been niggardly,' said Paul Hodges, analyst with James Capel. The response seems all the more surprising because the shares of composite insurance companies have underperformed the Footsie index in the last year and appear under rated. By Thursday night insurers were on a dividend yield of 5.32 compared to a market average of 3.78, while the sector's price earnings ratio - measured on the basis of its historic performance - amounted to only 9.61, compared to 18.92 for the market. Underpinning the cool response is the perception that the industry's pricing cycle has reached its peak and that current buoyant levels of profitability could soon begin to erode as prices fall. In particular the markets are concerned by signs of price competition, especially in the motor market, where a new breed of telephone insurance companies, led by Direct Line, is making rapid inroads. Some analysts fear that these pressures will gradually feed through into other parts of the market, dampening the profitability achieved after increases in rates and the introduction of more selective underwriting. This week's results indicate such fears may have been overplayed. Profits from the home insurance market were particularly good, for example. This was partly the result of kinder weather which meant fewer claims for storm and subsidence damage. But it could indicate that the direct writers, which are currently attacking the home insurance market, may experience more difficulty in winning market share than they have done in the motor market. 'People generally show more inertia in changing their home insurance policy from year to year, compared with changing their motor insurer,' says Youssef Ziai, analyst with Morgan Stanley. In addition Ziai says that in some parts of the market - such as commercial property, for example - premium rates are still increasing and he expects competition from European companies and Lloyd's syndicates to be muted. Analysts also suggest that the industry's balance sheet is not strong enough to support rate competition. Falls in the fixed income and equity markets, have knocked several points off the solvency margins of the composites. 'The balance sheets of all the companies have been seriously eroded. There is no excess capital,' says Hodges. Hodges and Ziai both expect the present period of profitability to be sustained beyond 1995 and the subsequent downturn to be less sharp. 'If UK insurers are looking at a long period of healthy results, their share prices should be higher than they currently are,' says Hodges. 'Investors do not seem prepared to believe that healthy profits will persist.' Nevertheless it is not difficult to find sceptics. Steven Bird, analyst with Smith New Court and the most prominent of the bearish commentators, believes competition will intensify. He insists that UK trading margins - the companies made underwriting profits of between 16p and 27p for each pound of home insurance premium income, for example - are simply unsustainable and that, outside the UK, returns on capital are generally unimpressive. 'I can't think of any reason other than possible bid talk for these shares to rise significantly,' says Bird.</p>

The Employer is a New York corporation engaged in the business of processing and marketing canned vegetables and fruit, with its corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California. The Employer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Del Monte Foods Company (DMFC), a Maryland corporation. On behalf of its employees and those of its affiliates, the Employer sponsors both of the Plans, which are defined contribution pension plans providing for individual participant accounts (the Accounts) and participant-directed investment of the Accounts. As of December 31, 1993, the Plans had approximately 3,730 participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 2. The Plans' assets are held in a master trust (the Master Trust) of which the trustee is the Merrill Lynch Trust Company of California (the Trustee). The named fiduciary of each Plan is the Del Monte Investment Committee (the Committee), which consists of five employees of the Employer appointed by the Employer's board of directors. The Committee designates the investment options into which the Plans' participants may direct the investment of their Accounts. The Plans currently offer five investment options, one of which is the Interest Income Fund (the I Fund), which invests in, among other things, guaranteed investment contracts issued by insurance companies. As of December 31, 1993, the I Fund represented approximately 54 percent of the fair market value of the assets of the Master Trust. The assets of the I Fund include guaranteed investment contract No. CG01300B3A (the GIC). The GIC was issued to the Plans on or about December 1, 1990 by Executive Life Insurance Company of California (Executive Life) as part of an arrangement whereby Executive Life agreed to ``clone'' a contract previously held by the Plans' predecessor plans (the Predecessor Plans), in connection with the sale of the Employer to DMFC in 1990 and the Employer's agreement that the Plans would assume the assets and liabilities of the Predecessor Plans. The GIC is a benefit-responsive contract permitting withdrawals for plan benefits, loans, and participant-directed reallocations among investment options under the Plans, and was issued in the principal amount of $3,899,130.43, with a guaranteed simple annual interest rate of 9.22 percent (the Contract Rate) to the July 1, 1993 maturity date.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

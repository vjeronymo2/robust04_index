"I think that we need to expand the area from where we  recruit our players, and that's what I'm trying to do this year."  </P> <P> He said he has a good shot at the two or three players he needs to upgrade the  defense and get more consistent shooting from the bench.  </P> <P> Five of the Lions' current reserves averaged less than 2.5 points and 2.5  rebounds per game, Corman said, adding that poor rebounding hurt the team the  most.  </P> <P> The season started with high hopes for the Lions, who were coming off their  best year (17-11) since Corman took over, though they faced a tougher schedule.  </P> <P> "We played well the first half of the season," he said. "Once we hit the  conference, though, things began to fall apart."  </P> <P> Early in conference play, the Lions were challenging for first place. But they  didn't finish strongly, especially having problems on the road, and finished at  .500 in the WCC, a distant third behind St. Mary's.  </P> <P> Corman said the team often wasn't ready to play and seemed distracted on the  court.  </P> <P> The core of that team will be back next year, including its two scoring  leaders: two-time all-conference guard Kristen Bruich, who averaged 14.3 points  per game, and guard Lynn Flanagan, who averaged 12.4. Bruich also led the team  with five assists and four steals per game.  </P> <P> A disappointment, Corman said, was the play of 6-3 junior center Tricia Gibson.  She averaged nine points and 6.6 rebounds per game -- virtually the same as the  previous year -- but was expected to do more.  </P> <P> This year, Corman said, he hoped that Gibson would assert herself offensively,  but she was slowed by injuries most of the season, though she still set a  school record for blocked shots.  </P> <P> No players have been cut, but there will be competition for spots on the team  next year, Corman said.  </P> <P> "One of two things is going to happen next year," he said. "The first is that  the current players will come back with an attitude that will allow them to  focus on basketball. The second is that they will again be distracted by things  outside of basketball and not be ready to contribute."  </P></p>

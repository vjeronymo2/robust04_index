			<p>930402 FT  02 APR 93 / Deficit damages Brazil pact hope BRAZIL'S Congress approved the federal budget for this year late on Wednesday, after the most tempestuous negotiations of recent times. But government officials are forecasting a budget deficit of the equivalent of Dollars 10bn, which would destroy hopes of a new accord with the International Monetary Fund or any early reduction of inflation, now at 27 per cent a month. The Treasury showed a deficit of Dollars 400m last month - the first for more than two years and underlining the parlous state of the country's finances. Also, the Dollars 234bn budget, formulated last August, includes no provision for a court-ordered 147 per cent increase in state pensions or a newly approved 33 per cent wage rise for government employees. The main expense is service of the government's Dollars 136bn domestic debt. This will consume 65 per cent of the budget. Analysts say that the primary surplus of 2.1 per cent of GDP last year was achieved largely by deferring spending.</p>

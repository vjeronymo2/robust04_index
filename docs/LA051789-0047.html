			<p><P> May 17, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SERIES OF ERRORS ON TANKER LED TO SPILL, PANEL IS TOLD  </P> <P> As the Exxon Valdez approached a hazardous midnight passage between rock reefs  and floating icebergs in Prince William Sound, a series of errors aboard the  supertanker began compounding, leading to the worst oil spill in U.S. history,  a federal board of inquiry was told Tuesday.  </P> <P> Not only was the captain away from the bridge, there was no lookout stationed  on the bow, the depth alarm was not working and the ship was increasing --  rather than reducing -- speed. At times the ship was on automatic pilot, a  condition normally reserved for operations in the open sea.  </P> <P> The disclosures came on the opening day of a five-day hearing by the National  Transportation Safety Board on the causes and immediate aftermath of the March  24 tanker grounding, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil into the  sound.  </P> <P> The hearing also focused on a mystery: Did the ship's crew fail to realize  trouble lay ahead, or did the ship somehow not respond to its frantic efforts  to avoid Bligh Reef?  </P> <P> The ship's third mate, Gregory T. Cousins, told the panel that Capt. Joseph  Hazelwood left the bridge to do some paper work in his cabin after first  ordering the tanker outside normal traffic lanes to avoid floating ice.  According to Cousins' testimony, Hazelwood asked if the third mate was  comfortable handling the responsibility.  </P> <P> Cousins, unlicensed to operate the vessel in the sound, said "yes, I was."  </P> <P> According to reports filed by NTSB investigators Tuesday, Hazelwood made a  series of decisions before leaving the bridge, however. He ordered the lookout  stationed on the bow to take a position on the bridge wing, 800 feet from the  bow. And he told Cousins to steer back into the traffic lanes just beyond Busby  Island, where a buoy light warns of dangerous shoals.  </P> <P> Seven minutes before the accident, just after passing Busby Island, Cousins  said he ordered a right rudder correction of 10 degrees. Two minutes later,  detecting no response, he said he made a more insistent 20-degree right rudder  correction.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Five-Minute Delay  </P> <P> But the ship's mechanical course recorder said no course change began until  five minutes after Cousins said he issued his first order.  </P> <P> "I honestly cannot pinpoint the reason" for the discrepancy, Cousins said.  </P> <P> As the ship steamed at 11 knots toward the reef, Cousins said he called  Hazelwood in his cabin.  </P> <P> "I said to him, 'I think we're in serious trouble,' " Cousins said. Then the  987-foot tanker hit the reef.  </P> <P> Cousins said in a panic that he grabbed the wheel and spun it left but by that  time, "I believe we were hard aground."  </P> <P> Cousins said he shined a light on the water but could not see oil because it  was too dark. But he said he could smell oil.  </P> <P> Telling his story for the first time to an intent crowd in a downtown hotel  ballroom, the Tampa, Fla., seaman said that after the first hit there was  another jolt every 10 seconds for a minute, six jolts in all.  </P> <P> Hazelwood returned to the bridge and spent about 20 minutes trying to rock the  ship free. He called the Coast Guard at 12:26. At 12:35, he made another futile  12-minute attempt to free the tanker -- actions that authorities believe might  have further jeopardized the ship's already precarious position.  </P> <P> Hazelwood, fired from Exxon and facing state criminal charges of drunk driving,  reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil, refused to testify at the  hearing.  </P> <P> Hazelwood, who is free on $50,000 bail, goes on trial June 20. He has pleaded  innocent to the charges. He faces two years, three months in jail and $11,000  in fines if convicted.  </P> <P> Cousins said he smelled no alcohol on Hazelwood's breath. The captain failed a  blood alcohol test 10 hours later and investigators said Hazelwood was drinking  before sailing his tanker out of Valdez.  </P> <P> However, Exxon Chairman Lawrence Rawl told United Press International on  Tuesday that company interviews indicate Hazelwood was not drunk prior to the  spill.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Attorney's View  </P> <P> Hazelwood's attorney, Michael Chalos, said Tuesday that the testimony showed  "an accident happened and it was the fault of the third mate and the helmsman.  You can talk about the captain's judgment, but it doesn't rise to a crime."  </P> <P> In a dozen trips on Exxon vessels out of Valdez, Cousins said, he had not seen  "growlers," small icebergs, worse than on the night the ship left port, but he  said he saw them only on radar.  </P> <P> Cousins said he was surprised to find the tanker on automatic pilot when he  took over because autopilot was used in open water and not during maneuvers,  such as the detour away from ice. He said he did not know who put the ship on  autopilot but that he took it off before trying to make critical turns prior to  running aground.  </P> <P> Cousins also testified that at no time while the ship was lunging into shallow  water did the alarm on the ship's fathometer sound.  </P> <P> Cousins said the distance between the ice and Bligh Reef was nine-tenths of a  mile. The Exxon Valdez was heading east, toward lighted and charted reefs and  islands, when he ordered the series of right turns.  </P> <P> NTSB questioning focused on ice conditions, tanker-turning capabilities and  crew decision-making.  </P> <P> The panel is trying to determine why the tanker strayed far from the shipping  lane on a clear night, whether Hazelwood was drunk and why Cousins was in  command.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 28 Witnesses Scheduled  </P> <P> The panel will question more than two dozen witnesses, including Coast Guard  personnel and Exxon executives, and try to determine whether the Coast Guard,  the oil industry and the state reacted as promptly as possible to the spill.  </P> <P> The inquiry is scheduled to hear 28 witnesses, including eight Exxon crewmen,  representatives from the state, Exxon, the Coast Guard and Alyeska Pipeline  Service Co., a consortium of oil companies that runs the 800-mile Alaskan  pipeline.  </P> <P> The board's report on the cause of the accident will take up to a year to  complete, NTSB spokeswoman Drucella Andersen said.  </P> <P> Cousins' testimony, delivered in a monotone, seemed to take on an air of  despair when he revealed that he was not supposed to be on duty when the ship  ran into trouble. Cousins reported telling his replacement, the second mate, to  take his time coming up to bridge to start his shift because he, Cousins, was  feeling fine.  </P> <P> OIL DRILLING DELAYED -- The Interior Department postpones a proposed offshore  oil lease sale in Alaska.

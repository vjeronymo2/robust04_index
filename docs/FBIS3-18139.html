			<p>Language: <F P=105> Italian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Federalism and liberalism are the principles which  inspire the Northern League's manifesto, unveiled today in  Milan. According to the League, it is necessary to shift the  emphasis of public spending from current expenditure to  investment and to reorganize the public sector, cutting state  support in order to favor private enterprise.    The League believes in the complete freedom of local  authorities to levy their own taxes and be responsible for  expenditure. Personal and corporate income tax would be reduced.  Small and medium-sized businesses would be developed by means  of partnerships, aid to southern Italy would cease, and greater  flexibility in working hours would be introduced.</p>

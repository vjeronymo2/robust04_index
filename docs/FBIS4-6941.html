			<p>BFN     [Text] Ulaanbaatar, April 25 (OANA-MONTSAME) -- As was  informed by the special issue of the newspaper "ERH CHOLOO" the  Mongolian Prime Minister P. Jasray has refused to sign an  agreement with the participants of the hunger strike going on  their action demanding the resignation of the government.    He gave such reason for his refusal as that neither in the  Constitution of the country nor in the law on the government  there is proper provision providing for a preliminary arriving  at an agreement on resignation of the government with  individuals or organizations. During the meeting with the  representatives of the hunger strikers on 24 April the prime  minister also called upon the strikers to discontinue the hunger  strike as a sign of respect of the stand by the president, the  recommendations of the Council for Ensuring the National  Security and the decisions by the parliament.    In the agreement on concord there is provided for as a  condition for ending the hunger strike the resignation of the  government in case their failure to fulfill their programme of  action for the year 1994.    In association with the fact that the head of the government  has denied this proposal it has been decided to continue the  hunger strike of members and supporters of the Mongolian  Democratic Association, Union of Mongolian Students and Union  for New Progress demanding the resignation of the government.  The hunger strike is being continued for 15 days.    The participants of the counterhunger strike in support of  the government have stopped their action on 23 April.</p>

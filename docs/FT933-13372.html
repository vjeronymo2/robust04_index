			<p>930720 FT  20 JUL 93 / Monks leads TUC drive to preserve check-off under which employers debit union subscriptions from salaries - was launched yesterday by Mr John Monks, who will be the new general secretary of the Trades Union Congress. The appointment of Mr Monks, now deputy general secretary of the TUC, was confirmed yesterday. As sole candidate he was nominated by 31 unions representing 87 per cent of total TUC membership. Mr Monks will take over from Mr Norman Willis, who retires on September 10 at the end of this year's annual congress. Mr Monks said one of his main concerns was to raise the morale of trade unionists. He wanted the TUC to play a co-ordinating role in the campaign to retain the check-off arrangements. A TUC working group on check-off has been set up to assist unions. unions are now legally obliged to reconfirm at least every three years that their members wish to continue having union subscriptions debited from their salaries. The unions, which will have to get this information from all their members in the next 12 months, fear this could result in a fall in union member-ships. Mr Monks said he sensed a more positive feeling among the unions. He added that the TUC wanted to work with good employers as well as expose bad employers.</p>

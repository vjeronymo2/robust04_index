			<p>920714 FT  14 JUL 92 / UK Company News: MFI gets applications for 44% of shares MFI FURNITURE Group, the kitchen and bedroom retailer, received applications for about 44 per cent of the 137m shares sold through the public offer portion of its flotation. However, of these, applicants for 29 per cent were sub-underwriters who could offset applications against their underwriting commitment. That leaves only a 15 per cent take-up from outside buyers. The group also placed 410.2m shares with institutions, and County NatWest, the bank sponsoring the float, said that 86 per cent of the shares available were placed or applied for in the offer. A final figure for applications will be announced on Wednesday, share certificates will be posted on Thursday and dealings are due to start on Friday. Brokers expect an opening price of about 105p compared to the 115p issue price.</p>

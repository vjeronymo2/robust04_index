			<p>941229 FT  29 DEC 94 / Markets Report: Mexican peso recovers off recent record lows Higher interest rates and rumours of central bank support yesterday helped the Mexican peso bounce back from record lows, writes Philip Gawith. After losing nearly 40 per cent of its value over the previous week, closing on Tuesday at 5.65 pesos to the dollar, it recovered yesterday to end at 4.975 on the spot market. Helping the peso was the upward surge in interest rates. The primary rate on 28-day treasury bills rose by 15 percentage points from last week, to 31 per cent, in the central bank's weekly auction. There was speculation that Mexico had started to use the Dollars 6bn line of credit extended to it by the US and Canada. Trading conditions were very thin, contributing to some exaggerated market movements. This was exemplified by the dollar's sharp downward spike in early afternoon US trading. It fell three pfennigs to DM1.54, and nearly two yen, to Y98.6, before bouncing back to DM1.5450 and Y99. There was little evidence, however, of heavy volumes being traded, or of any sustained downward move being underway. The weaker dollar, and political worries, pulled sterling lower. The pound finished at DM2.4309, from DM2.4385. In afternoon Wall St trading, it was at DM2.4198. Elsewhere, the Canadian dollar breached the CDollars 1.40 level against the dollar to finish at CDollars 1.403, its lowest level since 1986. The peso's recovery followed comments from Mr Larry Summers, US Treasury under-secretary, that its fall was not warranted by economic fundamentals. He said 'excessive depreciation' was not in anyone's interest. Mexico has a currency swap line totalling nearly Dollars 7bn with the US and Canada. Mr Summers said the US had confidence 'in the underlying soundness of Mexican economic policies.' He said the US Treasury was in close contact with Mexico and Canada about the situation in the currency markets. Aside from higher Mexican interest rates, the other development touching on the dollar was the publication of Japanese trade and current account figures for November. Japan's politically sensitive current account surplus rose in November by 15.4 per cent from a year earlier - the first rise since June. The size of this surplus has been a continuing source of friction between the US and Japan, and exerted downward pressure on the dollar over the year. A Japanese ministry of finance official sought to downplay the figure, saying Japan's trade surplus was still on a downtrend, both in yen and dollar terms, though subject to monthly fluctuations. One positive factor for the dollar was the continued recovery in the US bond market. The yield on the 30-year treasury bond has recovered to 7.79 per cent, having recently been as high as 8.15 per cent. After starting in Europe around DM2.4390, sterling lost nearly two pfennigs by the afternoon in New York. Mr Paul Downs, analyst at Technical Data in London, attributed the pound's weakness to 'overseas lack of confidence in the Conservative government.' He said support at DM2.4250 was 'very significant', as a break below this level could trigger stop-loss selling, leading to a decline to DM2.40. On the other UK news of the day, the monthly monetary meeting, Mr Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist at NatWest Markets, said he would be surprised if interest rates were raised again this month. 'Our view is that another  1/2 per cent rate rise will come in February, prompted by the Bank's next inflation report.' The Bank of England cleared a Pounds 350m money market shortage, at established rates, in its daily operations. Traders said the weakness in the Canadian dollar was more a case of ongoing market momentum, rather than any specific development. Despite reported Bank of Canada support, the dollar breached the crucial CDollars 1.40 level against the US dollar, to finish in London at CDollars 1.403 - its lowest level since touching CDollars 1.45 in 1986. The Canadian dollar has been weakening steadily since touching CDollars 1.12 in 1991. Mr Jonathan Griggs, economic adviser at Barclays in London, said the Bank of Canada seemed 'prepared to see a degree of currency weakness. It is not prepared to raise rates to defend the currency.'</p>

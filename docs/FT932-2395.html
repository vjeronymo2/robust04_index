			<p>930618 FT  18 JUN 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Airlines unloaded for second straight day Wall Street US SHARE prices traded in a narrow range yesterday, finishing slightly higher as airline stocks took a battering for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New York. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 10.24 up at 3,521.89. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 put on 1.11 at 448.54, while the Nasdaq composite was a slight 0.31 easier at 695.94. Trading volume on the New York SE amounted to 239.8m shares. The mood of the markets remained clouded by uncertainty over the outlook for the economy. Yesterday's economic news was mostly bearish for equities: the April trade deficit widened to Dollars 10.49bn because exports fell amid a weakening in overseas economies; weekly unemployment claims were unchanged; and the Philadelphia Federal Reserve reported a sharp deterioration in local business conditions. Although the data cheered bond investors, stocks mostly remained stuck at opening values. As well as the murky economic picture, equity markets have to contend with uncertainty over President Bill Clinton's economic package, which is currently undergoing a considerable overhaul as it makes its way through Congress. Among individual sectors, airlines were hammered after the second major carrier in two days issued a warning about its quarterly earnings outlook. AMR, parent of American Airlines, said second-quarter profits would come in well below analysts' forecasts of Dollars 1 a share. At the same stage last year AMR made a profit of Dollars 2.21 a share. After a delayed opening due to an order imbalance, AMR dropped Dollars 4 1/2 to Dollars 61 1/2 in volume of 3.1m shares. Other airline stocks tumbled: USAir, which on Wednesday issued its own profits warning, fell a further Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 16, Delta declined Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 48 1/8 and UAL weakened Dollars 5 1/4 to Dollars 121 1/2 . Although Hewlett-Packard claimed that Wednesday's reports of a downbeat earnings forecast from the company's chairman were a misrepresentation, the stock continued to run into heavy selling, falling a further Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 81. Other stocks in the technology sector were lower, with Digital Equipment losing Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 40 3/4 and IBM Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 49 5/8 . Pepsico continued to do well in spite of reports of syringes apparently being discovered in cans and bottles of Pepsi. The shares rose Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 36 7/8 amid a growing belief among investors that the syringes may be the work of hoaxers, rather than criminal product-tamperers. On the Nasdaq market, Adobe Systems dropped Dollars 3 3/4 in the morning after the company reported second-quarter earnings below Wall Street forecasts, but rallied strongly later to end a net Dollars  3/8 up at Dollars 69 3/8 . Canada TORONTO gained ground in active trading, the TSE 300 index closing 11.3 ahead at a 1993 high of 3,903.7. Rises outscored falls by 423 to 287 after volume of 61.9m shares. Ten of the 14 stock groups were higher, led by the paper and forestry group, which gained 2.49 per cent. Mining, energy, golds and industrial products were up, and consumer products and financial services were flat. Real estate stocks fell 2.16 per cent.</p>

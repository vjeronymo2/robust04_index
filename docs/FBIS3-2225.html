			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report: "Two Former Leaders of Beijing Students Campaign </F> Are Again Detained by Public Security Authorities"]    [Excerpts] John Shattuck, U.S. assistant secretary of  state for human rights and humanitarian affairs, yesterday  released a statement in Hong Kong, condemning China for  detaining dissidents. Shattuck also warned that the action taken  by the Chinese authorities over the past few days had cast a  pall over Secretary of State Warren Christopher's forthcoming  visit to China. It was on the same day that Shattuck released  his statement that the Chinese authorities detained two more  former Beijing student movement leaders, namely, Zhai Weimin and  Ma Shaofang.    An informed source in Beijing revealed that Zhai Weimin, a  student leader in the 1989 pro-democracy movement, was detained  by the police yesterday afternoon and his whereabouts are  unknown. Another student leader, Ma Shaofang, was stopped and  detained by the police in Tianjin, enroute Beijing, and then  sent back to Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province under escort.    A friend of Zhai Weimin said Zhai, who came to Beijing from  his home province, Henan, was picked up by some policemen near  the Qinghua University campus in Beijing's Haidian District  around 1440 yesterday. His whereabouts are still not known.  His friend estimates that there are two possibilities: Like  the case of Wang Dan some days ago, Zhai Weimin may be released  in a couple of days after being warned by the police; or he may  be sent back to his home province of Henan under escort.    AFP quoted a friend of Zhai as saying that the incident took  place when the 26-year-old Zhai was walking with a child along a  street near Qinghua University. A red Volkswagen Santana  suddenly arrived and four policemen got out of the car and  picked him up.    Meanwhile, according to one of Ma Shaofang's friends, Ma  originally planned to arrive in Beijing on 3 March from his home  province of Jiangsu but he has not yet shown up in Beijing. A  phone call from Ma's family yesterday said he had been stopped  and detained by the Jiangsu provincial police a few days ago in  Tianjin on his way to Beijing and he had been brought back to  Nanjing by the police. What is going to happen to him is still  unknown.    Zhai Weimin and Ma Shaofang are the 12th and 13th dissidents  detained by the authorities in Beijing and Shanghai over the  past four days. Some of the detained dissidents have been  released, among whom are Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan. Wei  Jingsheng met with Shattuck, a senior U.S. State Department  official who was visiting China to make preparations for  Christopher's China mission. But, while Shattuck was still in  China, Wei Jingsheng was detained for 24 hours and then  released. The official XINHUA News Agency yesterday released a  statement saying that Wei Jingsheng was summoned by the police  according to the law because of his violation of parole  regulations.    An informed source from the Beijing Municipality Public  Security Bureau said the few democratic activists' being  summoned for interrogation over the past few days had little  link with the convening of the National People's Congress  session and the Chinese People's Political Consultative  Conference National Committee session but, rather, is related to  U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher's visit to China  later this week. The authorities concerned intend to warn  democratic activists not to "speak carelessly" during  Christopher's visit to Beijing. [passage omitted]    The dissidents who were taken away by the police over the  past four days are Zhai Weimin, Ma Shaofang, Wei Jingsheng, Wang  Dan, Zhou Guoqiang, Yuan Hongbing, Wang Jiaqi, Xu Wenli, Bao Ge,  Yang Zhou, Yang Jingheng, Dai Xuezhong, Ma Wei, and Gong  Xingnan. It has been confirmed that Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, Xu  Wenli, Bao Ge, and Yang Zhou are among those who have already  been released after detention.</p>

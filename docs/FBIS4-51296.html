			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, may 27 (XINHUA) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng  and visiting Russian Prime Minister V. S. Chernomyrdin held  talks at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here this morning.    In "a sincere and friendly atmosphere" the two sides  exchanged views on bilateral ties and international issues of  mutual concern.    Chernomyrdin arrived here Thursday [26 May] morning for a  four- day official visit.    On bilateral ties, Li expressed his satisfaction with their  healthy and smooth development.    China attaches great importance to its ties with Russia, Li  said, adding that it constitutes a major part of China's foreign  policy to develop long-term, stable and good-neighborly ties  with Russia.    This is also the common aspiration of the two peoples, Li  said.    "The Chinese Government and people are willing to constantly  enrich the friendly co-operation, together with Russian side, on  the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence," Li  said.    China and Russia are two nations with global influence. The  expansion of their ties is not only in the fundamental interests  of the two sides, but also conducive to the peace and  development of the region and the world, Li stated.    Li described the overall development of the bilateral  economic and trade relations in recent years as "good". The  two-way trade volume hit 7.68 billion U.S. Dollars-worth last  year, well above the record in the days of the old Soviet Union,  he said.    The geographical proximity and economic complementarity  provide the economic and trade co-operation of various forms  with many advantages, a great potential and bright prospects, Li  said.    However, the present level of economic and trade  co-operation  is not high enough, Li conceded. The two sides should further  upgrade their co-operative level and quality, explore new  opportunities and encourage enterprises with credit on both  sides to reinforce their co-operation so as to best play their  role as the mainstay of bilateral co-operation.    In economic and trade relations, both sides should stick to  the principle of equality and mutual benefit, Li said.    So long as the two sides take positive attitudes and enhance  macro-control, the problems emerging from the growing economic  and trade ties can be gradually resolved, thus creating more  favorable conditions for the economic and trade co-operation  between the two countries' localities and enterprises, Li said.    While noting the long and traditional contacts between the  two peoples, Chernomyrdin said his visit is aimed at furthering  friendly co-operation.    The seven agreements to be signed here embody the healthy  and  stable growth of the bilateral links, he said.    Touching on the agreement concerning the Sino-Russian  borders, Chernomyrdin told his Chinese host that it is his hope  that the border will remain forever as one of peace, friendship  and co- operation, and bestow happiness on the two peoples.    Referring to the border trade and co-operation as the major  part of Sino-Russian economic and trade co-operation, Li said  that they should continue to develop and be given active  guidance.    The improvement of transportation is crucial in the further  development of the bilateral trade and economic co-operation, Li  said.    He cited the Euroasian rail links, saying they should be  given high priority and be fully employed.    In the meantime, the railways in the border areas of the two  countries' eastern parts should be dovetailed, Li said,  suggesting that China and Russia reinforce their co-operation in  this respect.    Chernomyrdin expressed agreement with Li's proposal. The  Euroasian railways are important, he said. The Siberian Railway  should also be perfected and made full use of, he added.    Both leaders agreed that today's talks were fruitful and  they  will serve to propel the good-neighborly and mutually beneficial  co- operation, especially the economic and trade ties, according  to Chinese sources.    The two prime ministers also exchanged views on  international  issues.    Both held that the enhancement of their co-operation in  world  affairs will play a significant role in Asia's stability and  security as well as in the overall improvement of international  environment.    On behalf of the Russian Government, Chernomyrdin invited Li  to visit Russia. Li accepted it.    Following the talks, the two prime ministers signed two  governmental agreements concerning the management of borders and  the avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal  evasion with respect to taxes on income.    They also presided over the signing of five other documents.  They were: the memorandum of the Second Session of the  Sino-Russian Joint Commission on Economic, Trade and Technical  Co-Operation, the agreement between the two governments on the  economic and technical co-operation of agricultural and  industrial complexes, the agreement between the two governments  on environmental protection cooperation, and the agreement  between the two governments on the joint protection, regulation  and value-addition of fishery resources on the Heilongjiang and  Wusuli Rivers.    Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing and Russian Deputy Prime  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin were among those present on the  occasion.    Later, Li Lanqing hosted a banquet in honor of the Russian  visitors.</p>

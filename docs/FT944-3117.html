			<p>941215 FT  15 DEC 94 / Mercedes seeks Greek damages German carmaker Mercedes-Benz threatened to sue Greece's government yesterday for shutting its main Athens office for eight days and posting a sign outside branding the company a tax dodger. 'If the case is as we see, it is most likely we will sue for damages,' Mr Hans Dieter Struck, the company's managing director in Greece, said. Finance ministry officials chained and padlocked the main entrance to Mercedes-Benz on Tuesday and put up a sign next to the door announcing 'locked until 20/12/94 for tax evasion'. Mr Struck said it was absurd to shut the company's headquarters in Greece because of a disputed 300,000-drachma (Pounds 790) fine. Mr Struck said Mercedes felt its row with the finance ministry had nothing to do with tax evasion but with a dispute, which is still under review at the ministry, over a missing 1993 receipt for spare parts worth 150,000 drachmas. Mercedes has appealed to the highest administrative court in Greece and, if necessary, will go to the European Court, Mr Struck said.</p>

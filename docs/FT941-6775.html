			<p>940228 FT  28 FEB 94 / World Bond Markets: Frankfurt It was a lugubrious week for German government securities and the mood of the market is unlikely to improve in the days ahead. The steep rise in yields was driven by knock-on effects of the US Federal Reserve's small rate increase in early February. It has helped foreign investors, massive buyers of bunds last year, to revise their view of the attractions of the German market. Even if the trend of German interest rates is down, in contrast to the probability of steadily rising rates in the US, the prospect of further Bundesbank rate cuts is not enough to inspire foreign investors to buy heavily into the bund market, says Klaus Holschuh, head of fixed income research at Commerzbank. On the contrary, foreign investors will be looking to seize on any data they can interpret as an excuse to sell. The Bundesbank will duly oblige by publishing the January M3 supply figure today or tomorrow. Following on from the distorted December figure - the annualised, seasonally adjusted growth in M3 was 8.1 for that month - further distortions are likely to take the January growth figure to 10 per cent or more. No matter that the figure is genuinely distorted, and that underlying inflation is well on the way down, the data is likely to be seen as a good reason for selling bunds.</p>

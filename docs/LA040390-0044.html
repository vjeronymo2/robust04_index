			<p><P> April 3, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> REROUTING AID  </P> <P> Stop the military aid we are sending to El Salvador.  </P> <P> I volunteer at Share Our Selves in Costa Mesa. We bag groceries for 300  families every day.  </P> <P> These families are living in cars, the streets, or have been evicted and ask  for temporary help while they try to get on their feet.  </P> <P> I volunteer for Meals on Wheels. These old people are living in trailers, are  over 80 years old and are trying to stay in their trailers and stay together.  </P> <P> Here is where our tax dollar should be spent. There was an old adage that I was  raised with: "Charity begins at home."  </P> <P> Let's stop funding the guns which are killing innocent people and spend it on  our own poor and homeless. SOS deserves our support. The NIMBY (Not In My Back  Yard) factor prevalent in our society today has to be identified and  eradicated. The poor are here, and they need help.  </P> <P> EILEEN MURPHY  </P> <P> Huntington Beach  </P></p>

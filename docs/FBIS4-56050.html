			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["ars"-signed report: "Tolerance Movement Established"] </F>   [Excerpt] The Tolerance Movement [Hnutie Tolerancia, HT]  was registered at the Ministry of Interior on 12 May. Two days  later, it held its constituent congress. The movement's  leadership, composed of chairwoman Anna Galovicova, PhD, deputy  chairman Lubomir Sausa, and secretary Imrich Ciffra, visited our  editorial office yesterday to inform us about the plans and  goals of this new political entity.    The movement was established as a force of harmonization,  whose task is to free us of emotional conflicts and campaign and  post- election struggles. The HT wants to run in the early  parliamentary elections independently, but it is not opposed to  cooperation with other political entities either. It has  launched a petition campaign to obtain the required number of  signatures to participate in elections to the National Council  of the Slovak Republic. [passage omitted]</p>

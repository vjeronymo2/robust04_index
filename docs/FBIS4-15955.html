			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Stanislav Chekalin video report from Kaliningrad; from the </F> "Utro" program]    [Text] The case of the Lithuanian Selma Construction  Association has become a strange, almost detective story. It  was building housing in Kaliningrad for families of officers  being withdrawn from the Baltic states.    We have often talked about Vladis Laurinavichius, director  general of Selma, who concluded a private contract with the  Russian Defense Ministry to develop a residential area of 2,000  apartments and about the impressive construction site that he  began near Kaliningrad that provided work for several thousand  Lithuanian construction workers. The Russian Defense Ministry  in turn was a reliable contractor and by agreement turned over  part of the Baltic Fleet's property, money, and oil as barter to  the Lithuanian side. In return it was to receive quality housing.    It would seem that one could ask for nothing more, that a  mechanism for a civilized and mutually beneficial solution to  the troop withdrawal problem had been found. This was precisely  what permitted the redeployment of units from Lithuania in a  short period of time. However, it seems that this situation was  not to the liking of representatives of the opposition, who are  longing for power.    And then the Lithuanian special services unexpectedly  arrested Vladis Laurinavichius for allegedly storing explosives  in his apartment, on the very day he was planning to go to  Kaliningrad to meet Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev.    [Video cuts to show Russian Defense Minister Grachev talking  to camera]    [Begin Grachev recording] He, Vladis, was told that I am  carrying a directive from the prime minister in which the  payment terms were stipulated. In other words, I have brought  the barter goods for them. We were supposed to settle with him  with oil as we had envisaged. So, as you can see, I have the  directive in my briefcase but I cannot hand it to the director  general nor can I thank him. [end recording]    So it looks like a detective story, does it not? However, I  think it has been written in a rather clumsy way and not in the  best traditions of this style. One may ask: Why does a major  businessman who deals with money totalling billions need to  store explosives in his apartment? None of the representatives  of Lithuanian Sejm deputies who arrived at the construction site  could answer this question. However, they showed obvious  eagerness to continue the Selma Association's work, however, in  such a way that the profits would not go to the association but  to designated government functionaries.    This position did not find any support among the Baltic  Fleet  command, which concluded the agreement with Laurinavichius and  was confident of his responsibility, nor did it find support  among Lithuanian construction workers. They declared that they  are stopping work until their leader returns. This is what  happens when politicians meddle in a normal and mutually  beneficial business, said former Lithuanian Defense Minister  Audrius Bytkiavichius, who defended Selma in several press  articles.    In the meantime, the construction site is at a standstill  and  if some goodwill gestures are not forthcoming from the  Lithuanian side, the conflict may unnecessarily complicate  relations between the two states.    [Video cuts to shot of Grachev]    [Begin Grachev recording] Of course, I consider this to be a  misunderstanding, moreover, because our relations with the  Lithuanian leadership are not bad. This concerns the withdrawal  of troops and the issue of the residence of the Russian-speaking  population. Of course, this unpleasant moment will not benefit  Russian-Lithuanian relations.

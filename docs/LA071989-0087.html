			<p><P> July 19, 1989, Wednesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> 2ND MAN ARRESTED; 3RD SUSPECT SOUGHT;  </P> <P> SON HELD IN SLAYING OF FATHER IN SYLMAR  </P> <P> Los Angeles police arrested a 24-year-old man Tuesday in the execution-style  murder of his father in Sylmar on July 4. They also arrested an alleged  accomplice and are searching for a third man believed to have plotted to kill  the victim for financial gain.  </P> <P> Raymond Godlewski Jr. of Montrose was arrested while being questioned at the  Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill station, Lt. Bernard Conine said.  </P> <P> Later Tuesday, police arrested Michael Brown, 21, at his Palmdale apartment.  Brown's roommate, Gene Marshall Flack, 23, was being sought in connection with  the murder, Conine said. The three men, believed to be companions from high  school, conspired to kill the senior Godlewski to claim the man's life  insurance and other property, Conine said.  </P> <P> Raymond Joseph Godlewski, 45, was shot once in the upper body at the entrance  to his home in the 13400 block of Trego Street about 2 a.m. July 4, police  said. A gardener discovered the man's body about six hours later, authorities  said. Police said they found a gun believed used in the slaying on the front  yard of the house.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mail-Order Business  </P> <P> Conine said the senior Godlewski, who earned an upper middle-level income, was  a machinist and ran a mail-order shipping business from the garage of his  two-story home, where he lived by himself. Conine said the man manufactured  nylon binding devices with plastic buckles. He said he did not know what the  devices were used for.  </P> <P> Police made the arrests after serving search warrants at the suspects'  residences and at two homes in San Fernando, which Conine said the men  frequented. He would not elaborate.  </P> <P> Conine said police initially thought that the senior Godlewski might have taken  his own life, "but the more we got into it, the more it looked like murder."  Authorities refused to say which of the three they believe shot Godlewski.  </P> <P> The younger Godlewski and Brown were being held at the Foothill Division Jail.  </P> <P> Flack is described as six feet tall and weighing 160 pounds, with blond hair  and brown eyes.  </P> <P> Times staff writer Mike Connelly, in Sacramento, contributed to this story.  </P></p>

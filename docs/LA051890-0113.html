Albracht on Thursday denied requests  by the ABC and NBC television networks for potentially key evidence in the  murders of Jose Menendez and his wife, Kitty.  </P> <P> Albracht tentatively rejected making public an audiotape of an emergency 911  telephone call made to police last Aug. 20, when the Menendez couple was found  slain in their Beverly Hills mansion.  </P> <P> He said he would reconsider his decision next Tuesday.  </P> <P> The judge also rebuffed attempts by the networks to gain video and audiotapes  made during the seizure of evidence in a Beverly Hills psychologist's office,  and information dealing with the purchase of two shotguns that are believed by  police to be the possible murder weapons.  </P> <P> Albracht has ordered the county coroner to make public autopsy reports on the  slain couple. On Thursday, on a motion by the Los Angeles Daily Journal  newspaper, he ordered the coroner to make public investigative and  toxicological reports as well.  </P></p>

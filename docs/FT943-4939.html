			<p>940906 FT  06 SEP 94 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading Stock index futures had a very quiet day, with turnover of only 12,242 lots. The low volume made for volatility, with the September contract yo-yoing between low and high points, writes Clare Gascoigne. The FT-SE 100 contract for September delivery got off to a shaky start, down 12 from Friday's close, and fell to test the 3,200 level early in the morning. However, there was plenty of support to prevent it dropping too far, and after touching the day's low of 3,205 it began to rally gently. The morning's squeeze was tested after lunch as locals - independent traders  -called September low and it received no direction from the US, where Wall Street was closed for Labor Day. But it climbed steadily throughout the afternoon, reaching a high of 3,256 before dropping back to close at 3,247 - only 3 points above its estimated fair value, the premium which allows for dividends and the cost of carrying. Bullish traders who suggested the contract would move higher in the next few days, testing the 3,280 level, received some comfort from after-hours' trading, when it rose to 3,254. Activity was equally slight in traded options, with volume of only 16,740 lots. FT-SE and Euro FT-SE turnover totalled 1,405 contracts. Hanson was the most active stock option, with 1,222 lots traded, followed by Zeneca with 1,020.</p>

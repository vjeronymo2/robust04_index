			<p>BFN     [Text] Following a fierce battle in which the soldiers of  the army of unity, democracy, and modernization emerged as  heroes performing deeds of bravery unprecedented in our people's  history, our forces succeeded in completely routing the foolish  and [word indistinct] forces of the bloody al-Ahmar gang,  forcing them to retreat to their rear positions in the direction  of Qa'tabah.    Many members of the latter forces had earlier surrendered  and  joined the ranks of our forces, having been forced into the war  by the al-Ahmar gang by various immoral means. Our forces are  now in complete control of the entire areas of al-Dali' and  Shu'ayb, having captured or put to flight the forces of the  adventurist al-Ahmar gang. In the Bab al-Mandeb Kharaz area,  our forces succeeded this morning in repulsing the offensive of  the oppressive forces of the treacherous gang of the al-Ahmar  clan, forcing them to retreat to their rear positions after  driving them out of the Ra's al-Arah and the Kahabup center  areas. Our forces are currently in control of this area, which  is in the region of the former border existing before the union.    The Defense Ministry has expressed conviction that victory  will soon be won and the destructive and oppressive war declared  by the so-called 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih on 27 April 1994 will soon  be silenced.</p>

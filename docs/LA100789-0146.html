			<p><P> October 7, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS TRY TO KEEP ROLLING ON ROAD;  </P> <P> FULLERTON, UNBEATEN IN BIG WEST, FACES WINLESS UTAH STATE  </P> <P> The leaves are just past their colorful peak in the Cache Valley, an event many  locals hope marks the changing of the football season at Utah State.  </P> <P> Utah State has finished a nonconference schedule that included USC and  Illinois, classic mismatches in the Big West Conference play-for-pay style. And  after four games, all losses, the Aggies have a set of the scariest statistics  this side of the last day of October.  </P> <P> Utah State is last in the Big West in six of nine statistical categories,  including:  </P> <P>  -- Scoring offense, averaging eight points a game.  </P> <P>  -- Scoring defense, allowing an average of 47 points.  </P> <P>  -- Total defense, giving up 588 yards a game.  </P> <P> There, but for the grace of Athletic Director Ed Carroll and the unavailability  of a game in the big-time, might go Cal State Fullerton. But not this year.  </P> <P> Fullerton enters its game against the Aggies at noon today in Romney Stadium on  an offensive roll after scoring a total of 75 points in its past two games.  </P> <P> Fullerton is 2-2-1 overall, but after a 34-20 defeat of Nevada Las Vegas last  week, the Titans are 1-0 in conference.  </P> <P> And this is one of those games that have come to be known, in the Gene Murphy  phrase book, as the biggest game of the season this week. In other words, the  one at hand. The Titans need to win to stay in position to challenge Fresno  State and San Jose State in the conference.  </P> <P> "It doesn't matter who (this week's opponent is), we've got to be 2-0," Murphy  said.  </P> <P> Those games against the likes of USC and Illinois do bad things to a team's  statistics. They also render game film nearly worthless for scouting purposes.  </P> <P> "They're hard to judge, just like we would be after games like that," Murphy  said.  </P> <P> For Utah State, this game is an opportunity -- at least in comparison to the  games against USC (66-10) and Illinois (41-2). Even Utah defeated the Aggies  easily, 45-10. Utah State's other loss was to Brigham Young, 37-10.  </P> <P> "The good news is that we're away from that schedule," Utah State Coach Chuck  Shelton said. "The bad news is we haven't beaten Fullerton in (six) years."  </P> <P> Fullerton has received outstanding performances from quarterback Dan Speltz the  past two weeks, as well as the type of game that has come to be standard from  running back Mike Pringle, who will be trying for his fifth 100-yard game in a  row.  </P> <P> Utah State has struggled, but nowhere more than at quarterback, where sophomore  Kirk Johnson will start. Johnson started the first two games and then Shelton  tried Kevin White, another sophomore. But White was injured against Illinois  and remains out of action, leaving Johnson, who has thrown five interceptions  and completed 25 of 77 passes for 314 yards.  </P> <P> "He has good athletic talent, but you have to mesh that talent with quarterback  qualities," Shelton said. "If he does that, we'll be a better than average  offense. We're never gonna be great."  </P> <P> Titan Notes  </P> <P> Phil Nevin, Cal State Fullerton's freshman kicker and punter, suffers from  asthma. He said the condition has caused him problems in baseball in the past,  but not in football, although he and Coach Gene Murphy are concerned about the  effect of the altitude in Logan. . . . The altitude has its positive effect as  well. Nevin tried two 60-yard field goals Friday, hitting the upright on the  first and putting the ball through on the second. Is he eager to try one in a  game? "Definitely," Nevin said. Murphy said he would like to give him the  opportunity, depending upon the score and how well the Fullerton defense is  playing. . . . Starting offensive lineman Tom Gang, bothered by a knee injury,  has had limited practice time this week. Murphy said he will start.  </P></p>

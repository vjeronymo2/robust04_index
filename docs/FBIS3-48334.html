The organization said  the study will be made under a new action program to be adopted  at a national congress scheduled for the fall.    Zenchu is concerned that the views of farmers may be  neglected in the process of political reforms, and it has become  more important than ever to strengthen the unity of farmers and  restructure the agricultural movement effectively, Zenchu  officials said.    The officials said the union was upset by the failure to  prevent the opening of the rice market under the Uruguay Round  of trade talks organized by the General Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade. They said the union will seek to have the government  review a new agricultural policy, including reorganization of  the agricultural industry.    The officials said the organization will try to prevent the  ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement by the Diet.    The Hitachi-Mitsubishi alliance is the first among Japanese  concerns on development of flash memory chips, although some  Japanese firms have teamed up with foreign companies on flash  memory chips.    Hitachi and Mitsubishi did not disclose how much money they  would spend on developing flash memory chips, but industry  sources said the two companies are likely to spend at least 50  to 60 billion yen for a 64-megabit chip alone.</p>

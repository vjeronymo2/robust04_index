			<p>940808 FT  08 AUG 94 / Credit check plan on hold: Banks suspend change to company probes on customers' status Banks have yielded to protests against forcing companies to contact customers' bank branches when checking credit. Banks have agreed to continue temporarily with a modified version of the old system, which allows companies to make inquiries through their own banks. Organisations including the Association of British Factors and Discounters told banks that their members would have to pay thousands of individual cheques to bank branches under the new system, adding substantially to costs. The change was proposed by the British Bankers' Association because of concern that banks do not seek their customers' consent before providing credit references under the status inquiry system. The bankers proposed that companies should be required to seek individuals' written consent for credit checks, and to pay the bank branch doing the work. Banks have set charges of between Pounds 7 and Pounds 9 for each check. Bankers have now decided, however, to allow companies to continue checks through their bank. Talks have started on how to simplify payments. But the association has resisted calls from groups such as the Institute of Credit Management for a 'two-tier' system under which companies could check the credit of other companies without obtaining written consent. The bankers introduced 'transitional arrangements' for bulk users of status inquiries when it changed the system in March. It originally intended these arrangements to last only until July, but has just extended them further. Mr Gareth Davies, who is representing the institute in talks with the association, said some users had protested at having to gain written consent because 'although it may be a good thing philosophically, it is hard in practical terms'. However, Mr Davies said most companies had now accepted the need for consent. They were pressing for a means of payment which would not involve staff having to write thousands of cheques for differing amounts to bank branches. Mr Andrew Mason, assistant director of the association, said that a possible way of simplifying payments would be for companies to send all check requests to central offices of banks, which would dispatch them to branches. Banks have pressed for branches to be paid individually in order to end the former system of cross-subsidies, under which a branch of Midland might carry out work on behalf of a Barclays branch without being paid. The old system was also criticised for allowing private detectives to mount 'fishing expeditions' about individuals' accounts. The association wanted to stop banks routinely disclosing information to each other. The institute protested to Mr Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, who replied that he understood its worry.</p>

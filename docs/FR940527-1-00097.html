			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the March 27, 1987 final rule, we determined that it was necessary to develop separate ``scaling factor formula'' values under the 1986 malpractice rule (see &sect;413.56(b)(3) through (5)), for malpractice insurance costs attributable to hospital outpatient services and for costs attributable to inpatient services furnished by facilities excluded from the prospective payment system (see 52 FR 9836). However, we were unable to derive separate formula values for inpatient and outpatient services for ``the R factor'' in the formula (that is, the national Medicare malpractice loss ratio, as adjusted for associated claims adjustment expense), due to the difficulty of securing hospital data attributing malpractice claims (and associated claims  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> adjustment expense) separately to outpatient services and inpatient services. Moreover, separate scaling factor formula values for hospital facilities excluded from the prospective payment system were not developed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Children's National Medical Center, et al. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Sullivan, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Civil Action No. 90&hyph;1362&hyph;WBB (D.D.C. July 16, 1991) (`` <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Children's National <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> ''), the Secretary entered into a Consent Order providing that the 1986 malpractice rule is invalid and shall not be enforced, due to the agency's inability to develop separate scaling factor formula values for outpatient services and for inpatient services furnished by hospital facilities excluded from the prospective payment system. The  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Children's National <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Consent Order was approved by the United States District Court for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the District of Columbia on July 16, 1991. The Administrator of HCFA then issued HCFA Ruling 91&hyph;1 (Sept. 30, 1991), which, first, provided that the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Children's National <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Consent Order governs all open hospital malpractice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance cost claims, and all properly pending appeals of the malpractice issue, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after May 1, 1986 and, second, required reimbursement of such claims under the pre-1979 utilization method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Supreme Court's  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Georgetown <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  decision, the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Children's National <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Consent Order, and the two corresponding HCFA Rulings establish that the 1986 malpractice rule is null and void as to all open hospital malpractice insurance cost claims, and all properly pending hospital appeals of the malpractice insurance cost reimbursement issue. See 42 CFR 401.108(c). See also HCFA Transmittal No. 395 (December 1993), which deleted as ``obsolete,'' due to HCFA Ruling 91&hyph;1, the implementation provisions for the 1986 rule that were formerly included in &sect;2214 of the Medicare Intermediary  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Manual, Part 2. We are proposing to conform Medicare regulations to the actual state of the law governing provider malpractice insurance cost reimbursement by removing &sect;413.56 from the regulations, and by eliminating all cross-references to &sect;413.56 from the regulations. As a result of this proposal, the amended Medicare rules would reflect the previously established legal requirement that reasonable cost reimbursement for provider malpractice  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> insurance cost claims that are either open or the subject of properly pending appeals, must be determined under the pre-1979 utilization method.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> C.

			<p>940519 FT  19 MAY 94 / US warning to North Korea: Military readiness may be increased, says Perry Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, warned yesterday the US would increase the already high 'readiness level' of its troops in South Korea if it proved necessary to seek sanctions against North Korea. This would be required, he told a group of foreign correspondents, because of North Korean statements that sanctions would be equivalent to an 'act of war'. He conceded that Pyongyang's assertions might be 'just rhetoric' and he added that US forces would not be placed on 'a war footing,' but that prudence dictated the US be ready for any eventuality. Mr Perry emphasised that sanctions would not be sought if the International Atomic Energy Inspection team now in North Korea reported back to the UN that its safeguards against the diversion of nuclear material for military purposes were being observed. He said he had some 'hope but not optimism,' that a confrontation with North Korea could be averted. He also refused to rule out the possibility that China could support sanctions if it concluded that the US and its partners had shown sufficient 'patience' in their dealings with Pyongyang. 'I believe the Chinese will make their decisions on sanctions based on where their national interests lie,' he said. China did vote in favour of tightened UN sanctions against Haiti earlier this month, but with the clear caveat that that should not be interpreted as a precedent.</p>

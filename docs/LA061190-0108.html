			<p><P> June 11, 1990, Monday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> WORLD;  </P> <P> AFRICA WARNED OF DESTRUCTION  </P> <P> The head of the U.N. food agency warned Africa today that it is on the path to  total destruction of its natural resources.  </P> <P> Edouard Saouma, director general of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization,  told an agency conference on Africa that the continent faces "an extremely  serious threat of accelerated, continent-wide environmental decline with the  inevitable outcome in the long term of total depletion."  </P> <P> In an opening speech to delegates from 51 states, he said there is a widening  gap between agricultural production, which grew at 2% over the last decade, and  population, which grew at 3%.  </P> <P> At the three-day conference the FAO will outline a series of remedial steps for  which it has budgeted $527 million in 1990-91. Land reclamation, soil  conservation and increasing food production by training farmers in more  efficient methods will be the focus of the FAO plan.  </P></p>

			<p>940217 FT  17 FEB 94 / Value of jobless data questioned: Department of Employment statistics under fire Political debate resumed yesterday over the meaning of Britain's official monthly unemployment figures. Mr John Prescott, Labour's employment spokesman, for once refused to comment on the rise in registered jobless. 'Whether the total out of work goes up or down, I am no longer going to take part in a sterile debate about statistics that are irrelevant to unemployment,' he said. He added that the monthly count of the number of jobless people claiming unemployment-related benefit was 'not a true measure of unemployment'. Mr Prescott said the claimant count understated the jobless total by about 30 per cent. Mr Prescott is due to meet Mr Peter Stibbard, head of the Department of Employment's statistical services, to discuss how the unemployment figures are compiled. Mr Prescott said he hoped this could lead to agreement with the government on 'a proper measure of unemployment'. The government estimates that its new jobseeker's allowance to replace unemployment benefit in the spring of 1996 will cut the monthly overall jobless figure by up to 90,000. Mr Prescott would like to replace the present monthly benefit headcount as the basis for the jobless total with the assessment based on a controlled sample of households, currently used in the government's quarterly labour force survey. People without work in the labour force survey sample are asked if they want a job, whether they have looked for one in the previous four weeks and if they ready to start work the next week. The latest quarterly figure based on those questions showed there were 2.894m people jobless in the second quarter of last year. This compared with an average total of 2.811m unemployed for the same period compiled from the benefit claimants. As Mr Paul Convery of the independent Unemployment Unit pointed out yesterday, however, the difference between the two figures varies dramatically. He said: 'The labour force survey figures are very sensitive to people's perceptions of the labour market.' The existing benefit count system costs Pounds 1m a year and the quarterly labour force survey Pounds 6m a year.</p>

			<p>930429 FT  29 APR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The clear contender  -Beer is the latest product to get the transparent treatment in the battle for US market share It looks like gin and tonic with a frothy head. It tastes like . . . well, some sort of a fizzy drink. This is Clear Beer, a new product which Miller Brewing, the second largest beer producer in the US and part of the giant Philip Morris group, launched this month in selected markets. Consumers in Austin (Texas), Richmond (Virginia) and Minneapolis (Minnesota) were able to purchase the bottled brew immediately. A 12-ounce can version will be available next month. Why, it might be asked, should anyone even contemplate marketing a colourless ale? The answer is twofold. In part, the new brew is a response to the large but moribund US beer market where innovation is essential to sales growth. In part, however, Miller is seeking to capitalise on one of the hottest US marketing themes: clear products. The US beer market is - if the term can be excused - flat. Total sales volume has been static at around 190m barrels for five years and the brewers' need to grab market share has become paramount. For years, the motor within the sector has been sales of lower-calorie 'light' beer, to the point where aggregate volume for the three main brands in this subsector - Miller Lite, Coors Light and Bud Light - topped 40m barrels in 1992. That was only slightly below the 46.8m barrels of Budweiser  -the nation's top-selling brew - which disappeared down American throats. Miller's theory is that the new clear product will offer a 'full beer flavour', but be perceived as lacking the 'heaviness' which the traditional amber nectar imparts. But the beer has the same alcohol content as any ordinary American beer, and is made from a traditional mix of hops, barley and cereal grains. Yet the colourless pint delivers a lower carbohydrate count - about half that of a conventional beer. This, plus the beer's appearance, may persuade drinkers that it is actually a 'lighter' product. A little surprisingly, the promotional campaign surrounding the new beverage is more concerned with persuading consumers that 'clear beer' is really beer, than with playing up its wholesome image. 'Great beer-drinking beer' is the advertising tagline devised by New York agency Cliff Freeman - with repetition of the word 'beer' designed to emphasis the drink's authenticity. Ears of corn are also prominent on the label design. Whether drinkers take to Clear Beer only time will tell. But the product's launch does point up the very discernable marketing trend towards colourless products in the US which is now beginning to appear in UK. This is usually viewed as an outcrop of the pro-health, pro-environment concerns which have been a driving force in the consumer goods sector in the 1990s. According to New Product News, in Chicago, about three dozen clear products hit the supermarket shelves last year, ranging from mouthwashes to rubbish bags. Included in the list are offerings from some of the nation's biggest consumer goods companies. In December, for example, PepsiCo launched 'Crystal Pepsi', a clear, no-preservative version of the traditional soft drink. Coca-Cola is retaliating with 'Tab Clear', its own colourless cola. Meanwhile, in the toiletries area, Gillette has introduced 'Cleargel deodorant'. Procter &amp; Gamble is making a clear Ivory dishwashing liquid  - a product which has traditionally been 'milky-cream' - and selling it in transparent containers. Colgate-Palmolive, a rival detergents manufacturer, is doing likewise. There is even a clear petrol produced by Amoco. Though this is not actually a new product, the gasoline has been renamed 'Crystal Clear Amoco Ultimate' and is being promoted more actively and distributed more widely. Many of these products have been on the market for too short a time for any sensible assessment of their selling power to be made. Most manufacturers admit that curiosity may be a factor in driving up post-launch sales, and market research firms such as A C Nielson decline to supply figures on market share for recently launched products. That said, there are some early indications that shoppers are proving responsive. The trade press, for example, has suggested that Crystal Pepsi may have taken about 2.4 per cent of the large US soft drinks market in the first few months since its nationwide launch. Pepsi says that figure - if correct - 'would make us ecstatic'. The company's goal is to have the product command a 2 per cent market share by the end of this year, which would equate to sales of more than Dollars 1bn. Pepsi is currently considering whether to launch the product overseas. P&amp;G, which replaced its entire Ivory dishwashing liquid line with the new clear version last summer, also says that both sales and market share have increased since then, although it declines to give numbers. But nearly all of these manufacturers are savvy enough to suggest that the 'clearness' of the product is merely a visual means of emphasising underlying product enhancements. P&amp;G, for example, claims that the 'colourless' revamp of its dishwashing liquid accompanied a product reformulation, and that this enhanced Ivory's 'grease-cutting' ability. Palmolive calls its colourless detergent 'Palmolive Sensitive Skin' - to stress the additional cosmetic benefits. Pepsi, meanwhile, notes that Crystal is also a no-preservative, no-caffeine product. 'Yes, it's a clear product,' says the company, 'but that's just one of its marketing attributes. Making a clear drink was not our primary aim.' Clarity, however, does not come cheap. Since these products generally claim benefits over their traditional counterparts, with lack of colour being used to emphasise this fact, they tend to cost more. For example, a 22-oz bottle of Sensitive Skin dishwashing liquid costs Dollars 2.29 in a Manhattan supermarket, compared with Dollars 2.19 for the traditional version. Virtue, in short, has its price.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- PRODUCTS ALREADY ON THE MARKET  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Deodorants                                 11 Rubbish bags                                5 Soaps                                       2 Skin care products                          3 Soft drinks                                11 Hard surface care (dishwashing soaps)       2 Sparkling waters                           32 Juices (sparkling)                          3 Coolers                                     3 Other health care items                     1 Other beverages                             5 Beer/lager                                  1 Sweetener/honey                             1 Oral care products (mouthwash)              3  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: New Product News  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p>940919 FT  19 SEP 94 / International Company News: Apple to allow Macintosh clones Apple Computer is today expected to unveil plans to license its Macintosh software to other manufacturers, for the first time allowing them to produce Macintosh 'clones'. This follows an announcement on Friday by IBM that it is to delay release of its long-awaited PowerPC computers until the first half of next year. The company said the postponement of this new generation of personal computers, based on its PowerPC microprocessor, would hopefully enable it to take advantage of more software being available. The delay is a further setback for IBM's PC business, which has been losing market share to competitors for the past six months. The first PowerPC personal computers had been scheduled for introduction next month, and were seen as helping the company to regain its momentum. IBM said that although desktop and mobile PowerPC models are already being shipped to select customers and software developers, general availability has been postponed. Last month, Mr Rick Thoman, IBM senior vice-president in charge of all IBM's personal computer related businesses, acknowledged that PowerPC currently lacks the software base to make it attractive to most PC users, and last week IBM confirmed that it has yet to complete development of a PowerPC version of its OS/2 PC operating system software. PowerPC microprocessor technology has been jointly developed by IBM with Apple Computer and Motorola over the past three years. PowerPC chips were initially seen as a challenge to the market leadership of Intel, which holds about 90 per cent of the market for 'brain' chips used in PCs. However, the prospects for PowerPC displacing Intel's technology as an industry standard now appear to be increasingly remote. Other PC manufacturers that have shown interest in the technology are generally waiting for IBM to create demand before committing significant resources to the new technology. Apple Computer, meanwhile, has been selling Macintosh computers based on PowerPC chips since March with moderate success. The early rush of orders for 'Power Macintosh' models has , however, slowed, according to market analysts. Today, Apple is expected to announce a significant shift of strategy to license its Power Macintosh software to other PC companies in a bid to boost profits and expand its influence over software application developers. Apple has long been criticised for refusing to license its Macintosh software. Many observers believe that had Apple licensed the Macintosh software, enabling other companies to 'clone' its computers, a few years ago, the software might have created a more potent challenge to Microsoft's 'Windows', the dominant software standard in the PC arena. Although Apple has yet to name any companies that have agreed to license its software, there is widespread industry speculation that IBM might be a prime candidate in view of its acknowledged lack of software for PowerPC. Others reportedly interested in licensing the Macintosh software include Olivetti of Italy and Fujitsu of Japan.</p>

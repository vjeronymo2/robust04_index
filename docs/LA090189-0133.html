			<p><P> September 1, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> MARINES HALT ORGANIZED SEARCH FOR MISSING OBSERVATION PLANE  </P> <P> The Marine Corps on Thursday discontinued an organized search for an OV-10A  Bronco observation plane and its two-man crew, which has been missing since  Aug. 24.  </P> <P> But Marine officials pledged to continue an informal search during routine  helicopter training flights, and added that volunteers from the Civil Air  Patrol would continue searching throughout the Labor Day weekend.  </P> <P> In addition, the Marines will follow up on any reports. A hot-line number  remains open to callers who may have sighted the aircraft between 11:30 a.m.  and 2:30 p.m. on Aug. 24, the time when the plane was scheduled to fly. The  number is (714) 726-2512.  </P> <P> The OV-10A Bronco is described as a small, olive-green colored aircraft driven  by two propeller engines. Its distinctive tail section consists of what would  appear to be parallel fuselages which extend from each of the engine assemblies  and are connected at the rudder by a horizontal stabilizer.  </P> <P> The missing crew members are the pilot, Marine Capt. Sergio R. Vivaldi, 29, of  Port Chester, N.Y., and the observer, Marine 1st Lt. Joel H. Piehl, 31, of  Bismarck, N.D. An intensive search has been conducted for the men, with more  than 150 aircraft canvassing the Southern California desert.  </P> <P> The plane, based at Camp Pendleton, was on a reconnaissance training mission  which could have covered an area from the base east toward the Colorado River,  north toward Las Vegas and south to the Mexican border.  </P></p>

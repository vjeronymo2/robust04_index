Over the past few years,  with a view shaping a public security system, Guangdong has  gradually gained a consensus from practice and carried out  numerous explorations on ways to strengthen comprehensive  control over public security.  <H3>  I. The Complexity of Public Security Problems Requires Us  To Exercise Comprehensive Control. </H3>   The significance of maintaining a sound social order is  known  to all because it has a great bearing not only on the safety of  thousands of thousands of families, and on the interests of  millions of people, but also on bringing about a stable and  sound environment for economic development and on the decisions  of foreign businessmen to run factories, do business, and go  sightseeing in China. Meanwhile, it is also a very serious  political issue which will produce a direct impact on the  confidence of the masses in upholding the four cardinal  principles and in carrying out reform and opening up. That is  why we have never relaxed our efforts in exercising control over  public security. However, despite the arduous efforts we have  made, the public security situation still remains quite grim.  This fact serves to show the complexity, severity, and  protractedness of our work to keep tight control over public  security, which is actually a tough social system project  involving many aspects of social life. Therefore, we cannot  succeed in our work if we just simply launch a few campaigns or  rely on the strength of one or two departments. To find  effective solutions to security problems, what we must do is to  acquire a correct understanding of the protractedness and  severity of the work, and persistently exercise comprehensive  control over public security.    First, the public security situation involves various  complicated social factors. With complicated ideological and  social roots of various sorts, different violations of the law  are a comprehensive reflection and the result of interactions of  the negative factors existing in many fields in society,  including the political, economic, ideological, and cultural  fields. Such violations are born of many adverse objective or  subjective influences which exist in the country or come from  outside the country. Problems generated from various  complicated factors have to be dealt with comprehensively from  various angles and using different measures.    Second, we should have a correct understanding of the many  rampant, stubborn, and repetitive negative factors which can  lead to security problems. Both international and domestic  political struggles are protracted in nature, as is the  corrosive influence from decadent ideologies and cultures of the  declining classes in the ideological field. For a considerably  long period of commodity economic development, the influence of  negative factors inherent in the commodity economy has also been  protracted. To resist and eliminate these influences, we must  be prepared for an extended struggle, undergo repeated trials of  strength, and never relax our efforts.    Third, during the process of reform, the shift of the new  and  old economic structures, readjustments of interest relations,  and changes in people's ideological concepts have inevitably  given rise to many contradictions and frictions, as well as  various factors leading to security problems. Since it takes  the lead in reform and is also on the forefront of opening up,  Guangdong may be the first to face more conspicuous and severe  problems in public security. Various criminal activities are  running rampant in the province and lawbreakers coming from  inland areas as well as triad forces from outside China have  committed many crimes, including drug-trafficking and  drug-taking, prostitution and patronizing prostitutes,  smuggling, robbery, and blackmail. All these problems keep  surfacing despite repeated bans, adding greater difficulties to  our control over public security. Under such circumstances, we  can attain greater results only when we make greater efforts to  unswervingly give full rein to all social forces and fight in  coordination when exercising comprehensive control over public  security.  <H3>  II. Give Play to Superiorities and Exercise Comprehensive  Control Over Public Security </H3>   Exercising comprehensive control over public security is a  societywide system project mainly characterized by integrating:  Special campaigns and the strength of the masses; central and  local supervisions; the efforts of the province itself and its  coordination with other provinces and foreign countries;  anticorruption struggles inside the party and the elimination of  evil-doing in society; and integrating short-term campaigns of  "severely cracking down on criminal activities" and "elimination  of seven evils" on the one hand and long-term efforts of  comprehensive control on the other. As regards the concrete  methods used by the system project, party and government leading  organs will coordinate all sides concerned and strive to bring  about a comprehensive effect by making use of various political,  economic, administrative, legal, educational, and cultural  means. Judging by the realistic situation in Guangdong, a  number of localities have done a good job in exercising  comprehensive control and their experience can be summarized as  follows: "Developing the economy, intensifying functions,  arousing the masses to exercise comprehensive control, paying  attention to education, and reinforcing management."  --Developing the economy. A better economy can  enable the masses to live in peace and comfort, ease up various  social contradictions, lay a foundation for reducing crime, and  provide conditions for increasing security input and upgrading  the necessary equipment. Therefore, we have persistently paid  attention to developing the economy and regarded and carried out  the work as a basic task of the system project of comprehensive  control.    --Intensifying functions. This means that we need  to give full play to the functions and roles of organs of  dictatorship, as well as the dual role of the law in protecting  the people and cracking down on criminal activities. The  procuratorial and judicial contingents are backbone forces in  the work of comprehensive control. Therefore, we need to  strengthen the building of these contingents in real terms and  we must not begrudge the money spent on reinforcing police  forces and upgrading their equipment. It is imperative to  enhance the political and professional qualities of  procuratorial and judicial workers, help them improve their  skills in struggling against crime, and nurture procuratorial  and judicial personnel who are able to act in strict accordance  with the law, handle cases with a high efficiency, and refrain  from acting impetuously or using penalties instead of adopting  legal actions. With coalitions between provinces and  municipalities, and between local governments and such special  departments as the railway and customs, we will make continued  efforts to carry out the campaign of "severely cracking down on  criminal activities," as well as other special-purpose  struggles, and strike relentless blows at criminal activities of  various sorts.    --Arousing the masses to carry out comprehensive  control over public security. The masses comprise the  biggest deterrent force against criminals and evildoers. To  prevent crime, we should not only rely on professional  contingents but also arouse and organize the forces of the  masses in an extensive way. By so doing, we can spread a  dragnet so that the criminals have no way to escape. Judging  from Guangdong's practice, we have mainly paid attention to the  following several links: 1) A joint defense has been set up by  the army, police, and militia. Security patrols, factory and  neighborhood joint defense commands, and residential quarters'  security squads have been organized in urban areas, with militia  patrols and peasants' joint defense commands in rural areas.  All these security-keeping units are on patrol duty round the  clock in key districts, sections, and units; open and covered  sentinels have been posted in hotbeds of criminal cases; and a  patrol duty system as well as police information posts have been  set up in all neighborhoods, buildings, residential quarters,  and key vital communication lines. 2) Giving full play to the  roles of security teams in public places, especially hotels,  shopping malls, and banks, and establishing a strict internal  management system. 3) Setting up and perfecting the militia and  joint defense organizations and bringing the roles of these  grass-roots organs into full play. 4) Setting up antigambling  and antidrug associations across the rural areas, organizing  youths and women and helping them enter contracts and supervise  each other in the struggle against gambling and drugs. 5)  Encouraging the masses to exercise supervision, inform against  lawbreakers, and to give assistance in cracking criminal cases.  We need to commend and give people handsome rewards for their  heroic behavior and their contribution to solving criminal  cases, thus creating a general social mood that "everybody has  responsibility for maintaining sound social order." 6)  Earnestly strengthening management over the floating population  and apartments rented by the hour. 7) Carrying out  rectification in areas and units where there are relatively more  problems to prevent them from becoming criminal dens. Practice  has proved that all these measures are workable and effective  and have played an important role in maintaining public security  and stability in our province.    --Paying attention to education. The process of  comprehensive control, viewed from a vertical angle, mainly  consists of three links: Preventing and cracking down on crimes  and transforming criminals. Of the three, prevention and  transformation are positive measures. To reach the goal of  preventing crimes and checking the reemergence of crime, a  fundamental way is to do a good job in ideological, ethical, and  cultural education and enhancing the ideological, ethical, and  cultural qualities of the people. Therefore, we should regard  education as a system task and provide people of different ages  with education at different levels. Particularly, we should pay  great attention to teenagers and youths, for it is the need of  comprehensive control and the need of rearing a generation of  people of a new type. We should strengthen ideological and  ethical education in schools, education on vocational ethics in  enterprises, and education on social morality and the legal  system in the entire society, to bring about a favorable turn in  the general mood of society. We should base our education on  problems emerging during reform and opening up, guide the masses  to resist the adverse influence of the negative factors of the  commodity economy, guard against erosion from the incorrect  concept of "evaluating everything in terms of money" and become  rich through legalized operations and honest labor. Careful  ideological education, mediation, and guidance are also required  in solving contradictions and disputes among the people, so that  these contradictions and disputes do not turn into security  problems. Departments in charge of reeducating criminals through  labor should work together with society; give full play to the  roles of enterprises, neighborhoods, townships, and villages in  reeducating and transforming criminals; and do a good job in  arranging the resettlement and employment of personnel who have  undergone reeducation through labor. In addition, we also need  to adopt vivid forms to enable the masses to educate themselves.  --Reinforcing management. Setting up and perfecting  rules and regulations on social security and management is a  basic task of comprehensive control. With strict rules and  regulations, as well as careful implementation, we can plug all  loopholes and eliminate all evildoing in the light of the  system. First of all, we need to set up a target responsibility  system and implement the target down to the grass-roots levels  by translating the general target of security into various  concrete and workable goals, requirements, and measures in  accordance with the principle that: "Whoever takes charge  should assume the responsibility." Leaders at all levels as well  as persons in charge of grass-roots units should take charge of  security affairs and regard security work as one of the contents  of the target responsibility system during their tenure.  Second, efforts should be made to set up and perfect various  concrete management systems, including management of floating  and temporary population; of guest houses, cabarets, roadside  inns, and apartments rented by the hour; of financial and  accounting; of outward remittances; and the management of  passports, frontier permits, and documents for multiple visits  to Hong Kong and Macao. Third, we should set up various  corresponding inspection and supervision systems and firmly  check violations of rules and regulations. Country rules on  maintaining social order should also be extensively drawn up in  rural areas.    All the aforementioned measures are interrelated and  inseparable and not a single one of them can be dispensed with.  Only by successfully mobilizing the entire society, taking  concerted efforts, and doing a good job at every link can we  bring about effective solutions to public security problems.  <H3>  III. Strengthening Leadership and Coordinating the Work of  All Sides </H3>   Comprehensive control over public security is a common task  for the entire society. To properly coordinate the forces of  all sides, we need a powerful command center. Therefore, party  committees and governments at all levels should place the work  of comprehensively controlling public security on their major  agenda; devote a great deal of effort, time, and resources to  the work; reinforce concrete guidance; ensure the implementation  of all measures; and set up corresponding work organs.  Departments under the party and mass system, including party  and youth league organizations, trade unions, women's  federations, and the militia; sectors on the propaganda,  cultural, and education front, including the press, publication,  films, television, broadcasting, schools, and hospitals; organs  on the procuratorial and judicial front, including public  security organs, procuratorates, people's courts, judicial  organs, and departments in charge of reeducation through labor;  and government departments, including industrial and commercial  bureaus, taxation departments, banks, audition departments, and  the customs should all work together to make the work a success.  Party committees and governments at all levels should draw up  unified work plans on the comprehensive control of public  security and strengthen, in particular, the building of  grass-roots organizations. If we succeed in the building of  leading bodies at the grass-roots level, we can surely fulfill  the task of comprehensive control down to every grass-roots  organization.    Whether or not the command center of comprehensive control  over public security can work with high efficiency and high  authority depends on whether or not it can perform an exemplary  role in observing and acting in strict accordance with the law.  Therefore, party and government leaders at all levels should  integrate comprehensive control of public security with the work  of opposing corruption and maintaining a clean administration.  So long as the leaders succeed in taking a good lead, the  entire system project of comprehensive control can be carried  through efficiently and all problems with public security can be  solved properly.</p>

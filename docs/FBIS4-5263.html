			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, April 8 KYODO -- Business leaders expressed  concern Friday [8 April] over the effects of Prime Minister  Morihiro Hosokawa's decision to step down on the domestic  economy and Japan-U.S. relations.    Hosokawa's abrupt decision, announced Friday, sent a shock  wave through the business community as it came at a time when  the Japanese economy showed signs of recovery.    Takeshi Nagano, president of the Japan Federation of  Employers Associations (Nikkeiren), expressed serious concern  that Hosokawa's decision may cause adverse effects on the  domestic economy.    He expressed hope that a new government will be installed as  soon as possible to prevent a further delay in the enactment of  the fiscal 1994 budget.    Kosaku Inaba, chairman of the Japan Chamber of Commerce and  Industry, stressed the need for Japan to maintain political  stability at a time when Japan-U.S. economic relations have  entered a delicate stage.    Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Federation of Economic  Organizations (Keidanren), appreciated the Hosokawa  administration for its achievements in a short period, such as  political reforms and the decision to open Japan's rice market.    Masaru Hayami, president of the Japan Association of  Corporate Executives (Keizai Doyukai), said he will continue to  seek political reforms by the next administration.    Osamu Uno, head of the Kansai Economic Federation, urged the  ruling coalition to form a new government as soon as possible.</p>

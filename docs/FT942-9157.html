			<p>940517 FT  17 MAY 94 / International Company News: Reshuffle at Kodak Eastman Kodak of the US is combining its corporate and Kodak Imaging Group staffs, Reuter reports from Rochester. The group said this was one step in creating a corporate structure 'consistent with the corporate strategy' unveiled two weeks ago by chief executive Mr George Fisher. Under the new structure, Mr Leo Thomas will remain president of Kodak Imaging Group with Mr Richard Bourns joining him in the general management of Imaging as executive vice president of the group. Mr Bourns is now a senior vice president with responsibility for Kodak manufacturing operations. Both will have full responsibility across the group, Kodak said. Mr Wilbur J. Prezzano, who remains president of Kodak's Health Group, is spearheading the company's effort to divest its non-imaging health businesses, the company noted.</p>

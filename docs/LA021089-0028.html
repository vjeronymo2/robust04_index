			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> COLLEGE NOTES / ALAN DROOZ: LIONS, GAELS HAVE ANOTHER SHOWDOWN -- BETWEEN WOMEN  </P> <P> Once again, it's showdown week for Loyola Marymount and St. Mary's in Gersten  Pavilion. The Gaels go into the weekend holding a one-game lead over Loyola in  the West Coast Athletic Conference and come to town Saturday.  </P> <P> This week, the gym probably won't be packed, and Sports Illustrated won't be on  hand. This is the distaff battle for first place in the WCAC. While the men's  team is playing at St. Mary's on Saturday, the women will be in as fierce a  race of their own.  </P> <P> Loyola is 14-9 overall, 6-2 in the WCAC, while St. Mary's (14-8, 7-1) and  Gonzaga (11-11, 7-1) are fighting for the title which could result in an NCAA  or NIT bid.  </P> <P> The Lions are 9-1 at home and get help from the schedule, with four of their  last six games in Gersten. Gonzaga is one of their two remaining road games,  next weekend.  </P> <P> While aiming at St. Mary's, the Lions can't stumble tonight against  fourth-place San Diego (7-11, 3-5). Every game is crucial.  </P> <P> In contrast to the men's match-up, the Loyola women are the more conservative  team compared to St. Mary's, the highest-scoring women's team in the WCAC and  one of the most proficient three-point shooting teams in the country.  </P> <P> The Lions don't have a player in the WCAC's scoring top 10, while St. Mary's  has the top two, Anja Bordt (22.1) and Cheree Tappin (19.5).  </P> <P> However, Loyola has been playing a more up-tempo game lately and has spread the  scoring around generously. Lynn Flanagan, at 10.9 points per game, Tricia  Gibson at 10.3, Regan O'Hara at 10.1 and Kristen Bruich at 9.3 are closely  bunched, and freshman Nicole Taylor, a spot starter the last two weeks, has  been the leading scorer in two of the last three games.  </P> <P> "We're scoring more points (than earlier)," said Loyola Coach Todd Corman. "Our  team is different than the others. Every other team has one player in the top  scorers. We don't. Everybody gets their points and rebounds. We're an equal  opportunity employer. It's been successful for us. It's been a real team  effort."  </P> <P> Loyola defeated St. Mary's this season, 74-65, before Bordt was eligible. St.  Mary's returned the favor last week in Moraga, 78-64. Since Bordt joined the  lineup in December, the Gaels have attempted more three-pointers than any other  team in the nation. Bordt has the individual high in the conference, 36 points,  and also leads the WCAC in assists, 6.4 per game.  </P> <P> "St. Mary's is probably the team to beat, and they probably have the player  with the most influence in Bordt," Corman said. "When she's in the game, it's a  whole different team. We've got to control her. We hope on the road they're not  gonna hit those (three-point) shots. Saturday's game should be an up-tempo  affair. We're 1-1. We want to take the rubber match."  </P> <P> With three weeks to go, however, Corman isn't ready to think about a first-ever  appearance in postseason play. "That's premature," he said. "The schedule  favors us. We've just got to go out and perform."  </P> <P> St. Mary's Bordt has followed an extensive itinerary on her way to becoming the  West Coast Athletic Conference's best female player.  </P> <P> The high-scoring guard, who leads the WCAC in scoring and assists, ranks among  national leaders in scoring, three-point percentage and three-point baskets per  game. She set a school record with a seven-of-eight performance from  three-point range against Portland in January.  </P> <P> Maybe her records should be listed as international. The 5-foot-8 native of  Helsinki, Finland, came to the United States as a high school exchange student  in Wisconsin in 1983. After graduation she returned to Helsinki for two years,  playing on the Finnish National Team, before heading to UC Berkeley, where she  was named to the freshman All-American team for the 1986-87 season.  </P> <P> However, Bordt didn't like the program at Berkeley and returned to Finland to  help the national team prepare for the European championships and a shot at the  Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> When the Finns didn't qualify for Seoul, Bordt surfaced at St. Mary's, where  she enjoys the atmosphere of the small school in Moraga as well as the team's  up-and-coming status and wide-open style.  </P> <P> Bordt, though only a sophomore, is older than most of her teammates at 23 and  is married to a San Francisco tennis pro. However, her coach says marriage  hasn't tempered Bordt's athletic zeal. "Her obvious talent level is a plus,"  said Gaels Coach Terri Rubenstein. "But in addition to that, her level of  intensity raises the play of the entire team. I have never coached anyone else  with the amount of competitive drive that Anja has."  </P> <P> Saturday Night Live, Barely -- West Coast Athletic Conference men's basketball  coaches were upset when the conference shifted from a Thursday-Saturday format  to Friday-Saturday. After last weekend, visiting teams were 8-8 on Fridays,  4-12 on Saturdays.  </P> <P> Loyola Coach Paul Westhead said his team's style may prove to be an advantage  in the tough travel schedule. "I think we'll play better back-to-back nights  than most teams," he said, "because of the way our guys extend themselves  everyday in practice. Teams talk about being worn down that second night, but  we're used to that."  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Salih Qallab: "Reports of Disagreements Among </F> Northern Leaders. Hard-Liners Insist on Fighting to the End"]    [Text] Amman -- A senior Yemeni official has said over the  telephone from Sanaa that a sharp disagreement has erupted among  senior northern leaders over the mission of the UN secretary  general's envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, and the proposal he submitted  two days ago to hold a meeting in Cairo between Sanaa and Aden  delegations.    The official said that the disagreement necessitated holding  an emergency meeting under Yemeni President 'Ali 'Abdallah  Salih. It was attended by Shaykh 'Abdallah Bin-Husayn al-Ahmar,  speaker of the House of Representatives, Dr. 'Abd-al-Majid  al-Zindani, and 'Abdallah al-Anisi, representing the Yemeni  Reform Grouping [YRG]; and by Dr. 'Abd-al-Karim al-Iryani, Dr.  Muhammad Sa'id al-'Attar, and Colonel 'Ali Muhsin al-Ahmar,  representing the General People's Congress [GPC].    The official said that a severe disagreement dominated the  meeting, and that Dr. al-Iryani was the first speaker, maybe in  coordination with President 'Ali Salih. And that he -- that is,  al-Iryani -- stressed that Sanaa has tried everything to resolve  the situation, and it is impossible for things to continue in  this manner forever.    According to the Yemeni official, al-Iryani stressed that  his  country has become isolated and has lost the support of  neighboring states and numerous Arab states. And that it has  been placed in the category of Iraq and Iraqi President Saddam  Husayn -- which will lead it into an unenviable situation.    Al-Iryani proposed that President 'Ali 'Abdallah Salih  personally make an Arab tour to include neighboring states,  Egypt, and some other states in order to break what he termed  the political siege imposed on Sanaa. He also proposed that  southern [as published] deputies make an Arab tour to explain  the northern Yemeni capital's view of the ongoing war.    The Yemeni official stressed that the YRG leaders -- Shaykh  al-Ahmar, 'Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, and Dr. al-Zindani, supported  by Col. Muhsin al-Ahmar -- rejected the idea of sending a  delegation to Cairo and insisted on continuing the fighting and  not responding to the UN mediation. They said that Aden is now  in their grasp and that any cease-fire is going to make them  lose the military battle after having lost the political battle.    The official pointed out that President Salih is in an  unenviable mental situation. That he has made great efforts to  persuade senior members of his leadership to send a northern  delegation to Cairo. And that he threatened to boycott the  meeting before the participants agreed to his proposal in this  connection.    The Yemeni official noted that the delegation Sanaa sent to  Cairo has a partisan and not an official capacity -- which means  that the northern leadership insists that the dialogue with the  southerners must remain within the framework that existed before  the eruption of the fighting, as discussions were conducted  between the GPC and the YRG on the one hand and the Yemeni  Socialist Party on the other.</p>

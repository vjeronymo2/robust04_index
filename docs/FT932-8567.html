			<p>930518 FT  18 MAY 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Strike called off at Danish Slaughterhouses WORK WAS resumed at Danish slaughterhouses yesterday after they were paralysed by a three-week strike of 16,000 workers, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen. The workers won the right never to work more than 37 hours a week but they expect to be doing substantial overtime in the next few weeks to make up the back log of pigs waiting for slaughter caused by the strike.</p>

			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Japanese face up to getting old: Planned changes to the pension system Mrs Setsuyo Uchida, a 71-year-old widow living on the outskirts of Tokyo, has been drawing a state pension for more than 15 years. 'I really wouldn't know what to do without it,' she says. Mrs Uchida is one of 27m Japanese pensioners on the state system, which provides citizens over the age of 60 with pensions worth 70 per cent of average employees' salaries. It is a tidy and generous system, but it is in for a change. Japan's is a rapidly ageing society, expected to have the highest percentage of people over 65 among industrialised nations by the turn of the century. Now the ministry of health and welfare wants to raise the pension eligibility age to 65 to decrease the contribution burden on workers supporting the system. At the moment, by paying 14 per cent of their gross salaries, 6.5 workers support one pensioner. By 2020 some 2.2 workers will be supporting one pensioner with more than 30 per cent of gross salary. If however the retirement age is changed to 65 some 2.6 workers will pay 26 per cent of their salaries to support one pensioner. The proposal has been met by fierce opposition from the influential trade union confederation Rengo. Mr Yoshio Tsuchida, director of Rengo's welfare policy planning department, points out that Japanese companies have just grown accustomed to the retirement age being raised to 60. Although the goal of 60 as a standard retirement age is still not accepted by all companies, progress has been made over the past decade as the government has promoted a later retirement age through subsidies to companies that retain or re-hire older workers. However, Japan's seniority-based employment system puts a large cost burden on companies retaining older employees, and although the government claims by re-hiring elderly workers companies can counter the expected labour shortage, job offers for workers over 55 remain at low levels. 'What are people supposed to do between the ages of 60 and 64 if the pension eligibility rate is raised to 65?' asks Mr Tsuchida. The government, which reviews its state system and resets its premium rates every four years, needs to reach a decision by April next year, as it cannot afford to postpone the matter until the next review in 2007 when Japan's baby-boomers reach 60. Although the pension council, an advisory group to the government made up of union leaders, bureaucrats, and representatives from the business community, failed to agree on a single reform blueprint, a recent report from the council suggests that a compromise deal is in sight. On one hand, the ministry is easing its rigid stance on the shift in eligibility age by proposing a reduced benefit system for pensioners between the ages 60 and 64 instead of no benefits until 65. The ministry admits it is aware that some sort of compensation needs to be made for that age group since at the moment two-thirds of pensioners start receiving their pensions between the ages of 60 and 64. Meanwhile Rengo has agreed that workers' twice-yearly bonus payments should not be exempt from pension contributions. It has also accepted a change in the way pension increases are calculated. At the moment these are based on increases in average gross salaries. However, by basing the increases in pension payments on the average growth of net income - gross income minus taxes and social security contributions - pensioners will also 'share' the burden of increases of workers' welfare contributions and the government can avoid the possibility of workers taking home less net cash than pensioners. Professor Noriyuki Takayama of Hitotsubashi University's Institute of Economic Research in Tokyo says basing pension growth on net salaries will ease the burden on the workers who support the system by 10 per cent and is more effective than altering the pension age. He says that the government has become enthusiastic over the plan after Germany implemented a similar scheme as a part of its pension system reform in 1992. Over the next few months, Rengo and the government will need to work out what the levels of partial pension payments for pensioners aged 60 to 64 will be. Prof Takayama says the government should set up a special fund which companies would also be required to pay into. He suggests that an incentive system should be set up where the payments into the special fund would decline as the company takes on more elderly workers.

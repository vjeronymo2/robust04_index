			<p><P> September 16, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEBATE OVER FAIRNESS OF PROP. 13  </P> <P> Jonathan Coupal's column, like Proposition 13 itself, is simple, easy to  understand, and wrong ("Proposition 13 Has Made Everyone's Tax Reasonable,"  Op-Ed Page, Aug. 29). It is also equivocal.  </P> <P> Property tax laws should not contain "absolute certain(ies)" any more than the  price of food or fuel should or could be absolutely certain.  </P> <P> Plainly, it is not good social policy to throw people from their homes for  non-payment of exorbitant taxes; but it is also poor policy to lock in  assessment increases with no consideration of future budget requirements.  </P> <P> Justice Frank Richardson's "roughly comparable" analogy to sales taxes refutes  Coupal's point. Sales taxes are directly related to current value. As the cost  of goods fluctuates, so does the cost of government, and so do sales tax  collections; to imply that one class of Californian (long-term property owners)  should be immune to inflation at the expense of others, is not "equal  protection under the law."  </P> <P> Coupal's argument that everyone's tax is "reasonable" because of an arbitrary  1% cap ignores the point. If our schools, our hospitals, our fire and police  are responsive to us all, then we must all pay a fair share. The 1% tax  currently provides sufficient funds.  </P> <P> But what if housing prices had not so outrageously surpassed inflation to  provide those funds? Are we to devise a new plan, some new Proposition 13, when  the real estate rocket levels off? Is that "reasonable"?  </P> <P> Proposition 13 is a Ponzi scheme, where the new entrants pay the bills of the  older players. It is "unfair." It is shortsighted. It is not good tax policy.  </P> <P> JOSEPH W. DOHERTY  </P> <P> Los Angeles  </P></p>

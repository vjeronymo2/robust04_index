			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / UK Company News: Strong performance by publishing boosts Boosey STRAINS OF Stravinsky, Rachmaninoff carried Boosey &amp; Hawkes, the instrument maker and music publisher, to a 24 per cent increase in profits last year. The pre-tax return at one of Britain's oldest music publishers rose from Pounds 3.25m to Pounds 4m for the 1991 year on turnover 9 per cent higher at Pounds 53.7m. The strongest performance came from the music publishing division where turnover rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 11.6m with operating profits jumping 31 per cent to Pounds 3.5m. Mr Richard Holland, chief executive, said the bulk of the division's profits growth had been derived from royalties. The group continued to seek out and sign new talent - such as John Adams, composer of the opera Nixon in China. He warned, however, that growth in publishing would slow this year, as the sharp increase had followed a meagre rise in 1990. The group closed its printing factory in north London. Mr Holland said the benefits of contracting out the work would be felt this year. The costs of closing the factory and shutting a loss-making Scandinavian company offset the gain of Pounds 0.5m on yen exchange rates. The instrument division was hit by the effects of the Gulf war and recession. Turnover increased by 8 per cent to Pounds 42.1m while operating profit benefited from cost cutting to rise by 13 per cent to Pounds 3.1m. The group, 51 per cent owned by the US music publisher Carl Fischer and its pension fund, cut gearing by 5 percentage points to 69 per cent. Earnings were 60p (49.4p). The final dividend is raised to 14.5p for a total of 20p (16.4p).</p>

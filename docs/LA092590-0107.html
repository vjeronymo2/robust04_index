			<p><P> September 25, 1990, Tuesday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE;  </P> <P> CITY REJECTS RESCUE OF GROVE FESTIVAL  </P> <P> A last-ditch plea to rescue the financially strapped Grove Shakespeare Festival  was rejected Monday night by the Garden Grove City Council.  </P> <P> The council, on a 3-2 vote, turned down two proposals to save the festival.  </P> <P> The first proposal was to give the Grove festival $30,000 normally allocated  for televising the Strawberry Festival Parade. The second was to give the  festival $20,000 in redevelopment funds.  </P> <P> The council had voted two weeks ago to spend $7,248 to temporarily help the  festival through what Barbara Hammerman, the managing director of the festival,  called "a short-term but serious cash-flow crisis."  </P> <P> Late Monday night, the board of directors for the Garden Grove Assn. for Arts,  the parent organization for the festival, voted to cancel "A Child's Christmas  in Wales," the final play in the 1990 season but to proceed with "The  Importance of Being Earnest" on Oct. 4 at the Gem Theatre.  </P> <P> According to Hammerman, to close down the festival will cost an estimated  $120,000, including refunds and lost deposits.  </P></p>

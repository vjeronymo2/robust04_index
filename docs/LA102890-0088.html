One unidentified Hawthorne cheerleader  was treated for injuries, Finnegan said. District officials are gathering  reports from Hawthorne High School officials who attended the game, he said.  </P> <P> A fight broke out when Hawthorne football players and visitors were leaving,  said Maurice Wiley, Inglewood school district spokesman.  </P> <P> "I have a feeling it was hot tempers more than anything else," Wiley said.  </P> <P> Finnegan said game referees are planning to file a report with the California  Interscholastic Federation-Southern Section, the governing body for high school  sports in the region.  </P></p>

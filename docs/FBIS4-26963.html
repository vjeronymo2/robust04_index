			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Wu Yi (0702 0308), Minister of Foreign Trade and </F> Economic Cooperation: "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Should  be Developed on the Basis of Equality and Mutual Benefit"]    [Text] The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Organization  (hereafter referred to as APECO) has now 17 members including  the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Papua  New Guinea, six ASEAN nations, Japan, Korea, China, Hong Kong  region, and Chinese Taipei (the title of China's Taiwan Province  in APECO). It covers a land area of 42,794,200 square  kilometers, occupying approximately 31 percent of total living  space of the world; in 1992 it had a population of 2.094  billion, accounting for about 40 percent of the world's  population. Compared with the scene of collapse after a setback  in the world economy in recent years, a considerable number of  countries and regions in this district have maintained an annual  average growth rate of over 7 percent for more than 10 years in  succession, and so far there has been no slow-down in the  momentum of growth. In 1992, the gross domestic product (GDP)  of 17 APECO members totalled 12.22745 trillion dollars, which  accounted for 50 percent of the world's total; the same year,  the total volume of their import and export trade amounted to  3.07145 trillion dollars, which accounted for 43.5 percent of  total volume of world trade. Trade among members already  occupied 67 percent of total volume of their import and export  trade, nearly 50 percent higher than the percentage of trade  among European Community members. APECO is the largest regional  organization of economic cooperation.    The emergence of APECO, fundamentally speaking, is an  inevitable outcome of the vigorous development of regional  economic integration in the world arena. Following the  independence of developing countries one after another in the  vast areas of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in the postwar  period, economic development became a major problem they faced  together. However, the old international economic order still  fettered and impeded the economic development of developing  countries whose emphases were on agriculture and the production  of raw materials and other primary products. They came to  realize that the limited "favor" and "sympathy" given by their  original suzerain states could not change the features of their  economic backwardness, and that the only effective choice for  them was developing south-south cooperation and strengthening  collective self-reliance and collective negotiation in dealing  with developed countries to improve the environment for economic  development and achieve economic progress. Soon afterwards, the  Latin American Free Trade Association, the Association of  Southeast Asian Nations, the West African Economic Community,  the Caribbean Community, and other regional economic integration  organizations of developing countries came into being. After  the 1970's, the struggle to set up a new international economic  order reached a high ebb, and regional, sub-regional, and  inter-regional economic integration organizations of developing  countries were built. Currently, there are nearly 30 different  governmental regional economic integration organizations and  economic cooperation arrangements which include a few developed  countries but mainly consist of developing countries.    In the last ten years, the rapidly developing progress of  regional economic and trade cooperation in the world arena, the  enlarged scale of cooperation, and the drastic growth of the  extent of integration also promoted the rapid emergence of  APECO. In particular, a big united European market already  started operation on January 1, 1993, and is moving toward the  European Union with economic, currency, and political union as  the final goal. Prior to this, the European Economic Zone built  up in the form of agreement by the European Community and the  European Free Trade Association (except Switzerland), and the  new development of multi-lateral economic and trade cooperation  arrangements between the EEC countries and some central and east  European countries posed fierce challenges to various countries.  After many setbacks, the North American Free Trade Agreement  went into effect on January 1, 1994, and became the largest free  trade zone in the world. Regional economic integration  organizations of developing countries in Central and South  America, the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and various places in  central, east, and west Africa started developing from loose to  close economic cooperation. While continuing to emphasize  collective self-reliance, they actively explored the possibility  of developing regional or trans-regional economic cooperation  with nearby or related developed countries to avoid being  excluded from cooperation arrangements and loss of trade  opportunities. This proves that with the development of the  world economy toward integration and conglomeration,  international economic ties have become increasingly close, and  strengthening cooperation and exchange with each other has  become an indispensable part of economic development. It was  precisely under the push by this tide that APECO was set up to  better meet global and regional economic and trade challenges,  and to make use of and create more opportunities to develop and  promote economic prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region.    APECO has developed rapidly in the last three years. The  most important reason lies in consensus brought about among  various member states on the basis of joint economic  development, with the same goal of and identical steps toward  cooperation. The "Seoul Declaration," adopted at the Third  APECO Conference at ministerial level, defined the purpose and  goal of reducing barriers, upholding opening-up,  interdependence, and developing common interests. In the past  few years, to achieve these goals, APECO did fruitful jobs at  multiple levels. The ministerial-level conference held every  year has provided a place for high-level consultation and  exchanges of views among members on Asia-Pacific economic issues  and trends, the strengthening of the multi-lateral trade  structure, regional free trade, and other issues of common  concern, thereby deepening mutual understanding and exchanging  information. The results of the conferences at ministerial  level have not only provided policy guidance, supervision, and  inspection for all kinds of work and activities of APECO, but  also directly promoted the strengthening of a multi-lateral  trade structure for the whole world, and become a catalytic  agent for the successful completion of the Uruguay round  multi-lateral trade negotiations. The "APECO Trade and  Investments Framework Declaration" adopted at the fifth  ministerial-level conference laid down a firm foundation and  principles for developing substantial economic cooperation among  members in the sphere of trade and investments and formulated  working plans. If this "Framework Declaration" can be  effectively carried out, it will be favorable to the balanced  development of APECO economic and trade cooperation and to  enlarging economic and trade exchanges among members. At the  working team level, trade, investments, science and technology,  energy, human resources development, and other departments were  bustling with activities which included all sorts of specific  items of economic cooperation among members. In the sphere of  trade alone, a large amount of cooperation has been developed in  a few short years in trade statistics among members, setting up  trade and investments data bases, building an Asia-Pacific  information communications system, compiling a guidebook to  Asia-Pacific investments systems, examination and approval of  administrative measures related to market admission,  coordination of procedures for passing through customs, setting  up Asia-Pacific tax rate data base, unanimity of standards, and  promotion of trade for small and medium enterprises. Positive  preliminary results have been achieved.    The convening of an unofficial meeting of APECO leaders in  November, 1993, pushed economic cooperation of the organization  to an unprecedented height. Leaders of the original 15 members  gathered in Seattle to discuss principles and matters of vital  importance concerning Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and to  promote economic co-prosperity among members. The "Economic  Prospects Declaration" adopted at the meeting once again  emphasized that an open multi-lateral trade structure was the  basis of economic growth in Asia-Pacific region, and it was  determined at the meeting to continue dismantling trade and  investment barriers by partnership and in an open spirit to  promote greater free flow of commodities, services, and funds  among members and between APECO members and other regions in the  world. The "Declaration" reiterated its support for developing  APECO into a forum devoted to creating practical economic  interests for the region, encouraging broadening of economic  dialogue among members, strengthening specific cooperation  items, and initiating entrepreneurial spirit and a market  guidance policy. Feeling no need for reticence, this unofficial  meeting of leaders has achieved the results that leaders of most  members had expected. However, the convening of this meeting  itself is of more profound significance and more far- reaching  influence than the specific results achieved at the meeting.  The gathering of leaders showed the high degree of concern for  and importance attached to APECO and its activities and their  determination and confidence in successfully developing  Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. The convening of the meeting  of leaders has evoked strong repercussions in the world. People  are watching closely the movements of APECO and the impact they  may possibly have on the world.    China is a large developing country in Asia with 9.6  million square kilometers of area and a 1.17 billion population.  Since China began the policy of reform and opening-up in 1979,  its economic development has advanced full steam ahead and  presented a scene of prosperity. In 1992, China's gross  domestic product (GDP) amounted to 424 billion dollars, ranking  fourth after the United States, Japan, and Canada among APECO  members; total volume of China's import and export trade reached  165.6 billion dollars, ranking fifth after the United States,  Japan, Canada, and Hong Kong region. In the total volume,  China's trade with APECO members amounted to 126.3 billion  dollars, accounting for 76 percent of China's total volume of  foreign trade. The same year, China actually drew a total of 11  billion dollars of direct investments from outside, of which  10.26 billion dollars from APECO members, 93.2 percent of  China's total of direct investments China from outside; the  contracted amount of China's technological transfer with APECO  members was 3.5 billion dollars, 44 percent of China's total  technological trade that year. It can thus be seen: Whether  judged by land, population, or by economic scale, including  market, China occupies an extremely important position in APECO,  and without China's partial or full participation, Asia-Pacific  economic cooperation will not be complete and truly effective.  On the other hand, APECO is also in extremely important  strategic position with regard to China's expansion of foreign  economic relations and trade. The prosperity of the Asia-Pacific  economy depends to a very large extent on development of China's  economy, and development of China's economy must also have the  Asia-Pacific economy as an important support.    China has traditional and close economic and trade relations  with vast numbers of countries and regions in Asia-Pacific  district. We attach importance to economic and trade  cooperation with all APECO members, and are willing to  constantly push such cooperation to further develop in depth.  Since joining APECO in 1991, then, and again in 1992, China  sent Qian Qichen, state councillor and foreign minister, and Li  Lanqing, economic relations and trade minister, at the head of  Chinese delegations attending the third and the fourth  ministerial-level conferences held respectively in Seoul and  Bangkok. In 1993, as foreign economic relations and trade  minister, I accompanied Qian in leading a delegation to attend  the fifth APECO ministerial-level conference held in Seattle,  and set forth the principles and position of the Chinese  Government on Asia-Pacific economic trends, the Uruguay Round  multi-lateral trade negotiations, progress of free trade in the  region, and future movements and the direction of development of  APECO.    China also actively participated in projects organized and  sponsored by other APECO members and did constructive work. In  shenzhen in June last year, the first APECO cooperation project  in China was held -- a seminar on promotion of export by small  and medium enterprises. In May and June this year, China will  hold in Beijing an APECO scientific and technological strategic  development industrial park seminar and a trade promotion  training class. In May and June, 1995, the official conference  of APECO trade promotion working teams among governments will be  held by China for the first time, also in Beijing. To the above  projects and conferences China has already undertaken or  promised to undertake, other APECO members respond actively and  showed immense interest. They unanimously believe that the  activities we hold in China deal with concrete matters related  to work and play an important role in promoting visible economic  cooperation in Asia-Pacific region.    In November, 1993, at the invitation of President Clinton of  the United States, President Jiang Zemin went to Seattle to  attend the unofficial meeting of APECO economic leaders, which  indicated the high importance and enthusiasm attached by the  Chinese Government to the cause of Asia-Pacific economic  cooperation and its concern about the future development of  APECO. During the meeting, President Jiang Zemin met officially  with President Clinton. This meeting between the chinese and  U.S. heads of state has enhanced understanding between China and  the United States, is conducive to the development of Sino-U.S.  relations and shows that Sino-U.S. relations have entered a new  stage. President Jiang also met with the leaders of nine  countries, Australia, Canada, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New  Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, exchanged  views with them extensively on how to promote Asia-Pacific  economic cooperation and on other matters of common concern, and  further strengthened China's bilateral relations and economic  and trade exchanges with these members.    Five years have elapsed since APECO was set up, and there is  still a long long way to go. In the large environment of the  world today, along what direction and how APECO will further  develop economic cooperation among members plays a very  important part in whether or not Asia-Pacific economic  cooperation can be carried out on a long-term basis, healthily,  and effectively. Therefore, this has also become the focus of  attention of the fifth APECO ministerial-level conference and an  unofficial meeting among leaders. During the Seattle meeting,  President Jiang put forward the 16-character policy that should  be followed for developing Asia- Pacific economic cooperation:  "Mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit, opening-up to each  other, and common prosperity", and proposed that "Asia-Pacific  nations should be geared to the needs of both the Asia-Pacific  region and the world; they should be open up to both inside and  outside the region"; to develop Asia-Pacific economic  cooperation, one "should proceed from the practical situation  and characteristics of the region itself, and follow in order  and advance step by step," and "APECO should be an open,  flexible, and practical forum of economic cooperation and an  organization for consultations, and not a closed economic group  of mechanisms" and a number of other important propositions.    APECO members include both developed countries in the  north, with the world's most powerful economic strength, and  newly emerging industrialized countries in the south, as well as  other developing countries and regions that are rising  economically; they each have their own advantages in funds,  technology, management experiences, places of investments, labor  resources, consumer markets, and other fields. Therefore, they  are economically highly compatible with each other and  complementary to each other, and have extensive and broad  prospects of cooperation. Similarly, compared with economic  cooperation arrangements of other regions in the world, APECO  also has characteristics that are extremely diversified. The 17  members are varied in size and have great disparity in wealth;  there are both sovereign states and regional economies; there  are both oriental civilizations and western cultures, and there  are immense differences in national tradition and historical  backgrounds among members. It is precisely because of such  diversity that we are required to adhere to equality and mutual  benefits, following in order and advancing step by step, and  other important principles, which are both the basis for  developing Asia-Pacific economic cooperation and the fundamental  guarantee for maintaining long-term and healthy cooperation.    Except for the fact that it is impossible for sovereign  states and regional economies to be completely equal politically  and legally, APECO members should uphold the principle of  equality and mutual benefit in every aspect related to economic  cooperation. Equality means that each member has the same say on  all issues of economic cooperation in which it is interested,  and such a say should be respected by other members; in  decision-making involving economic cooperation and  organizational matters, APECO members should follow the  principle of reaching unanimity through consultation on the  basis fully developing democracy, and no member should be  allowed to control and manipulate any major decision- making or  resort to power politics. Disputes arising from cooperation  among members should be resolved through every effort of  friendly consultation without resorting to wielding and using  sanctions or a unilateralist baton. Mutual benefit means that  all activities carried out within APECO should be beneficial to  all APECO members and not just one party or a small number of  members, and not harm the interests of other members. In this  respect, we should especially be opposed to the despotic conduct  of openly violating the standards of international economic and  trade relations by any member to meet the needs of its domestic  policies. To develop Asia-Pacific economic cooperation, it is  necessary first of all to pursue various important principles  laid down in multi-lateral trade structure of GATT, including  that of granting each other member unconditional MFN treatment,  and it is also necessary to take into full account the actual  difficulties of members with low levels of economic development  and grant them differential favored treatment. In APECO, if  some members set up artificial barriers in their economic and  trade relations with other members, and are unwilling even to  respect and follow the basic principles of global trade  structure and even to grant trading partners in the same  regional organization the most minimum treatment laid down in  multi-lateral trade structure, then how can we talk about  equality and mutual benefit, and about strengthening regional  economic cooperation?    Regarding opening-up, so far as regional economic  cooperation  organization is concerned, it is to pursue open regional  cooperation. APECO members should first of all open up to each  other economically. They should not endlessly demand others to  abolish administrative measures and open up their markets to  them, while they themselves set up quotas, "automatic export  restrictions", and other non-tariff barriers, and close their  own markets to others. APECO should not only adhere to  opening-up internally, but also to opening-up to the outside  world. We must not build ourselves into a closed economic and  trading group open only internally and look upon the outside  world as competition and objects of contention. The criterion  for judging whether or not APECO is open is to see whether or  not its code of conduct and activities match with the principles  of GATT. Open regional cooperation upheld by APECO is not to go  our own way while deviating from the global multi-lateral trade  structure, but should coincide with the principles of GATT and  the world trade organization that will come into being. All  APECO conduct should be based on the global multi-lateral trade  structure, and as an important supplement to this structure,  APECO should promote its improvement and strengthening.  Economic cooperation among APECO members must not affect  economic and trade exchanges between its members and other  partners outside the organization. The two should supplement  and complement each other.    The basis of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation is neither  common social and political systems, nor common political  viewpoints and ideas of value, but the common economic interests  of various parties working together. However, when we decide on  the mode of cooperation, its growth rate, its direction, and the  final structural goals, we cannot but seriously consider and  make allowance for the level of development, differences in  social and cultural background, and other factors. Within  APECO, we neither maintain formulating impractical working plans  and goals that aim too high, nor favor designing working speed  and a structural frame divorced from reality, and we are all the  more opposed to introducing into the sphere of economic  cooperation so-called "democracy," "human rights," and other  ideas that are not in the least related to economic cooperation.  At present and even in the foreseeable future, on the basis of  full consultation and seeking common ground while reserving  differences, and within the sphere unanimously approved, we  should take some feasible action and measures, following in  order and advancing step by step, and steadily push forward  development of Asia-Pacific economic cooperation. Changes and  developments in the cooperation mechanism of APECO should also  respect and be in accord with the will of all members, and  accomplish the situation that when a melon is ripe, it falls off  its stem, and that where water flows, a channel is formed. If we  go against the will of most members, and push setting up by  force some kind of structure when conditions are not yet ripe,  it would be in the end like water without a source, or a tree  without roots, and it will do harm to the healthy operation and  development of Asia-Pacific regional economic cooperation.</p>

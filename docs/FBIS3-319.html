			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by political correspondent Themba Molefe] </F>   [Text] The African National Congress [ANC] has increased  security around its leadership after being informed of a  rightwing plot to assassinate Mr Cyril Ramaphosa.    The ANC has confirmed that Afrikaner Volksfront [National  Front -- AVF] co-leader General Constand Viljoen "volunteered"  information linking the plot with covert military operations.  The ANC has, however, not divulged the full details of  Viljoen's information and referred inquiries to him.    SOWETAN has learned that Viljoen approached the ANC with the  information because he wanted to draw suspicion away from his  people who, he said, were not part of the conspiracy. Viljoen  was this week travelling around the country on AVF and Freedom  Alliance business and could not be contacted for comment. ANC  chief media officer Mr Carl Niehaus said the organisation had  stepped up security, especially around Secretary-General  Ramaphosa, in the light of the threat. ANC leaders have been  targets of rightwing forces for some time, and several leaders  have been killed in suspected plots. The most prominent was Mr  Chris Hani, while SACP [South African Commun?st Party] chairman  Mr Joe Slovo has also been a target.</p>

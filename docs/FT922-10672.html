			<p>920430 FT  30 APR 92 / Management: Banking on an ethical approach Ethics are hardly a normal theme of corporate advertising, but they form the centrepiece of an ambitious campaign to be launched by the Co-operative Bank tomorrow which stresses businesses with which it refuses to be associated. Few attempts to restructure a company can have been so fundamentally linked to marketing objectives or as widely tested among existing customers. Terry Thomas, managing director and the bank's first marketing director when he joined in the early 1970s, makes no secret that the ethical stance is designed to win new business. The issues highlighted were approved by 30,000 of the bank's 1.5m customers canvassed in a questionnaire late last year. Those most widely supported - arms exports, environmental damage, cosmetics-testing on animals and human rights - are the ones to be used. The first two television advertisements - which will appear in three northern TV regions, reflecting the bank's heartland - focus on environmental damage and arms exports. They are striking for their simplicity, mostly filmed in black-and-white, with a series of sketched stills accompanied by a voice-over. There is a long silence before the final message: that some banks will use depositors' money for unethical purposes, while the Co-op will not. 'They stand in contrast to typical financial services ads which are glossy, colourful and often criticised for not living up to expectations,' says Simon Williams, head of marketing. 'Ours are stark, straight-talking and come as quite a shock.' Press advertising will include the broadsheet newspapers and specialist magazines catering to some of the interest groups likely to respond to the issues the bank is raising. The bank is coy about the costs of the campaign, although the bill is believed to be more than Pounds 1m.</p>

			<p><P> April 27, 1989, Thursday, South Bay Edition  </P> <P> SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESIDENTS PROTEST REFINERY UNIT  </P> <P> At an emotional special meeting of the Carson City Council, neighbors of the  Fletcher oil refinery complained that a vacuum distillation unit, which would  produce asphalt, threatens to add more pollution to the southwest corner of the  city.  </P> <P> The $16-million unit is under construction with completion scheduled for this  summer. It is the second phase of a refinery modernization project begun in  1978 that was put off for years because of financial difficulties.  </P> <P> Residents also complained that the original Environmental Impact Report for the  project, written more than a decade ago, said nothing about asphalt production  and that neighbors were not informed when Fletcher revived plans last year to  construct the facility.  </P> <P> Fletcher representatives said at the meeting that the unit will have no  significant impact on air quality and that operating the still to make the  heavy oil required for asphalt will result in lower air pollution than if the  unit were used to produce high-sulfur fuel oil.  </P> <P> City Atty. Glenn Watson said a preliminary examination of the issue indicates  that the conditional-use permit approved for the project in 1978 remains valid.  </P> <P> The council is scheduled to consider whether to require additional  environmental reports on May 2.  </P></p>

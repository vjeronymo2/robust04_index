			<p>920302 FT  02 MAR 92 / Soldiers' revolt provokes Niger protests and strike MUTINOUS soldiers briefly seized control of the state broadcasting centre yesterday for the third time in three days, but were ousted by other soldiers who said they had put down a coup attempt, AP reports from Niamey, Niger. Soldiers drove around the city, firing into the air and frightening people off the streets, but there were no reports of injuries. Earlier, thousands of pro-democracy protesters yelling anti-French slogans demonstrated against the soldiers' revolt, which they said Paris supported, and the main trade union called a general strike. Some 10,000 people gathered in the capital of the former French colony in West Africa, denouncing the soldiers and demanding they not interfere with an interim government's plans to instal democracy. They burned a flag of France, which they claimed supported the mutineers. Unpaid troops first revolted on Friday, seizing the broadcasting centre twice and kidnapping two high-ranking government officials. However, they returned to their barracks and freed the hostages after the government promised to pay up. Niger's 3,200 soldiers are among 40,000 government workers who have not been paid for two months. When the interim government took over last year it inherited a bankrupt economy.</p>

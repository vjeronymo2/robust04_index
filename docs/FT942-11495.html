			<p>940505 FT  05 MAY 94 / UK Company News: Heron interest deferral opposed Holders of Heron Internat ional's senior bonds voted against the deferral of interest due on March 31 to June 30 at a meeting yesterday morning. Of the votes cast, amounting to Pounds 78m of the bonds, only 38 per cent supported the deferral. A meeting of junior bondholders was then adjourned. At a meeting of bondholders on March 31 there were insufficient votes to form a quorum and since then the bonds have been technically in default. However, Heron, the property and trading group, said yesterday that Law Debenture, the trustee of the bonds, was not intending to take any steps to declare them due and payable. The trustee could be asked to act if 25 per cent of bondholders requested this. Heron's directors have been advised that the group can continue trading while there is a reasonable prospect of its debts being refinanced. Heron said it was in talks with possible bidders for the group, and expected to have proposals by June 30.</p>

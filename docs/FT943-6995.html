			<p>940825 FT  25 AUG 94 / International Capital Markets: Report identifies risks of OTC regulatory loophole As the market in equity derivatives grows, problems may arise from the sector's regulatory framework - or rather, lack thereof. These risks were highlighted in a recent report on the role of derivatives in Europe's securities markets, commissioned by the International Securities Market Association (ISMA). The report points to a regulatory imbalance between cash and OTC derivatives markets which has created an arbitrage opportunity allowing market participants to beat regulatory barriers in the cash markets by moving into the OTC sector. The report also draws attention to the fact that traders can use equity derivatives to circumvent restrictions on insider dealing and foreign shareholdings. In the past, equity transactions in the cash market were reported to stock exchange authorities. However, due to the growing activity in OTC equity derivatives, deals are increasingly reported to banking authorities, the study explains. This is because a high proportion of large, medium-term OTC transactions are traded by banks which have the necessary balance sheet strength, rather than by securities houses. The data reported to banking authorities tend to be aggregated, and banking supervisors, whose primary concern is prudential supervision, generally do not obtain information about individual transactions. As a result, stock exchange authorities in many countries appear to be in the dark about OTC derivative trades on the shares they supervise. 'Given that some banks (surveyed) indicated a willingness to trade OTC derivatives of up to 5 per cent of a company's capitalisation in a single transaction, we feel this is a significant gap in information flow which needs to be addressed,' the report's authors state. The result of the OTC/stock exchange divide is that the absence of reporting requirements in the OTC market provides an obvious incentive to channel transactions that might otherwise be handled in the cash market, and caught by reporting requirements there, into the OTC market, they add. 'While we do not support regulation for regulation's sake, neither do we feel that regulatory arbitrage is desirable. For this practical reason, we feel that reporting requirements in the cash equity markets and in the OTC derivatives markets should be made parallel.' They add that 'if one market is regulated more tightly than the other, the effect will simply be to drive transactions into the other market'. Any shift of business from the cash to the OTC market bears the risk of reducing cash market transparency for equity investors. Moreover, imposing tight regulations on the cash markets, in which smaller firms can trade fairly freely, but leaving the OTC market entirely unregulated 'results in a regulatory tilt in favour of the large global firms which are able to use the OTC markets in a manner not available to smaller firms', the report warns. These worries are not shared by all market participants. 'OTC deals are private transactions: I don't think it would be appropriate to regulate every transaction occurring between two private counterparties - that would prevent a lot of good financial transactions from occurring,' says one derivatives specialist at a large international bank. The report also points to other ways - outside the OTC market - in which equity derivatives can allow traders to escape the regulators' attention. Derivatives can be used, for example, to execute insider trades without dealing in either the share or a direct derivative of the share. According to the study, this appears to have occurred on at least one occasion through a technique called 'mirror' trading, where a dealer buys a derivative on an index or a basket of shares and sells short the components he doesn't want. If, for example, a dealer has inside information on a particular French company included in the CAC-40 stock index, he could buy the CAC-40 future and sell short the 39 other shares in the index, leaving him with a net exposure to only the target share - the equivalent of having a position in the underlying shares. In markets where an index future covers a large number of shares, an alternative might be to buy a basket warrant covering a limited group of shares including the target share and run short positions in the remaining shares. In both cases, it would be hard for investigators to prove that insider trading has taken place. Moreover, if regulators were to search for suspicious trading patterns in a given equity, this type of trade would not necessarily appear on their checklists.</p>

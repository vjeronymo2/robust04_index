			<p>920104 FT  04 JAN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Co-op strikes gold CO-OP BANK's promise of a free gold card for life to those who applied for it before January 1 1992 seems to have paid off. This week the bank said that it had issued about 70,000 cards to 55,000 customers. Some applications are still in the pipeline but the bank says it expects to have over 67,000 accounts eventually. 'We are overwhelmed by the response we have had,' a Co-op bank spokesman said. The Co-op card is now one of the most popular British gold cards. American Express, the leading player in the UK gold card business, is believed in the industry to have around 140,000 gold card customers. Barclays, the second largest gold card issuer, has 134,000. The Co-op card is aimed at the 'high rollers' - people who use their cards much more than the average. 'We believed that if we got the high rollers in, we could make money on the card by offering it free for life when everyone else was introducing a charge,' says a spokesman. Despite adverse publicity about the numbers of credit-worthy people who were turned away, the bank says it refused far fewer people than it expected. There were 90,000 applications and it looks as if 23,000 will be unsuccessful. Co-op was looking for gold card customers aged over 25, who owned their own homes and earned more than Pounds 25,000 a year. 'We got a much higher standard of applicant than expected,' the bank says. One reason for its popularity was good luck: the Co-op launched its card in the week after National Westminster and Royal Bank of Scotland announced annual charges on their cards. Now that the January 1 deadline has gone, the chance of getting a free-for-life gold card from the Co-op has passed. The next best deal available is probably a free Visa card from one of the dwindling band of issuers who do not make a charge: these include TSB Bank, Giro, and National &amp; Provincial Building Society, although these do not offer the additional benefits of a gold card.</p>

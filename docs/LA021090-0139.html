			<p><P> February 10, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO;  </P> <P> 'HUMDINGER' TRAFFIC SNARL IS FORECAST  </P> <P> Repair work that will temporarily shut down half of Del Obispo Street in the  heart of town will create "a humdinger" of a traffic jam, Mayor Gary Hausdorfer  said.  </P> <P> About 37,000 vehicles a day cross the railroad tracks at Del Obispo just west  of Camino Capistrano.  </P> <P> From Feb. 26 to March 2, the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. and  the city will repair the railway crossings and the street leading up to them.  Del Obispo will remain open, but only one lane each way.  </P> <P> Three other intersections in the city and surrounding area also are scheduled  for repair work: Oso Road, Feb. 25-26; La Zanja Street, March 4; and Avenida  Aeropuerto, March 5-7.  </P> <P> "Anyone who's a little bit late will be a lot late on those days if they travel  this way," Hausdorfer said. "We suggest everyone make plans to use alternate  routes."  </P> <P> Signs and blinking lights will be placed on Del Obispo starting Thursday to  warn motorists of the detour, said Bill Murphy, the city's public works  director.  </P> <P> The railroad will pay for replacing the tracks and crossing surfaces as part of  a project to upgrade track throughout the county.  </P> <P> But the City Council this week allocated $90,000 for its share of the project,  including traffic control, replacing and restriping streets and sidewalks, and  public notification.

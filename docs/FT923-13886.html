			<p>920710 FT  10 JUL 92 / Tory housebuilding plans attacked on two fronts GOVERNMENT plans for releasing land for housebuilding in London and south-east England to the year 2011 were attacked on two fronts yesterday. Housebuilders and environmentalists objected to an announcement from Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary. He said there should be no increase in the amount of land made available for housebuilding, which should be maintained at a rate of 57,000 homes a year. The Housebuilders Federation, whose members build four fifths of private homes under construction, said that would mean that many people would be unable to buy homes in the region in the next 10 to 15 years. Mr Howard was sowing the seeds for the next house-price boom. The Council for the Protection of Rural England, which had been pressing Mr Howard to reduce land for housing in the south-east, accused him of backtracking on government commitments to protect the environment. The decision means planned housebuilding rates in the south-east will remain unchanged - the number of new homes to be built between 1991 and 2006 is expected to be 855,000. Mr Howard has asked local-authority members of the South East Regional Planning Conference (Serplan) to prepare plans for how the 57,000 new homes might be distributed throughout the region. Other organisations are being invited to comment, and the government will also consider the study of the potential of the east Thames corridor, which is likely to be completed by early September. In a letter to the Earl of Carnarvon, chairman of Serplan, Mr Howard said the proposed rate represented 'a realistic response to the need of the south-east region to provide for the housing needs of its people while maintaining the quality of its environment'. The number of households in the region in the period until 2011 is forecast to rise by an average annual rate of 53,600, with sharper than average increases in the first 10 years. The Housebuilders Federation said the government's figures took no account of the existing shortage of homes in the region or the fact that housing demand was likely to be much higher during the early part of the period. MR MICHAEL HOWARD has given Countryside Properties, the developer, approval to build 900 homes on 240 acres south-west of Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire. Countryside said the development, the subject of a public inquiry last summer, would include shops and community facilities.</p>

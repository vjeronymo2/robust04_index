			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Open letter "to A.N. Yakovlev and V.V. Lazutkin, Heads of </F> the Russian Federal Television and Radio Broadcasting Service"  from Aleksey Simonov, former cochairman of the former Licensing  Commission]    [Text]    Dear Aleksandr Nikolayevich and Valentin Valentinovich!    This concerns the licensing of television and radio  broadcasting, which has been charged to the federal service  which you head under the president's Edict No. 2255 of 22  December.    The Edict speaks about the preparation of a Statute where  all  the questions about licensing are to be explained and published.  Permit me to ask: Where is this Statute? Why has it not been  made public? Evidently by force of habit, because these matters  have always been resolved by the bureaucratic method here. And  with all my respect and sympathy for you, I have trouble  believing that it will be your lot to break this "perpetual  course of heavenly bodies." But the fact that the Statute should  deal with licensing infringes upon the interests of hundreds of  nonstate broadcasters (and how it affects them!), and the  "bureaucratic nature" of decisions in this area may lead all  these broadcasters who have come into being, those who are  growing, and those who are becoming independent to the brink of  ruin. But after all, it is precisely their existence, and only  it, which actually makes it possible to form an opinion about  the presence or absence of freedom of information in the  country; by no means is this a procedure for appointing chiefs  or a method of editing news reports on state channels.    So forgive my persistence, but this concerns implementation  of the most important article in the Constitution--and nothing  less. For this reason, I ask that you consider this letter as a  modest contribution to its protection.    For nearly two years I was the cochairman of the Licensing  Commission (formally, the Interim Broadcasting Commission), and  my considerations are based on experience which is quite unique,  for prior to this commission no one was concerned with the  licensing of radio frequencies in our country. And the only  available document which you could be guided by in your  postulates was Council of Ministers Decree No. 500 of 26  September 1991, in accordance with which the commission was  formed.    So I would like to protect your Statute from this first  mistake: do not repeat the decree's principal miscalculation and  reject what is unprecedented in world licensing practice: the  issuance of two licenses for one frequency--a broadcasting  license (naturally, the one who broadcasts controls the  frequency) and a technical license--which ties this frequency to  a specific transmitter and its owner, which turns out to be an  enterprise of the Ministry of Communications in 95 out of 100  cases. Well, what can we compare this with? Imagine that a  deputy and the technician who provides him with a microphone  have the same right to address the audience. Meanwhile, it is  this very provision which has enabled the Ministry of  Communications to retain its monopoly over the means of  communication, which in the final analysis led to the shutdown  of transmitters in dozens of regions in Russia.    Secondly, in defining state policy in the field of licensing  (and this is precisely the purpose of the Statute, obviously),  you will have to overcome a natural bias toward concern for  state television and radio to the detriment of nonstate,  independent, and spontaneous broadcasting. After all, there are  only two state channels, but there are already hundreds of  independent broadcasters and, as never before, they need a fair  law which protects them. Incidentally, from the viewpoint of  licensing, broadcasting by "Ostankino" and RTV, as paradoxical  as it may seem, is illegal at present: it has not been legalized  by a license, unlike many nonstate companies.    Thirdly. In its two years of existence, the Licensing  Commission issued over 250 licenses. In most cases, for five  years. Will your future Statute confirm them? Or will the new  broom begin sweeping all over again, increasing the line of 500  or 600 broadcasters waiting their turn by another 250 because of  the awkwardness of Decree No. 500 and because of the numerous  spokes thrust into the wheels of the Licensing Commission by the  Ministry of Communications? And after all, these 500 are  broadcasting, but timidly, fearing an administrative outcry or  arbitrariness, and not only because they are "making  knucklebones" by any means. Among these "unbridled merchants"  there are quite a few persons who consider broadcasting their  duty to the people, to their audience which they have won and  who have become accustomed to them. And who do not want to learn  about their city, oblast, republic, and regional news from the  infrequent mentions in the central channels' reporting. Now,  when administrative arbitrariness in the regions has intensified  to such an extent that a license is insufficient protection  against it, the support of independent radio and television is  so essential that universal preoccupation exclusively with the  fate of the two state channels seems to me to be arrogant  and--excuse me--shortsighted. The unified information space  which everyone is so concerned about, by the way, does not mean  that all programs everywhere are tied to the two state  octopuses, accompanied by state protectionism with respect to  the 89 small regional octopuses. The unity of this space lies in  the diversity of choices accessible to the viewer in any part of  Russia, a diversity supported by a wise law that applies to  everyone, and a license is the guarantee of adherence to it.    The commission in which I worked ordered back in July that  they remain for a long time.    I hope that all the licenses issued since 1 August, and  quite  a few have been issued since then, especially by the Ministry of  Communications, will be nullified by your Statute, for someone  should put an end to the squandering of state resources. During  this time the last available ultrahigh frequency [detsimetrovyy]  television channel in Moscow was pocketed, as well as  frequencies for which competitions were conducted and there was  a waiting line, and numerous channels in the regions where the  Moscow "merchants," waving their new licenses, come looking for  broadcasters on frequencies they have already obtained by  circumventing the law.    I realize that not everything is within your power, and you  are unlikely to persuade the president that it is not good to  give up a state channel with one's own hand, even to such a  strong team as NTV, without competition and practically without  serious discussion of the concept of broadcasting. But will the  Statute contain articles which will help it refrain from such  actions later on? The Statute, however you write it, is doomed  to be temporary, for like any limited natural resource, radio  frequencies need a unified law for their protection. And as I  recall, there have been no less than five drafts of a law on  television and radio broadcasting. The last one was prepared in  those days when the next wave, the Bragin washout, once again  mixed everything up in the turbulent sea of radio and  television. Perhaps it should be adopted finally, and the  Statute on state radio and television should be made one of the  chapters in this Law, unified for everyone?    And finally: will your Statute be able to prevent new  attempts at blackmail by the Ministry of Communications? When  the state monopoly sets conditions for the state, is only the  economy behind this? Incidentally, the wages of ministry's  employees come not only from payment of the state order to  transmit the Ostankino or Russian signal. After all, they are  flaying three independents, or commercial broadcasters, as it is  more convenient for public consolation to call them, at the same  time that state authorization is given. The prices are a little  better than American prices in absolute figures, without any  references to the exchange rate of hard currency. And there are  no ministry employees who would not have these extra earnings  "on the side." It is no coincidence that our commission was  "dissolved" precisely at the point where it was butted by the  horns of the ministry's desire not to give the opportunity to  broadcasters to have their own transmitters and retransmitters.  Only a strict antimonopoly policy with respect to communications  enterprises can bring democracy to the situation in radio and  television broadcasting. Otherwise, everything stays the same: a  common state knife switch, which the unbridled fanatics at  Ostankino repeatedly struggle to seize.    It has now been two months that I have been trying to  express  these and other considerations to you, but in the meantime, for  old times' sake, people who urgently need the legal right to  conduct their broadcasting have been arriving from all over  Russia. And they are telephoning. And they are asking: What  shall we do? Where do we go? And while previously I was able and  obliged to respond to this, it is your turn now. And I am  addressing their questions to you with this letter.</p>

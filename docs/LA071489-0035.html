			<p><P> July 14, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GUNSHOTS BARK, AND DEATH CLAIMS A TEEN-AGER  </P> <P> Walter Stewart had just returned home from work when his 17-year-old son asked  permission to go outside for a while.  </P> <P> A few minutes after 9 p.m. Wednesday, Stewart heard the unnerving bark of  gunshots outside his South Los Angeles home. Moments later, his sister-in-law  pounded on the front door, screaming that his 17-year-old son, Walter Dale  Stewart Jr., had been shot dead.  </P> <P> Stewart's son would have turned 18 on Thursday -- the same day that a computer  training school representative called the family with news that he had been  accepted into a job placement program.  </P> <P> Police said they did not have a suspect or a motive in the killing. The younger  Stewart, a senior at Locke High School, was not believed to have been a gang  member.  </P> <P> "Sad, huh?" muttered the victim's mother, Olivia Stewart. "It still seems like  a dream to me."  </P> <P> As he sadly described the events of the preceding night, Walter Stewart Sr.,  38, stared out blankly to beyond the back-yard fence of the family's small  stucco home on the 700 block of 109th Street.  </P> <P> "I ran around the corner and there he was with his face down on somebody's  porch. The police said, 'He's going to be all right.' Maybe they should quit  telling you that. I noticed he was still . . . still as a rock. It didn't look  good at all."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Shot in Torso  </P> <P> South Bureau Homicide Detective Pat Marshall said Walter Stewart Jr. had been  walking along Stanford Avenue near 109th Street when he was shot in the upper  torso by a suspect that police could only describe as a man in his 20s.  </P> <P> "The victim ran 30 to 40 feet before he collapsed," Marshall said.  </P> <P> The gunman was seen by witnesses getting into a brown 1979 or 1980 Chevrolet  Caprice, which sped from the scene westbound on 109th Street, Marshall said.  "We really don't know why he was accosted by this suspect."  </P> <P> Walter Stewart Jr. was one of four victims to die in the violence that erupted  Wednesday on Los Angeles streets.  </P> <P> On Wednesday morning, a bloody shoot-out eight blocks from the Los Angeles  Memorial Coliseum left two rival gang members dead and three others wounded,  police said. More than 50 shots were fired in the gun battle that killed  17-year-old Edward Cory Brown, investigators said. The second victim, Jerry  Knox, 33, was struck and killed by a car during the intense gunfight.  </P> <P> In addition, Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies arrested 16 members of rival  gangs involved in a rock, bottle and fist fight in an unincorporated area on  Wednesday afternoon. After these arrests were made, 10 of the gang members  walked to a nearby street in Los Angeles. There, in a drive-by incident, they  were sprayed with bullets fired by an assailant from a rival gang, police said.  </P> <P> Monolita Shawn Green, 18, of Los Angeles, was hit in the back. He died of his  wounds at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew Medical Center.  </P> <P> Gang-related homicides citywide increased 39.3% during the first three months  of this year, compared with the same period a year ago, said Police Lt. Fred  Nixon. Similarly, gang-motivated crimes -- those growing directly out of gang  activity -- increased 31.8% citywide in the first six months of this year,  compared with the same period a year ago, Nixon said.  </P> <P> Walter Stewart Sr. needed no statistics to tell him the problem is out of  control. "Parents used to run the neighborhoods; the youths run the  neighborhoods now," he said. "Whoever is supposed to be in charge of these kids  has got to get back in control."  </P></p>

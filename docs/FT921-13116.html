			<p>920123 FT  23 JAN 92 / International Company News: Federconsorzi assets valued FEDERCONSORZI, the financially-troubled Italian farm services group, should be able to pay creditors 73.9 per cent of what they are owed, according to documents presented to the Rome court overseeing its affairs. Separately, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), the state-owned banking group which owns 50 per cent of Agrifactoring, a factoring concern closely involved with Federconsorzi and also in financial difficulties, has put forward a plan to end its long-running differences with foreign creditor banks. BNL would be prepared to give priority to other bank creditors to Agrifactoring before repayment of its own loans, provided foreign banks restored normal commercial relations with BNL. Some foreign banks have frozen credit lines or cut foreign exchange trading links with BNL following its refusal to honour Agrifactoring's borrowings. The ability of Federconsorzi to pay more than 40 per cent of its borrowings fulfils one of the conditions required when government-appointed commissioners turned to the courts to prevent formal bankruptcy proceedings last year. However, it will be up to creditors to decide at a meeting on January 29 whether they are satisfied with the repayment level, or want to trigger bankruptcy proceedings. While most large Italian banks have expressed willingness to back the procedure, foreign banks, which lent around L300bn (Dollars 251.25m) to Federconsorzi, have demanded instant repayment. The 100-page document presented to the court is limited to a detailed valuation of Federconsorzi's assets, rather than going into the reasons for its financial problems or identifying those responsible. According to its findings, Federconsorzi's 13 per cent stake in Banca Nazionale dell'Agricoltura, Italy's second-biggest private bank, is worth L282.7bn, while its 89 per cent holding in the Credito Agrario of Ferrara is valued at L119.9bn.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Ludmila Benkovicova of the Slovak Statistical </F> Office]    [Text] We regularly publish the results of public  opinion surveys conducted by various specialized institutions.  Their results are not quite identical. We have asked Ludmila  Benkovicova, of the Slovak Statistical Office, to compare the  results and explain the differences in the methodology used. As  she noted in an introductory letter to her article, she had  consulted the problems under review with the FOCUS agency and  Slovak Radio. As an important contribution of this activity,  they agreed on the need to coordinate in the future at least the  use of terminology because, as she writes, "the differences  disconcert all of us."    Why do different polls produce different results?    I will mention at least the most important factors  influencing the ascertained results of public-opinion surveys.    Generally, it holds true that the obtained empirical data  are  significantly determined by the time of collection of  information in the field. Public opinion is a dynamic  phenomenon. It reacts with particular sensitivity to events in  public and political life, new facts and information,  politicians' statements and speeches. A shift of a few days in  the collection of data, especially if these days are packed with  political activities, can find its expression in changes of  opinion among a part of the population and, hence, in altered  results.    A problem in its own right is when to perceive  differentiation of data as true differences and when certain  differences are still within the norm. Some commentators and  users interpret as a difference even a decline or rise by a few  tenths of a percent.    It is necessary to clearly realize that surveys working with  select samples--and this is true of all public-opinion surveys  without exception--are surveys of likelihood nature [vyskumy  pravdepodobnostneho charakteru]. They produce data, the  validity of which is not absolute but that are always valid,  with a certain probability within a certain interval of  reliability. The interval of reliability has its lower and  upper limit, and the figure that is given as the result is the  midpoint of the interval. This means, for example, that the  Christian Democratic Movement [KDH], which, according to the May  1994 survey of the Slovak Statistical Office, availed itself of  11 percent of votes, would have received in "May" elections,  with a likelihood of 95 percent (the margin of error is 5  percent!), 8.7-12.7 percent of the votes of participants in the  elections.    The final results are also affected by the research method  that is used, starting with the method of establishing the  select sample, through the method of data collection, all the  way down to the specific wording of the question put to the  respondent.    Let us take a closer look at the questions used by various  institutions. Slovak Radio's Research Department, whose  electoral surveys frequently appear in the mass media, uses the  following question: "Imagine that parliamentary elections were  to take place this week. For which party or movement would you  opt?" This question is put to every respondent. The respondent  can select his reply from 20 entities running in the elections  (out of more than 50 officially registered parties and  movements). He is free to supplement his reply with any other  party, but he can also reply "I am not going to vote," "I do not  want to reply," or "I do not know." The sum of all replies adds  up to 100 percent.    The FOCUS agency asks two questions. In the first, it  ascertains interest in participation in the elections, and, in  the second, it surveys how the respondent would vote. It offers  a choice of 15 entities running in the elections and,  simultaneously, the replies "I am not going to vote," "I do not  know for whom I will vote," and "I do not want to reply." The  two questions are put to all people included in the select  sample. By means of combining replies to the first and second  questions, the FOCUS agency obtains the electoral preferences of  individual parties.    The Slovak Statistical Office addresses to all citizens  polled a question concerning their participation in the coming  elections. The second question--"For which political party or  movement would you vote if elections to the National Council of  the Slovak Republic were to be held today?"--is put to only  those respondents who said at the time of the survey that they  are determined to vote or that they are likely to vote. It  offers a list of 18 entities running in the elections, the  possibility of naming any party not included in the list, and  the reply "I do not know for whom I will vote." The electoral  decisions of those of the respondents who want to participate in  the elections are then interpreted as electoral preferences.  The aim of this methodological procedure is to come as close as  possible to the actual "pure" situation of casting the vote.    The electoral results are directly determined by those who  come to the ballot box. Even the most unbending sympathizer of  a party cannot support "his" party with his vote if he does not  turn up at the polling station. It would be appropriate to pay  more heed to this trivial fact when presenting the results of  preelection polls.    The use of a different term (such as, for example,  "political  sympathy," "political orientation of the population," etc.)  could therefore be considered for expressing attitude. The term  electoral preferences should be reserved for the electoral  decisions of participants in the elections--that is, those who  want to come to the ballot box on the last day of September or  the first day of October.    The reality of the '94 elections will test not only the  validity of various preelection prognoses but also the  theoretical justification of the methods used. For the time  being, the reader and user who is seriously interested in  preelection surveys has no choice but to pay heed not only to  the "figures" themselves, but also to the wording of the  question, the wording of all of the optional replies, and to  what each item of data actually expresses.</p>

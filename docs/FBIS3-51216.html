			<p>Article   Type:BFN     [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of  reports on Salvadoran economic developments monitored by Panama  Bureau through 17 January; source follows in parentheses after  each item.    Jose Roberto Orellana, president of the Central Reserve Bank  of El Salvador, has reported that resources close to 650 million  colones were channeled to finance private investments in 1993.  He has said the government created Investment Loans Funds to  help micro- and small-scale companies. (San Salvador EL DIARIO  DE HOY in Spanish 12 Jan 94 pp 3, 33)    According to Ruben Pineda, executive director of the  Salvadoran Coffee Council, during the first quarter of the 1993  to 1994 coffee harvest, El Salvador withheld 44,541 quintals, or  20 percent, out of a total of 222,705 quintals that were going  to be exported. The average sale price for this period is $75.83  per quintal, whereas it was $68.40 during the 1992 to 1993  period. Pineda has credited the retention policy for the price  increase.

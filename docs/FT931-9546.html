			<p>930213 FT  13 FEB 93 / EC surprised by Clinton's attack on Airbus subsidies EUROPEAN Commission officials reacted with a mixture of anger and surprise to President Bill Clinton's attack on EC subsidies for Airbus, describing it as an unhelpful addition to the growing tension in transatlantic trade relations. 'Either the Europeans are going to have to quit subsidising Airbus. . . or we're going to have to take on the competition. I'm not going to roll over and play dead,' Mr Clinton told a televised 'town meeting' on Wednesday night. Very much against the odds the EC and the US last year reached an agreement on limiting subsidies to their respective civil aviation industries, and it came into force last July. 'We have an agreement with the Americans and we hope they stick to it,' was the official reaction of Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, according to his spokesman. Brussels is playing down Mr Clinton's remarks - made in answer to a question at the Detroit 'town meeting' - as a heat of the moment reaction. 'It seems as though he was shooting from the hip a bit,' one Commission official said. Officials add that since the subsidies agreement last July, there has been no new state-subsidised civil aircraft programme in the Community. Rehashing the old arguments about Airbus is 'sterile', one official said, and merely reflected the European consortium's increasing success in winning world market share from its two US competitors, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. One Commission official insisted that, in any case, US civil aviation subsidies far exceeded EC subventions. 'They say we have spent Dollars 15bn in direct subsidies,' said one official. 'We don't accept that and in any case that figure includes cumulative interest. The US civil aeronautics industry has benefited from about Dollars 22bn in indirect support from defence spending over the past decade; and if we accumulated their interest it would be nearer Dollars 30bn,' he added. Senior US trade officials negotiating the Uruguay Round with the Community on behalf of the Bush administration last year made clear as part of their bargaining stance that they had come under a lot of pressure from industry, trades unions and Congress for the aviation subsidies agreement. One Brussels official said yesterday that the Clinton administration might seek to renegotiate the terms of the accord as part of a settlement of all current EC-US trade disputes.</p>

			<p><P> July 25, 1989, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HE'S NOW A KNIGHT, BUT HE REIGNS AS REX  </P> <P> Actor Rex Harrison was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II at a Buckingham Palace  ceremony today and said it was "a marvelous moment."  </P> <P> After the ceremony, he formally will be called Sir Reginald but said he  preferred Sir Rex, for the nickname he has used throughout his career.  </P> <P> The 81-year-old actor, best known for his Oscar-winning role as Henry Higgins  in the movie "My Fair Lady," was awarded the knighthood in recognition of his  services to the arts.  </P> <P> "I think they rather like to leave awarding honors until you get to a certain  age," he said. "It was a marvelous moment kneeling there and getting tapped on  each shoulder."  </P> <P> Knights must kneel before the queen, who taps them on both shoulders with a  sword as part of the ceremony.  </P> <P> Harrison, who plans to star in Somerset Maugham's comedy "The Circle" on  Broadway this fall, said he has no plans to retire because "I wouldn't know  what to do."  </P></p>

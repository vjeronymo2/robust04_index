			<p>940831 FT  31 AUG 94 / International Company News: Bank of Nova Scotia ahead in third quarter Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's fourth-biggest bank, lifted third-quarter net profit to CDollars 198m (USDollars 141m), or 80 cents a share, up 8.2 per cent from CDollars 183m, or 77 cents, a year earlier. Return on equity was 13.91 per cent, against 14.39 per cent. However, the bank recorded a 12.6 per cent rise in net interest income, due to strong growth in commercial and mortgage lending and better overseas markets. Other income was up 20.4 per cent, though expenses rose 18.5 per cent due to the absorption of Montreal Trust, the Canadian trust company. Annual provision for credit losses was CDollars 567m at July 31, unchanged from the previous quarter. Net profit for the nine-month period was CDollars 277m, or 95 cents, down from CDollars 520m, or CDollars 2.18, a year earlier. The 1994 period included CDollars 305m special charges taken in the second quarter following the acquisition of Montreal Trust. Excluding these, net profit was CDollars 582m, up 12 per cent.</p>

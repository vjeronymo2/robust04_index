			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] Paris has threatened to take such a decision  several times and Francois Leotard announced it this morning:  France will withdraw 2,500 blue helmets from Bosnia; that is, a  third of the French contingent, before the end of the year.  [passage omitted]    The French Foreign Ministry adds a note of caution: this  figure of 2,500 will have to be adjusted. First, because the  withdrawal operation of 1,000 blue helmets from Sarajevo was  already planned. As for the rest, we will wait and see, Alain  Juppe says:    [Begin Juppe recording] This operation is under way. It is a  gradual reduction, if I may say so, which was planned and  announced within the context of the concentration of our troops  in Sarajevo, an idea we have entertained for a long time. For  the rest -- that is, the 1,500 men or so who are in Bihac --  their status will be considered by the end of the year but no  final decision has yet been taken. This, I repeat, will depend  on the development of the diplomatic process. [end recording]</p>

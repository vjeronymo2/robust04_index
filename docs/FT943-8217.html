			<p>940818 FT  18 AUG 94 / UK Company News: Aitken Hume Pounds 4.87m in loss Aitken Hume International, the former banking group, yesterday announced pre-tax losses of Pounds 4.87m for the year to March 31, but said it was still looking at ways for shareholders to realise the value of what is little more than a Pounds 29m shell company. During 1994 the company sold Aitken Hume Bank to Secure Trust for up to Pounds 7.88m, and raised Pounds 3.6m from the sale to Bank Julius Baer of Aitken Hume Bank (Guernsey). Last year it sold National Securities Research Corporation, leaving the finance company, founded 17 years ago by Mr Jonathan Aitken, MP, with no operating businesses. Aitken Hume has until October 29 to restructure and develop an operating finance business or the Stock Exchange will remove its listing. It is currently reviewing a range of options, the most likely of which is a reverse takeover or a cash distribution. As at March 31 the company had net assets of Pounds 29.1m, equivalent to 54p a share, after deducting the par value of the convertible preference shares. This compares with the share price of 51p at the time of its suspension in April. In addition, the company is owed Dollars 11.8m (Pounds 7.5m) from the sale of NSR, which is dependent on the resolution of certain tax issues in the US. No account of this potential cash has been made on Aitken Hume's balance sheet, but the company 'has been advised that settlement of these issues is now likely on terms very favourable to the company'. There are further potential profits from the proceeds of work-out debt from Aitken Hume Bank. In the meantime, the company said income from interest and rent continued to exceed outgoings. The company is 30 per cent owned by Hong Kong-based Allied Group which is likely to sell its stake. Said Trust owns another 30 per cent. Losses per share were 11.03p but a 1p dividend is proposed.</p>

			<p><P> November 11, 1989, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> DISCOVERY: THE CHILDREN'S BOOKSHOPPE  </P> <P> From the moment you walk through the flowered entrance of the Children's  Bookshoppe, an aura of literary wealth surrounds the visitor. The big red door  with its painted drummer boy and genuine straw hat is an entree to  floor-to-ceiling, wall-to-wall bookshelves, spilling over with every type of  children's book imaginable.  </P> <P> One small section, toward the rear of the shop, has a make-believe fireplace  draped on the wall with downsized furniture, including a bench, rocking chairs  with pillows and small tables. In the same area are nifty little specialty  gifts. The reasonable prices permit children to shop, using, perhaps, their  allowance.  </P> <P> Another separate small room is well-stocked with paperbacks, cassettes and  videos only. A neighboring room, very narrow, is used for gift-wrapping and  mailings. The shop will special order and mail books anywhere, on request.  </P> <P> A special service this store renders is its children's book club membership.  You explain the child's interests and hobbies and provide an age. Then each  month an appropriate selection will be made by the shop and mailed to the  child. Fees change from month to month, depending on the book involved.  </P> <P> The Children's Bookshoppe offers stories throughout the day arranged by age  groups and seasonal Winnie-the-Pooh-type parties (and other children's  book-related parties) complete with party favors. Preregistration is required  for the Saturday story-hour programs.  </P> <P> Sara Brant opened the shop 19 years ago after many years as a school reading  specialist. All of her part-time assistants are former librarians and teachers  and are well-equipped to work with children.  </P> <P> "I love the children, the books and I love the people here. I have formed many  friendships with authors, illustrators and parents during the years," Brant  says. "It's been quite a rewarding experience for me."  </P> <P> Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Saturday  </P> <P> Address: 1831 Westcliff Drive, Newport Beach  </P> <P> Telephone: (714) 675-1424  </P> <P> Miscellaneous information: Located in the Westcliff Court  </P></p>

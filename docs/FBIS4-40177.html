			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Novikov] </F>   [Text] Murmansk June 15 TASS--The nuclear power station on  the Kola peninsula can operate until its design service life  expires, says a conclusion made by an IAEA commission which has  just ended its inspection of the station.    The commission checked whether recommendations given to the  personnel of the station by IAEA experts two years ago had been  followed. It was recommended then to enhance the reliability of  the safety systems of the first and second nuclear reactors and  replace outdated equipment by a modern one. The IAEA inspection  pointed out that half of these recommendations had been already  fulfilled.</p>

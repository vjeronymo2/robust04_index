A Chinese official with responsibility for aviation  policy said that lack of British cooperation over air service  agreements between Hong Kong and other governments would lead to  the termination of any agreement not approved by the Joint  Liaison Group (JLG).    "The natural outcome will be that CAAC (the Civil Aviation  Administration of China) will get into the market after 1997,"  the official said. "In principle, after Hong Kong reverts to  Chinese rule, the British companies should retreat from the  territory and Chinese or Hong Kong companies should take over.    "But in practice, taking account of reality, we accept the  fact that some British companies have been operating quite well  and have established a reputation among customers.    "They deliberately withhold the texts of these agreements to  try to maintain the status of domination of Cathay Pacific over  Hong Kong's air services."    The official argued that Cathay Pacific by itself could not  cope with the increasing demands of the market. "It cannot even  cope with two cities in Germany," he said. "There is no point  to try to undertake the whole thing. Besides the CAAC will not  throw it out. We can compete together (against foreign  airlines)."    Cathay Pacific has long been Hong Kong's de facto flag  carrier, with monopoly rights on most routes. It has been given  the rights to fly to countries which have air service agreements  with Hong Kong, while its sister company, Dragonair, covers  mainly mainland routes. The other registered airline, Air Hong  Kong, carries only cargo.    The Chinese official accused Britain of being reluctant to  hand over documents and information concerning air services  which have not yet been initialled by Hong Kong for discussions  at the JLG. So far only eight out of about 30 air service  agreements have been officially approved by the JLG. This  leaves more than 20 at risk, should China fulfil its promise to  revoke all agreements not approved by the JLG.    Phil Burfurd, public relations manager of Cathay Pacific,  yesterday played down the threat to Cathay. "We anticipate that  we can keep our normal operation way beyond 1997," he said.  "The air service agreements are done on a governmental basis.  We are keen to see the agreement finalised."    A British official maintained that the British were showing  a  full spirit of co-operation over this issue. "These are rather  complicated issues involving not only governmental agreements  but commercial confidences applied to airlines. We have to be  very careful about how these things are handled," the official  said.    "If Hong Kong is, as provided for under the Joint  Declaration, to have its own aviation regime and its own  airlines it does not really matter who the owners of the  airlines are Cathay has mainland shareholders anyway," he said.  "We have attached great importance to preserving Hong Kong's  aviation strength, one of the things which has made Hong Kong so  successful. I believe Cathay, as a main Hong Kong airline,  wants to preserve a satisfactory service regime along with all  its aviation partners."</p>

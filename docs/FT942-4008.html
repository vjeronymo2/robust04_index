			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Arts: Dazzled by identity crises - Video white-haired and Russian-accented, like the old psychiatrist in Hitchcock's Spellbound - told me that there are two kinds of movie experience. One is like falling asleep and entering the dream state: films touched with the surreal or fantastic like Fassbinder's Querelle (Artificial Eye) or Nicolas Roeg's Eureka (MGM/UA), both new out on video. The other kind is like getting up in the morning. You draw the curtain and reality's light dazzles you, routing the goblins of the night. Finest example cassette-released this month: Ken Loach's Raining Stones (Ist Independent), the brightest movie in years from British realism's brightest modern exponent. The Professor refused to accept that there was any kind of film other than these two. I suspect he is mostly right. A mighty chasm separates the poetic impulses of, say, Fassbinder's Genet fantasia, filmed amid glowing painted sets, or Roeg's fable-like film about a Kane-ish millionaire journeying to self-destruction (powerhouse acting by Gene Hackman) and the beautiful human pulse of Loach's picture of an 'ordinary' Northern family, as clinkingly familiar as the milk bottles outside the front door. Yet there are truancies and exceptions to the Professor's rule. Some film-makers love to fool us into thinking they are making a dream-movie when they are making a realistic one and vice versa. Alex van Warmerdam's The Northerners (Curzon) is a Dutch fantasy that behaves for a long time like the primmest suburban soap or sitcom. You think you have parted the curtains for a morning's snooping on the neighbours: the married woman sneaking off to the butcher's shop out of hours, the postman who peeks at people's letters, the boy who peers through windows. But then you realise the story is spiralling into poetic dementia. Soon there are wild animals, ghostly bodies in the nearby forest pool, a sense of history and barbarism creeping in from the town's edges. Strange and marvellous. Then there is Rising Sun (Fox), written and directed by Philip Kaufman from the novel by Michael 'Jurassic Park' Crichton. Ah] we cry at first. A techno-fantasy about Them (Japs) versus Us (the West). But allowing for a little generation-gap formalism in the casting - Sean Connery for the WASPS and wrinklies, Wesley Snipes for the young and ethnic - little in this film is fantastical or improbable at all. America is indeed riven with anxiety about a new Pearl Harbor in the boardroom. And the 'preposterous' subplot, in which a murder is covered up by some outlandish video-tampering, is technically wholly plausible. This film seems a piece of midnight mind-sorcery but is really more an open-the-morning-curtains movie. Then there is the kind of film that does not seem itself to know what it is. Olivier's enduringly majestic Richard III (Video Collection) thinks that it is turning from poetry to realism, from the hieratic to the documentary-historical, when it debouches from those painted sets into a 'real' Battle of Bosworth. But the real trees and bushes only set off more the inspired stylisations of Olivier's acting, twitching like Nijinsky even in his al fresco death throes. The Professor could say that these films prove his point: after a little initial teasing they fall into place on the side of the real or poetic. But some good movies, pace the Prof, defy the most determined viewer to place them in either category. Jane Campion's The Piano (Entertainment In Video) swept across festivals and film award nights last year, stealing every prize in sight including two acting Oscars. One was for Holly Hunter as the mute Scottish heroine thrown into wildest New Zealand in the mid-19th century. There she tests the mettle of her 'civilised' values on missionary Sam Neill and brutish foreman Harvey Keitel. The other Oscar was for Anna Paquin as her daughter. Miss P was mute only on Oscars night, when she opened and shut her mouth like a goldfish in shock. But then that is the viewer's reaction to this astonishing tale of violence, sex and emotional rite-of-passage, set in a world as starkly real as it is hauntingly oneiric.</p>

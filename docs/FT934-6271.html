			<p>931125 FT  25 NOV 93 / Survey of Turkish Finance and Industry (1): Skating on thin ice - Though the economy continues to bowl along, the public deficit is growing and the balance of payments is deteriorating. Meanwhile, Turkey is preparing for the challenge of customs union with the European Community in 1995 As winter sets in, Turkey skates uneasily on a rink of dangerously thin ice. While industry reports record profits and the stock exchange reaches new heights, the politicians in Ankara give the impression of lurching from one dilemma to the next, unable to offer solutions or even dictate their own agenda. Turkey faces a looming crisis. The coalition government of Mrs Tansu Ciller is faced with a growing public deficit, a deterioration in the balance of payments and rising foreign debt. Already Moody's, the US rating agency, has said it is considering a downgrading, which could impair Turkey's access to the debt markets. It seems only a matter of time before the escalating violence in the Kurdish- speaking region starts to impinge on the investment decisions of foreign companies in western Turkey. Mobil Oil of the US pulled out of the Kurdish area in September. All public works have been suspended after allegations that Kurdish rebels are demanding protection money from contractors. While the government refuses to countenance political and social reform for this hard-pressed minority, the violence can only get worse. The next few months could well prove decisive as the campaign train rumbles into action ahead of municipal elections across the country in March. The solitary comfort in this otherwise rather gloomy picture is that the economy continues to bowl along. Growth for 1993 is set to exceed last year's 6 per cent figure, after a staggering second quarter which saw the gross national product increase by 12 per cent. Indeed, while the rest of Europe pulls wearily out of recession, Turkey is enjoying a consumer boom, fuelled by looser domestic credit and increased foreign capital inflows. But if this heady cocktail is attractive today, the after-effects are not likely to be so pleasant. Against such a background, corporate Turkey is now trying to prepare itself for the most momentous change in the trade regime in over 20 years. In 1995, barring upsets, a customs union will be established with the European Union. The motivation is as much political as economic. But the short-term cost to the Turkish economy will be considerable - a topic which is likely to dominate the negotiations which formally got under way at a meeting of the EU-Turkey Association Council early this month. The implementation of a customs union will transform the face of Turkish industry. The charmed life of Turkey's large privately-owned companies, which have prospered behind high tariff barriers, is coming to an end. The market share of key sectors such as cars and consumer durables is likely to be squeezed by cheaper imports, particularly when Turkey adopts the EU's common commercial tariff for third countries, including eastern Europe. McKinsey, the US management consultants, has just been employed to look at the car sector. The study will almost certainly conclude that Turkey's vehicle manu- facturers are not ready. Turkey's full membership of the EU is today a distant prospect. But both sides of the negotiating table appear resolved to deepen the relationship. Turkey is fearful that it is slipping down the queue, with the EU's moves to invite applications from Scandinavia and eastern Europe. Even Turkey's membership of Nato and the Council of Europe no longer carries as big a cachet, as these two organisations also consider new applicants. critical. Brussels will be watching for any sign that Turkey is going back on its undertaking to meet the next round of tariff cuts. All tariffs have to be reduced to zero in 1995. Industry complains at the failure of repeated governments to bring the budget deficit to heel. Managers say this has discouraged the long-term investment decisions necessary to upgrade technologies, the only way many local companies will survive the renewed competition which will follow customs union. Much now depends on resolving the current political gridlock. When the coalition was formed in October 1991, there was popular expectation that the search for common cause would force both parties to moderate their positions  -the right-wing True Path party (DYP), forced to take on a more reformist Kurdish policy and the Social Democratic Populists (SHP) a more pro-business stance. That did not happen. Indeed with Mrs Ciller's appointment as DYP leader, and as prime minister in June, after Mr Suleyman Demirel's move to the presidency - the lines of communication have become even more atrophied. Mrs Ciller's attempts to legislate by decree have now been abandoned. The sale of state enterprises and tax reform, the twin pillars of her bid to bring down the deficit, remain blocked. The courts, on appeal from SHP deputies, have moved to prevent the sale of the state telecommunications company, and are poised to take similar action in the case of Tek, the power utility. Meanwhile, the long-awaited tax bill, which Mrs Ciller earlier withdrew from parliament in an effort to extend its provisions, has still to be debated. Few officials believe it can be legislated before the end of the year. In that case, its effects will not be felt until the 1995 tax year at the earliest. In the absence of much progress on reform, officials are counting on strong economic growth to boost the fiscal side by increasing the tax take. The competition resulting from the surge in lower cost imports may also prove instrumental in restraining inflation, although it still hovers around 65 per cent. In turn, there is every expectation that the frenetic pace of industrial activity will have eased the unemployment problem. More worrying is the reserves position, which while healthy now, cannot long be sustained while the current account deficit is projected at Dollars 5bn. Foreign debt has risen sharply and is expected to have exceeded Dollars 60bn with the latest spate of bond issues by the government. Turkey's public sector borrowing requirement is not huge by the standards of many European countries. Indeed, given the narrowness of the tax base, there is plenty of room for fiscal consolidation. One difficulty will be convincing the public of the case for extra taxation, while implementing a slowdown and in some cases a freeze on investment in public services and infrastructure. On welfare, public health and education, there is a strong case for more spending rather than less. SSK, the rudimentary national health and retirement plan, is all but bankrupt, unable to pay its debts to the pharmaceutical companies. Many public infrastructure projects have come to a standstill and contractors complain that even the government is behind in instalments on the work already completed. President Demirel, in a strongly worded speech earlier this month, warned of the dangers if early decisions were not made on a new generation of power stations. Energy experts have projected that without substantial new investment, Turkey could face a supply shortfall as early as 1995. All eyes are now on the municipal elections in March. In 1991, the Motherland party government tried to spend its way to the polls - unsuccessfully. Given the current growth rate, Mrs Ciller hardly needs to pump-prime the economy. Should the DYP make strong gains next spring, it will be tempted to break with the SHP and call early general elections. But unless there is a new consensus, Turkey will continue to have difficulties in addressing its mounting economic problems.</p>

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / Technology: Flying high with diesel power - Worth Watching Trials have begun on the Isle of Wight of a diesel-powered engine for light aircraft. The designers believe the use of diesel oil, as opposed to aviation gasoline, will save Pounds 10,000 on a flying time of 500 hours - the purchase cost of the engine. Although designers have been aware of the benefits of diesel engines in the past, use of the fuel has resulted in torsional vibration, which produces an uneven twisting action of the crankshaft and consequent risk of propeller failure. ABN Engines, of Ryde, have overcome this by putting the components in a novel configuration which gives the Ashton engine an inherent balance and reduces the loads reaching the crankshaft.

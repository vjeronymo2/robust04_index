			<p>941206 FT  06 DEC 94 / Arts: A well-dressed 'Fairy Queen' It hardly matters that we shall be inundated with performances of The Fairy Queen over the next 12 months. The work is so tricky to put on stage that anybody who wants to mount a production to mark Purcell's tercentenary year is likely to come up with a solution different from any others. The original entertainment was lavishly appointed. Purcell took Shakespeare's play A Midsummer Night's Dream, added five extended musical masques, threw in a variety of dances and made sure that the new scenario included as many visual delights as possible, from a tableau of the passing seasons to an exotic garden overrun by dancing monkeys. It is difficult to imagine its like today; more difficult still to imagine where the money would come from. Most performances find themselves obliged to do without at least one element: either the actors or the dancers are given the night off. Roger Norrington's concert version last year saved itself the cost of the stage spectacle, but did bring together the play and the music (the play unexpectedly won hands down). Perhaps finding that to be a long evening, the English Bach Festival took the opposite route for its fully-staged production at the Royal Opera House on Sunday. Not a line of Shakespeare was uttered, but the visual trappings were as rich as the company's finances would allow. The costumes, some of them based on the original designs by Inigo Jones, kept coming in a seemingly endless, no-expense-spared parade. The work of the costumiers and headdress-makers could keep other period productions supplied second-hand for years. As an evening of music and drama, however, this Fairy Queen was less successful. The masques are really five interludes in the play and having five interludes without anything in between makes a lightweight offering. After fighting to keep stage and pit together in the first half, Howard Williams managed to instil a greater sense of confidence after the interval. He had the advantage of an experienced first soprano in Jennifer Smith and valuable contributions from the bass David Mattinson; but the rest of the cast was mixed. While there are better musical accounts of Purcell's music to be heard elsewhere, no other has recently tried to match the dance to the music in the proper period style, and that was where the main value of this production lay. Under the guidance of the choreographer Stephen Preston, the various dances for the warbling songsters, the green men, the haymakers and the monkeys could all be seen as well as heard. The allegory of Night also seemed especially effective in Jonathan Cocker's sympathetic staging. Bit by bit the full range of The Fairy Queen is coming to light, as each performance sheds its own ray of understanding on the work. The English Bach Festival has shown what a carefully-researched period style can achieve. Next up is English National Opera's projected production, which the safe money can bet will be different again.</p>

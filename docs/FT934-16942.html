			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / Surgical glove to help reduce risks A SURGICAL GLOVE designed to reduce risks of cross-infection is being launched today by London International Group. The glove has two layers. If the outer one is punctured and the inner one exposed to fluid, such as blood, it shows up green, alerting the surgeon to the puncture. LIG, which also makes condoms and toiletries, is putting emphasis on new products at a time when group profits have been hit by losses at its photo-processing subsidiary. Last month Mr Tony Butterworth, LIG group executive, took early retirement after Mr Alan Woltz, chairman, warned that profits in the first half of 1993 would be 'very substantially lower'. Studies suggest that surgeons cut their gloves in 40 per cent of operations. Often they do not realise they have done so, exposing both surgeon and patient to risk of infection, such as from HIV or hepatitis.</p>

			<p><P> August 6, 1989, Sunday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> HUD HELPS THE RICH TO TEE OFF AT COURSE;  </P> <P> $27-MILLION LOAN USED IN BUILDING LINKS, CLUBHOUSE AT UPSCALE RETIREMENT  COMMUNITY IN OCEANSIDE  </P> <P> A Los Angeles builder used a $27-million loan insured by the Department of  Housing and Urban Development to build a golf course and help finance a lavish  clubhouse for a private, gated retirement community in Oceanside, HUD records  show.  </P> <P> New homes in the development, called Leisure Village Ocean Hills, are selling  for as much as $329,000 and feature individual back-yard fountains and hot  tubs. Residents zip around the 400-acre complex in golf carts and gather at the  multimillion-dollar clubhouse, where two-story, carved wooden doors lead to an  auditorium with a parquet dance floor, a banquet kitchen, lapidary shop,  woodworking shop, Nautilus exercise studio, darkroom, billiard club and  wood-paneled "Wall Street Room," complete with high-backed leather chairs.  </P> <P> Leisure Village, developed by Leisure Technology Inc. of Los Angeles, was  approved by HUD in 1981 and dedicated in a 1984 ceremony hosted by Alexander M.  Haig Jr., who joined Leisure Technology's board of directors in 1983 after he  stepped down as U. S. secretary of state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Didn't Have Any Misgivings'  </P> <P> "At the time we did it, we didn't have any misgivings," said Charles J. Wilson,  manager of HUD's San Diego office. "But, looking back at it in retrospect, it  probably is elaborate."  </P> <P> The funding for Leisure Village was obtained under Title X, a much-criticized  loan-insurance program discontinued in June by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp. Kemp  said it was "riddled with abuses," had suffered enormous losses and had failed  to benefit the needy. The program guaranteed $500 million in loans over the  past 16 years, and losses so far total $90 million.  </P> <P> Because Leisure Village has been financially sound -- "one of the most  successful (HUD) projects in the country," according to Wilson -- it has caused  no losses for HUD. But neither has it provided any benefit for the poor. Only a  few of the duplex homes that went on sale beginning in 1984 at prices starting  at about $100,000 were within reach of those with moderate incomes. In fact,  according to a Leisure Technology official, most buyers required no mortgage  arrangements. They paid cash.  </P> <P> While allegations of influence peddling in HUD deals have been widespread in  recent months, there was no indication that such was the case with Leisure  Village. Haig became associated with the company after the $27-million loan was  approved, and officials say it was the only HUD project the company ever  arranged.  </P> <P> Title X was established to provide loan guarantees for developers of vacant  land who, in exchange, were supposed to set aside a percentage of housing units  for low- and moderate-income families. But HUD officials concede that the  set-asides were more of a suggestion than a requirement, and Leisure Village is  a case in point.  </P> <P> Plans for Leisure Village began in earnest in 1981, when officials of the firm,  then based in Newport Beach, decided to exercise their $9-million option to buy  400 acres in North San Diego County. They wanted to finance the construction of  a retirement community on the site with the help of a HUD-insured mortgage,  according to Joseph A. Gallagher III, president of the firm's Southern  California division.  </P> <P> Unsure of how to proceed, Leisure Technology  </P> <P> officials approached DRG Funding Corp., a mortgage lending firm that was known  to have expertise in dealing with Title X projects, Gallagher said. DRG  arranged the $27-million loan with an interest rate of 17.5% at a time when a  similar loan without HUD insurance would have been made at a 21% interest rate,  Gallagher said. An additional advantage was that it was a 10-year loan, rather  than the normal 18-month construction loan, Gallagher said.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Powerful Incentive  </P> <P> For DRG, as well as other lenders, there was a powerful incentive: The federal  government assumed all the risk in the event that the borrower defaulted. The  security offered by the federal insurance was to prove critical to DRG in later  years, as many of the firm's HUD-backed loans -- possibly as much as $500  million worth -- fell into default in another HUD insurance program.  </P> <P> HUD has since canceled DRG's right to issue HUD-insured mortgages, and a  federal grand jury is investigating allegations of fraud, theft and money  laundering involving DRG. HUD officials say privately that Leisure Village may  have been DRG's most financially sound HUD-related venture.  </P> <P> Documents show that DRG received a "financing fee" of $541,422 for making the  loan. That figure was in addition to the 17.5% interest it charged.  </P> <P> When Leisure Technology and DRG made their initial proposal to HUD's San Diego  office in 1980, they planned to build about 1,900 duplex units in an area of  rolling hills about 7 miles from the coast in Oceanside. Prices were expected  to range from $80,000 to $125,000, according to HUD documents.  </P> <P> The documents also outline the proposal for the 18-hole golf course, clubhouse  and other recreational facilities, including a swimming pool and tennis, boccie  ball and shuffleboard courts. The amenities of the development's Ocean Hills  Country Club are not open to the public, and are available only to residents of  the high-security complex.  </P> <P> Because it was the first Title X project in San Diego County, local HUD  officials were unfamiliar with the specifics of the program and consulted a HUD  manual containing guidelines for such developments, Wilson, the San Diego  manager, said in an interview last week.  </P> <P> The handbook reads: "A swimming pool, golf course, clubhouse, tennis court and  marina are examples of recreation facilities which may be included in a Title X  land development."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Prices Shot Up  </P> <P> "I remember in my own mind thinking, 'A golf course. Why would the department  do this?' " Wilson said. But, because the proposal appeared to meet all the  criteria for Title X insurance, it was approved by the San Diego office and  forwarded to HUD headquarters in Washington, where it received the final  go-ahead, he said.  </P> <P> Under the terms of the loan, the $27 million was to be used only for grading  and improving the land and constructing the development's common buildings.  Leisure Technology was to obtain private financing to construct the homes.  Wilson said there was little his office could do about the price of the units,  since there were no specific requirements in the loan agreement about what the  builder could charge.  </P> <P> The 1,000-square-foot units, the development's cheapest, were to cost $80,000,  but quickly shot up to $95,000 before any were sold, Gallagher said. The more  expensive ones sold for $135,000, and the average price was $115,000, he said.  </P> <P> The company was forced to raise the prices because the previous owner of the  land defaulted on an agreement to build a $5-million stretch of road needed to  reach the development, Gallagher said. The cost had to be absorbed by Leisure  Technology, he said.  </P> <P> Over the following year, prices rose an additional 10% to 15%, he said, and the  size of the houses was increased to meet consumer demand.  </P> <P> "In all our discussions at the time (of the loan application), low income was  never a consideration," Gallagher said, adding that the company considered the  $95,000 units "affordable."  </P> <P> "It didn't seem an inappropriate use of federal insurance," he said. "It made  HUD a lot of money (in insurance premiums). . . . I know that some developments  didn't work, but that seemed to be more because they were in the wrong  location. I don't think the concept was flawed, but people didn't do what they  were supposed to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Economically Sound Move  </P> <P> Gallagher said the HUD loan did not finance all of the complex's considerable  amenities and that Leisure Technology spent about $1.4 million on improvements  for the 27,000-square-foot clubhouse after using about $1.6 million from the  HUD-insured loan. Also, he said, the company paid for construction of the back  nine holes of the 18-hole golf course.  </P> <P> Construction of the golf course turned out to be an economically sound move, he  said, because it provided the company with an inexpensive on-site area in which  it could dispose of tons of rock excavated at the housing sites.  </P> <P> Leisure Technology paid off the loan in January, so HUD is no longer involved  in the project, according to John Kilduff, the firm's executive vice president  and chief financial officer in Los Angeles.  </P> <P> Leisure Technology, a developer of retirement communities in New Jersey, New  York, Florida, Illinois and California, has grown rapidly over the past decade  and two months ago announced it had reached a $1-billion agreement to build  retirement communities with a Japanese firm.  </P> <P> At the Oceanside complex, the company has moved away from duplexes and is now  building detached, single-family homes that are sold to upper-middle-income  buyers, many of them from the Los Angeles area who have developed substantial  equity in their homes, Kilduff said.  </P> <P> The "San Remo," described as a "private villa" in the development's Village of  Hydra, is the top-of-the-line model and sells for $329,990. It features three  bedrooms, a master bath suite, two full guest baths, a powder room, "a  magnificent oversized living room with walk-in wet bar" and a two-car garage,  according to a sales brochure.  </P> <P> The full range of facilities of the Ocean Hills Country Club comes with the  package, the brochure says. And, it notes, "Prices Are Subject to Change  Without Notice."  </P> <P> Times staff writers Douglas Frantz in Los Angeles and William J. Eaton in  Washington contributed to this story.  </P></p>

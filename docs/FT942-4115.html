			<p>940611 FT  11 JUN 94 / Honda to spend extra Pounds 330m at Swindon Honda is to invest a further Pounds 330m in its car production facilities at Swindon, Wiltshire, to raise capacity by 50 per cent to 150,000 cars a year by 1998. It will also consider a second expansion programme for the plant at the end of the decade. This increase in production will almost double the value of Honda's components purchases in Europe to nearly Pounds 1bn a year. It will also create another 500 jobs at the plant in addition to substantial extra employment projected for the company's 211 UK and Continental suppliers. The plant currently employs 1,400 people, a figure due to rise to 2,000 next year when production is scheduled to reach 100,000 units. This compares with 32,139 in 1993 and 50,000 scheduled for this year. Mr Kazue Ito, who is to take over as president of Honda Motor Europe at the end of this month, said yesterday that the value of components purchases would increase by proportionately more than car-unit production. This was mainly because Honda intended to increase 'local' - UK and continental European - content from the current 80 per cent to between 85 per cent and 90 per cent. Cars to be produced at Swindon - notably a successor to the Honda Concerto - will also be more sophisticated and require a higher absolute level of components. Mr Nobuhiko Kawamoto, Honda president, who yesterday announced the increased capacity plans, left the door open to further collaboration with other manufacturers in Europe, including both Rover and Rover's parent, BMW. The Swindon plant is also to start exports to the Middle East and Africa as part of an overall restructuring of Honda's European operations in the wake of BMW's takeover of Rover. These exports could reach 10,000 a year by 1999, Mr Ito said. Honda sells 50,000 cars a year in the two regions, almost wholly imported from Japan - many in kit form. Other countries may take Swindon exports, he indicated. Honda also said yesterday that it has set a total annual target for European car sales of at least 300,000 by the year 2000 - a 2 per cent market share compared with the market share of 1.4 per cent Honda presently has. Half of these vehicles would be supplied from Swindon. Meeting all these demands would exceed even the expanded Swindon capacity, Mr Ito acknowledged. The investment programme includes Pounds 30m for a steel body-parts pressings plant at the Swindon site, which will end Honda's dependence on Rover for body pressings for both the Swindon-built Honda Accord and a new medium-size car, code-named HH, which is to enter production at Swindon this autumn. This car - to be called the Civic like Honda's existing medium-size range - will be produced at a rate of up to 100,000 units a year when it goes on sale next spring. Rover's version of the HH, code-named Theta and replacing the current 200/400 series, also goes on sale next spring under continuing collaboration agreements between the two companies signed last month.</p>

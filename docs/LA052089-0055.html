			<p><P> May 20, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COUNCIL LOCKS IN SERIES OF CITY TAXES  </P> <P> As it has every year since 1983, the City Council on Friday extended a series  of "temporary" taxes on items ranging from utilities to hotel beds. But this  time, at the urging of Councilwoman Joan Milke Flores to "stop fooling  ourselves," the council struck the one-year-in-effect clauses, effectively  making the levies permanent.  </P> <P> The council spent only a few minutes discussing the measure, expected to bring  more than $200 million a year to city coffers, before approving it 13 to 0.  </P> <P> The speed at which the action swept through the council surprised even some  veteran City Hall staff members, who remember the long and acrimonious debates  these taxes have spawned in past years.  </P> <P> "Everybody knows they're not temporary," said Flores as she recommended  removing the so-called "sunset" provisions from the ordinances. Those clauses  provided that the taxes would expire in one year unless the council voted to  renew them.  </P> <P> Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky quickly seconded the motion and urged members to  support the measure, even though he has said it is a healthy exercise for the  council to review the taxes annually.  </P> <P> Only Councilman Nate Holden voiced any protest. "We're talking about forever,"  he cautioned his colleagues. But even Holden voted in favor of the measure when  he was reminded that the city already is counting on the funds the taxes will  generate in the coming fiscal year's $3.2-billion budget.  </P> <P> "There's no way to cut $200 million out of the budget," said City  Administrative Officer Keith Comrie. "It's just part of our tax base now."  </P> <P> The four taxes are:  </P> <P> * A utility user's tax -- the largest of the four -- of 10% of gas, water and  electric bills. This surcharge is estimated to raise $163 million in the coming  fiscal year, according to Comrie.  </P> <P> * A business tax, levied at a sliding-scale rate of from 1/10th of 1% to 1/2 of  1% of gross receipts; it is expected to raise $17 million.  </P> <P> * A hotel bed tax of 12 cents per room per night, expected to bring in $15  million.  </P> <P> * A sanitation equipment charge, costing each single-family household in the  city $1.50 a month, which will yield an estimated $11 million.  </P> <P> The taxes, which have withstood legal challenges, are not restricted by 1978's  statewide tax-cutting initiative, Proposition 13.  </P></p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Leonid Galinskiy] </F>   [Text] Moscow May 31 TASS -- "There will be no  privatization a la Chubays in Moscow," Moscow Mayor Yuriy  Luzhkov told ITAR-TASS here today. "It is not the matter of  conflict between the chairman of the State Committee for  Property and me, but essential differences in the vitally  important issue of the implementation of the state privatization  program".    Commenting on the recent appeal of Anatoliy Chubays to the  Russian procurator general's office in connection with the  Moscow mayor's privatization resolutions, Luzhkov said "I accept  this proposal of Mr Chubays with readiness, but I want him to  visit the procurator general's office together with me. I am  convinced that it is not my privatization resolutions that run  counter to the law but resolutions of the State Property  Committee".    In the opinion of Luzhkov, "the state institution has  usurped  the right to solve all problems in privatization and sometimes  makes serious mistakes" .    "We think that property should be sold and not squandered or  given away dirt cheap to anyone. That is why, I believe that  voucher privatization is a swindle to be investigated by the  procurator general due to the inadmissibility to squander state  property," he stressed.    Asked about major drawbacks in privatization, Luzhkov said  "I  am sure that privatization a la Chubays has brought almost no  positive results. It brought us no additional property. It  only ruins the state. Russia gained no new owners and  proprietors, as Chubays has promised. Privatization resulted in  an enormous number of speculators who are looking for an  opportunity to sell at high prices what they have bought dirt  cheap".</p>

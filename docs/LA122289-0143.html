			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> TITANS' MURPHY, NOTRE DAME ASSISTANT ARE TWO UNLV FINALISTS  </P> <P> Notre Dame assistant Jim Strong and Cal State Fullerton's Gene Murphy are the  final two candidates for the Nevada Las Vegas football coaching job, sources  said Thursday.  </P> <P> UNLV expects to name a coach at a news conference today, but had not scheduled  one as of Thursday night. The school would not confirm whether the job had been  offered to either candidate.  </P> <P> Murphy said Thursday night he had not heard from UNLV, and that if he were  offered the job he would not answer immediately but would take time to consider  the offer.  </P> <P> "If it happens, it happens," Murphy said. "I don't care. I'm real easy."  </P> <P> Strong could not be reached for comment. He was in Wisconsin on a recruiting  trip, according to a person who answered the phone at his home.  </P> <P> Strong, 35, has coached the backfield at Notre Dame the past two seasons. He  also has been an assistant under Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz at Minnesota and  Arkansas.  </P> <P> A 17-member UNLV committee met for five hours Thursday before narrowing the  list of five candidates.  </P> <P> Other finalists were Rams assistant Artie Gigantino, Fresno State assistant Pat  Hill and Houston offensive coordinator John Jenkins. Portland State Coach Pokey  Allen, who also interviewed, withdrew earlier this week, and Gigantino withdrew  Thursday night.  </P> <P> Murphy has earned praise for building a competitive program on a meager budget  at a school that does not have its own stadium. In his 10 years, Fullerton is  54-60-1. His teams have won two conference championships, in 1983 and again in  1984 when UNLV was forced to forfeit a victory over Fullerton because the  Rebels had used ineligible players.  </P> <P> Murphy was in demand five years ago after the Titans went 11-1 and was offered  jobs at Utah and Oregon State. Murphy chose to pursue the job at Missouri that  year, but finished second to Woody Widenhofer, whose tenure lasted four  seasons.  </P> <P> This season's 6-4-1 record has brought another round of speculation that Murphy  would leave.  </P> <P> Murphy met with Utah Athletic Director Chris Hill last week to discuss the  vacant Utah coaching job, but was not formally interviewed. Utah named Arizona  assistant Ron McBride, 50, as its coach on Thursday.  </P></p>

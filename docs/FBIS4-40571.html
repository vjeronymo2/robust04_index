			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Gleb Cherkasov report in the "Master" column: "Yuriy </F> Luzhkov Wants to Extend the Life of the Voucher. And Calls on  U.S. Businessmen To Be More `Go-Go'"]    [Text] At a meeting with representatives of the American  Chamber of Commerce in Russia, in Moscow, Yuriy Luzhkov  expressed regret over the fact that the U.S. business community  is pursuing an "overcautious" line in the sphere of joint  cooperation and investments in Russia and Moscow. After  enumerating a number of projects executed and in the process of  being implemented by Moscow authorities with foreign (non-U.S.)  companies, the Moscow mayor admitted the existence of problems  both in the legislative sphere and in ensuring security for  businessmen, and called on representatives of U.S. business  circles to be more forthright in pointing out existing  shortfalls to the Moscow authorities: "We cannot be reproached  for not wanting to listen to foreign businessmen." Yuriy  Luzhkov described as "absurd" rumors about Moscow city officials  demanding bribes and payoffs from U.S. business people. Talking  about the efforts by the Moscow authorities to create a  favorable climate for foreign investments, the Moscow mayor  spoke about deposit funds to ensure against "force majeur"  circumstances. According to Yuriy Luzhkov, the services sector,  tourism, and construction are the most promising areas for  foreign investment in Moscow. In the construction sphere alone,  according to Luzhkov, at least $2 billion worth of investments  is needed annually.    Touching on problems of crime control, Yuriy Luzhkov  admitted  the complexity of the current situation, noting that in the past  year the Moscow authorities have done their utmost to improve  the situation. According to Luzhkov, work along these lines is  under way, but additional legislative measures are called for.  In this connection the Moscow mayor highly appraised the latest  presidential crime control edict. Yuriy Luzhkov denied elite  militia formations would be created to defend entrepreneurs.    On the issue of his disagreements with Vice Premier Chubays,  Yuriy Luzhkov pointed out that the president's decision about  privatization in Moscow is a triumph not for Luzhkov but for  common sense. Accusing "democrat Chubays" of implementing "the  worst possible communist principles," Luzhkov declared that  "voucher" privatization has been a flop. At the same time the  Moscow authorities intend to find ways to remedy the situation,  in particular, according to the Moscow mayor, by insisting that  the life of the privatization check be extended. Furthermore,  the Moscow authorities plan "actively and expeditiously" to  translate into reality their own model for the second stage of  privatization the result of which will be the sell-off of  property to "real masters" at realistic prices.</p>

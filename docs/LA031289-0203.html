			<p><P> March 12, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HOSPITAL SHIP CONVERSION PROJECT HITS FINANCIAL SHOALS  </P> <P> Like a ghost ship at the mercy of the elements, the Oceanic sits idly in the  harbor.  </P> <P> Below the bare decks, darkened passageways strewn with debris lead to crew's  quarters containing bunks without mattresses and toilets without plumbing. On a  table near the bridge lay two old maps, one of the Maine coast, the other  showing New York's Hudson and East rivers from Governor's Island to 67th  Street. In the galley next to a bowl of rotten grapes and a crumbled cigarette  carton, a dusty guest book bears entries that end on Jan. 31.  </P> <P> That is the last time anybody but journalists has been aboard the Oceanic. For  more than a month, the vessel has been anchored a few hundred yards offshore  near the Long Beach Naval Station in the Port of Los Angeles.  </P> <P> There are those who envision the ship -- which is painted white with a huge red  cross on its side -- as a majestic floating hospital that will one day carry  volunteer doctors to needy ports in Mexico and Central America. In reality the  vessel, accessible by water taxi at a fee of $100 an hour, is at the center of  a bureaucratic dispute that may keep it anchored for some time.  </P> <P> The most immediate problem is that Los Angeles port officials will not let the  ship berth until it can operate under its own power. But its skipper says the  ship can't operate under its own power until port officials let it berth for  repairs.  </P> <P> The project "just might go down the tubes," complained Tom Keegan, a former  Merchant Marine captain, now in a wheelchair, who skippers the Oceanic. "That  would be sad for everybody."  </P> <P> Counters Ed Hill, the port's chief wharfinger: "The ship's a long way from  being operable. Putting her in port would be dangerous."  </P> <P> Keegan, 49, first conceived his dream of delivering medical supplies and  services to Third World countries after a 1985 motorcycle accident paralyzed  him from the chest down, ending a seagoing career that had spanned 25 years.  Becoming acquainted with the medical technology that saved his life, he said,  helped him recognize the dearth of proper medical equipment and services in  many of the ports he had visited.  </P> <P> "People south of the border in my condition wouldn't have survived," he said.  "They don't need food down there as much as they need medical attention."  </P> <P> When he heard of an available ship with 7,500 square feet of covered deck space  and 800 tons of storage capacity, the captain rejoiced. Built by the Canadian  government in 1969, the Oceanic -- formerly called the Atlantic Jag -- served  as a tuna clipper for several years before being purchased by Sea Trec  Enterprises Inc., a shipbuilding firm in Chula Vista that intended to convert  it into a salmon processor. But financing for the project fell through, leaving  the 200-foot vessel tied up and losing money. When Keegan suggested converting  it into a hospital, the owners agreed.  </P> <P> "He's a pretty convincing chap," said Sea Trec owner Doug Lotoski, whose wife  is a nurse. "He's got a good idea, the ship would be ideal for the project and  he is very very sincere. So we thought we'd give him a shot."  </P> <P> Although Sea Trec still owns the vessel, Lotoski said, the company has agreed  to sell it eventually to Keegan for an unspecified amount. In the meantime, he  said, the captain has full possession of the vessel as he attempts to add four  operating rooms, eight recovery beds, three dental chairs, an X-ray machine,  orthopedic unit and complete blood lab.  </P> <P> Just how he intends to accomplish all that is still rather vague.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Nonprofit Status  </P> <P> To begin with, Keegan set up a nonprofit organization headed by Dr. Alton  Ochsner, a New Orleans surgeon. "The idea is very good," said Ochsner, who also  heads a private foundation that provides medical aid to the indigent in the  Caribbean. "We've been slow in getting this thing going." Ochsner said he first  heard of Keegan's work through a mutual friend in the medical community.  </P> <P> Others listed as members of Keegan's board of directors include Dr. P. William  Oysinger, a professor of internal medicine at Loma Linda University; Frank C.  Flores Jr., a dentist on the staff of the USC School of Dentistry; Robert E.  Green, a dentist in private practice in Highland, Calif., and Alejandro  Rostran, a member of the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> According to Keegan, the proposed remodeling of the Oceanic -- as well as the  plans for its eventual operation with the help of volunteer doctors and crew  members -- is being overseen by board members and various volunteer medical  technicians. The remodeling work, he said, will be done by several local  maritime unions that have offered to work for free.  </P> <P> A spokeswoman for San Bernardino Community Hospital, where Keegan once was a  patient, said hospital staff members are collecting used medical equipment to  donate to the project.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Support Promised  </P> <P> The captain also carries a sheath of letters from foundations, private  companies, medical centers, doctors, hospitals and politicians promising  various levels of moral, material and financial support.  </P> <P> What Keegan does not have much of, however, is cash.  </P> <P> So several weeks ago he moved the ship up the coast from San Diego to San Pedro  in an effort to attract more attention and thereby generate more contributions.  Because of a defective generator and other problems, however, the ship had to  be towed all the way. Now, its inability to move under its own power has become  an albatross that threatens to sink the project altogether.  </P> <P> Although the U.S. Army has offered to let Keegan use one of its docks for the  90 days he estimates it will take to convert the Oceanic to medical use, the  dock at Berth 55 in San Pedro was not immediately available the day the vessel  arrived. So port officials decided to give the ship temporary berthing nearby.  But after a short grace period during which little apparent progress was made,  they had the ship unceremoniously towed to its present out-of-the-way location  in the outer harbor.  </P> <P> </P> <P> He Needs Three Weeks  </P> <P> "That's a surge area," Hill said, referring to the fact that the Army's Berth  55 is subject to changing tide levels, which sometimes require vessels to be  moved. "We don't put dead vessels there," he said.  </P> <P> Keegan says he needs at least three more weeks in port to do the repairs  necessary to make the ship seaworthy. Hill says that to let an inoperable ship  tie up any longer would have constituted an unacceptable hazard. And hanging  over everything is the $114-a-day tariff normally charged by the port for ships  the size of the Oceanic.  </P> <P> Keegan says he can't afford the tariff and that it ought to be waived. Hill  says that a decision to waive the tariff could be considered only if Keegan can  prove that the Oceanic is a bona fide relief vessel destined for a country  considered stricken.  </P> <P> "No vessel is a relief vessel if it's dead in the water," the wharfinger said.  "(Keegan's) been treated very generously by the port, but we have our  limitations."  </P></p>

			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / Canada's leading lady challenged THE RACE for the leadership of Canada's ruling Conservative party has tightened markedly, raising the possibility that the frontrunner, defence minister Ms Kim Campbell, may be pipped at the post by Mr Jean Charest, the youthful environment minister. About 3,800 Conservative delegates will gather in Ottawa next weekend to choose a successor to Mr Brian Mulroney both as party leader and prime minister. Their main concern will be to pick a leader with the best chance of beating the opposition Liberals in the general election which must be held before November. Up to a few weeks ago, Ms Campbell was seen as virtually invincible in the leadership race. But several recent opinion polls indicate that 34-year-old Mr Charest would fare better in the general election. A poll published yesterday by Angus Reid Associates concluded that only 29 per cent of decided voters would support a Campbell-led Tory party, with 38 per cent favouring the Liberals. With Mr Charest at the helm, however, the Tories could expect 34 per cent of the votes, only fractionally behind the Liberals. The policy positions of the two candidates are difficult to distinguish. But Ms Campbell's popularity has been hurt by an unrelenting barrage of media attention, which has portrayed her as a blunt intellectual out of touch with the 'real' world. Despite being a Quebecker, Mr Charest has won admirers throughout the country with an easygoing style and perfect bilingualism. While organisers in the Campbell camp remain confident their candidate will win the leadership, they acknowledge that the vote will be closer than initially expected. Moody's Investors Services of New York has reduced its rating on Quebec government and Hydro-Quebec bonds a notch to A1 from Aa3, or the level ruling in 1986, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal. Quebec finance minister Gerard Levesque said the downgrade was not justified in view of the government's commitment to wipe out the budget deficit by 1996-97.</p>

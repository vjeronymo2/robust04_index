			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondents Gennadiy Yezhov and Anna </F> Melnikova]    [Text] Moscow, 15 Apr -- Since September 1993 Russia has  been totally financing the Black Sea Fleet. Thus, the fleet is  Russian even with regard to its means of existence, Russian  Defense Minister Pavel Grachev told journalists after a news  conference given by the CIS leaders. There can be no question  of paying rent in this case, the army general stressed.  Moreover, in these conditions Ukraine's security in the Black  Sea is being provided at Russia's expense.    Asked by journalists whether there has been any change in  the  top military circles' attitude to President Bill Clinton's  "Partnership for Peace" initiative, Grachev said: "Until very  recently I was an active supporter of signing the proposed U.S.  concept very quickly. The recent development of the situation  in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, has shown that that the  concept proposed by the U.S. President is good only in words.  We have gained the impression that our 'partners' are acting  behind our backs. I am not afraid to change my opinion if I  have been mistaken," the Russian defense minister said in  conclusion, "and I have now changed it."</p>

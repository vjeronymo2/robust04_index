			<p>BFN     [Text] Seoul, April 26 (YONHAP) -- Spurred by fears of war  and anxiety over the possible collapse of the Kim Il-song  regime, senior North Korean party, government and military  officials are hoarding U.S. dollars, gold, jewelry and other  valuables.    A persistent distrust of the local currency, the won, is  also  driving the North Korean elite to convert their money into  capitalist currency or other valuables, according to information  filtering through to the South.    Pyongyang's leaders have been hyping a war mentality among  their countrymen by boasting, "We will accomplish unification  through the barrel of a gun."    Of late, they have been instilling fear in ordinary citizens  by claiming that South Korea and the United States are about to  invade the North because of the deadlocked nuclear row.    The Stalinist state's leaders have contributed further to  the  atmosphere of anxiety by ordering power blackouts and air raid  exercises.    As a result, many North Koreans now believe that war will  eventually break out on the peninsula.    One member of the pro-Pyongyang Association of Korean  Residents in Japan (Chochongnyon) who claims to know the  commander of the Fourth North Korean Army Corps, identified only  as Gen. Chang, said many North Koreans were buying U.S. dollars  and Japanese yen from ethnic Koreans in China who trade goods  across the border at prices that are considerably higher than  the official rates.    Others are secretly amassing stores of alluvial gold, he  said.    In particular, military generals like Chang are holding  hundreds of thousands of dollars and gold ingots as large as 15  centimeters long, 5 centimeters wide and 4 centimeters thick.  Some are also hoarding pearl and gold necklaces, gold bracelets  and earrings.    The Chochongnyon official said one of his relatives,  identified only as An, a senior member of the Central Workers  (Communist) Party in charge of agriculture, is hiding an  unspecified amount of yen and jewelry.    NAEWOE Press, South Korea's official watcher of North Korean  affairs, said another reason North Koreans are hoarding foreign  currency and valuables was because of a possible, abrupt  exchange of old bills with new ones like the swap carried out on  July 15, 1992.    At that time, the Pyongyang government conducted a  one-to-one  exchange of old and new cash but limited the amount citizens  could change, forcing them to deposit the excess at the central  bank and other financial institution. They could withdraw the  deposited money under different regulations later on, NAEWOE  said.    The government allowed individual households to exchange up  to 399 won while depositing 30,000 won and no more.    Because of this irrational and forceful measure, many angry  citizens burned excess money they had saved or simply tossed the  bills into the river.</p>

			<p>920316 FT  16 MAR 92 / Irish ayes and the Chicago float vote IT IS perfectly clear who could win the Democratic party's presidential primary in Illinois tomorrow, writes Jurek Martin. His name is Pat O'Connor, he comes from Chicago's 40th ward and he would win, if he were running, because he had easily the largest float in Saturday's St Patrick's Day parade. National politicians are not really welcome at this celebration of Irishness by Chicago's policemen, plumbers, pipefitters and social club members. The three Democratic candidates stayed away, not only because none can afford contracting pneumonia from Windy City at this stage. Pat Buchanan was going to appear but spent the morning with Ukrainians instead. Their supporters were out working the crowds, though hopelessly outnumbered by those running for local office. By the number of placards seen and leaflets collected, Bill Clinton will beat Paul Tsongas here easily, with Jerry Brown nowhere, but this is hardly a scientific measurement. More reliable was a weekend Chicago Sun-Times poll giving the governor of Arkansas 48 per cent, the former senator from Massachusetts 21 per cent and the former governor of California 7 per cent. It also had President Bush overwhelming Mr Buchanan by 79-15 per cent on the Republican side. The Mason-Dixon poll in neighbouring Michigan, which also votes tomorrow, told a similar tale, with Mr Clinton at 48 per cent, Mr Tsongas 22 per cent and Mr Brown 11 per cent. But most ward bosses were more interested in local races for office.</p>

			<p>920916 FT  16 SEP 92 / China to boycott arms talks CHINA is boycotting talks between the five permanent members of the UN Security Council on restricting arms sales to the Middle East in what appears to be its first retaliation against President Bush's decision to allow the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Taiwan. Reuters news agency quoted a State Department official as saying China had informed the US that it would not attend the talks, for which no date has yet been set. 'They've said they will not be going to the. . . talks,' the official said, adding: 'We will be arguing against that.' However, China is taking part in separate multilateral talks on Middle East arms controls, which began yesterday in Moscow. Beijing is furious that Mr Bush cleared the sale of up to 150 fighters in what it says is a breach of a 1982 Sino-US agreement. It said the decision would make it difficult for China to co-operate in arms control and non-proliferation efforts. It was not clear yesterday whether the Chinese boycott was the beginning of a sustained campaign of non-co-operation in arms control discussions, or a one-off action designed to underline its displeasure at the fighter sale. The State Department official said the decision did not mean Beijing would resume arms sales to the region, but it would be watching carefully.</p>

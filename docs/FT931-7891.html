			<p>930222 FT  22 FEB 93 / US Money and Credit: President delivers a rosy outlook for Treasuries IT IS unlikely that any new president in modern history has received so enthusiastic a reaction from the domestic bond markets as has Mr Bill Clinton the past week. When he won the presidential election on November 3, the yield on the benchmark 30-year government bond was standing at 7.645 per cent and the yield on the two-year note was 4.416 per cent. On Friday, after a week-long rally in bond prices, the 30-year yield had plunged to 7.000 per cent and two-year yield had dropped to 3.945 per cent. The 30-year is now recording the lowest yield since the issue was first sold to the public in 1977. Given that Democratic presidents are normally regarded as the enemy of fixed-income investors - because they like to use the power of the government to generate economic growth, a policy approach that can have inflationary consequences - the performance of the bond markets under President Clinton has been remarkable. The recent strength in bond prices can be put down to a variety of factors, but one has been dominant - a surprise among Treasury investors at the president's willingness to propose tough, politically unpopular measures to cut the huge federal deficit. Last week's economic plan from President Clinton, a mixture of big tax increases, selected spending cuts, and targeted government 'investments' - a euphemism for more spending - was a braver assault on the deficit than the bond market could ever have imagined in the pre-election days of mid-1992. The president's economic package - which is geared to short-term economic stimulus this year but which quickly shifts its focus towards deficit-reduction in 1994 and 1995 - has been welcomed by bond investors not just because it tackles the deficit problem. The plan has also earned applause because the Treasury market believes the net effect of the measures proposed in the State of the Union address last week will be to slow the rate of economic growth in 1994 and possibly beyond. This is not only good news on the inflation front, but also in terms of the direction of monetary policy. As Mr Neal Soss, chief economist at First Boston, said of the president's economic package last week: 'This is extremely bullish for securities markets, because it postpones the prospects for any Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy.' Mr Soss believes that the tax increases will effectively take the place of interest rate rises as the main method of pacing economic growth and stifling inflation. President Clinton, however, cannot claim all the credit for the bond rally. Prices have been driven higher recently by at least two other factors. One has been the flight to quality by investors frightened by the dramatic downturn in stock prices after the president's tax increases were first announced. The other has been the continued speculation that the Treasury plans a big cut in the size of future long bond issues as part of a plan to reduce the cost of servicing the federal deficit. The flight to quality will probably continue to benefit the bond market until equity investors have grown more comfortable with the new economic policy emanating from the White House, and despite hints from the Treasury to the contrary, longer-dated prices will also continue to benefit from expectations of future cuts in long-bond issuance. Consequently, the market's short-term outlook looks rosy. As Salomon Brothers said on Friday: 'If the key 7 per cent threshold on long Treasury yields is breached - as we expect - long-term yields are likely to head toward 6 1/2 per cent.'</p>

In a statement on arrival  in Islamabad today on a two-day visit to Pakistan, he said the  legitimate aspirations of the Kashmiri people cannot be crushed  by force. The ICO secretary general said the Indian atrocities  have crossed the limits on which the ICO is deeply concerned.  The large-scale massacres in Sopor and Kupwara, in which  hundreds of people were martyred, have dealt a deep blow to the  Islamic world. He said the ICO will move a resolution at the UN  Human Rights Commission meeting currently being held in Geneva  to halt the human rights violations in occupied Kashmir.    On Bosnia-Herzegovina, the secretary general said our  efforts  are to get the use of force against Serbs authorized by the UN  Security Council and also get the unjust and illegitimate arms  embargo on Bosnia-Herzegovina Government lifted.</p>

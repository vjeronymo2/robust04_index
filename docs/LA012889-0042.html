			<p><P> January 28, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CONTROVERSY OVER TAPED POLICE 'STING'  </P> <P> Some thoughts on the Long Beach police incident:  </P> <P> * By law one must comply with any order issued by legal authority.  </P> <P> * Control of a situation may entail more than a police request.  </P> <P> * Long Beach police Officer Mark Dickey ought to be fired for being so stupid  as to slam anyone into a glass window, destroying property, endangering himself  and the suspect while losing control of the situation.  </P> <P> * Activists like suspect Don Jackson are a pain for the prevailing majority but  they are revered in this country for being the point men in effecting political  change. They include personages such as Sam Adams, Paul Revere, Thomas  Jefferson, the Quaker's Anne Hutchinson, the Minutemen, John Brown, the  Abolitionists, Eugene V. Debs, Walter Reuther, Clarence Darrow, Amelia Bloomer,  the Suffragettes, Theodore Roosevelt, Margaret Sanger, Upton Sinclair, Martin  Luther King, Jackie Robinson, Eleanor Roosevelt -- just a small fraction of the  troublemakers who now reside in the pantheon of American heroes.  </P> <P> ULLA BAUERS  </P> <P> Highland  </P></p>

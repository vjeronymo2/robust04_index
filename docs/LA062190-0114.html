			<p><P> June 21, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: AZUSA;  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS  </P> <P> The City Council gave preliminary approval to an ordinance to make campaign  contribution limits conform with those of the state, repealing a measure that  was stricter than state law.  </P> <P> The Monday night vote was unanimous on the ordinance, which will require a  second vote before it becomes law.  </P> <P> It is scheduled to be considered at the July 2 council meeting.  </P> <P> Under the previous ordinance, adopted in January, individual contributions were  limited to $250. The state limit is $1,000. Political action committees may  contribute up to $2,500 to a candidate under the new measure, as opposed to  $500 under the earlier one. And so-called broad-based political committees, or  those that get contributions from 100 or more people, may make campaign  contributions up to $5,000 -- $4,000 more than allowed in the previous  ordinance.  </P> <P> "This way we'll be uniform with the state and the bookkeeping and paper work  will be a lot easier," said Mayor Eugene Moses. "The limits set by the state  are very fair."  </P></p>

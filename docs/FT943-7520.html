			<p>940823 FT  23 AUG 94 / Ghost Towns: Decay and hope in 'Queen of the North' - With MPs due to publish a report on shopping centres in the autumn, the first of a series examines claims that urban centres are beyond repair A stroll along the High Street of Stockton-on-Tees reveals past glories, recent decline and a hint of hope for the future. Reputedly Britain's widest, the High Street is the heart of a market town which received its charter in 1310 and for centuries was a bustling port and trading centre. Older residents remember the smart shops, the crowds, the thriving thrice-weekly market. Mr Jack Klyman, chairman of the market traders' association, said: 'We were considered the 'Queen of the North'.' The open-air market survives and the 18th-century town hall still stands in the centre of the street, but much else has changed. Charity shops and amusement arcades now compete for attention with discount outlets. A few high-street shops remain, including Marks and Spencer and Boots, but Stockton is notably lacking in new clothes stores and upmarket and independent retailers. Many say the decline began in the 1960s, when the Castle Centre development fronting on to the High Street replaced many of the old buildings. New roads diverted traffic from the centre, and a policy of the local authority during the 1970s of concentrating development on Middlesbrough compounded Stockton's problems of under-investment. The decline of traditional heavy industry cost Cleveland 63,000 jobs between 1975 and 1985  -a quarter of its total. Local spending power dropped and in those 10 years, 40 national retailers left the town and only 15 moved in. Today Stockton borough council insists the town centre has 'turned the corner' and started its recovery. Some retailers, such as Mrs Elaine Smith, manager of M&amp;S, say their business is healthy. But in the side streets the tenacity of the few independent retailers who have clung on  - such as Mr Tony Lockwood, who owns a shoe shop - is being severely tested. Lockwood's was founded by his father and Mr Lockwood, who joined the family business in 1961, said he was 'broken-hearted' at what has happened. 'The staunch regulars are going. I don't know how long we can stay here.' At the end of nearby Prince Regent Street, where clearance sites, decaying buildings and a boarded-up cinema combine to depress the spirits, Mr Stephen Grabham, a third-generation gentleman's outfitter, speaks with dignified disgust of raising his shop's shutters only to find them spattered with night-clubbers' urine. He said: 'The decline in the area is terrible. Unless business picks up we shall have to relocate to a nicer environment.' This would be bad news for Stockton. Traders and development organisations agree that what the town centre needs most is more quality retailers and more parking space to attract affluent shoppers. Stockton has the added difficulty of establishing an identity for itself in the face of fierce competition from nearby Middlesbrough, Darlington and the well-heeled market towns to the south, as well as out-of-town retailing. These developments include the 500,000 sq ft Teesside Retail Park, an Pounds 80m scheme with plenty of parking. It was built on former racecourse land and is only a couple of miles from the High Street. Town-centre traders and the local authority are alarmed at proposals for a 180,000 sq ft extension, but Mr Duncan Hall, chief executive of the government-funded Teesside Development Corporation which developed the scheme, said the retail park is not undermining the town centre. One of its objectives, he said, is to stop people travelling away from Teesside to shop. 'All the shopping we have introduced was new to the area.' The government's view of this will be known soon - the result of a public inquiry in May into the expansion plan is expected in the autumn. The impact of other development corporation schemes on the town centre is less controversial. The new Tees barrage, for example, is expected to transform the river behind the central shops into an attractive leisure amenity. The council and Stockton City Challenge, a government-funded urban regeneration initiative, are working to develop this potential by bringing a replica of Captain Cook's barque Endeavour to the riverside and introducing art to the town centre. A third of the Pounds 150m of public and private investment that City Challenge hopes to bring to Stockton is earmarked for the town centre. Early results include grant-aided improvement of shop fronts, town-centre flats created in a 'living above the shop' scheme, new lighting in the High Street, and the closing of some streets to most traffic. This autumn the council will launch a Pounds 4.5m closed-circuit television system to help reduce crime and increase public confidence. Some retailers are unhappy about the traffic restrictions - buses still use the street - and complain that it has cost parking spaces. But Mr Chris Oldershaw, City Challenge manager, said more projects would bring a net increase of about 1,000 spaces by 1998. His proposal is for a Pounds 40m retail development behind the High Street which is intended to rejuvenate it by creating quality units for retailers. Mr Oldershaw believes Stockton's prospects are good, but warned: 'You don't turn a town around overnight. We need to impress on people they must take a long-term view.'</p>

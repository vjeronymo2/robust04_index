As our press correspondent, Andrei Barsan, reported in his  speech given after the signing of the framework document, NATO  General Secretary Manfred Woerner emphasized that by joining the  PFP concept, the Republic of Moldova demonstrates that it shares  the main objective pursued by the Alliance: Building a European  order of peace that is based on the principles of democracy and  human rights.    Referring to problems in the east of Moldova, Manfred  Woerner  said that the Alliance supports a rapid and complete withdrawal  of foreign troops from that area and hopes that a rapid peaceful  solution may be found in connection with the said problems.    In turn, President Mircea Snegur said that, as a trustworthy  partner, Moldova will strengthen its bilateral relations with  Central and East European countries and will cooperate honestly  with the Euro-Atlantic security structures in accordance with  the PFP principles and objectives.    We pay special attention to the mechanism of consultations  on  security stipulated by the PFP, particularly when a  participating state believes that it is facing a direct threat  against its territorial integrity, political independence, and  national security. This is all the more important since the  said principles are questioned today by the presence of foreign  troops on the territory of Moldova; something that represents  the main obstacle for a definitive political solution to the  conflict in the east of Moldova.</p>

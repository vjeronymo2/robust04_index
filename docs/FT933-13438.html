			<p>930719 FT  19 JUL 93 / International Company News: BSN to take shareholding in Delta BSN, the big French foods and drinks group best known for its range of yoghurts, is to take a shareholding in Delta, the Greek dairy products company, Reuter reports from Paris. The two companies have agreed to an accord which calls for BSN initially to take 10 per cent of Delta. No price was given for the deal. Delta had turnover of Dr51bn or some FFr1.27bn in 1992, and made a net profit of FFr122m, BSN said. BSN made a net profit last year of FFr3.44bn on sales of FFr70.8bn. It will bring its expertise to Delta, which will ultimately make yoghurts under the Danone brand name. Initially, the Greek company's yoghurts will keep the Delta name. BSN already has a joint venture in Bulgaria making Danone yoghurts.</p>

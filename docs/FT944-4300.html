			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Vladivostok mayor fights back The former mayor of the Russian far eastern city of Vladivostok, who was forcibly deposed by the regional governor in March, demanded his reinstatement yesterday with the support of citizens' groups. Mr Victor Cherepkov was cleared last Friday of charges of taking bribes - allegations levelled against him by Mr Yevgeny Nazdratenko, governor of Primorskye Krai, the far-eastern region. The Sevodnya newspaper reported Mr Cherepkov as saying he would sue the governor - who was the object of a report by Russian liberal parties that demanded his sacking on the grounds of arbitrary and corrupt rule. A group of parties in Vladivostok - which has become a byword for organised crime and corruption - issued an appeal to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, demanding the former mayor's reinstatement.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Serbo-Croatian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with Ivan Jarnjak, minister of internal affairs </F> of the Republic of Croatia, by Marko Barisic; place and date not  given: "Serbs Do Not Feel Like Leaving Croatia"]    [Text] There are many reasons for an interview with Mr.  Ian Jarnjak, who was the mayor of Krapina and the deputy  minister of internal affairs before becoming the minister of  internal affairs. There have recently been so many events that  the Ministry of Internal Affairs has to say something about,  they cannot fit into an interview. We first asked Minister  Jarnjak to assess safety in the Republic of Croatia.    [Jarnjak] It has been noticed that the number of the most  serious crimes, such as murders, terrorist actions, or planting  of bombs and explosives, has dropped compared to 1992. We are  happy about this and wish to highlight it as the main  characteristic of 1993. We can say that safety is better than  in the previous years. Clearly, there has also been less war  conflict. It must be pointed out that we have had two tourist  seasons, in which not even the slightest incident has occurred,  so that we can say that Croatia is a stable low-risk country.  The remark made by the Italian minister of internal affairs  during the meeting in Italy in June 1993 that Italian citizens  know that Croatia is safer than Italy is interesting in this  context.    [Barisic] Still, some towns are more dangerous than others,  Split for example.    [Jarnjak] The Ministry of Internal Affairs makes a list of  everything that happens in the country every month. Based on  this information we plan our actions and personnel changes, if  necessary. After we had discussed these monthly reports we  realized that the situation in Split is worse than the Croatian  average, which was the signal for us to respond to this  situation. The first thing we did was to improve the personnel  structure. We took a series of measures, among other things we  dismissed the then chairman of the Police Department for Split  and Dalmatia, but the new one did not achieve the expected  results, either. Then we brought a third man and gave him until  the end of 1993 as a deadline to create order. We also took  preventive and repressive actions, we brought several hundred  policemen from other parts of Croatia to Split to help their  colleagues, especially at border crossings and in Dubrovnik.  After that, 500 new policemen came to help establish order.  Split is a distinct area from many aspects, primarily because  of refugees, but living in the city no longer entails any great  risk, but is like any other town in Croatia. I think that  safety in Split is improving and that it will soon be above the  Croatian average.    [Barisic] What do you think about the border between Croatia  and Herceg-Bosna as far as smuggling and economic crimes are  concerned?    [Jarnjak] This is a very complex question. As the deputy  minister of internal affairs, I met with representatives of the  Croatian communes in Bosnia-Herzegovina as far back as 1991. We  discussed this problem and reached the agreement -- according to  the proposal by President Tudjman -- to establish some kind of  border because the Croats from Bosnia-Herzegovia kept on buying  various goods, especially gasoline, in Croatia. That kind of  border was not a problem for honest people, but smuggling  developed into a big problem here. Legal stipulations favored  it since the taking of goods to Herceg-Bosna was treated as a  classic export, which could not be controlled. After this  stipulation became ineffective, this border became like any  other; the crime is here no bigger than at any other border  crossing.    It was at this border that we achieved good cooperation  between the police, the customs and the finance police. I think  that we have established good cooperation with Mr. Prlic, the  prime minister of Herceg-Bosna, and with Mr. Coric, the minister  of internal affairs, by a recent agreement, which is already  showing the first results. This is now a flexible, open border,  but nevertheless everything is under control.    [Barisic] What are relations between the Ministry of  Internal Affairs of the Republic of Croatia and the institutions  of Herceg-Bosna like?    [Jarnjak] The Ministry of Internal Affairs and, I dare say,  me, as the minister, did everything we could to help our  Croatian people in Bosnia-Herzegovina defend themselves. We are  now helping them in organizing their police from the point of  view of logistics, personnel and organization. We visited the  border crossings in 1991 and talked to the people who are now  high-ranking officials in Herceg-Bosna about the preparation of  the defense strategy. I informed Mr. Tudjman on these talks and  asked him to help us define the best way to help them. The  president supported our ideas so we founded a training center,  and this was visited by Croats from the whole of  Bosnia-Herzegovina. We made a program in the Ministry of  Internal Affairs that included an 11-day course organized in  Makarska. This program can be compared to a spider's web;  several people who wanted to become local commanders in their  Croatian place in Bosnia attended the course. They were taught  to organize themselves and make units. I would like to point  out that these courses were organized as early as 1991 -- while  there was peace there. Approximately 1,500 people attended  these courses. They have been in charge of the defense of  Herceg-Bosna from the very beginning. When the first group  completed the course and went to Bosnia-Herzegovina, they were  sworn in by Mate Boban on behalf of Herceg-Bosna, and by me on  behalf of Croatia.    These courses were secret because these people were not to  be discovered. I told you all these things to show you that our  cooperation dates back to 1991. I would like to add that we did  not interfere with the integrity of Bosnia-Herzegovina as a  state; we simply did not want to allow Croatian regions to  remain unprepared for defense.    [Barisic] What do you think about the documents published in  the press accusing Tomislav Mercep, an adviser at the Ministry  of Internal Affairs?    [Jarnjak] I do not think that he is being charged with  something, he is only being accused, because he can be charged  with something only by the attorney general. It is correct that  during the investigation of the murder in the Zec family some  people made very broad statements and told us things we did not  know before. The collected material was forwarded to the Office  of the Attorney General. The outcome of the trial for murder is  well known, but we as the Ministry of Internal Affairs have no  right and we do not want to comment on decisions made by courts.  After I read the article in GLOBUS, I first tried to find out  whether the Ministry of Internal Affairs gave any kind of  information about this case and asked the Ministry employees to  make written reports. I learned that the Zagreb Police  Department reported on this case in the second half of December  1991 at the request of the Office for the Protection of the  Constitutional Order, and there are documents about it. We  wrote our report in three copies: One was left at the Zagreb  Police Department, and two were forwarded to the aforementioned  office. The complete case was submitted to the attorney general  for further procedure. This means that the police accomplished  its part of the task.    As far as concerns the question how our report reached the  public, I have to say that I examined the Ministry employees;  all persons who could have somehow had access to the report, or  had any knowledge on it, were asked to make written reports.  They stated, with moral and financial accountability, that none  of them enabled anybody to come to this information.    [Barisic] Does this mean that this information leaked out  from the Office for the Protection of the Constitutional Order?    [Jarnjak] I do not know where the information came from, but  I would like to point out that according to written reports it  did not come out from the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Should  it be proven during the investigation that one of the Ministry  employees made a false statement, the consequences are clear,  regardless of who this person is. The Ministry of Internal  Affairs will not tolerate the removal of documents marked as  "state secret." I would like to stress -- no matter who this  person is. Not because the public should not be informed, but  because the case has been handled by the attorney general, in  which case the Ministry of Internal Affairs can be involved only  upon order of the attorney general if necessitated by some  additional information. From this point of view it is clear  that Ministry employees are not allowed to bring information  into circulation. These are the facts and the genesis of the  whole case.    Personally, I think that the person who spread this  information did not have good intentions. If he wanted to  stimulate the functioning of the constitutional state, it would  have been enough if he had told the attorney general and  judicial authorities to handle the case, since the attorney  general is not obliged to accept all information received from  the police. For this reason there is a division of power into  the executive, judicial and legislative. I think that the  attorney general should have responded and stated whether there  was material for bringing a charge against Mercep or not. We do  not want to protect anybody, but nobody can be blackened by  information at a point when the deed has not yet been proven.  It is also bad to pull this case out of the context of 1991 and  look at it from the perspective of 1993. I do not want to  excuse the committed crimes, the law has to be respected, but  the law has to respected also as far as the spreading of  confidential information is concerned. I shall always support  correct work. We know which institutions could have treated  this case and which we could have contacted if we wanted to do  Croatia good. I think that the person who spread this  information did no good either to the individuals connected with  this case or to the state. I condemn such methods.    [Barisic] How many applications for Croatian citizenship  were refused and why?    [Jarnjak] We received 527,581 applications, and 25,493  applications were rejected, mostly because the formal conditions  were not met. It is important to know that numerous people came  to Croatia as refugees and that many of them asked for Croatian  citizenship. It is clear that the applicants who have not lived  in Croatia for at least five years were refused. A small number  of applicants were refused for other reasons, so that the number  of negative applications is not that big taking into  consideration the total number of applications.    [Barisic] The Serbian People's Party constantly stresses,  however, that the Serbs have problems in obtaining Croatian  citizenship.    [Jarnjak] Whenever the Serbian People's Party asked us for  an explanation in a case, we reconsidered it and responded. I  cannot speak in general about dissatisfaction because there are  examples that some associations submitted lists consisting of  150 people who were allegedly refused Croatian citizenship, and  more than half of them never asked for it. For this reason I  cannot accept general accusations of the type that Serbs, for  example, have problems with it. Also Croats have problems.  Very indicative is the following information. Up to now 2,483  Croats have asked to renounce their Croatian citizenship,  whereas only 82 Serbs have made such an application. There are  rumors that the Serbs do not feel like leaving Croatia, and I  can say that there are no significant reasons why they should  feel like leaving Croatia. This is a sign that the  constitutional state is functioning.    You have to admit that it was not easy to solve all these  cases in one or two years. The Ministry of Internal Affairs  worked in four shifts, day and night, we entered all applicants  into the computer (we have the data stored on diskettes now); we  created a data base for Croatia. Some data still have to be  checked, but we have a data base. At the beginning people had  to wait for a long time for their documents, but we do not have  this problem any more. It is normal that there are people who  cannot obtain Croatian citizenship. There is not such a state  in the world that would give everybody citizenship. In some  states people wait for years. Admittedly, it is a special  situation, but I have to repeat that in most cases only those  applicants were refused who did not fulfill the basic  conditions. These people are entitled to appeal before the  Administrative Court. If this court makes a positive decision,  we carry it out immediately.    [Barisic] What is the national structure of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs employees?    [Jarnjak] There are 93 percent Croats, 4.7 percent Serbs,  1.3 Muslims and 1 percent others.    [Barisic] This structure will probably change if Manolic's  proposal that members of Martic's units enter the Croatian  police is accepted.    [Jarnjak] Croatian citizens of Serbian nationality will join  the Croatian police; not every applicant, only those who meet  the criteria established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  This means that they will have to pass certain tests. We  cannot accept a criminal or a person who has already been  convicted. Apart from that, Croatian policemen are required to  have appropriate education. Not everybody is entitled to be a  Croatian policeman. These criteria will be applied to future  policemen of the Serbian nationality. Nobody can be admitted  without having fulfilled these conditions, otherwise the  professional level of the Croatian police could fall below the  level we need.    [Barisic] The administrative law on the rights of minorities  provides the possibility of autonomous police in Glina and Knin.    [Jarnjak] We are prepared to organize also these police  forces, we have established police departments in these communes  and we have plans on how to organize the work in the police  stations in all the places that should have them: Petrinja,  Glina, Knin, Topusko, Vukovar, Beli Manastir, Okucani.... When  the conditions are met, we shall organize the police's work  there: border control, maintenance of law and order as well as  all the other tasks that the Croatian police has to perform.  According to the administrative law from 1991 the police forces  in these places should be formed according to the national  structure of the population. We shall respect this law.    [Barisic] Which international organizations was the Ministry  of Internal Affairs of Croatia admitted to and what is the  cooperation with these organizations like?    [Jarnjak] We were only interested in Interpol, which we  joined in 1992. Our cooperation with Interpol members is good  and useful. Interpol works according to the principle that the  member states within an area sign bilateral agreements on  cooperation in the prevention of crime in general. We have  signed such an agreement with Slovenia, Italy, Hungary, Ukraine,  and Albania. Apart from that, we have signed a protocol with  Slovakia. Now we have to sign such agreements with other close  countries, such as Austria, Germany and others. The everyday  cooperation with close countries is good, especially in stamping  out organized crime. We have already had several successes in  actions with the police of the neighboring countries.    [Barisic] What is cooperation like with the police of the  Muslim part of Bosnia-Herzegovina? Can you comment on the  rumors that Zagreb is the largest logistics base for the Army of  Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is fiercely attacking the Croatian  enclaves in Central Bosnia?    [Jarnjak] From time to time the Croatian police checks the  work of humanitarian organizations as possible logistics  centers. The people who work there must have legal status in  Croatia, in order to prevent illegal acts or crime that could  affect the sovereignty of the Republic of Croatia. There might  be various rumors, but these are the facts.    [Barisic] What are the priority tasks of the Ministry of  Internal Affairs in the next period?    [Jarnjak] We have the necessary personnel and the technical  equipment now. We shall now have to solve the problem of our  facilities, because our police stations and even department  offices do not have appropriate accommodation. As far as other  priorities are concerned, we shall especially insist on the high  quality of police work. We shall work on the further education  of our staff. Further on, we shall have to improve the  discipline, there must be no incidents whatsoever. In short, we  shall make our police professional; the Croatian policeman must  be a correct and kind professional, loyal to his state and his  people, regardless of his working conditions and the place in  which he works.</p>

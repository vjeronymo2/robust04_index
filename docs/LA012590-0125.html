			<p><P> January 25, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCHOOL OFFICIAL OFFERS PLAN EXTENDING FAST-FOOD SERVICES  </P> <P> It is a teen-ager's culinary dream come true.  </P> <P> A Long Beach school official has come up with a plan that will allow sales of  fast-food items such as pizza and hamburgers to continue on high school  campuses. Fast-food sales also may be allowed occasionally at middle schools,  beginning with the next school year.  </P> <P> Daily fast-food deliveries were started last fall at Lakewood and Millikan high  schools, and students responded enthusiastically. At Jordan, Poly and Wilson  high schools, pizza was delivered most Fridays.  </P> <P> Besides questioning the nutritional value of the fast-food items, educators  pointed out that such sales violated state and local school regulations aimed  at preventing competition with the schools' food service operations.  </P> <P> But the new director of the school district's food services, Frank Towers, has  come up with a plan that at least appears to resolve the legal concerns. The  school food service operations will take charge of purchasing and selling the  fast-food items, thus eliminating potential competition between fast-food sales  and school cafeterias.  </P> <P> There had been some concerns that the district's food service division would  lose money as a result of the fast-food sales, and cafeteria workers had said  they were concerned that fast-food sales might eliminate some of their jobs.  Fast-food items have been sold in student stores, with all profits going to  student activity funds.  </P> <P> State and local regulations limited outside food sales on campus to four days a  year. The limit mainly is to prevent competition with school cafeterias, which  must be self-supporting, said Maria Balakshin, director of the state Department  of Education's division of child nutrition and food distribution services.  </P> <P> The fast-food meals will continue to be sold through the schools' student  stores rather than in the cafeteria, but the food service operation will split  the profits with individual schools.  </P> <P> The new plan still has its critics, and even Towers himself said he is not  completely satisfied.  </P> <P> "It's not a magical answer to everything," Towers said, adding that he would  prefer that students eat the balanced meals prepared by cafeteria workers. But  that is unrealistic, he said, because many teen-agers would rather hop in a car  and leave campus for lunch than walk through a cafeteria line.  </P> <P> "If we don't offer them something (like this), they'll leave campus," Towers  said.  </P> <P> Eventually, Towers said, he would like to eliminate fast foods by having school  cafeteria workers prepare the type of meals that students prefer. Towers said  he wants each school to create a student group to advise him on the types of  foods and services the teen-agers would like.  </P> <P> School board President Jenny Oropeza said this week she is concerned that  fast-food sales will contribute to students' poor eating habits, which later  lead to high cholesterol levels and other problems.  </P> <P> "A McDonald's hamburger, as an example, has so much salt and fat. . . . It's  terrible that we would be contributing to their health problems," Oropeza said.  McDonald's representatives have called their food "extremely nutritious."  </P> <P> Oropeza said that she hopes the district will move swiftly to improve the  cafeterias' food so that students won't be tempted by fast foods.  </P> <P> Officials at Lakewood and Millikan also expressed concern over the decline in  student-activity revenues that will result from Towers' plan. Once the  district's food service branch contracts directly with fast-food outlets, the  district and the schools will split the revenue generated. Until now, the  schools ran the sales and kept the profits for student activities.  </P> <P> "I'm not terribly happy with it. I'd much rather have the full amount go to  school activities," said Bob Schnebeck, activities director at Millikan High  School, which has generated about $25,000 in profits from the food sales since  last September.  </P> <P> James Wickman, activities director at Lakewood High, said: "From what I  understand in meeting with Mr. Towers, we don't have much of a choice (because  of local and state regulations.)  </P> <P> "Fifty percent of something is better than nothing," he added.  </P> <P> While disagreeing on some aspects of the issue, school board members, school  officials and district administrators agree that a primary concern is keeping  students from leaving campus for lunch, thus reducing tardiness and safety  problems.  </P> <P> "I would prefer," Towers said, "to have students stay on campus and buy fast  food then go off campus and buy fast food."  </P> <P> </P> <P> BACKGROUND  </P> <P> In an attempt to keep students on campus during the lunch period, officials at  Millikan and Lakewood high schools last fall began ordering hamburgers, pizza  and other food from fast-food outlets. At Lakewood High, more than 1,000 of the  school's 3,400 students have been buying fast-food items every day. But some  educators expressed concern that the fast-food sales were violating state and  local school regulations.  </P></p>

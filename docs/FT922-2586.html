			<p>920616 FT  16 JUN 92 / Margaret Reid: distinguished journalist - Obituary MARGARET REID, the distinguished financial journalist, has died suddenly at the age of 67. She had an unusual background for such a career. An Oxford graduate, she spent some 10 years in the Treasury, where she became a principal - an experience which helped to shape an intellectual rigour and a discreet approach to her task which were to be among the hallmarks of her time as a journalist. She was fortunate to develop her writing skills under the guidance of Mr Ian Richardson, city editor of the Birmingham Post, someone with great experience of the City and industry. She really came into her own when she joined the Financial Times as a financial reporter in the 1970s, where she was at the forefront of the newspaper's coverage of the secondary banking crisis. This drama played perfectly to her strengths: technical and complex, enacted to a considerable degree behind the closed doors of City banking parlours, requiring judgment and a cool head from those whose job it was to report and to analyse. Senior City figures were prepared to talk to her in the knowledge that she would never betray a confidence. She never speculated or over-dramatised a story: her judgment could always could be relied on at a time when banking structures were in such chronic disrepair that any false alarms could have had serious consequences. She also developed a strong news sense. Colleagues remember the excitement when she was the first to report on the fact that one of the leading finance houses, hitherto regarded as rock-solid, had been forced into the 'lifeboat' organised by the Bank of England. Margaret Reid capitalised on this experience by taking a year as journalist research fellow at Nuffield College, Oxford, where she wrote The Secondary Banking Crisis 1973-75. This remains perhaps the most readable and comprehensive book on the subject. In 1980, she became finance editor of Investors Chronicle. She covered the turmoil leading up to and following Big Bang on the Stock Exchange, and again showed her broad understanding of City affairs in her book on the subject - All-change in the City: The Revolution in Britain's Financial Sector - which was published in 1988. In recent years she worked as a freelance. Her most recent book, Conversion to PLC, describing Abbey National's move from building society to bank, was published last year. In the latter part of her life, she found great personal happiness in her marriage to Mr Howard Whitten.</p>

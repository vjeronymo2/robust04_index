			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Commentary by Jozef Janto: "U.S. Confusion and the </F> Integration of Europe"]    [Text] One of the architects of the Partnership for Peace,  Deputy Secretary of State Talbott, said at a meeting in our  capital on Tuesday [12 April] that Slovakia was not in a  security vacuum. He was reacting to our fears, and those of  Polish representatives, in particular (he had been to Warsaw the  day before), that our countries are in the so-called gray  zone--that is, in a security vacuum between West and East, and  are almost defenseless. At the same time, he pointed to the  project for prospective NATO membership, which has been joined  by 17 East European countries, including former USSR republics.  Russia, it is a well known fact, is considering joining the  Partnership for Peace plan. However, if we set Talbott's  assurances against the most recent statements by U.S.  politicians and NATO representatives, according to which the  Partnership for Peace does not provide direct guarantees for  NATO to come to the aid of countries under threat, we have here,  to put it mildly, a contradiction.    Let us theorize. Despite the nervous statements by Hungarian  chauvinists, the current situation in Central Europe does not  give rise to worries about a possible confrontation. However,  emotions are volatile, and, for two years now, we have seen  merciless combat operations a few hundred kilometers south of  our country. Not everything is without problems in the CIS,  either.    We can put this question in a different and a more specific  way: Does the leading NATO country, the United States, have a  firm foreign policy on Europe? Talbott said in Bratislava that  Europe must integrate in terms of the economy and security and  that the current situation was the most proper for it. Such a  situation arises once in a hundred years (on this occasion, he  appreciated our policy and orientation toward European  integration). We ask this question because the foreign policy  of the United States--on former Yugoslavia, for example, about  which no one doubts that it belongs to Europe and not to the  Islamic world--does not confirm this. U.S. generals said last  week that they would not intervene in Bosnia. This encouraged  the Serbs, but they were attacked by U.S. fighter planes on  Sunday [10 April] and Monday [11 April]. The Muslims, who are  the most active in the combat, are calling for more U.S. planes  and even for ground forces. The Americans have some 15,000  troops in former Yugoslavia (in the UN peacekeeping forces),  which is about 9,000 fewer then the number of "advisers" in  Vietnam in 1965. Confusion in U.S. foreign policy also affects  Moscow's position--not only President Yeltsin's but also that of  the right and the left opposition, which are shouting that the  United States did not consult with Russia on the bombing and  that they reserve for themselves the right to be informed in the  future.    There is no better idea than the unification of Europe. It  must be said, however, that people have wanted for a long time,  but there was always someone to put a monkey wrench in the  works. The Balkans are the biggest monkey wrench now. It is  precisely in the Balkans that the situation should be sorted out  in a peaceful manner. But not to the detriment of the Serbs or  even the Croats.</p>

This strategy will modify existing land use plans. The modification will include a coordinated ecosystem management strategy for National Forest System and BLM public lands. This strategy will be consistent with the ``Framework for Ecosystem Management in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' that is being completed by the Scientific Integration Team of the Eastside Ecosystem Management Project. The EIS that will accompany this strategy will use the information from the ``Scientific Assessment for Ecosystem Management in the Interior Columbia River Basin'' and information received from the public as a basis for issue determination and for evaluating alternative strategies. Additional information may be collected as necessary.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The strategy will be adopted in the form of decisions about desired ranges of future conditions for ecosystems, and related standards and guidelines for management of National Forest System and BLM public lands on all or parts of the UCRB. The EIS will consider alternative strategies for management of National Forest System and BLM-administered lands and their effects in the entire UCRB. At a minimum:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A. The strategy will include direction which will protect and enhance aquatic ecosystems within the range of threatened or endangered anadromous fish through amendments to Forest Plans and Resource Management Plans. This direction will supersede any interim direction resulting from the Environmental Assessment for the Implementation of Interim Strategies for Managing Anadromous Fish-producing Watersheds in Eastern Oregon and Washington, Idaho, and Portions of California (commonly referred to as ``PACFISH'').  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> B. The strategy also will include other necessary guidance applicable to the Basin as a whole, or to broad subregions within the basin. This guidance will address forest ecosystem health; rangeland ecosystem health; aquatic and riparian ecosystem health; integration of social and economic considerations; population viability; and the long-term sustainability of threatened, endangered, and sensitive species. The guidance also will be developed by examining other issues identified by the public through the scoping process. This guidance will be adopted as amendments to the Forest Service Regional Guides for Regions 1 and 4 and/or amendments to Forest Service and BLM land use plans.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> C. The third part of the strategy may identify changes to the ways current plans are implemented or budgets developed, that can improve capability to achieve ecosystem management objectives. The strategy may also help establish priorities for revising forest plans and developing or amending resource management plans. This part of the strategy does not require environmental analysis, but may be addressed within the scope of this EIS.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> DATES: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 -->  Comments concerning the scope of the analysis should be received in writing by 30 days following the date of the last scoping meeting to receive full consideration in the development of alternatives.

The strategy will focus on ecosystem health, including its forest, rangeland, and aquatic/riparian, landscape, and social/economic components, with emphasis on population viability and the sustainability of threatened, endangered, and sensitive species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

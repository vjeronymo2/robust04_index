			<p>920817 FT  17 AUG 92 / Middleton set to be Lloyd's chief executive MR PETER MIDDLETON, chief executive of Thomas Cook, the travel subsidiary recently sold by Midland Bank, is expected to be appointed as the new chief executive of Lloyd's of London, the insurance market, in the next few weeks. He was chosen as the preferred candidate for the vacant post at a recent meeting of the senior appointments committee of Lloyd's Council members from a shortlist compiled by GKR &amp; Associates, a London-based firm of executive head-hunters. Mr Middleton will be formally introduced at the next full council meeting in early September. Traditionally this has been a formality, as the full council has no authority over selection for the post. The new chief executive will work closely with both the chairman and the head of regulation at Lloyd's. Mr David Coleridge, the previous chairman, nominated Mr David Rowland, the head of Sedgwick, the insurance company, as his successor at the annual general meeting last month. The role of the chief executive is being fundamentally restructured to focus on 'business development' in line with recommendations from both the Lloyd's task force report issued in January and in the report chaired by Sir Jeremy Morse released at the start of July. Mr Middleton became chief executive of Thomas Cook Group in December 1987, and helped negotiate the sale of the group for Pounds 200m from Midland to LTU, Germany's third-largest package tour operator. Much of his past career was spent at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Mr Middleton is believed to have been chosen over two internal finalists for the position, Mr Robert Hewes, head of regulatory services, and Mr Andrew Duguid, head of market services. His salary is not known, although his predecessor received about Pounds 200,000 a year. Mr Middleton earned more than Pounds 140,000 as chief executive of Thomas Cook for the financial year ending in 1990. A note on the skills required for the job by Mr Alan Lord, the previous chief executive who retired in June, is believed to have stressed the importance of attendance at committees and preparing papers, which he believed made a civil servant the preferred choice. Senior Lloyd's insiders had been concerned at the speed with which a new chief executive was being chosen, so soon after recommendations for changing the position's function. But several said yesterday that they were satisfied with the choice of Mr Middleton because of his diverse background, including considerable business experience. Thomas Cook said yesterday that Mr Middleton was halfway through a three-week holiday in Italy arranged through the company, and could not be contacted. 'It is not for any of us to comment on personal matters,' a spokeswoman said.</p>

			<p><P> April 19, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> RAPPERS GO TO THE SOURCE FOR ANTI-GANG VIDEO;  </P> <P> POP: THEY TAPE 'ALL IN THE SAME GANG' AND HOLD A NO-MORE-WARS SUMMIT AT THE  NICKERSON GARDENS HOUSING PROJECT. SOME ONLOOKERS DOUBT THE EFFORT WILL DO ANY  GOOD.  </P> <P> Nickerson Gardens, the poverty-plagued Watts housing project, is the classic  breeding ground for rap music. But when some of the top West Coast rappers held  a summit meeting there Tuesday to shoot an anti-gang rap video, they seemed  strangely out of place.  </P> <P> It wasn't the way most of them dressed -- the black T-shirts, caps and jackets  sported by the likes of Eazy-E and Tone Loc looked right at home. It was more  the spectacle of the lights, cameras and (limited) action taking place amid the  blue buildings of the compound.  </P> <P> A certain amount of life as usual went on. People came and went and took care  of their daily business. Laundry swayed in the breeze from lines strung between  the buildings, even while the mass of rappers themselves swayed to a funky beat  while lip-syncing "All in the Same Gang," a new song calling for an end to gang  wars.  </P> <P> The venture was put together by Mike Concepcion, who calls himself a co-founder  of the Crips gang. He has left gang violence behind in favor of starting a  record company called Grand Jury Records.  </P> <P> The song and video scheduled to be released through Warner Bros. Records on May  15 are the company's first recordings. The song will also be the centerpiece of  an album that will feature new rap artists, scheduled for June 12 release.  Proceeds will benefit Project Build, an employment counseling, assessment and  referral service for six Watts housing projects.  </P> <P> "I'm never out (of the gang) -- it's always in my heart," said Concepcion, a  paraplegic as a result of a bullet fired in a street gambling dispute. "But I'm  tired of all these guys killing each other."  </P> <P> Through the taping, a security force of mostly white off-duty police officers  surveyed the scene, assisted by community members decked out in Amnesty  International "Human Rights Now" T-shirts.  </P> <P> The onlookers -- kids and adults alike -- seemed more interested in the  performers than their message, though. Each star arrival brought screams from  the onlookers, who took every opportunity for photo and autograph hounding.  </P> <P> And while in front of the cameras the rappers shook their bodies, the Nickerson  residents stood behind the yellow police tape security line shaking their heads  about the potential effect of the video on the community.  </P> <P> "When they all leave it's gonna be same old same old," said Imogene Cosey, 26,  a former Nickerson resident who had come to watch after hearing about the  taping on rap radio station KDAY-AM.  </P> <P> One 15-year-old boy who claimed gang affiliation said it would have no impact  on him.  </P> <P> "You die one day anyway," he said, acknowledging the risks of gang violence.  </P> <P> "Too much money in dope," said Sylvin Flores, 18, standing next to the gang  member. "You have to understand why they create the violence so you can create  your own peace."  </P> <P> Even some of the performers expressed doubts about the reach of the video.  Eazy-E, whose hits as a solo act and as a member of the controversial group  N.W.A have depicted gang activity in a way some believe glorifies the violence,  had in the past said he would never take part in any such "message" project.  </P> <P> During a lunch break he admitted that his tune had changed a little.  </P> <P> "It can help," he said. "Some are gonna listen to it, some gonna be hard-headed  and not listen. There are other ways to make money other than (gangs) and dope.  You could be a producer like me. You just gotta give them a chance."  </P> <P> But Eazy stressed his lyrical contribution to "Same Gang," in which he raps  "Eazy's no sell-out" and "I'm not tryin' to tell ya what to do / You have your  own freedom of choice who to listen to," and concludes by refering to himself  as "the violent hero."  </P> <P> "It's up to people what they do," he said, shrugging.  </P> <P> Most of the performers admitted that they had little hope for saving any  current gang members. The video, they said, is for the next generation.  </P> <P> "It's not going to stop anything right away," said Loc, whose "Wild Thing" is  one of the biggest-selling rap singles ever. "The older ones are too set in  their ways. No one can tell them what to do. No one can tell me what to do.  </P> <P> "But it may stop some of the 8-, 9-, 10-year-olds. If we can start from this  and build and move on, go into the community and do something, we can let those  kids know there's hope and more to life than getting high and kickin' with the  homeboys."  </P> <P> To Concepcion, the very act of making the video showed hope. "The fact that we  could bring N.W.A and Tone Loc to do a video here and to have me, a Crip, come  to this (rival gang) Blood neighborhood to do this is a sign," he said.  </P> <P> According to some members of the production crew, arranging for the video shoot  did present some problems. One person, who asked not to be named, said that  some of the performers who had had gang affiliation in the past expressed  concerns about coming to the site for fear of rival gang presence.  </P> <P> As it was, there seemed little to worry about, with the high security presence.  </P> <P> "But the police are leaving at sundown," said the production crew member. "So  we're leaving at sundown."  </P> <P> And after sundown, the gang problem would again be in the hands of the people  who live in the middle of it. And that suits Nickerson resident Sharon Robbins  fine. The 21-year-old mother of three young children said that she, not rap  stars, bears the responsibility for eventually keeping her youngsters out of  gangs.  </P> <P> "I know they're not gonna get in gangs," she said. " I got a good leather belt.  I'll whip their (behinds)."  </P></p>

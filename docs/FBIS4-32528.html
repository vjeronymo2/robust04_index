			<p>BFN     [Text] One civilian was killed and three injured in last  night's Serb artillery attack on Usora [Croatian enclave in  northern Bosnia]. Doctors in Tesanj war hospital are fighting  to save the lives of the wounded. There is fresh damage to  residential buildings. Serbs are heavily shelling locations  adjacent to the front line. From their strongholds in Putnikovo  Brdo, Zeravica, and Stanovi, Serbs were shelling defense lines  and the free Usora territory with mortars, tanks, and long-range  shells until late last night. They also attempted an infantry  breakthrough but Usora defenders prevented it. Fresh explosions  were heard in the free Usora territory again this morning.</p>

Cuba  has shown an interest in purchasing paper pulp, paper for  manufacturing bags, and cartons manufactured by the Papel  Misionero Enterprise, and mate leaf [ilex paraguayensis]; the  island also might be interested in wooden prefabricated houses,  several varieties of lumber, and soybean flour and oil.    Misiones, in turn, might send to that country people who  need  a very highly developed medical system, and Cuban professionals  would advise the province's doctors.    The aspects of the agreement are being studied by Cuban  officials and a Misiones Province delegation headed by  provincial Health Minister Victor Hugo Martinez.    During his stay in Cuba, which will last one week, Puerta  plans to meet President Fidel Castro.</p>

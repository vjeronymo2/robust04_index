He yesterday submitted  to Gonzaga Motta, PMDB [Brazilian Democratic Movement Party]  deputy for Ceara and coordinator of the special committee in the  Chamber of Deputies that is analyzing the minister's second  economic plan, a new proposal blocking 7.5 percent of the fund  tranfers to state governments, and leaving municipal funds  untouched. The original proposal was to retain 15 percent of  funds for state and municipal governments. The blocked funds  will be used for the creation of the Emergency Social Fund.    After meeting with Cardoso and special Finance Ministry  advisor Edmar Bacha, Motta said that "it was unfair to affect  municipal governments, because 80 percent of them survive on  fund transfers." By blocking 15 percent of transfers the  government expected to collect approximately $2.7 billion, $1.4  million from municipal funds and $1.3 billion from state funds.    With the new proposal, collected funds will drop to $650  million. Gonzaga Motta said that the difference will be  compensated for with an increase on the taxable percentages of  the tax on manufactured products, the IPI, which will affect  exports, and through the withholding -- by the Union -- of the  income tax of federal public employees. This will put the  federal public servants' income tax outside the cake that is  shared with states and municipal districts.    "I believe the PMDB will like the changes in the economic  program," Motta said.    Last Friday, a fiscal adjustment subcommittee chaired by  Luiz  Roberto Ponte, PMDB deputy for Rio Grande do Sul, approved a  proposal by which fund transfers to state and municipal  governments will be 5-percent higher, in real terms, than in  1994.    The modification announced yesterday by Minister Cardoso  shows that the government has reviewed its figures and has  preferred states to be partners of the fiscal adjustment instead  of mere creditors. The modification, however, involves a source  for political complication, as it maintains the block on fund  transfers to state governments. This could be another proposal  for negotiation.</p>

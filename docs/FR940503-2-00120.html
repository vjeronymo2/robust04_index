Introduction <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On December 14, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') <FOOTCITE>1</FOOTCITE>  and Rule 19b&hyph;4 thereunder, <FOOTCITE>2</FOOTCITE>  a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of index options on the CBOE Global Telecommunications Index (``Global Telecommunications Index'' or ``Index'').

See Letter from Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, Research Department, CBOE, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated March 16, 1994 (``Amendment No. 1''). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> II. Description of Proposal <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. General <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The CBOE proposes to list and trade options on the CBOE Global Telecommunications Index, a new securities index developed by the CBOE and based on stocks and ADRs <FOOTCITE>5</FOOTCITE>  of international telecommunications companies that are traded on the American Stock Exchange (``Amex''), the New York Stock Exchange (``NYSE''), or are national market securities traded through the facilities of the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system (``NASDAQ''). The CBOE also proposes to list either long-term options on the full-value Index or long-term options on a reduced-value Index that will be computed at one-tenth of the value of the Global Telecommunications Index (``Global Telecommunications LEAPS'' or ``Index LEAPS''). <FOOTCITE>6</FOOTCITE>  Global Telecommunications LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular Global Telecommunications Index options traded on the Exchange, <FOOTCITE>7</FOOTCITE>  however, as discussed below, position and exercise limits of Index LEAPS and regular Index options will be aggregated. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 5 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> An ADR is a negotiable receipt which is issued by a depositary, generally a bank, representing shares of a foreign issuer that have been deposited and are held, on behalf of holders of the ADRs, at a custodian bank in the foreign issuer's home country. The securities underlying the ADRs included in the Index are securities issued by corporations formed under the laws of Chile, France, Hong Kong, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Spain, and the United Kingdom. See discussion of standards for ADR components,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=3 --> infra <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  notes 9 and 29. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 6 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> LEAPS is an acronym for Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities. LEAPS are long-term index option series that expire from twelve to thirty-six months from their date of issuance. See CBOE Rule 24.9(b)(1). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 7 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> According to the CBOE, the Global Telecommunications Index represents a segment of the U.S. equity market that is not currently represented in the derivative markets and, as such, the CBOE concludes, should offer investors a low-cost means of achieving diversification of their portfolios toward or away from the global telecommunications industry. The CBOE believes the Index will provide retail and institutional investors with a means of benefitting from their forecasts of that industry's market performance. Options on the Index also can be utilized by portfolio managers and investors to provide a performance measure and evaluation guide for passively or actively managed global telecommunications industry funds, as well as a means of hedging the risks of investing in the global telecommunications industry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Composition of the Index <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Index is based on securities representing twenty U.S. and foreign companies that the Exchange believes are representative of the global telecommunications industry, all of which trade domestically as either stocks or ADRs. Fourteen of these securities currently trade on the NYSE, one trades on the Amex, and five trade through NASDQ. The Index is price-weighted and will be calculated on a real-time basis using last sale prices. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As of the close of trading on February 11, 1994, the Index was valued at 149.63. <FOOTCITE>8</FOOTCITE>  As of November 30, 1993, the market capitalizations of the individual securities in the Index ranged from a high of $73.61 billion (AT&amp;T) to a low of $144.21 million (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.), with the mean and median being $14.79 billion and $8.14 billion, respectively. The market capitalization of all the securities in the Index was $295.74 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks and ADRs in the Index ranged from a high of 1.35 billion shares (AT&amp;T) to a low of 12.27 million shares (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.). The average price per share of the securities in the Index, for the six-month period between June 1 and November 30, 1993, ranged from a high of $78.19 (Compania De Telefonos De Chile) to a low of $12.79 (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.). In addition, the average daily trading volume of the stocks and ADRs in the Index, for the same six-month period, ranged from a high of 1.89 million shares per day (AT&amp;T) to a low of 51,675 shares per day (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.), with the mean and median being 425,652 and 252,187 shares, respectively. Lastly, no one stock or ADR accounted for more than 9.08% of the Index's total value (Compania De Telefonos De Chile) and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 37.07% of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted component was 1.27% of the Index (Atlantic Tele-Network, Inc.) and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues in the Index accounted for 11.66% of the Index's value. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 8 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> See Letter from Eileen Smith, Director, Product Development, Research Department, CBO, to Brad Ritter, Attorney, Office of Derivatives and Equity Regulation, Division of Market Regulation, SEC, dated February 14, 1994 (::February 14 Letter''). <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

This revision retains part 536 as The Army Claims System. Part 537 is removed and held in reserve for future use. This part prescribes the policies, procedures, and responsibilities for investigating, processing, and settling claims against and in favor of the United States under the authority conferred by certain statutes, regulations, international and interdepartmental agreements, and Department of Defense directives. It is intended to ensure that claims are properly investigated, adjudicated objectively and fairly, and either paid or collection action initiated. Because of the complexity and length of changes and consolidation of parts 536 and 537, a breakout of the scope or responsibilities of each subpart to this whole part is listed in the Supplementary Information part of this submission. By reviewing the supplementary information portion, reading of the complete part becomes necessary in order to understand the entire part. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </SUMMARY> <DATE> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> EFFECTIVE DATE:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> December 12, 1994. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </DATE> <ADDRESS> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> ADDRESSES:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> Director, U.S. Army Claims Service, Building 4411, Llewellyn Ave., Fort Meade, Maryland 20755&hyph;5360. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </ADDRESS> <FURTHER> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=1 --> LTC Cashiola, (301) 677&hyph;7622 or 7960. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FURTHER> <SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG ITAG l=10 g=1 f=2 --> SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=2 --> (Subpart A).

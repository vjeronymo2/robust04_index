			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / UK Company News: Lionheart buys Devon woodworking business LIONHEART, the Knutsford-based home improvements, DIY, paint brushes, house wares and retail systems group, has bought The Carpenter's Workshop, a woodworking business in Barnstaple, Devon, from the receiver. It wants the extra capacity to make a range of home and bathroom products that look and feel like rain-forest hardwoods - and weigh as much - but are made from polystyrene waste, notably discarded beakers from McDonald's, the hamburger chain. Lionheart hopes to have them on sale in retail DIY sheds in the autumn, when their environmental friendliness will be a principal selling point. Unlike some wood substitutes, the new material can be extruded through dies into complicated profiles. Compressing the waste during processing increases its density and weight. Mr Paul Lever, executive chairman of Lionheart, said yesterday the development would cost about Pounds 300,000. He added: 'Last year was awful. Not only did sales volume fall throughout our industry, but we were squeezed by the price war between the DIY sheds. Manufacturers and suppliers were caught in the middle.' Lionheart was urged to rescue The Carpenter's Workshop by Homebase and Marks and Spencer, two of the protagonists in the retail war. The price is believed to have been about Pounds 250,000. Mr Lever also revealed that Newell, the US company which is the biggest paint brush maker in the world, has increased its holding in Lionheart from 13 to 20 per cent. The next largest shareholder is Equitable Life, with nearly 7 per cent; about a fifth of the shares are in private hands.</p>

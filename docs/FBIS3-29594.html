The strong growth was attributed mainly to the  manufacturing and construction sectors with each sector  registering a double-digit growth of 12.5 percent. The Central  Bank, in its third quarter economic review, said that activities  in the services sector were equally buoyant maintaining a growth  of 9.6 percent, while the agriculture sector slowed down to 2  percent and the mining sector remained negative 0.8 percent.  The continued buoyancy of the manufacturing sector reflected  favorably growths of the export-oriented as well as domestic  market-oriented industries. All the export-oriented industries  recorded strong growths, especially the textile and wearing  apparel industry, electronics and electrical product industries,  and wood products.</p>

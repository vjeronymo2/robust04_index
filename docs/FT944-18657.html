			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / Leftwingers step up attack on 'modernising tendency' Leftwing activists including MPs Mr Tony Benn and Mr Dennis Skinner repeatedly attacked Mr Tony Blair and his 'modernising tendency' at a pre-conference rally yesterday staged by the Campaign for Labour Party Democracy. Mr Benn insisted: 'Don't believe that selling out wins votes.' They enthusiastically endorsed demands for higher taxes on the rich, the introduction of a minimum wage, the renationalisation of privatised industries and the repeal of all Tory anti-union laws. Reality briefly intruded when Mr Skinner, MP for Bolsover, gave an account of the meeting held by the national executive to decide its approach to the policy issues to be debated by the conference. His disclosure that an attempt to restore a bigger role to the unions in the formulation of policy had been defeated by 25 votes to two underlined the decline in the left's influence on the party leadership. The two votes against came from Mr Skinner and Mr Benn, the former cabinet minister and MP for Chesterfield. Both made what is expected to be a brief return to the national executive on the strength of votes cast at last year's conference to fill the vacancies created by the election of Mr Blair as leader and Mr John Prescott as his deputy. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former party leader, later dismissed the activities of the 'temporary replacements' as nothing more than echoes from the past. The decisions reached by the national executive were seized on by Mr Skinner as further justification for a show of strength by constituency delegates at the conference. He said: 'Don't get worried about the leadership - remember that we represent class interests.' Mr Skinner called for a commitment to a minimum wage of 'at least Pounds 4 per hour'. He added: 'If they ask where the money is coming from let us tell them 'the richest 10 per cent'.' Mr Benn deplored the shift in power away from the membership of the party and the annual conference to the parliamentary Labour party 'to the exclusion of people outside the House of Commons'. He said the party had never achieved an election victory under a 'moderniser'. These included Hugh Gaitskell, Lord Callaghan, Mr Kinnock and Mr Michael Foot, who had been a 'sort of moderniser'. Mrs Alice Mahon, MP for Halifax, said the national executive had become a 'mirror image of the shadow cabinet'. She said the executive could not be trusted to honour the socialist commitment to clause four of the party's constitution which advocates common ownership of the means of production, distribution and exchange. In a speech to the Labour economic strategies group, Mr Peter Shore, the former cabinet minister and ex-shadow chancellor, warned that an effective incomes policy, whether voluntary or statutory, would be needed to return to anything approaching full employment. He complained that the Labour leadership had 'virtually nothing to say' about the successful demand management which would be required to bring Britain's idle plant and idle hands into fuller use.</p>

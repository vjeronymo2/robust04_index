			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John McBeth in Jakarta] </F>   [Text] Benny Murdani is not just another general. The  former defence minister and armed forces chief holds no official  position, but is known to wield considerable clout in the  ambiguous world of Indonesian power politics. No wonder when  reports surfaced that the government would restructure and  downsize the Strategic Intelligence Body or Badan Inteligen  Strategis (Bais), it was seen as a move to deflate his  influence. Bais, Murdani's former power base, serves as the  military's eyes and ears on domestic and international affairs.    The intelligence agency, which grew out of the smaller  Strategic Intelligence Centre in 1983, is also having its  headquarters moved from Tebet in southeast Jakarta to a new  building at Pasar Minggu in the southern suburbs. This will  deprive Murdani of the office he is said to maintain at Bais.  However, it is unlikely to diminish the influence of a man  whose allies have been in the intelligence service for 20 years  or more. Armed forces spokesman Brig.-Gen. Syarwan Hamid will  only say a reorganisation is under way. But there are  suggestions that the number of sections in Bais will be reduced  and that its name will be changed to Badan Intelijen ABRI  [Indonesian Armed Forces] (BIA) or Intelligence Agency of the  Armed Forces. "Some of its functions are being dropped and I  think its powers are being dispersed," an intelligence source  told the REVIEW. It is understood that Bais might no longer  come under the direct command of armed forces chief Gen. Feisal  Tanjung, who serves as the organisation's nominal head and the  president's personal representative within it. Instead, it may  be placed under the supervision of the chief of general staff,  Lieut. Gen. H. B. L. Mantiri, and the assistant chief of staff  for intelligence, Maj.-Gen. Bantu Harjito.    According to some versions, the restructuring could lead to  some Bais functions passing to the Badan Koordinasi Intelijen  Nasional (Bakin), or the National Intelligence Coordinating  Agency. Not everyone is convinced the revamp will be all that  far-reaching. "Murdani created Bais to give direct advice to the  president," said one Indonesian analyst with ties to the  military. "The palace guard is under Bais and if control of the  agency goes to armed forces headquarters, then it means the  whole of the guard will be under that headquarters. I don't  know if the president would like such an arrangement."    On top of that is the question of who will provide  Indonesia's intelligence overview. In theory, there is  considerable overlap between Bais and Bakin, but in practice  Bais is clearly the preeminent agency. Staffed purely by  military personnel, it is better trained and has better  resources than its more civilianised counterpart. Bakin is  regarded as a sleepy sinecure with a somewhat elastic staff.  Its mission, according to current chief Sudibyo, is to  "strengthen national resilience."    In describing the role of Bais, Australian academic Richard  Tanter says the term "strategic" refers to the broad interests  of the state, "rather than the narrow definition of military  affairs or international geopolitics." This, in turn, is taken  to mean domestic political intelligence, and perhaps operations  against such targets as East Timorese refugees in Australia and  Portugal.    Up to now, Bais has worked closely with the armed forces'  social and political affairs directorate and also the  politically significant Home Affairs Ministry and  attorney-general's office. Senior officers of the Kopassus  [Special Forces Command] special forces regiment are routinely  rotated through the agency. Kopassus commander Brig.-Gen. Agum  Gumelar and Jakarta military commander Maj.-Gen. Hendro Priyono  have both served as Bais deputies.    Rumours of the change in Bais have been circulating since  July 1993, not long after President Suharto dropped Murdani from  his cabinet in a move seen to reflect his displeasure at the  minister's political manoeuvrings. It was the same month  retired Lieut.-Gen. Sayidiman Suryohadiprojo became the first  senior officer to openly criticise Murdani and what he called  the "excessive role" of military intelligence during the 1980s.    Suryohadiprojo, a staff officer for most of his career, is  now one of four roving ambassadors charged with assisting  Suharto in his capacity as chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement.  He also acts as an adviser to influential Research and  Technology Minister B. J. Habibie. Murdani is known to be at  odds with Habibie, who has also accumulated enemies among  serving military officers for his interference in arms purchases.    When Murdani became armed forces chief in 1983, he retained  concurrent control over Bais and took direct charge of the  Command for Restoration of Security and Order (Kopkamtib), the  powerful security apparatus formed in the wake of the abortive  1965 communist coup. Over the next five years he built a  formidable power centre that was second to none in the military  and on which Suharto depended for his counsel.    Observers noted that when Murdani finally stepped down as  armed forces chief in early 1988 to take over the defence  portfolio, the Bais leadership passed into the hands of his  long-serving deputy, Maj.-Gen. Mohammad Sutarjo, instead of  Murdani's successor, Gen. Try Sutrisno, the current  vice-president. One of the first overt moves to clip Murdani's  wings came in September 1988, when Suharto dismantled Kopkamtib  and effectively ended the defence minister's control over the  security apparatus. Although the process, known as  "deBennyisasi," seemed to accelerate with Murdani's departure  from the cabinet, Indonesian observers still see his status as  enigmatic. "On the one hand, the president wants to reduce his  power, but on the other he realises Benny can be very  supportive," said one source.    Last March, the outgoing defence minister caused a major  stir  by throwing a reception for 1,500 guests to mark the launching  of a book on his often shadowy career. Six months later, three  heads of state and a galaxy of political figures from Indonesia  and the region showed up at the wedding reception for his only  daughter.    Since then, Murdani has kept a low profile. But that has not  prevented rumours about his perceived behind-the-scenes role in  Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhaq Rabin's surprise visit last  October and, more recently, in the intrigue attending Megawati  Sukarnoputri's election as chairman of the Indonesian Democratic  Party. Typically, however, there is not a shred of evidence  connecting him to any of it.</p>

			<p>930701 FT  01 JUL 93 / World Trade News: Nafta delay latest blow to Clinton trade policy - The entire US effort to bring free trade to the Americas has been thrown into question THE ORDER by a US federal court judge yesterday to delay the North American Free Trade Agreement for an environmental impact assessment was the latest blow to a carefully constructed Clinton trade policy, which now seems in danger of crumbling. The US scenario for the economic summit next week in Tokyo had President Bill Clinton appearing with a budget reduction package in hand, along with Senate and House approval for a renewed fast-track negotiating authority, giving the Uruguay Round of global trade negotiations a last lease of life until December 15. The president and Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, Japanese prime minister, had also agreed to produce by next week a negotiating framework to set up the perimeters of the US-Japanese bilateral trade relationship. The Japanese political crisis dealt the first setback. Then, last week in Tokyo, a ministerial meeting - to prepare for a tariff reduction deal by the US, EC, Canada and Japan - stalled. Talks on a bilateral framework got nowhere. Into the increasingly gloomy picture, on Tuesday, came statements by Mr Edouard Balladur, French prime minister, who provocatively tied a global trade deal to the US lifting anti-dumping duties on steel. These brought an outraged reaction from Mr Peter Watson, chairman of the US International Trade Commission, who demanded an apology. 'The US administrative and quasi-judicial regime affords a significantly higher degree of due process to foreign respondents than provided by France through the related EC process,' he said. The delay of Nafta for an environmental impact statement throws into question the US administration's entire effort to bring free trade to the Americas. And according to one prominent Washington trade lawyer, the court ruling may also apply to a Uruguay Round agreement: 'You can't possibly do an environmental impact assessment on the whole world economy.' Even an expedited appeal would take at least two months. The administration could ignore the judge's order and risk being sued for contempt, but it is still trying to prove its green credentials. Mr Clinton's choice of a novice in trade - Mr Mickey Kantor - as his trade representative has caused concern among US trading partners (particularly when Mr Kantor trips on EC sensibilities as he did by doing a separate telecoms deal with Germany). Still hoping for progress in Tokyo, Mr Kantor yesterday delayed sanctions against Japan for its closed procurement market in construction. Next week he will have to prove his mettle, not just against other more experienced negotiators, but also against the whims of leaders who for six years have not demonstrated the political courage to agree on trade liberalisation.</p>

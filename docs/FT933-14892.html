			<p>930712 FT  12 JUL 93 / Danger of the simple route: The Royal Commission on Criminal Justice Fraud is a crime which leaves chaos in its wake. In many cases, investors suffer substantial loss. Often savings built up over a lifetime's work disappear. Those charged with responsibility for investigating and prosecuting serious fraud will find much to welcome in the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice. The commission has carefully addressed the issues and given a firm pointer for the future. Although lessons from a small number of high-profile cases were learnt long ago, the Serious Fraud Office continues to be criticised for the way in which those cases were handled. It is the SFO's policy to narrow the investigation, as far as possible, and then to charge only the principal participants in the fraud with a reasonable number of offences. However, there is a point beyond which it is dangerous to simplify. We must not sacrifice thoroughness for brevity and run the risk of prosecutions collapsing at a later stage. The SFO has always worked to a target of one year for an investigation and one year for the prosecution. Now the Royal Commission has proposed that targets should be set for the amount of time to be taken up by each stage of the trial. It has also proposed that written skeleton arguments be submitted in advance and that time limits be imposed on oral argument. These would be valuable new disciplines. An extended debate has taken place while the Commission has been sitting. Many of the ideas canvassed have found a place in its report. For instance, much has been said on whether certain City offences should be dealt with in the criminal courts or by the regulatory bodies. While the criminal justice system cannot abdicate responsibility for prosecuting serious fraudulent conduct, there may well be cases where regulatory action would be more appropriate. The SFO continually keeps possible reference to a regulator under review in the course of its investigations and prosecutions. The commission has endorsed this approach, provided regulatory action is capable of ensuring that a person found guilty by the appropriate regulatory tribunal can be banned from the market and ordered to compensate the victims. The SFO is currently in discussion with the regulators about mechanisms which might lead to more cases being handled by the regulators - with its agreement. The SFO supports the commission's desire to see a system which would mean that a decision on whether or not to prosecute, and the choice of charge, could take into account a defendant's readiness to accept a regulatory penalty of sufficient severity to justify dropping the prosecution or reducing the charge. It would require the defendant's agreement to the regulatory penalty, and, if prosecuted on a lesser charge, to pleading guilty to that charge. Under Section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1987, the director of the SFO can compel a person to answer questions or produce documents on pain of prosecution and up to six months' imprisonment if he refuses to answer. It must be remembered that fraud is uniquely a document-based crime. Without a means of getting at the underlying material, it would be impossible to find out what happened. Section 2 is mainly used for that purpose. Banks and professional firms are usually happy to co-operate when they receive a notice under the Section. It is also used to interview suspects, but the safeguard is that the power is only investigatory. A transcript of an interview under the Section cannot be admitted in evidence unless the witness changes his story. Also the legal professional privilege applies. The commission has concluded that it is necessary and right that investigators in serious fraud cases should retain the section 2 power. That is welcome news to those who face the task of unravelling these immensely complex cases. Contrary to the belief of some of the SFO's critics, the commission found that this power had worked in the interests of justice. Moreover, it considered the section had not been unfair to those questioned, who were likely to be persons in responsible positions with ready access to legal advice charged with sophisticated offences which might otherwise go not merely unpunished but undetected. The commission would also like to see section 2 being used to help investigations conducted in the UK on behalf of foreign investigating authorities and, significantly, in support of many investigations at present undertaken with guidance from the fraud investigation group of the Crown Prosecution Service. A feasibility study is recommended into the possibility of merging the two fraud authorities. The commission has, however, gone further. It considers that section 2 should, on the authority of the director, be extended to the police. That is not, in fact, something for which the SFO has pressed, but it clearly deserves careful consideration. Some change is also recommended to the culture of the criminal justice system. Currently, the prosecution lays bare its store of knowledge and evidence to the defence at an early stage, while the defence can keep its case up its sleeve until the trial. The system dates back to the days when defendants were inarticulate, uneducated and lacked the resources to defend themselves. It is, however, quite inappropriate to serious fraud trials. Hence, the recommendation for more advanced disclosure from the defence in such cases will reduce the number of issues for the jury and vastly improve the management of cases.

			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / International Company News: Chemical compound that spells trouble - Japan's petrochemical groups face falling demand and rising costs When Japan's petrochemicals companies close their books for the 1993 financial year tomorrow they will make sorry reading. The country's 12 largest makers of ethylene, the basic building block for plastics, are expected to post combined losses of Y51.6bn (Dollars 493m) for the year to the end of March. Like much of Japanese heavy industry, the sector, one of Japan's most important manufacturing industries with sales of more than Y6,000bn, is being plagued by poor domestic demand and high costs, as well as wilting exports caused by the high yen and increasing Asian competition. The question is whether Japanese petrochemicals manufacturers' problems have been caused merely by the longest and deepest recession since the second world war, or whether a secular change is occurring which threatens their long-term viability. In the short term, the industry's problems are severe enough. The sector is haemorrhaging red ink. 'Almost every Japanese plastics manufacturer is losing money at the moment,' says Mr Yukio Murakami, director of Chem Systems Japan, the specialist consultants. The reason for the plunge in profitability is simple, explains Mr Hiromasa Yonekura, director of basic chemicals at Sumitomo Chemical, one of Japan's largest plastics makers. 'Demand is falling at the same time that supply is increasing.' Demand for various grades of plastic was down between 5 per cent and 10 per cent last year and is expected to fall 7 per cent this year, according to Mr Yonekura. The sector's largest customers - the automotive, electronics and construction industries - are all suffering from the recession. The drop in demand would be bad enough on its own, but the industry compounded its misery by increasing capacity. 'During the late 1980s we were making record profits for about five years. Everybody expected that to continue. All the companies made the same mistake of adding capacity simultaneously,' says Mr Yonekura. As a result, ethylene capacity increased from 4.7m tonnes a year in 1987 to 7m tonnes this year, when demand is expected to be only 5.8m tonnes. The industry is still inflicting additional wounds, adding yet more capacity this year. Mitsubishi is commissioning a new plant, adding 300,000 tonnes a year. A massive 700,000 tonnes a year complex, built by Maruzen, Mitsui Petrochemical and Sumitomo Chemical, has just been completed and is scheduled to come on stream later this year. Not surprisingly, given the imbalance between supply and demand, plastics prices have tumbled. The price of styrene monomer, used to make polystyrene, has fallen from a peak in 1992 of Y120 per kg to only Y60. Mitsubishi Petrochemical says Japanese domestic prices are so low that the company is incapable of making money at the moment. Although domestic demand is dire, Japanese petrochemicals companies have been unable to export their way out of trouble. The groups are handicapped by high costs compared with international competitors. In any case, international prices are so low that Japanese manufacturers are exporting below fixed costs at the moment, says Mr Murakami. The appreciation of the yen has exacerbated the Japanese companies' problems. One bright spot is that the rise in the yen has not been followed by an increase in imports. Most Japanese petrochemicals manufacturers acknowledge the existance of a secular shift in demand from the domestic market to the rest of Asia. 'Our customers, such as the Japanese automotive and electronics companies, are migrating to low-cost manufacturing sites overseas. We will have to follow,' says Mr Yonekura. Chem Systems estimates plastics demand in east Asia, excluding Japan, will increase by 7.8 per cent a year until the end of the decade. The migration has already begun. Sumitomo has set up a joint venture in Singapore with Shell to manufacture polypropylene and low-density polyethylene. Mitsubishi Petrochemical is building a styrene monomer plant at the same site. Idemitsu has a joint venture with BP Chemicals and Petronas of Malaysia to manufacture polyethylene in Malaysia, and Showa Denko and Marubeni have combined to set up a polyethylene plant in Indonesia. 'The future of the Japanese industry is outside Japan,' says Mr Yonekura. 'We can take advantage of the high value of the yen to invest elsewhere. And, in spite of the red ink, we can always borrow whatever we need.' But although Japanese manufacturers believe their long-term future is outside Japan, they are unwilling to face up to the inevitable decline of their domestic market. Faced by massive domestic losses, Japanese plastics makers have been implementing stop-gap measures to reduce the damage. Plants have been moth-balled, maintenance periods extended and plans for new plants shelved. Just-in-time delivery is being abandoned. The number of grades being offered to clients has also been cut. But such fiddling does not deal with the root cause of the sector's difficulties. Capacity is still not being cut. Historically, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry intervened at such moments to encourage consolidation. In the early 1980s, it co-ordinated a 36 per cent cut in capacity. However, this time Miti is unwilling to adopt such a role, at least in part because of US complaints about its interference. Without the guiding hand of the Miti, little rationalisation has occurred. 'The industry understands the problem. It understands the solution. The problem is doing anything about it,' says Mr Murakami. Admittedly, a few companies, such as Idemitsu Petrochemical, Showa Denko and Asahi Chemicals, are setting up joint ventures to pool their resources. Two large groups, Mitsubishi Petrochemical and Mitsubishi Kasei, have announced they will merge, forming Japan's biggest petrochemicals manufacturer. However, industry observers question the benefits of the move. 'Mergers are all very well, but they're only really of use if you then cut staff. But Japanese companies are still reluctant to do that,' says Mr Murakami.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- JAPANESE ETHYLENE SUPPLY/DEMAND BALANCE  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- (Thousand metric tons)             1990    1991    1992    1993   1994    1995    1996    2000  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Capacity   5,975   6,132   6,432   7,032  7,032   7,032   7,032*  8,232 Supply     5,810   6,142   6,103   5,740  5,809   6,122   6,474   7,417 Demand     5,838   6,052   6,022   5,752  5,809   6,122   6,474   7,417 Inventory    (2)       -       3       -      -       -       -       - Net trade   (26)      90      78    (12)      -       -       -       -  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- * Allows for some new projects and debottlenecking  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Chem Systems Japan  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> April 24, 1989, Monday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> DREAM OF SPORTS PALACE IS A LONG WAY FROM REALITY  </P> <P> When he unveiled his dream of building a sports palace in San Diego several  months ago, La Jolla millionaire Harry Cooper summarized the blend of gung-ho  enthusiasm and sober business acumen with which he approached the project by  saying, "This is not an easy thing we're talking of doing."  </P> <P> The intervening weeks have done nothing to dissuade Cooper of that notion.  Indeed, despite making progress on a number of fronts since he announced in  February that he planned to take over the San Diego Sports Arena lease, the  obstacles that confront Cooper appear just as formidable -- and, from some  perspectives, perhaps more daunting -- as they did at the outset.  </P> <P> Today, Cooper finds himself facing a City Council that has grown skeptical of  his commitment to build the arena downtown, where the price tag could be $20  million more than the estimated $120 million it would cost to construct it on  his Sorrento Valley property. Moreover, even if Cooper and the city agree on a  downtown site, his expectation that the city will cover that price differential  could be an additional stumbling block.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Mayor Lukewarm  </P> <P> More significantly, Mayor Maureen O'Connor, who could play a pivotal role in  those negotiations, has, at best, a lukewarm attitude toward Cooper's proposal  to build a palatial 22,900-seat sports complex to replace the 23-year-old,  much-maligned Sports Arena.  </P> <P> "As far as I'm concerned, all Mr. Cooper is doing is buying a lease to operate  a sports arena as is, where is, with no commitments from the city on anything  else," O'Connor said in a recent interview. "Later, if you're going to take a  look at building a sports arena downtown, that may be a possibility. But we're  nowhere near that."  </P> <P> Even as Cooper goes about the difficult task of trying to secure development  rights for an eight-square-block downtown parcel, city planners and others have  expressed reservations about, as Horton Plaza developer Ernest Hahn put it,  "simply dropping a sports arena complex" into downtown. Doing so, some warn,  could seriously undermine plans for future downtown housing.  </P> <P> In addition, the major purpose behind building a new arena -- attracting a  professional basketball or hockey franchise to San Diego -- still faces tough  odds. Though Cooper has lined up an unidentified potential basketball owner,  the prospect of luring a National Basketball Assn. or National Hockey League  team here is hardly a slam-dunk.  </P> <P> "We're aggressively pursuing those possibilities," Cooper said. "But so are a  number of other cities."  </P> <P> The NBA has awarded two new franchises to Orlando and Minneapolis for next  year, but neither that league nor the NHL has any current plans for further  expansion.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Changing Project  </P> <P> Over the past two months, the arena project itself has also undergone dramatic  transformation. For economic and aesthetic reasons, the project has been  expanded to include a 400-room hotel, a 13-story office building and 150  condominiums, with the surrounding development intended to provide a buffer  between the arena and its immediate environs.  </P> <P> When, or if, the overall project is completed, Cooper and his partner, Richard  Esquinas, may own only a small percentage of it, with most of the equity having  been sold to other investors.  </P> <P> Yet, when asked whether that array  </P> <P> of obstacles and changes in direction bothers him, Cooper simply smiled and  said, "I end each day feeling a little more positive than the day before."  </P> <P> The problems that have been encountered are typical of any project of equal  scope, Cooper said. While admitting to occasional frustration "over things not  falling into place as quickly as I'd like," the 56-year-old computer technology  innovator said he keeps things in perspective by reminding himself of both the  magnitude of his undertaking and the incremental progress that has been made.  </P> <P> "This isn't a one-week or one-month or even one-year deal," he said. "This is a  very big project, and we've got to overcome a lot of odds. We never deceived  ourselves about this being quick and simple. But I think even people at City  Hall would admit that probably more has happened in the past two months on this  than any other project its size."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Memories of Past Plans  </P> <P> Within City Hall, enthusiasm over Cooper's proposal is tempered as much by  recognition of the thorny problems remaining as by memories of similar past  plans that never got off the drawing boards.  </P> <P> Reflecting that cautious attitude, O'Connor clearly remains to be sold on the  proposal. Her ultimate decision will be crucial, because, as mayor, she could  expedite the project by championing it or delaying -- and perhaps even  scuttling -- it with her doubts.  </P> <P> "In terms of priorities, I certainly don't see this being near the top of the  city's list," O'Connor said. "When I need $55 million for two police officers  per 1,000 (population) and things like the ($2-billion-plus) sewage issue are  coming up, . . . there's no reason to turn City Hall upside down for this  thing.  </P> <P> "I've said all along: Buy the lease and run the Sports Arena if you want to.  But what we, the council, may do in the future about a new arena should not be  contingent upon that deal. We don't have to do anything but leave the Sports  Arena where it is right now. That's the cheapest and easiest option. Then, in  20 years, we'll figure out what we're going to do from there."  </P> <P> Though Cooper realizes the importance of gaining the mayor's enthusiastic  backing, he professes to be unperturbed by O'Connor's wait-and-see attitude.  </P> <P> "I don't blame her for feeling that way," he said. "We've still got a lot to  do, and it's natural to have some questions. When our package is complete, I  think those doubts will be gone."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Package Would Be 'Ideal'  </P> <P> The Cooper-Esquinas purchase of the existing arena lease from the Canadian  company that now holds it probably will not be final until June, Cooper said.  Although he said the lease sale "is not contingent on any guarantees for a new  arena," he added: "It is all kind of tied together. It would be ideal if the  whole package came together at the same time."  </P> <P> O'Connor's position notwithstanding, other city officials are enthused by the  possibility of a new arena -- particularly one built entirely or at least  largely with private funds. They differ, however, on key questions such as  possible sites or whether any public dollars should be involved.  </P> <P> Councilman Ron Roberts, whose district includes the current Sports Arena and  who promoted the idea of a downtown replacement in his 1987 campaign, says  flatly that downtown is the only location he is willing to support for this or  any other arena proposal.  </P> <P> "I feel strongly that a sports arena is the kind of civic facility that belongs  downtown," Roberts said. "If this group can't make that happen, I'd rather wait  five years for one that could."  </P> <P> In contrast, Councilman Bob Filner, who represents downtown, said he has not  yet decided whether a site there or in a suburban area would be preferable.  Similarly, City Architect Mike Stepner noted that the council "won't know what  the complete balance sheet on that question looks like" until economic and  design studies now under way are finished later this spring.  </P> <P> </P> <P> A Clearer Picture  </P> <P> Cooper, who has spent more than $150,000 over the past two months researching  possible sites, hopes to have that question resolved by mid-June, when an  accounting firm's comparison of downtown and Sorrento Valley construction costs  will be completed. With preliminary architectural work already in progress,  Cooper said that his "absolute drop-dead deadline" for a site decision is Sept.  1.  </P> <P> "By then, the architect just can't dance anymore," said Cooper, who hopes to  break ground on the project by June, 1990. "Now, we're doing interior design  work common to either site. But by September, we'd have to start getting into  more precise exterior things related to a specific site."  </P> <P> Based on a tentative analysis, Cooper estimates a downtown arena would cost at  least $20 million more as a result of higher costs for land, underground  parking and construction logistics.  </P> <P> Advocates of a downtown arena argue that it would be a catalyst for development  in the so-called Centre City East area, would be a major boon for downtown's  night life and could be used in conjunction with the bayfront convention center  for "video conferences" too large for the center alone.  </P> <P> Potential traffic problems would be eased by the multiple freeways, San Diego  trolley lines and numerous bus routes that feed into downtown, as well as by  the fact that downtown workers could simply walk or take shuttles to the arena.  The arena's proposed 5,800-car parking garage, they add, also would provide  badly needed daytime parking for downtown workers.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Lining Up the Land  </P> <P> Other than cost, the chief disadvantage to a downtown site stems from possible  land-acquisition difficulties that could delay construction. Even a single  recalcitrant landowner could force Cooper to rely upon the city's condemnation  powers, a potentially lengthy process that could jeopardize his 1992 target  opening date.  </P> <P> Cooper's first choice for a downtown site -- the San Diego Gas &amp; Electric  Co.'s maintenance yard at 10th and Imperial avenues -- appears unobtainable,  given the utility executives' insistence that the 11.3-acre site is not for  sale. But Cooper is still interested in that area and has begun signing  development option contracts on the eight blocks to the north, east and west of  the SDG&amp;E property.  </P> <P> Not wanting to give remaining property owners bargaining leverage, Cooper  declined to specify the number of blocks he has acquired options on or the  cost. However, he ruefully conceded that publicity over the arena proposal has  dramatically driven up those prices.  </P> <P> "I wish I had quietly bought up that land a year ago," he said. "I probably  could have gotten it for a half or third what it's going to cost now."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Housing or an Arena?  </P> <P> While many city officials view a downtown arena as having the potential to spur  the next major wave of redevelopment, others are worried that it could disrupt  other key facets of long-range downtown planning -- especially the residential  development envisioned for the areas being studied as possible arena locations.  </P> <P> "At some point, you have to ask whether housing or an arena is more important  to the future of downtown," Filner said. "It may not be an either-or situation.  But if it turns out that building an arena there would mean putting aside our  plans for more downtown housing, I'm not sure we'd want to do that."  </P> <P> Underlining that point, architect Stepner noted in a recent memo that an arena,  combined with a planned new civic center on downtown's eastern fringe, could  "polarize Centre City East," resulting in "a blighted, difficult-to-develop  area in between the two projects."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, that memo -- as well as a letter to O'Connor from developer Hahn  that raises many of the same concerns -- concludes that, with proper planning,  an arena could complement residential and commercial development in adjacent  areas.  </P> <P> Because Cooper originally proposed building the arena on his 38-acre parcel in  Sorrento Valley's Golden Triangle region, some city leaders question whether he  still has an emotional attachment to that idea that could color the feasibility  studies' conclusions. That skepticism stems in part from Cooper's frequent  suggestions that use of his own land -- which he bought for $400,000 and that  now is valued at more than $23 million -- likely would cut the arena's costs  and expedite its construction.  </P> <P> "I'm concerned that their interest in downtown may not be sufficient to get the  job done," Roberts said. "I haven't seen a real aggressive push in that  direction."  </P> <P> Another top city official added: "The only reason they're looking downtown is  because we told them to. I think they'd be happy to find all kinds of reasons  not to do it downtown."  </P> <P> </P> <P> No 'Strong Preference'  </P> <P> Cooper, however, insists that he will not make up his mind on a site -- a  decision that requires the council's approval -- until he sees the analysis of  the costs and other factors associated with either a downtown or Sorrento  Valley locale.  </P> <P> "I really don't have a strong preference now," he said. "I did in the  beginning, but now I just want the best site, wherever that is. I'll start  talking about downtown and get sold on it, then the next day I'll think about  Sorrento Hills and get excited about it all over again. I've told the people  doing the report not to slant it based on how they think I'm leaning. I just  want to let the chips fall as they may."  </P> <P> Far from needing the arena project to develop his Sorrento Valley property,  Cooper confidently noted: "That land will be developed, with or without the  arena. In fact, it's probably to my advantage not to build the arena there,  because that would be riskier than other kinds of developments. I can reduce my  risks by keeping my land separate from the arena project."  </P> <P> When the site feasibility report is completed, Cooper said, he hopes it will  show that one site has a decisive advantage over the other -- partly to  eliminate any second-guessing on his part, but more importantly to speed the  council's decision.  </P> <P> "I hope the final numbers and other factors make the choice so obvious that  there's no real question. The worst thing would be for it to be a close call.  But I don't think it will be."  </P> <P> The projected price tags -- in particular, whether public financing would be  required under either option -- obviously will figure prominently in that  decision.  </P> <P> If, despite higher costs, the city insists on a downtown site, Cooper has  indicated he would expect the city to pay for the difference. Although Cooper  stressed that point from the very beginning, the growing perception that public  financing would be a necessity for any downtown arena disturbs some city  leaders.  </P> <P> "The thing that was so attractive at the beginning was that this was going to  be an entirely private project," said one council member, who asked not to be  identified. "But now there's all this talk of public funds maybe being needed.  . . . I don't think it's so much a question of bait-and-switch as it is an  attempt to deliberately lead us away from downtown."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Financing Options  </P> <P> Any public financing sought by Cooper likely would take the form of  redevelopment bonds, which he characterizes as "not exactly public money" -- an  arguable semantic distinction. Under that option, the additional tax revenue  generated by the arena in future years would be used to reimburse the city for  any public money spent now.  </P> <P> "It's not like we'd be asking the city to just give us $20 million," Cooper  argued. "This would come out of the new additional taxes and other revenue that  wouldn't be there without the arena. If this is going to be a good deal for the  city, I see no reason why it shouldn't be willing to put up some money. So long  as it doesn't cost taxpayers or take money away from sewers, police or other  programs, I don't see that as a problem."  </P> <P> Under the current Sports Arena lease, the city receives about $250,000  annually, according to Deputy City Manager Maureen Stapleton. Cooper estimates  that a new arena would raise the city's annual lease and property tax revenue  to at least $3.5 million, as well as generate additional revenue stemming from  increased consumer spending of up to $50 million a year.  </P> <P> Well aware of a new arena's potential for fattening the city's treasury --  thereby offsetting any initial public investment -- most council members say  they have not ruled out the possible use of redevelopment funds for the  project.  </P> <P> However, in order for that option to even be possible, the jurisdiction of the  city's redevelopment agency would have to be expanded to include eastern  downtown, according to Pam Hamilton, executive vice president of the Centre  City Development Corp. For Cooper, that necessary legal change is only one of  the many "ifs" on which possible city aid hinges.  </P> <P> If the city ultimately opts to invest in the arena, it likely will find itself  in partnership with far more parties than Cooper and Esquinas.  </P> <P> Previously, Cooper revealed that the financial linchpin of his plan involves  convincing a company to spend up to $40 million -- roughly one-third of the  estimated construction cost -- to have the arena named after it. In addition,  Cooper hopes to attract other major investors, including firms that would do  business at the arena, such as concessionaires and service companies -- even if  that relegates him to a small minority ownership role.  </P> <P> "We never claimed we had enough money to do this all by ourselves," Cooper  said. "But we do have enough to get it started and make it happen. My feeling  is that anyone with a chance to benefit from the upside of the arena also  should be willing to take the risk for the downside.  </P> <P> "By the time this is over, I may only own 5% of the deal. I don't want it to  sound like I'm that flippant about possibly giving away ownership. But if  that's what it takes to make this reality, my ego can live with that."  </P></p>

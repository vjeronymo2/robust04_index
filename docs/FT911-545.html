			<p>910511 FT  11 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Bridgend moves in for Cowan with 17p cash THE BID for control of Cowan de Groot, the toys and industrial hardware group, intensified as Bridgend Group, a major shareholder, officially entered the fray with an offer of 17p in cash per ordinary share. This offer follows an all-share bid made last month by Wilton Group, the USM-quoted company with interests in property, which is also a major shareholder of Cowan with a 29.3 per cent stake. Wilton is offering six ordinary shares for each Cowan share and one Wilton preference share for each Cowan preference share. Describing Wilton's offer as 'totally unacceptable,' Bridgend, which has a 10.6 per cent stake, pointed out that Wilton was a heavily geared company that had not paid a dividend since its present directors were appointed to the board five years ago. 'We were disturbed by the quality of Wilton's offer,' said Mr Neil List, chairman of Bridgend. In 1990 Wilton reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.07m and had borrowings of Pounds 10.90m against net assets of Pounds 7.28m. Bridgend further questioned Wilton's stated asset value, indicating that property values had declined substantially since Wilton made the valuations for balance sheet purposes in July 1989. Bridgend calculates that Wilton's offer, on a net asset basis adjusted to current valuations, comes closer to 4p per Cowan share, rather than the 16 1/2 p stated by Wilton. Bridgend reported a 74 per cent rise in pre-tax profits for 1990 to Pounds 1.06m from a previous Pounds 608,000.</p>

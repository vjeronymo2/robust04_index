			<p>940820 FT  20 AUG 94 / Food &amp; Drink: The glories of ancient fish ARCHESTRATUS: THE LIFE OF LUXURY. EUROPE'S OLDEST COOKERY BOOK Translated with introduction and commentary by John Wilkins and Shaun Hill Prospect Books, Pounds 7.99 No one has yet attempted a history of changing tastes. Products may vary; sugar and potatoes and tomatoes may transform civilisations, but physical sensations (we always assume) remain the same - and the decision about what is pleasant or unpleasant to taste must be part of an unchanging world. Yet what western traveller has learned to accept sheep's eyes or fermented mares' milk as equal to caviar and champagne? Even words mislead us: wine is not the same taste as it was 10 years ago, and certainly not the same as medieval or ancient wines. Greek wine was sweet and thick, so full of straws and sticks that it had to be strained; there were no vintages or chateaux, and only the most rudimentary of geographical appellations controles, as Archestratus, a Sicilian of the fourth century BC, reveals. The greatest luxury in ancient Greece was fish. Promising political careers were ruined by the accusation that a man was a fish-eater - fish-eating was a sign of extreme right-wing opinions. That is why Archestratus's book on the life of luxury or pleasant sensations is all about fish. This earliest of gastronomic guide-books was written in verse, as a mock epic poem; it survives in 62 quotations from a gastronomic encyclopedia compiled 500 years later during the Roman Empire. In florid poetic style it describes where you can find the best of each sort of fish from the Black Sea to Sicily and from the Adriatic to Asia Minor. The author was a dedicated hedonist 'who sailed round the inhabited world for the sake of his belly and the parts beneath his belly'. Occasionally he mentions other flesh, such as hare and goose, but never the great sacrificial meats such as beef, goat or pork. The world of pure pleasure lies outside the civic rituals, in an area where indulgence runs free. The editors of this delightful translation, illustrated with charming drawings by Philippa Stockley, are scholar and chef combined. They tell us what fish is what, and how well the recipes will work. They even reconstruct two sample recipes (dogfish with cumin and oregano, and grilled marinated mackerel). But in spite of the grandiloquent claims of an author who believes so passionately in self-indulgence and excess, we are left with an impression of elegance, mixed with a certain abstemiousness; Greek luxury seems pretty restrained. Now the Romans, they were really gross.</p>

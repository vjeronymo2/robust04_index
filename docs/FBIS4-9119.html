			<p>BFN     [Text] Members of the executive committee and chairmen of  the municipal councils of the Croatian Democratic Union [HDZ] of  Bosnia-Herzegovina have confirmed their support for full  implementation of the Washington agreement. At their meeting in  Mostar, they also discussed the political and security situation  in Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Croat republic of Herceg-Bosna.  Zdenko Vranjes has filed this report:    [Vranjes] Addressing the members of the executive committee  and the chairmen of the municipal committees of the HDZ in  Bosnia-Herzegovina, Kresimir Zubak, president of the  presidential council of the Croat republic, said that a majority  of the Croatian and Bosniak people want to implement the  Washington agreement and the constitution of the federation.  The minority of the Croatian nation which would like to  obstruct the Washington agreement must be aware that it fulfills  the interests of the entire Croatian nation both in  Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Republic of Croatia. We must  continue to stress that Bosnia-Herzegovina is our homeland in  order to prevent anybody from making exclusive claims on it.    Zubak said that talks on the presidency of the federation in  the interim period will be resumed with Bosniak representatives  on Saturday. Under the constitution, the Croatian side wants to  have their man as president in the interim stage. However,  Zubak added, the Croatian side is prepared to accept a  compromise if the Muslim side insists on a Muslim president of  the federation and if Haris Silajdzic is nominated for this  position.</p>

			<p>910507 FT  07 MAY 91 / Bush heart flutter sharpens America's election focus: The president's health could become a potent campaign issue in 1992 PRESIDENT George Bush returned to the White House yesterday after two nights in hospital behaving as if everything is back to normal. But it is not. His heart problems have raised, and revived, questions which were not being discussed previously. The possibility of a Quayle presidency now has to be considered. Suddenly the 1992 US presidential election looks different. Before the weekend the conventional wisdom in Washington was that Mr Bush was unbeatable, and few leading Democrats were even thinking about entering the race. But even if Mr Bush's irregular heartbeat turns out to be as temporary a problem as the White House claims, his health will have become a campaign issue. The weekend's events have reminded everyone of the president's age, 66. He has seemed younger and belied his age by his energetic official activities. Mr Bush jogs frequently, as he was doing when he suffered shortness of breath on Saturday, and participates in other outdoor sports like golf and tennis. He also fishes and sails. His age and health will now be subject to closer scrutiny in view of his previous vigour. Past presidents have suffered serious illnesses and been re-elected, notably President Eisenhower, who survived a serious heart attack in 1955, during his first term. But expectations about fitness are higher now. This weekend's events have underlined in the most vivid manner the old cliche about the vice-president being only a heartbeat away from the presidency. Five vice-presidents have taken over from presidents in mid-term this century, in four cases where their predecessor died. The Quayle question was the subject of long articles in all the US newspapers yesterday. The vice-president has not managed to shake off the popular impression of being a golf-loving political lightweight he had when selected to be Mr Bush's running mate in August 1988. His poll ratings remain very low: a recent CNN/Time magazine survey showed that only 19 per cent thought he was qualified to become president. Senior Bush administration officials say this is unfair. The vice-president has been fully involved in decision-making by Mr Bush - certainly much more than, say, Harry Truman was before President Roosevelt's death in 1945 when he did not even know about the atom bomb project. Mr Quayle has proved to be a loyal and dutiful vice-president with sharp political antennae on such issues as last autumn's tax row. He has made few public mistakes and is seen by beleaguered conservative Republicans as an effective advocate of their case in the White House. He also has a team of talented young, conservative advisers around him. The other main political result is likely to be that more Democrats will think about running next year. Several possible contenders have been in Cleveland for the meeting of the mainstream Democratic Leadership Conference, but avoided public comment, apart from asking whether Mr Bush still believed that Mr Quayle was the best person to succeed him. But such leading Democrats as Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, Governor Douglas Wilder of Virginia and House majority leader Richard Gephardt may now review their positions. Mr Bush was yesterday impatient to return as soon as possible to his usual frenetic pace, as his doctors ruefully acknowledged. But as veteran New York Times columnist James Reston pointed out yesterday, perhaps Mr Bush's problem is not a 'shortness of breath' but a shortage of rest and patience. 'He is physically in motion and mentally impulsive.' Not only does Mr Bush pursue a hectic schedule, but he has also been under pressure recently. The glow of the Gulf war victory has faded in recent weeks as he has faced criticism not only for his tardiness in responding to the Iraqi civil war but also for handling of military decisions during the war. Charges that he was involved in alleged Reagan campaign efforts to delay the release of US hostages in Iran until after the November 1980 election have been revived. The huge media coverage of Mr Bush's heart problem - and the associated market nervousness - have underlined how much power and attention is concentrated on the US president. His health matters.

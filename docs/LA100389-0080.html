			<p><P> October 3, 1989, Tuesday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> LINK OF KIDNAPING SUSPECT TO OTHER INCIDENTS INVESTIGATED  </P> <P> Southland police tried to determine Monday whether the suspected kidnaper of a  homeless Orange County girl might have attempted to abduct at least 10 other  Los Angeles-area children by luring them into his pickup truck.  </P> <P> Detectives from four South Bay cities and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's  Department said they are interested in learning more about Eduardo Uzcanga, a  transient arrested Sunday afternoon by Santa Ana police a day after a  6-year-old girl was kidnaped.  </P> <P> "Some things match and some things don't," said Manhattan Beach Police Sgt.  Jack Zea. "We are going to look at him anyway. We are trying to get pictures of  him and look at his background to see where he has been the last couple weeks."  </P> <P> The Santa Ana youngster was abducted about 6:30 p.m. Saturday. Officials said  her mother, who has three children, is homeless. Police found the child  wandering in the same area about two hours later. Detectives are awaiting the  results of a medical examination to determine if she was sexually assaulted.  </P> <P> Uzcanga, 48, on parole from an attempted murder conviction in Santa Ana, is  being held in Orange County Jail. Officials with the Orange County district  attorney's office say they expect to file a one-count kidnaping charge against  him.  </P> <P> Police also confiscated Uzcanga's pickup truck, a dark blue Chevrolet with a  white camper shell. The girl's mother told police she saw a man in a blue  pickup truck grab her daughter.  </P> <P> The Santa Ana kidnapping is at least the 11th reported incident of its type in  the Southland involving a dark-haired man with a mustache, who drove up to  girls in a dark blue pickup. With the exception of the Santa Ana case, the  children managed to get away and call for help, police said.  </P> <P> The attempted kidnapings were reported in Hawthorne, Manhattan Beach, Pico  Rivera, Redondo Beach and Torrance between Sept. 13 and last Thursday. Police  said the man allegedly told the children that their parents were hurt and that  he was supposed to pick them up, police say.  </P> <P> Police said there are some differences in descriptions of the suspect provided  by witnesses and the children. Zea said Uzcanga is older than the man described  by most witnesses. Also, Redondo Beach and Manhattan Beach police say the  suspect vehicle was described as a foreign-made compact truck, not a full-sized  Chevrolet.  </P></p>

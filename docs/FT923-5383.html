			<p>920901 FT  01 SEP 92 / Letter: Baccalaureate preferred to A-levels Sir, As the parent of a recent international baccalaureate student I think Andrew Adonis' contacts ('Not always a class act', August 21) dismiss the value, potential and the recognition of the IB too easily. The IB syllabus is wider and more up to date than A-levels. This is recognised by many parents wanting their children to be better equipped. The same is true of many universities, including Oxbridge, which value the wider and more rounded perspective of the IB student. I asked the headmaster of an A-level public school why his school did not offer the IB option and was given a surprisingly unenterprising answer: 'Because there is only room for one IB school in Kent.' If there is a problem with recognition of the IB it lies not with the parents or the universities. Rather, it lies with schools and the appallingly low level of promotion by the IB authorities.

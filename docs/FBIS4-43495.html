A ministry communique said the meeting took place in a  "cordial climate" and also covered a wide range of issues  concerning European anti-trust and competition regulations,  focussing on the new Rome government's "orientations" for  privatizations.    Budget Minister Giancarlo Pagliarini also met Van Miert and  discussed state aid to industry, privatizations, regional aid  and tax rules for payments made by employers for pensions and  welfare, a communique said.    Van Miert urged Rome to prepare as soon as possible a list  of  areas that may be eligible for EU funds. Most of the EU funds  set aside for development and infrastructure projects in  southern Italy over the past several years have not been used.</p>

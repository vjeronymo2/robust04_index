			<p>930723 FT  23 JUL 93 / International Company News: Belgian cement group in Polish acquisition CIMENTERIES CBR, the Belgian cement producer, has agreed to pay DM90.4m (Dollars 52.50m) for stakes in two cement works in Poland. It will acquire 30 per cent of the Gorazdze works and a 42 per cent share in the Strzelce Opolskie factory, which together produce one-quarter of Poland's cement output. CBR, which has sought to purchase Gorazdze for over two years, has also promised to buy a further 21 per cent of the shares in the plant in 1997 as well as 38 per cent of the equity in Strzelce, which uses the more costly wet process technology, for DM55.2m. The Belgian company has also promised to invest DM76m in new equipment for Gorazdze and DM32m for equipment at Strzelce. A further DM72m will be spent on upgrading marketing operations and DM11m on reducing pollution. The final stages of the negotiations were accompanied by a strike alert called by the Solidarity trade union branch at Gorazdze, which has been resisting a majority takeover by foreign capital. It has also supported the Initiative Group (IG), an employee and management bid to purchase the works backed by local banks and several western investment funds. Mr Janusz Lewandowski, the privatisation minister, yesterday afternoon signed an undertaking for the union and the IG promising that 10 per cent of the equity at Gorazdze would handed over free to the employees. The remaining 30 per cent would be sold to the IG and the Polish Development Bank, through the Warsaw Stock Exchange.</p>

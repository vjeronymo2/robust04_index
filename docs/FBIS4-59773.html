			<p>BFN     [Text] U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher may  return to the Middle East in a month. This remark was made by  Professor Itamar Rabinovich, Israel's ambassador to the United  States, to our political correspondent Shlomo Raz at the end of  Christopher talks in Jerusalem. Ambassador Rabinovich noted  that there is no breakthrough in the talks with the Syrians, and  described them as a living process.    He further said that the clarifications received from the  Syrians are not satisfactory, but they do contain some positive  and real aspects. Rabinovich noted that Christopher will be  leaving for Damascus tomorrow with additional Israeli questions  regarding the Syrian replies and, according to him, we will know  where the talks are headed in less than two days.</p>

			<p><P> July 30, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FAR-REACHING BILL TO PROTECT DISABLED FROM DISCRIMINATION GAINS SPEED  </P> <P> Former Rep. Tony Coelho suffered seizures for six years, starting when he was  about 15 years old. He had epilepsy caused by a head injury suffered in an  automobile accident.  </P> <P> But he did not know that. His parents, holding to an ancient belief, told him  that he was possessed by the devil and took him to witch doctors.  </P> <P> Coelho finally found out what was wrong after he was denied entry to a Roman  Catholic seminary based on his medical exam. But when he sought other jobs,  potential employers also turned him down. He lost his driver's license. He  became depressed and suicidal and began drinking heavily. "It hit me pretty  hard," he says. "I felt total rejection."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bipartisan Support  </P> <P> It was his personal experience that drove Coelho to sponsor and push hard for  the Americans With Disabilities Act, a measure that would protect all disabled  Americans against discrimination in private-sector employment and public  accommodations -- the same rights that are already guaranteed on the basis of  race by the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act.  </P> <P> Coelho (D-Merced) is no longer in Congress, but the bill has been quietly  gaining speed in recent months on Capitol Hill with widespread bipartisan  support and now appears destined for passage.  </P> <P> "Discrimination against people with disabilities remains pervasive in our  society," said Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), one of the bill's chief sponsors in  the Senate. "People with disabilities are entitled to lead independent and  productive lives, and they are entitled to make choices for themselves."  </P> <P> Harkin remembers visiting his brother, who is deaf, in the hospital and having  his brother tell him: "This thing must be broken," referring to the nurse call  button on the wall. "I keep pushing for my medicine and nobody comes." So  Harkin pressed it, and a voice boomed into the room: "Hello. May I help you?"  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bans Bias by Employers  </P> <P> The bill before Congress would prohibit discrimination based on handicap by all  private businesses employing 15 or more people, unless the person otherwise was  not qualified for the job. The measure would also require employers to make  "reasonable accommodations" for the disabled in the workplace by removing  physical barriers or providing special equipment, unless doing so poses an  "undue hardship."  </P> <P> All new buildings and public transportation would have to be accessible to  disabled individuals. Existing facilities -- including theaters, restaurants  and hotels, for example -- must make modest changes to accommodate disabled  persons.  </P> <P> In a particularly far-reaching provision, the bill also would require telephone  companies to put in place special relay systems to enable those with  communication disorders to make calls. With non-voice telephone devices, the  deaf and others would communicate with a telephone operator who, in turn, would  relay the conversation verbally to the individual on the other end of the line.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Affects AIDS Patients  </P> <P> Interestingly, although the acronym AIDS appears nowhere in the proposed  measure, the bill defines persons with contagious diseases as handicapped.  Thus, it would also afford protection to people who have the deadly disease, to  those who are infected with the virus -- and to those who may even be perceived  to be infected. The latter point is an important distinction, since relatives  of AIDS patients have often themselves been the target of discrimination.  </P> <P> Under this definition, more than 40 million Americans would be considered  disabled. Through its broad scope, the bill has forged a massive and unusual  coalition of supporters. "You can see paralyzed vets in their wheelchairs  passing out information about AIDS, and AIDS activists arguing in favor of  retrofitting buses," said one congressional aide who has worked on the  legislation.  </P> <P> The AIDS protections alone embody what members of the public health community  have repeatedly said could be the single most important tool to curbing the  burgeoning epidemic. Many medical experts have long believed that once those at  risk for AIDS know that they cannot be the subject of discrimination, they will  be more willing to undergo testing for AIDS infection and can better receive  treatment and education about the disease.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Extends Existing Law  </P> <P> The measure builds on partial protections for the handicapped already in  federal law. The 1973 Rehabilitation Act already forbids discrimination against  the handicapped in programs and facilities that receive federal funds, but  advocates for disabled persons and AIDS activists have argued that the  provisions must be extended to the private sector.  </P> <P> There were numerous calls for such legislation during the Ronald Reagan years,  but they brought no action. Reagan said that the ideas needed more study, and  preferred that action on such measures be left to state legislatures.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Bush More Receptive  </P> <P> President Bush has been more receptive. "The last day I was in office I called  President Bush and asked him to recommit himself to the bill and try to get it  done this year," said Coelho, who resigned from the House last month to avoid  an Ethics Committee investigation of the circumstances surrounding his purchase  of a junk bond. "And he said 'yes.' He said: 'Yes, absolutely, let's get it  done this year.' I respect him for that."  </P> <P> Bush Administration officials have a few problems with the bill, but have  expressed overall broad support for its goals and have indicated that Bush will  sign it. The measure, also sponsored by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.),  already has 48 co-sponsors in the Senate.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Strong Opposition  </P> <P> While the White House support has provided a big push, there is strong  opposition, particularly in the business community.  </P> <P> Referring to the "reasonable accommodation" section, Zachary Fasman,  representing the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in recent testimony before the  Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee that "the costs of this action would  be enormous and obviously could have a disastrous impact upon many small  businesses struggling to survive." Further, he said, "Imposition of these costs  on employers threatens to make American business even less competitive in our  increasingly global economy."  </P> <P> Supporters of the bill, on the other hand, argue that the costs of making the  changes would be small, especially compared to the amount society now spends to  support those with disabilities, particularly those now unable to work.  </P> <P> Fasman also criticized a provision of the bill that defines alcohol and drug  abuse as handicaps, saying that it has the potential to create "safety  ramifications regarding customers, clients and the public at large."  </P> <P> He added: "It is particularly inappropriate that Congress should be considering  such provisions at the same time that American business is increasingly being  required,  </P> <P> by federal agencies, to create and preserve a drug-free workplace."  </P> <P> But Robert Silverstein, staff director and chief counsel to the Senate  subcommittee on the handicapped, said that the provision requiring an  individual to be qualified for the job eliminates such potential difficulties.  </P> <P> "You must show that you are qualified," he said. "If you use drugs, or sell  them, or engage in abusive behavior or absenteeism -- if your behavior is not  consistent with the rules -- you get fired. The key is qualifications. The  person has to be qualified . . . to be hired and to keep the job."  </P> <P> Rep. William E. Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), who has long been opposed to AIDS  anti-discrimination legislation, said that he plans to fight the bill in the  House.  </P> <P> Referring to AIDS patients and drug and alcohol abusers, he said that people  who "engage in such activities . . . have no case worthy of being brought  within the reach of handicapped status. It's kind of like the young man who  shoots both his parents and then throws himself on mercy of court because he's  an orphan."  </P> <P> Nevertheless, the bill is expected to be approved in both houses, possibly with  some amendments, and to be sent to the President. It may reach the Senate floor  for a vote shortly after lawmakers return from their August recess.  </P> <P> "This bill is a revolutionary bill, no doubt about it," said Pat Wright,  director of the East Coast office of the Disability Rights Education and  Defense Fund. "It will change the way America is. It will make a society that  is totally open to all Americans, not just to those who are able-bodied."  </P></p>

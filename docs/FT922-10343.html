			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: World Stock Markets: Novelty value helps give new value - Post-revolution, post-war, Tehran's exchange is reinvigorated After a moribund decade on the post-revolutionary shelf, Tehran's stock exchange is enjoying a new lease of life as the government proceeds with its privatisation programme. Last week the government announced that it would sell off hundreds of state-owned companies during the next two years, and domestic investors will be allowed to buy up to 34 per cent of the equity in each. The share offerings are also open to foreigners, who will be able to buy up to 25 per cent of the share capital. At present, 129 companies are listed on the exchange - mostly newly privatised chemical, textile or other industrial companies. A further 200 companies have applied for a listing, and officials say 50 of these will be accepted. In order to qualify for a listing, a company must be both Iranian and profitable. The government's privatisation drive, part of its five-year plan launched in the 1989-90 year, has attracted more than 100,000 new investors a year to the Tehran stock exchange. In the year to March 31, 1992, turnover reached IR478bn (Dollars 333m), seven times the previous year and 40 times the 1989-90 figure. The Tepix index rose by 106 per cent during the year to March 31, 1992, with some shares gaining more than 200 per cent. This surge in interest is partly due to the novelty of share ownership in post-revolutionary Iran. Trading on the stock market virtually stopped in September 1980, at the outbreak of Iran's eight-year war with Iraq, when the Iranian government put its economy on a war footing. Traditionally, Iranians have sought to trade in tangible goods, rather than financial paper, since Iran's Islamic banks pay no interest and distribute only a small percentage of their overall profits. One third of the government's sales will be offered to employees. Workers in recently privatised companies make up a sizeable proportion of the stock exchange's private investors. Those who need the money sell quickly, but increasingly they are keeping their investments and hoping to see them increase in value. The stock market is open to all and, in a country where gambling and betting are illegal, individuals see the stock exchange as their only chance for a flutter. Women investors are quite prominent. 'Here, women are the same as men,' says Mr Abdullahi Pervaiz, a trader on the exchange. 'Their money is just as good.' Indeed, the sexes mingle in the public gallery, where hardcore investors rub shoulders with economics graduates, eager to see the mechanics of capitalism at work. The stock market has levelled off recently, but officials expect a renewed rally, if President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's government abolishes the remaining restrictions on stock market trading. Last week, in an encouraging sign of flexibility, President Rafsanjani allowed private brokerages on to the trading floor for the first time. Previously, all trading was conducted by large banks and a few individual brokers. The new regulations allow private firms to develop across the country, giving more access to retail investors. Mr Rajaie Salmassi, secretary general of the stock exchange, says that foreigners, mainly from the Gulf countries, but increasingly from Europe, are interested in returning. Some foreign companies still own stock bought before the revolution. The exchange still uses an 'open outcry' system and only trades for two hours a day in a cramped old building in central Tehran. Most investors have to come to the exchange in person, and since brokers have not yet got to grips with the new financial transactions, the trading pit is ringed with advisers. However, in May the exchange will move to new, computerised offices nearby, which will provide room for expansion.</p>

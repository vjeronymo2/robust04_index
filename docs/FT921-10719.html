			<p>920205 FT  05 FEB 92 / World Trade News: Contract for phone cable FOUR companies have announced plans to build one of the world's largest-capacity underwater phone cable systems to link three Caribbean islands, AP reports from Morristown, New Jersey. The system will be built by AT&amp;T Submarine Systems as a key part of a network linking the Caribbean and Latin America with the US and Europe, scheduled to be completed by 1994. The 112-mile fibre-optic Taino-Carib cable will link Puerto Rico, St. Thomas and Tortola. Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK, Telefonica Larga Distancia of Puerto Rico, and US Sprint Communications of Kansas City, will also work on the project.</p>

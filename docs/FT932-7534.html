			<p>930522 FT  22 MAY 93 / Property: When history palls, there are always pork pies - Gerald Cadogan finds plenty to interest potential purchasers in the east Midlands of England LINCOLN Cathedral is at the heart of the east Midlands. Its vast bulk dominates the town and its rich variety of stonework recalls that it used to control a great swathe of England, when its diocese stretched from the Humber to the Thames at Oxford. This majestic building from the late 12th and early 13th centuries, conceived on a scale that seems more at home in France, is rare in having had few changes since St Hugh started to rebuild it in 1186. Lincolnshire prospered in the Middle Ages, as its many grand village churches show. The county's decline reached a trough in the 1930s when some landlords actually paid tenant farmers to continue to work the land. But the second world war changed that. While bombers took off from Lincolnshire's many airfields - the cathedral has a sobering monument to the great number of fliers who never returned - its fertile land showed at last what it could produce. And farming still prospers. Church crawling is one delight of living in the east Midlands, partly to identify the stones the builders used. Ketton and Clipsham stone were favourites, and Collyweston produces the best roughly-slivered stone tiles. Savills is selling the 17th century, Grade II Manor House in Clipsham for around Pounds 325,000. But Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire and Nottinghamshire are not just for antiquarian aesthetes. Go to Leicestershire to hunt or taste pork pies in Melton Mowbray. Nottingham has its Chinese restaurants and the southern branch of Scotland's Loch Fyne oyster bar. And in Northampton, home of the British shoe industry, outlets near the factories sell 'seconds' of the footwear destined for the shops of Jermyn Street in London's West End. The defects are hard to spot and the saving is large. The price rises for season tickets by train to London have hit commuters who came into south Lincolnshire in the 1980s, attracted by cheap houses. But getting north and south is quick on the M1 and A1 roads, and very quick by train from Peterborough or Grantham. House prices are around 40 per cent down on the boom years. Nicholas Leeming, of Humberts, suggests the county is turning back on itself. Now that 400-500 people a day - the peak a few years ago - are no longer commuting from Grantham, there are seats on the London trains. The steady shrinking of the fishing industry has hurt north-east Lincolnshire. Across the Humber, Hull hardly knew there was a 1980s boom in house prices. But, as they scarcely went up, so they have scarcely fallen. There is a shortage of houses of rectory/farmhouse size (unlike the south of England and the West Country), probably because big landlords still own much of the land. The area of Nottinghamshire known as the Dukeries (parts of Sherwood Forest, of Robin Hood fame, that became ducal property with the enclosures) speaks for itself. Lincolnshire boasts Belvoir Castle and Burghley House - Britain's riposte to Chambord in France - while northern Northamptonshire has Rockingham Castle, Deene Park and Boughton House, the Duke of Buccleuch's French chateau in the Midlands. In the medium range, a few more houses are appearing because the diocese of Lincoln is still selling rectories out of church domain - which will qualify for a unique exemption from stamp duty if sold under the Parsonages Measure 1938. Jas Brown has on its books the Rectory at Scotter, between Scunthorpe and Gainsborough, with 1.75 acres for around Pounds 175,000 (note, however, that the new rectory will be going up next door); and the Rectory at Woolsthorpe, west of Grantham, with a splendid view over the Vale of Belvoir to Belvoir Castle, for around Pounds 225,000. The same firm (and Strutt &amp; Parker) is selling Barkston Grange, five miles from Grantham. This is a farmhouse with outbuildings, swimming pool, tennis court and 4.3 acres for Pounds 280,000 - much cheaper than such a property would cost in Gloucestershire. Yet, it is just a few minutes over an hour to London by rail. For Pounds 5,000 less, William H. Brown offers the early-17th century brick Cosby House (but without the barn and stables, although they could be included) in Cosby, a few miles south-west of Leicester and well-placed for the M1 and M69; and, for Pounds 105,000 less, Tudor Mews in Cosby, three cottages made into a house of substance. In Billesdon, between Leicester and Uppingham, Brown offers The Old Greyhound, a converted pub said to stand on the site of a Roman building, for Pounds 145,000. The agent, faithful to the new Property Misdescriptions Act, writes that this has not been verified. To do so would mean a dig. A larger country house new on the market shows what good value waits in Lincolnshire. Thorpe Hall at Louth, on the edge of Tennyson's country of the Lincolnshire Wolds, was begun in 1584 for John Bolle, knighted in 1596 for his exploits fighting at Cadiz. In Spain, he fell for a Spanish woman whose ghost, the Green Lady, is said to haunt the house. In 1906, Gertrude Jekyll planned the gardens and park, so the spirit of romanticism is alive. Savills is selling the house for around Pounds 650,000. Apart from its grounds and cottages, you get a study with a stained glass window showing the ballad of 'The Spanish Lady's Love for an Englishman,' and perpetual rights to sole use of the Thorpe Hall pew in the local church. Hilton House, near Huntingdon in Cambridgeshire, also has fine gardens and a wealth of topiary, and is on sale for only the second time since it was built in the 18th century - as a Georgian house on the older plan of an E with the middle bar cut out. An underground passage, letting servants go from one end of the house to the other, will be an adventure playground for children. Bidwells offers it for around Pounds 500,000. Usselby Hall, near Market Rasen in Lincolnshire, is a brick Georgian house that belonged to Tennyson's grandfather (from Savills, around Pounds 385,000). The firm's Cambridge branch is selling the imposing Edwardian Tudoresque Houghton Manor near Huntingdon, complete with a baronial dining hall. This comfortable pastiche costs around Pounds 325,000. In Oakham, Rutland, the Grade II Yule House is probably the best in town; the judge used to stay there for Assizes. Built in 1700, it has a squash court and listed dovecote; Carter Jonas offers it at Pounds 395,000. Two essence-of-rural-England thatched cottages from the same agent are Walnut House in Ufford, near Stamford (Pounds 195,000), and Ivy Cottage in Sawtry, near Huntingdon (Pounds 125,000). Carter Jonas also has Yew Tree House in Molesworth, near Thrapston, a thatched farmhouse for Pounds 230,000. East of Northampton, Jackson-Stops is selling 8 Bell End in Wollaston for just Pounds 85,000. New on the market is Uffington Manor, near Stamford, from Humberts for Pounds 250,000-Pounds 275,000. With views across the valley to Burghley, the manor is next to the ruined site of the big 1670s house which burnt down at the beginning of this century. Its yew walk is now in the manor garden, as is a dog cemetery where Jockie is buried with the epitaph: 'The rich man's guardian, and the poor man's friend; the only creature faithful to the end.' Doggerel for toffs. Also newly for sale is a Grade I manor rich in history near Oundle. Lyveden Old Bield belonged to the family of Sir Thomas Tresham, an eccentric Tudor symbolist who turned Roman Catholic in 1580 and so went straight to the Fleet prison. When not in jail, he started building the nearby New Bield, with a cruciform design honouring the Cross and Passion. Now a picturesque ruin owned by the National Trust, it is well worth a visit. So, also, is his Triangular Lodge at Rushton, the family's main seat, which honours the Trinity. Sir Thomas never finished the New Bield as he died in 1605 (as did his son, Francis, in the Tower of London, where he had gone for taking part in the Gunpowder Plot). The Old Bield, with a guide price of Pounds 475,000, comes from Savills in Stamford. But you get only the back stairs for your money; the main staircase went to the United States in the 1920s.

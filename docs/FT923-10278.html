			<p>920731 FT  31 JUL 92 / International Company News: CNAC buys stake in HK air cargo handler THE Hong Kong government yesterday sold its 10 per cent shareholding in Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals (HACTL), the colony's monopoly aviation cargo handler, to China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) for HKDollars 106m. The deal follows CNAC's purchase two weeks ago of a 5 per cent stake in Cathay Pacific for HKDollars 1.7bn from Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. China Travel Service bought another 5 per cent holding in Cathay from the bank as well. The move was seen yesterday as strengthening Cathay Pacific's role in Hong Kong after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in June 1997. The Swire group, Cathay's parent, owns 30 per cent of HACTL and CNAC is closely related to China Aviation Administration Corporation, China's civil aviation authority. The acquisition was also seen as a vote of confidence by China in the colony's new multi-billion dollar airport as HACTL only has a future if the new airport is built. The company's ability to expand cargo handling facilities at Kai Tek, the existing airport, is limited as Kai Tek is expected to reach full capacity by 1994 or 1995. The Provisional Airport Authority has called for expressions of interest from companies wanting to operate mainstream cargo handling and dedicated express cargo operations at Chek Lap Kok. It aims to issue one or more licences and HACTL is expected to feature among the winners. Last year HACTL handled 821,000 tonnes of air cargo, 7 per cent up on 1990 in spite of the Gulf War. HACTL estimates the long run growth in air cargo at around 8 per cent a year. In addition to Swire, Jardine Matheson owns 30 per cent of HACTL, Wharf Holdings 15 per cent, and Hongkong Whampoa Docks - a Hutchison Whampoa subsidiary - 15 per cent.</p>

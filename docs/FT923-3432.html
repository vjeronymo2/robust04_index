			<p>920912 FT  12 SEP 92 / Germans warned of health spending cuts GERMANY has too many doctors and too many hospital beds, and consumes far too many medicines, Mr Horst Seehofer, the health minister, declared yesterday. As a result, government subsidies for the health service will almost double in the current year, from DM5.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn) in 1991 to more than DM10bn in 1992, he warned the German parliament. Figures published yesterday showed that west Germans in 1990 spent DM304bn on their health, or almost 10 per cent of gross national product. Per capita, that meant spending DM4,770, an increase of 9.7 per cent over 1989. Mr Seehofer insisted yesterday that the health service and pharmaceutical industry must share cuts of DM8.2bn, while patients will contribute DM3.2bn in increased charges. However, he has agreed to set up working groups with doctors' organisations, and the opposition Social Democrats, to reach consensus on the plan. The plan tabled in the Bundestag provides for a 5 per cent cut in pharmaceutical prices from next January, strict limits on the quantity of medicines doctors may prescribe, and a limit on the number of new doctors to be registered with the state-subsidised health insurance schemes. There would also be increased charges to patients for hospital care and prescriptions. Mr Seehofer said Germany had the second highest density of doctors per capita in Europe. 'In the next eight years we expect a further 22,000 doctors to be registered, and yet probably we will not get any healthier.' He added that neighbouring Denmark, with as high a life expectancy as Germany, consumed only one-fifth of the medicines per capita. He also said far too many patients who could be cared for at home, or be treated as outpatients, were kept in hospital. The result of Germany's health boom was that contributions to health insurance now consume 13 per cent of average incomes, and would rise to 15 per cent by the end of 1994 without the savings planned. Mr Seehofer's offer of talks was welcomed by the Social Democrats, but the opposition is determined to limit the effect on patients. The German government yesterday announced the establishment of four working groups to bring together government, industry, trade unions, the federal states and local government in preparing a 'solidarity pact' to revive the German economy, Quentin Peel reports. The groups will consider measures to improve the competitiveness of German industry and to finance the reconstruction of eastern Germany.</p>

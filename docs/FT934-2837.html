			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Lutine Capital struggles toraise Dollars 200m for Lloyd's Lutine Capital Corporation, the Lloyd's insurance company, was last night struggling to meet its Dollars 200m (Pounds 134m) capital raising target. Lutine, which is backed by Donaldson Lukin and Jenrette, the US securities house, the Anton members' agency and Phoenix Securities, had originally aimed to raise Dollars 300m to provide support for Lloyd's syndicates in 1994 but has found difficulty in persuading enough US investors to back the scheme. Lutine is still hopeful of raising capital but since it must finalise its plans by December 15 it could soon run out of time. Enthusiasm among US investors has waned following a flood of financial issues in the autumn. In addition, it is understood that sentiment among US institutional investors has shifted against Lloyd's in the wake of adverse publicity over the past month. Earlier this week Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank, and Johnson &amp; Higgins, the insurance brokers, withdrew a scheme to launch another Dollars 300m Lloyd's fund, London Market Investors. Another bank and broker team - JP Morgan and Marsh &amp; McLennan - has also not delivered a corporate capital project for the Lloyd's market. Lloyd's has been more successful in raising capital from UK institutional investors, with some Pounds 860m committed to Lloyd's in 1994.</p>

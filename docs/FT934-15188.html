			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / The sun rises and rises The daily 'chokai' sessions for the 500 blue-jacketed employees at the Scottish manufacturing plant of OKI, the Japanese electronics company, have been upbeat affairs in recent months, writes Michael Cassell. The morning meetings, intended to enable everyone to participate in running the company, take place against a background of growing order books and higher production. OKI arrived in Cumbernauld in 1987 after a long search to find a European operating centre for its manufacturing, sales and research and development. The company, founded more than 100 years ago, had looked hard at Spain, France and Germany, according to Mr David Ennis, director of personnel and corporate affairs. It chose Cumbernauld mainly because of the availability of skilled workers, good infrastructure and communications, as well as modest regional grant aid, which was helpful but not critical in reaching the decision. 'The golf courses might have helped a bit as well,' Mr Ennis concedes. An initial investment of Pounds 20m - spent refurbishing a 500,000 sq ft factory, one of Scotland's biggest - has grown to Pounds 32m with a decision to install specialist plant to make electronic components for Honda's new Swindon car plant. From Cumbernauld, OKI supplies its entire European customer base with an expanding range of products. This customer base is now expanding following a decision to use Cumbernauld to service the US with some products. Rising Japanese manufacturing costs have prompted the company to switch to Cumbernauld the production of some dot matrix printers for export to the US. About 100,000 printers a year will be made and shipped from Scotland, instead of Japan, helping to safeguard local jobs and boost exports. It is a similar story at Yamazaki Machinery UK, the Worcester-based machine-tool manufacturing subsidiary of Japan's Yamazaki Mazak. Last year, it won a Queen's award for its overseas sales efforts. Yamazaki's UK operation has invested Pounds 40m at Worcester since arriving six years ago, making it Britain's biggest machine-tool maker. It sees itself as a European business serving mainly European markets: 85-90 per cent of output is sold outside the UK. The company employs 270 people and calculates that it indirectly supports a similar number of jobs among local suppliers. It was attracted to the cathedral town by availability of labour, a mature supply base and the English language. It also received help worth more than Pounds 5m from the DTI, then available to companies implementing flexible manufacturing systems. Yamazaki had no initial complaints about quality of materials, but unreliable deliveries were a problem. Now, partly thanks to Yamazaki publicising the plant suppliers' performances, 93 per cent of parts are supplied on time. Mr John Maund, deputy managing director, says efficiency levels are high and pay is in the 'medium rank' for manufacturing. Yamazaki stages an annual bonfire party on vacant land it owns alongside its Worcester plant. But the venue may eventually have to change: Mr Maund does not doubt future investment will fill the site.</p>

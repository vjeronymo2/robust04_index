			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS parliamentary correspondent Ivan Novikov] </F>   [Text] Moscow June 17 TASS -- The Council of the Russian  parliament lower house relegated a representation by Russian  Prosecutor-General Vladimir Ilyushenko on divesting Vladimir  Zhirinovskiy, leader of the Russian Liberal Democratic Party, of  a legislator's immunity to the house's credentials commission  for examination, Valentin Kovalev who chaired the chamber's  plenary meeting on Friday, said here.    It will be remembered that the acting prosecutor-general  claims in his representation that Zhirinovskiy's book "The Last  Leap to the South" is liable to criminal prosecution.    The report by Kovalev provoked a lively response from  legislators. For instance, Deputy Andrey Dorovskiy from the  LDPR group insisted that lawmakers should vote to return the  representation by Ilyushenko who, in the deputy's opinion, had  no powers to sign such a document, since he "was not approved as  prosecutor-general".    Another proposal -- to put the item on the representation on  the session's agenda -- did not pass either: The motion was  short of 20 votes.</p>

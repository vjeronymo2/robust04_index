			<p>920416 FT  16 APR 92 / International Company News: Upjohn results reflect lower Halcion sales UPJOHN, the Michigan-based pharmaceuticals company, yesterday posted first-quarter earnings growth of only 8 per cent in an industry where leaders regularly turn in earnings growth of around 20 per cent. Upjohn's slower growth reflects a 39 per cent drop in sales of the company's controversial Halcion sleeping pill. Before concerns about the drug's side-effects emerged, Halcion was the most popular sleeping pill in the world and Upjohn's second-biggest product, bringing in about 8 per cent of the company's sales and making an even stronger contribution to earnings. For the first three months of 1992, Upjohn had net income of Dollars 143.7m or 80 cents a share, against Dollars 133.3m or 73 cents a year earlier. Sales rose 9 per cent to Dollars 871.9m from Dollars 799.4m. During the latest quarter, pre-tax earnings advanced 4 per cent to Dollars 189m, while operating income was 3 per cent higher at Dollars 186m. Shares in the company rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 37 yesterday morning.</p>

			<p><P> July 3, 1990, Tuesday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> TRANSIENT DROWNS AFTER DRUG OVERDOSE  </P> <P> The body of an apparent drowning victim was found Monday in the Los Angeles  River south of White Oak Avenue and Victory Boulevard, police said.  </P> <P> The 21-year-old man, a transient whose identity was withheld pending  notification of his relatives, appeared to have drowned accidentally in the  five-inch deep, six-foot-wide wash that runs down the middle of the concrete  riverbed, said Detective Phil Quartararo.  </P> <P> The man was reportedly disoriented due to an overdose of sleeping pills he took  after being told he could no longer live in a nearby house where he had been  staying, Quartararo said. The overdose was not fatal in itself, but the man  staggered into the riverbed and collapsed face-down in the water, he said.  </P> <P> The body was spotted by passers-by from an overpass about 6 a.m. Monday, police  said.  </P></p>

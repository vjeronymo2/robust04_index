Assistant Secretary General of the OAS, Christopher R.  Thomas, said a major objective of the assembly "is to look at  ways of boosting and promoting development in the context of  consolidating democracy in the hemisphere".    Development, he added, "is at the core of the stability of  democracy and progress of most of the countries of the  hemisphere and so we must pay special attention to issues such  as critical poverty which threatens stability and democracy".    According to Thomas, the special general assembly will also  examine the mechanisms through which OAS technical assistance is  provided so as to make such assistance more effective.    He said the assembly will consider a recommendation that two  instruments within the OAS responsible for the provision of  technical assistance - the Inter-American Council for Economic  and Social Affairs and the Council for Education, Science and  Cultural Affairs - be merged into a single council for integral  development.    The establishment of a single council, he said, will provide  for better coordination and serve to make OAS technical  assistance more effective and efficient.    "I know there is some concern in the Caribbean that this new  development because of the emphasis it places on the  multilateral approach to providing technical assistance could  result in a reduction of such asssistance to our Caribbean  member-nations, but there is no tangible indication of this," he  said.    Mexico's permanent representative to the OAS, Ambassador  Alejandro Carrillo Castro, said the assembly was being convened  "so that we can focus on the issue of critical poverty and take  advantage of this new mechanism to ensure the best use for all  of us of the resources at our disposal."    Canada's permanent representative to the OAS, Brian Dickson,  chairs one of two sub-committees preparing for the special  general assembly.    He said in an interview that the establishment of a single  council for integral development within the OAS "will help to  alleviate problems such as duplicaton and  over-bureaucratization" which impede the effectiveness of  technical asssitance.    "The OAS has made, we think, some very important efforts to  reform and to adapt itself to the beginning of a new century and  to respond to the new challenges which are before us.    "We believe that the efforts it is making in the area of  technical assistance are very important in analyzing what the  OAS is doing now, how it could do things better and how it could  be more responsive to the needs of the hemisphere," Dixon said.</p>

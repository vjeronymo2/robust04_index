			<p><P> January 20, 1990, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: EASE THE MOVE FOR 4-YEAR-OLD  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: We deliberately postponed moving so it wouldn't interrupt  our 10-year-old's school year, but now we're amazed at how upset our 4-year-old  is. Since he didn't have much to interrupt in the way of friends or  commitments, we thought it would be relatively unimportant to him. He's become  very anxious and is suffering from nightmares. What are we doing wrong? -- D.P.  </P> <P> DEAR D.P.: Child psychologists point out that often when little children see  all the boxes being tied up ready to be sent away and possessions being packed  or thrown out, it makes them fear that this may also happen to them. It is  important to reassure your child that he's coming with you. Help him to look  forward to being part of the family in a new town and meeting new friends.  </P> <P> After you move, don't redecorate your child's room for a while, and arrange  furniture as it was before. Dr. Tiffany Field of the University of Miami  Medical School says that having the old furniture in place can be like a  security blanket.  </P> <P> Remember not to throw away all the old toys and books. Children need a sense of  continuity, and it's vital to be able to hang on to some objects that bring  comfort and solace.  </P> <P> DEAR DR. BROTHERS: When I was in my second year of college, I cheated on an  exam and was caught by the teacher and expelled. Eventually, I enrolled at  another school and got my degree, but I've never gotten over the feeling of  shame. It almost led me to suicide. My parents thought I was overreacting, even  though they were very angry at the time. I know lots of kids cheat, and I  wonder if my reaction is normal. -- W.F.  </P> <P> DEAR W.F.: Shame is a powerful emotion because it cuts through to one's basic  sense of self. Certainly, shame would be a normal feeling after what happened  to you.  </P> <P> Shame becomes dangerous when it starts to color one's most basic idea about  what one is or how worthy one is. You may need counseling to rid yourself of  this past error if you feel shame every time someone rebukes you and if,  despite beginning again and getting your degree, you still feel guilty and  worry that you're not to be trusted.  </P> <P> Feelings of shame are often at the root of what may seem like irrational rage,  according to some experts, and shame has been shown to play a key role in many  cases of family violence.  </P> <P> The best antidote to shame is to get it in enough perspective to be able to  laugh at it. After all, this is something that happened a long time ago. Talk  with someone about it. Don't keep it to yourself any longer. You've learned  from your mistakes and that is what's important now.  </P></p>

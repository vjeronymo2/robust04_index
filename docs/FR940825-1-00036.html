			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> HUD specifically requests comment from the public on the proration formulas set forth in &sect;&sect;200.188, 812.11, 905.310(s), and 912.11. HUD welcomes suggestions on alternative formulas and comments on the subject of proration of assistance, generally.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 12. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Additional provisions in the 1994 proposed rule (particularly those that differ from the 1988 proposed rule) are addressed in the discussion of public comments on the 1988 proposed rule set forth in section VII of this preamble.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Documents in Other Languages. One additional provision included in the 1994 proposed rule is a requirement that for any document or notice that the rule requires the responsible entity (housing authority, project owner, mortgagee) to provide an applicant or tenant or to obtain the signature of the applicant or tenant, the responsible entity, where feasible, is to provide such document in a language that is understood by the applicant or tenant if he or she is not proficient in English.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Nondiscrimination Requirements. The 1994 proposed rule includes a provision that restricts the responsible entity from administering the restrictions of section 214 in a manner which discriminates or treats persons differently because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or familial status, as prohibited by the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3601&hyph;3619), Title VI of the Civil Rights of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000d&hyph;2000d&hyph;5), and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794). Such unlawful actions include determinations of eligibility and ineligibility, using different requirements to ascertain that eligibility or ineligibility, and treating persons differently, if those actions are based on such factors as language, country of origin, or family associations.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> B. Organization of Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Because of the number of HUD programs covered by section 214, this proposed rule amends several program regulations in three chapters of HUD's regulations: 24 CFR Chapter II, Chapter VIII, and Chapter IX. Within these three chapters, conforming amendments are made to several parts, and four parts are substantially amended to address the restrictions of section 214. These parts are: parts 200, 812, 905, and 912. The regulations implementing section 214 in each of these four parts are divided into the following regulatory sections, and generally follow the order shown below. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=15 g=1 f=1 --> Sec.&blank;Definitions.

Response to Public Comments on 1988 Proposed Rule  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> This section of the preamble discusses the significant issues and questions raised by public comments received on the 1988 proposed rule. The discussion of public comments on the 1988 proposed rule is included in the preamble to the 1994 proposed rule to assist the public in understanding why certain provisions in the 1988 proposed rule were revised or not revised in the 1994 proposed rule.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> During the public comment period for the 1988 proposed rule, 20 comments were received. These represented the views of several housing authorities, two State departments of housing, project owners, an association of management agents, and an association of housing officials, legal services organizations, immigration law organizations, and an advocacy group for the elderly. Many comments made suggestions criticizing the restrictions for being too broad, the special relief for being too narrow, or the procedures for giving inadequate opportunity to applicants to demonstrate eligibility. However, other comments focused on the burden placed on the entity responsible for enforcing the restrictions and complained that the procedures were too complicated and costly.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In addition to the comments received during the comment period of the 1988 proposed rule, HUD held an informal meeting at HUD headquarters in February 1994 on the subject of the restrictions imposed by section 214. This meeting was attended by representatives of organizations that included, but were not limited to: The Farmers Home Administration, the Association of Farmworker Opportunity Programs, California Rural Legal Assistance, Inc., Chicanos for La Causa, New York Legal Aid Society, National Center for Youth Law, National Council of La Raza, National Housing Law Project, and the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund. These organizations submitted additional written comments at, and subsequent to, the meeting. These comments are part of the docket file for this rule, and are available for inspection by the public. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

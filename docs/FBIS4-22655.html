			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Interview with President of the Republic of Crimea Yuriy </F> Meshkov by Andrey Uglanov; place and date not given: "Where the  `Crimean Island' Is Floating. Yu. Meshkov: `Easy, Gentlemen,  Easy!'"]    [Text] "If you happen to have been born in the  Empire, it is best to live in a remote province on the sea."  These lines from the poem by I. Brodskiy can no longer (or for  now) apply to the residents of the Crimea. The former recreation  zone of the great empire has been transformed into a disputed  zone and, unexpectedly, with no prior indication, has acquired  its own constitution, parliament, and president. People are not  being shot here; things have become even quieter. But what will  happen tomorrow depends on too many factors and above all  whether Ukraine and Russia will continue to move further and  further away from one another.    Today we are speaking with the president of the  Republic of Crimea, Yuriy Meshkov. He was born in 1945. His  father is a Don Cossack, his mother--a Ukrainian, and his  wife--a Russian. He has a daughter 23 and a son 13. He served in  the border guards, graduated from the law department of Moscow  State University, and has worked as a sailor, an investigator,  and a lawyer.    [Uglanov] Yuriy Aleksandrovich, in Kiev they call you a  separatist. Does that offend you?    [Meshkov] The only people in Kiev who call me a separatist  are representatives of the Ukrainian Nationalist Party. (Their  influence is rated at 0.3 percent.) The rest of the residents  support our goals--solving crucial economic problems. If the  Ukrainian government were also interested in improving the life  of the people, it would never have proceeded toward isolation  from Russia. From an economic standpoint that was suicide. But  the government came to power relying on nationalistic  structures, and now the sad result of the ill-considered  economic policy of the Ukrainian leaders is so apparent that one  might say that the question of its fate has already been decided.    Unfortunately the government of Ukraine is still not  accepting the changes in the consciousness of the people of  Ukraine. Especially in the left-bank, eastern part of the  country where nationalism has always been something alien to the  people.    [Uglanov] Your sharp statements are evoking a fairly painful  reaction from Kiev. Are you not afraid that they will arrest you?    [Meshkov] Since the time when I was serving on the border I  have stopped fearing anything in this world except for the loss  of my loved ones. Everything else is unessential when there is a  grand purpose for which it is worthwhile to do something  personal. This is not the ranting of a fanatic. This is about  our republic's freedom.    [Uglanov] Can you imagine the Crimea as a zone of military  operations?    [Meshkov] No. There are no forces inside the Crimea capable  of provoking a conflict and there are no preconditions for one.  And we have an aversion to anything that detracts from solving  crucial problems. And in general Crimeans are preparing for the  beginning of the vacation season.    [Uglanov] Not everything depends on you alone. What  political  changes, in your view, must take place in Kiev in order for the  Crimea not to become a "hot spot"?    [Meshkov] Reasonable people must come to power. But now the  people in power are accomplished politicians, virtuosos. While  professing one ideology, they rely on forces which they  previously destroyed, although they helped them to get in power.  There has probably never been more of this in world history. You  cannot deny that these politicians have intelligence,  trickiness, and treachery.    Today we must have people in power who reflect the objective  interests of the citizens and the economy of Ukraine. We will  have no problems with them. It is clear that both before and  after 1954 the people of the Crimea remained a part of the  people of Russia. You can write whatever you want to on the map  of the Crimea and depict it with any symbols, and you can even  stamp it with a trident--but that will change nothing in our  consciousness!    [Uglanov] How do you envision the future of Ukraine?    [Meshkov] Reasonable people have one path. Either all of  Ukraine will follow the path of the Crimea or they will be  doomed to even greater troubles than they have now. As they say  here, they are "sick of everything"--the orgy of nationalism and  the waving of flags and tridents. This is no longer accepted.    [Uglanov] Whom would you like to see in the post of  president  of Ukraine; whom would it be easiest for you to talk to?    [Meshkov] In general I find it easiest to speak with the  leaders of Russia.    [Uglanov] As president of the Crimea are you counting on  support from the Black Sea Fleet in the event of a critical  situation?    [Meshkov] I such situations an immense number of people  gather in front of your building. And this is taken into account  in Kiev.    [Uglanov] You just reacted very sharply to the appointment  from Kiev of a Crimean deputy. But in all Russian oblasts there  are representatives of the president of the Russian Federation,  and nothing is said.    [Meshkov] In the oblasts, but not in the republics.  Tatarstan, for example, has its own president and an agreement  has been concluded with Russia for division of authority. But  what is happening here? When there is a nationally elected  president, suddenly there appears an individual authorized to  oversee his actions and "represent the Republic of Crimea at the  international level"(!) That is going too far.    [Uglanov] I see that you have portraits hanging in your  office...    [Meshkov] Yes, that is Peter the First and Count Vorontsov.    [Uglanov] Well, that is probably enough about politics. As  the chief of the executive power, answer a good old question:  How is the planting going? Or is there no time for it what with  all the rallies?    [Meshkov] I must answer joyfully. The planting has been more  than successful. There was a difficult situation with fuel,  equipment, and seeds. They rushed around the fields trying to  solve these problems. Now I am calm: The problem of the harvest  was solved in the stage of planting.    [Uglanov] But there is a fuel shortage in Ukraine.    [Meshkov] This is true. But we have no problems with fuel,  and its price has dropped by almost half. Measures of an  economic nature have been taken. So people may come to the  Crimea with their own vehicles--there will be no problem  refueling. If, of course, they manage to get across Ukraine.    [Uglanov] And what about food products?    [Meshkov] Help yourself--we have it all: to drink and to  eat.  Incidentally, we are negotiating with the Russian Ministry of  Railways to reduce summer fares and railroad tickets. So if you  buy a ticket and put down enough rubles to meet Russian  standards, your capital will increase 20-fold here and your  level of vacation will be tops. Unfortunately, there might be  only one peaceful place for Russians to rest--the Crimea.  Normal, Russian, homey. With doors open wide, the Crimeans  receive vacationers with any kind of purses.    [Uglanov] Is Foros also open to guests?    [Meshkov] M.S. Gorbachev's dacha is being protected (for no  good reason) by L. Kravchuk's personal guard. We will do  everything we can to open up this historic place.    [Uglanov] They say you are experiencing friction with Prime  Minister Ye. Saburov.    [Meshkov] Yes, everything is normal. That is one of the  tasks  of the special services--to create an uneasy situation. At  certain stages they are successful. But on the whole we are  working together.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:CSO   <F P=106> [Article: "Cisi Regroups Its Subsidiaries"] </F>   [Text] SSII, a subsidiary of CEA-Industries and Cap Gemini  Sogeti, is supposed to finalize its reorganization by this 20  January. According to a company spokesperson, Cisi is getting  rid of a structure defined on the basis of tasks and is  preparing to restructure its organization on the basis of its  customers' market sectors. As a result, Cisi Ingenierie, Cisi  Transtec and Cisi Telematique (excluding the part that is being  reattached to Athesa France, Cisi's and Bull's joint subsidiary  in facilities management) are going to merge into a single  company. That will depend on Cisi SA, the financial holding  company that is supposed to head up the group's overseas  subsidiaries, as well as Athesa France. This restructuring is  supposed to impart dynamism to Cisi activity (FF70 million in  losses in 1992 on a turnover of FF1.5 billion) and accelerate  structural savings. Shuffling the workforce at Rungis is also on  the agenda.</p>

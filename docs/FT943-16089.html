			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Personal View: Three cheers for a weak dollar The trade-weighted dollar has fallen about 5 per cent since April, but this must be seen in perspective. The dollar had previously been trending upwards and, even after the recent fall, it is still 3 per cent above its 1992 average. President Bill Clinton is 'puzzled' by the weak dollar at a time when the US economy is so 'strong', and markets around the world are jittery because they fear that the Federal Reserve is going to put up interest rates again. But are the US authorities right to resist the dollar slide, such as it is? As it happens, Clinton's 'strong' economy has been heading for the rocks, even if these are still on the horizon. In the first quarter of 1994, the current balance of payments was 2 per cent of gross domestic product in deficit, having deteriorated fast through 1993. Import penetration of the US, still relatively low by international standards, has for years been growing much faster than penetration of foreign markets by US exports. We calculate that, other things (including exchange rates) being equal, world output has to rise at least 1.5 times as fast as US output for the US balance of trade to remain a constant share of GDP. For many years this is what happened, as productivity in other countries rose towards US levels. But, since the mid-1980s, growth in the rest of the world has been only a little faster than US growth, so the underlying US trade deficit has deteriorated in a secular fashion. As a result, US foreign indebtedness has begun to build up in an unsustainable way. In the last 20 years the US has become the world's debtor, and by the end of 1993 had net foreign liabilities worth about 12 per cent of GDP. For a long time the loss of overseas wealth did not obviously matter because, with recorded profits on foreign direct investment in the US so low, the total net flow of property income across the exchanges remained positive. But the tide has just turned. During the last few quarters, the income flow has become negative and, if the US trade deficit (including transfers) were to be a steady 2 1/4 per of GDP in deficit, the outflow would build up quite rapidly from now on. The US current account deficit as a whole would rise to nearly 4 per cent of GDP in 10 years and net foreign debt would approach 40 per cent of GDP - the proportion that normally relegates countries to the ignominious 'highly indebted' category. Matters would be far worse if interest rates rose further or if the balance of trade deteriorated even more. Things could never really get that bad. Long before the US deficit and foreign debt rose to such levels, corrective forces would come into play. The danger is that the correction, when it came, would take the form of demand disinflation, as it always has with debtor countries in the past. If this were to happen, a new twist would be given to the recessionary screw, with endemic unemployment, not just in the US but in the rest of the world as well, ratcheted up several more notches. A devaluation of the dollar now, before things get out of hand, seems to be just what is needed. The effects on the US economy of changes in the exchange rate are far less costly than in the textbook story - less costly, too, than in the UK experience. Dollar devaluations only seem to have a very small effect on US import prices, real wages and the terms of trade, and as imports of goods and services are still only 11 to 12 per cent of GDP, the direct effect of a (say) 10 per cent devaluation on US price levels is a mere quarter of 1 per cent. On the other hand, the fact that the dollar price of exports is unresponsive to devaluation means that the price of exports denominated in foreign currency falls a lot when devaluation occurs, causing the trade balance to improve in a very lively way. A fall in the dollar, even if this goes considerably further than it has already, should therefore be positively welcomed by the US authorities, and by the rest of the world as well. It offers some hope that a significant part of the US chronic payments imbalance, which poses a grave long-term threat to activity and employment throughout the world, will be ameliorated in a timely fashion. If the US authorities succeed now in supporting the dollar, they will only make the underlying problem worse. If they raise interest rates further in the process, the error will be compounded because the outflow of interest payments on its foreign debt will build up faster, bringing forward the day of reckoning.

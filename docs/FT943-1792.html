			<p>940922 FT  22 SEP 94 / US bankers step up their challenge to City's local heroes: Nicholas Denton assesses the battle for M&amp;A clients CS First Boston has broken new ground for US investment banks by acting as sole adviser to Browning-Ferris Industries on its Pounds 364m hostile bid for UK waste company Attwoods. BFI, itself a US company, may be a longstanding international client but CSFB's role is an unusual one. UK merchant banks, like their counterparts elsewhere, have tended to dominate public deals in their home market. The Attwoods takeover battle is one of the first, and certainly the largest on which a US investment bank has been lead adviser to an aggressor in the UK. 'You no longer need a City firm like Warburgs or Schroders to go hostile,' said one international mergers and acquisitions investment banker. The large 'bulge bracket' US firms have already moved to the top of the league tables for cross-border mergers and acquisitions in Europe. Morgan Stanley acted as financial adviser on 13 deals worth a total of Pounds 4.95bn in the first half of this year, according to the magazine Acquisitions Monthly. The figures were for a short period and influenced by one particularly large deal but Morgan Stanley topped the table with Goldman Sachs, another US firm, placed a close second. But US firms now claim they are encroaching not just in the pan-European market, but also on the home territory of their local competitors. 'I feel that we have already met the cross-border challenge,' says Mr John Studzinski, head of European M&amp;A for Morgan Stanley. 'Now we are competing head-to-head domestically too.' Morgan Stanley points to its mandate on a purely UK transaction, advising the UK-based international marketing group Inchcape in its bid for insurance broker Hogg Group earlier this year, as a landmark deal. Goldman Sachs has been established in London since 1980 and as far back as 1987 advised British Caledonian on its sale to British Airways. But it too has made recent advances. Goldman this year won the mandate to be exclusive adviser to the National Grid Company in direct competition with UK banks. A spokesman said it had completed three deals worth more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 600m) each this year where the transaction was 'UK oriented' and the firm's position compared 'more than favourably' with any of its UK competitors. Large US firms have also pioneered many techniques of modern investment banking, from valuation models to having specialised groups of advisers for particular industries. This advantage has been eroded as UK firms have adopted similar techniques. US firms with a long presence in London appear to be gaining the confidence of the market. One rival concedes: 'Goldman Sachs are part of the furniture now.' Hiring of UK bankers has also helped US firms. A BFI executive at CSFB's offices for the takeover bid said: 'Looking around they seem to have a lot of British.' One natural advantage of UK firms is a history of contacts with UK institutional investors that can make or break a share issue. However, the US firms claim to have caught up. 'Our access to UK investors is as good as anyone's,' says Mr Steven Berger, head of European investment banking for Lehman Brothers. Some UK firms accept that the US banks are making advances, but claim not to be worried. 'This has been going on for a long time,' says the head of one merchant bank. 'We work alongside US firms and get on fine.' Even CSFB says the Attwoods bid is not a revolution, as it looks at all advisory work in an international context. Other UK firms say that US banks are making exaggerated claims. 'The list is actually pretty thin,' says an investment banker at a UK firm. Indeed, only one US firm - Goldman - figures in the top 10 M&amp;A advisers on purely UK deals announced in the first half of 1994. The British critics point to some reverses. Goldman conducted its first initial public offering (IPO) for a UK company when it helped float the Nottingham Group earlier this year. The company's share price slipped well below the issue price when trading began. US firms' advisory work in the UK market is also criticised by rivals. One UK firm quoted an example of when it had to step in and bail out a bidder which had relied exclusively on a US investment bank's advice. Yet US investment bankers are still convinced that UK banks are giving ground, but through 'erosion' of market share rather than a dramatic breakthrough. This could spur larger UK firms to expand in other European countries. A Schroders executive points out that it has more domestic business in Italy than any US firm.</p>

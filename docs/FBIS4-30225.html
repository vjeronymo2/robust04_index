			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 24 KYODO -- Market intervention alone  will not help the yen to stop its uptrend against the dollar,  Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi Mieno said Friday [24 June],  while repeating concerns over the yen's rise on the recovering  economy.    "How to guide the economic fundamentals is the most  important," Mieno said, citing the huge trade surplus as the key  factor for Japan in hinting why the Group of Seven major nations  are not taking joint moves as it did in may.    In making a speech and answering questions at the National  Press Club, Mieno said Japan's huge current account surplus  "often" surfaces as a major factor behind the yen's rise, and  measures to correct this is "the most important."    His comments came after the dollar plunged in New York  Tuesday to hit a new global low of 99.85-95 yen. It is now  moving nervously around 101 yen with dealers saying that the  market is testing an accord among Group of Seven (G-7) major  nations to act jointly to stem excess currency volatility.    But unlike the joint G-7 intervention taken in May when the  dollar tumbled near to fall below 100 yen, they said the Bank of  Japan has acted alone to defend the dollar's fall against the  yen.    In a disappointing U.S. move for market participants, U.S.  Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued a statement Wednesday,  only saying, "we continue to be in close communication with our  G-7 partners, and we continue to be prepared to act as  appropriate."    Mieno also said he is watching currency movements with  great concern and will take "appropriate and timely actions in  close contact with other G-7 nations."    The central bank chief reiterated that the yen's rise is  one of the key risk factors for the recovering economy, and  noted that the stronger yen first brings "near-term demerits" on  exports although there are benefits on import prices in the  longer run.    The yen's rise makes Japanese products expensive overseas  and foreign goods cheaper in Japan.    On the economy, Mieno said in his speech it has "moved one  step" forward, and in answer to questions, that it is "steadily  moving" toward a recovery.    The recent improvements are supported by a background that  is different from that prevailing at the same time last year,  when the economy fell back toward the summer after showing signs  of recovery, he said.    Mieno cited recovering corporate earnings, progress in  restructuring efforts, and improving economies abroad as the  main differences with last year.    Considering risks aside from the yen's rise, Mieno pointed  out still-tough conditions of corporate capital investment and  labor, and said more time is needed for adjustments.    He also expressed concern over emerging competition from  other asian nations and former communist countries, deriving  from the yen's rise and favorable conditions in the  labor-intensive field.    Against this backdrop, Mieno said that macroeconomic  measures should continue to serve as a "cushion" against  still-tough conditions, primarily by supporting personal and  corporate spending.    On long-term interest rates, the central bank chief said  the recent rises reflect market sentiment about the economy, but  market players should take more carefully into consideration  "both good and bad indicators" yet expected to appear.    Long-term rates should settle at levels reflecting the  state of the economy, he said.</p>

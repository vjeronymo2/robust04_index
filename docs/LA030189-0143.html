			<p><P> March 1, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> CANADA FIRM TO BUY U.S. MONTHLY  </P> <P> Telemedia Inc., Canada's largest publisher of consumer magazines, said today it  has reached a tentative agreement to buy New England Monthly, a 5-year-old  regional magazine that has been struggling toward profitability.  </P> <P> Terms of the sale were not disclosed pending ratification of the agreement by  the magazine's 59 shareholders. Both Robert Nylen, 44, the magazine's  publisher, and Editor Daniel Okrent, 40, will continue in their jobs.  </P> <P> Despite winning national awards for journalism and tripling its circulation to  more than 116,000, New England Monthly's costs continue to exceed its revenues,  Nylen said.  </P> <P> A literate, breezy, often irreverent publication, New England Monthly  frequently profiles small companies or craftsmen and devotes one issue a year  to "local heroes." But it has been harshly critical of some of New England's  most powerful institutions and individuals.  </P></p>

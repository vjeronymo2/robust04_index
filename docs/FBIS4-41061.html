			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Petr Karapetyan: "Federation Council Gives </F> Go-ahead to Introduction of Peacekeeping Forces into Abkhazia"]    [Text] At a closed session on 21 June Federation Council  deputies discussed President Boris Yeltsin's edict on the  introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces into the  Georgian-Abkhazian conflict zone.    Let me remind you that the previous session was just one  vote  short of the number needed to ratify the edict. But this time,  after hearing a report from Army General Pavel Grachev, the  Russian defense minister and the president's representative at  the session, the deputies voted by a majority for the  introduction of Russian peacekeeping forces (with seven votes  against and seven abstentions).    Answering journalists' questions, Army Gen Pavel Grachev  expressed satisfaction at the Federation Council's decision but  stated that the troops will not go into the conflict zone "at  breakneck speed." Around 3,000 men will be transferred to the  deployment area only after the locality has been cleared of  mines. According to Army Gen. Pavel Grachev's estimates, it  will take three to five days to occupy the bridges and carry out  engineering operations. The first to be moved up will be two  battalions from the 145th Motorized Rifle Division (Batumi) and  one parachute regiment from the 345th Airborne Troops (Gudauta).  As soon as these three battalions "take control of the sector"  a further two reinforced motorized rifle battalions will be  flown in. Control centers have already been prepared,  communications have been organized, and all the material and  technical support is in place for the peacekeeping action for  which, as Army Gen Pavel Grachev announced, "we have requested  10-11 billion rubles before the end of the year." One is bound  to recall here that the federal budget has not been approved  yet....    At the last moment the question of the federal budget was  deleted from the Federal Council session agenda. When one of  the deputies asked for the budget to be "heard" on 23 June  anyway, Vladimir Shumeyko stated that this was impossible for  purely formal reasons: The State Duma has not officially  presented the draft law on the federal budget for the Federation  Council's approval. In so saying he noted that, when the Duma  adopted it on second reading, it did not take into account the  Federation Council's 252 amendments to the budget and the budget  was adopted by a "political consensus."    After declaring that the budget is an especially political  document, Vladimir Shumeyko made the following comment: "There  is a version to satisfy everyone." At the same time he implied  that if the Duma delayed in handing on the draft budget law to  the upper chamber of the Federal Assembly, the Federation  Council would not have time to discuss it, "and then everyone  will begin saying that the budget has not been adopted because  of the Federation Council's arrogance. I must ask the Duma to  speed up the adoption of a decision. At the very least it must  be ready to adopt a good law for the government, where spending  will be decided."    Nevertheless, on the evening of 21 June and not without  pressure from the pickets (around 100 placard-wielding  representatives of defense sector enterprises had gathered by  the entrance to the building),the Federation Council deputies  did discuss the problems of the military-industrial complex and  the draft federal budget and did adopt a request to the State  Duma to submit the draft in good time.</p>

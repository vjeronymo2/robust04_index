			<p>BFN     [Text] According to reports from Seoul, U.S. Defense  Secretary Perry made a junket [haenggak] to South Korea from 19  to 21 April.    Perry's junket to South Korea was a junket of war to  examine,  on the spot, how their plan of a war of Northward aggression had  been carried out and give new instructions to the puppets.    During the junket, Perry met with traitor Kim Yong-sam,  puppet Defense Minister Yi Pyong-tae, and puppet Foreign  Minister Han Sung-chu respectively, held one military confab  [kunsajok moui] after another, mapped out vicious plans  [hyunggye] to resume the Team Spirit joint military exercise  before the end of this year, build up the U.S.-South Korea  combined forces, strengthen the cooperation system, and pursue  the UN Security Council sanctions [jeje] against the North.  This is an unforgivable criminal act to bring the situation on  the Korean peninsula to a crisis phase and cause a very  dangerous situation.</p>

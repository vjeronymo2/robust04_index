			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Vladimir Gondusov and Mikhail </F> Shevtsov]    [Text] Moscow, 6 May (ITAR-TASS) -- Russian Federation  Defense Minister Army General Pavel Grachev plans to outline  Russia's new approaches to the "Partnership for Peace" program  in Brussels on 24 May. He stated this at a news conference at  the Russian Defense Ministry today.    In his words, Russia should put out its own idea of  partnership. Before 15 May a group of Russian scientists should  draw up proposals on this issue, they will be then examined at a  meeting of the Security Council. If they are approved, the  Russian proposals will be announced to NATO defense ministers by  Pavel Grachev at the NATO headquarters.    The minister said that what is proposed in the "Partnership  for Peace" program does not entirely suit Russia. "The role of  NATO and the West European Union is increasing, but they do not  have the right to substitute the peacekeeping functions of the  CSCE and ignore Russia's interests," Pavel Grachev believes.    Pavel Grachev also said that he discussed issues relating to  Russia's new proposals to the "Partnership for Peace" program  with Russian President Boris Yeltsin.</p>

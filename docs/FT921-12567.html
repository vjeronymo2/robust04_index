			<p>920125 FT  25 JAN 92 / Wine: Full-bodied winter warmers - Sherries worth the attention of great wines THE BEST moderately-priced aperitif in summer must surely be fino or manzanilla sherry; but, in the six or seven colder months of the year, there is a strong case for fuller-bodied, rich (yet, for the most part, still dry) sherries: amontillados, olorosos and that comparative rarity, palo cortado. They have a concentration and depth of flavour that is warming and comforting in chilly weather and also can be more interesting drinks than the attractive, light, dry sherries that refresh but do not enrich the palate. More alcoholic, they have powerful aromas and flavours. They confirm the traditional British preference for full-bodied sherry although, apart from a few special wines, they are not sweet as were most in Victorian times. The 60,000 bottles from the Royal cellars (in Buckingham Palace, Marlborough House, Windsor Castle and Sandringham) that had been accumulating since 1863, and which King Edward VII had auctioned at Christie's on his succession, were mostly 'golden.' To a public accustomed to consider sherry as sweet (only a maximum of 15 per cent of sherry produced is fino or manzanilla), it is a surprise to learn that, if sweetened later, all sherry is fermented-out completely (with the sugar converted into alcohol) and is, therefore, dry. An element of glycerine might give a smooth, slightly sweet nuance to an amontillado or oloroso. It used to be considered a mystery as to whether the young sherry in a cask turned out to be a fino or an oloroso, but modern techniques generally can ensure the result desired. Moreover, certain vineyards in the Jerez area are noted for one or other: for example, Macharnudo for fino and Carascal for oloroso. The finos produce flor: a rather unpleasant-looking thick scum that protects the sherry from oxidation. But oloroso either has none or very little; what there might be is killed promptly by fortification with brandy mixed with must. Whereas finos increasingly are fortified as little as possible, up to only 15.5 degrees, amontillados and olorosos will be upwards from 19 degrees to 21.5 and even higher for very old sherries in which the percentages of water have diminished. But these are not sold commercially. The solera system - which ensures that wines move through a series of 'scales' over the years until they reach the solera from which the finished wine is drawn - means it is not possible to give an age for a sherry. The average for finos is six years and true amontillados (finos allowed to develop in cask) will have been aged for at least eight years and should be nearer 12. Fine olorosos are older, and special blends from very old soleras may be from 20 to 40 years in age. These finer types of sherry are not represented very well in the lists of some of the more distinguished independent wine merchants in the UK. This might demonstrate a lack of experience or interest among their customers; but with lists to hand, they are given when available. Amontillados, noted for their nutty bouquet and flavour, are lighter and generally less alcoholic than olorosos. Their fino origin makes them less concentrated, although they are very smooth and provide easy drinking. However, those from an old solera which seldom is drawn off are very different. A delicious example is Gonzalez Byass's Amontillado dell Duque Seco y My Viejo (Peatling, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Pounds 15.49) a rich, concentrated wine with a slightly-smoky nose. A small glass of one of these old amontillados and olorosos goes a long way. Less concentrated but with a distinguished flavour is Valdespino's Amontillado Tio Diego (Wine Society, Stevenage, Herts, Pounds 7.85). Corney &amp; Barrow, London EC3, has a special blend of Garvey's Old Dry Amontillado with a clean, dry finish (Pounds 9.99); and Philip Eyres, Coleshill, Amersham, Bucks, lists an Amontillado de Jerez (Pounds 10.76) from the high-quality firm of Lustau. Although all of these are exceptional wines, my favourite for winter drinking is old, dry oloroso. It has a delicious bouquet, a warming flavour and a long finish that can contain a hint of sweetness but is not heavy. Adnams, of Southwold, Suffolk, lists Hidalgo's Oloroso Seco (Pounds 6.86); Harveys of Bristol produces Adorno, a fine old oloroso bottled in 1974 (Pounds 9.50); Peatling has Apostoles Oloroso Abocado (Pounds 15.49), a wine of great depth with a hint of sweetness; and the Wine Society has the distinctive Valdespino Viejo Oloroso (Pounds 6.75). Quite different is the old, sweet oloroso of Gonzales Byass listed by Peatling: Matusalem Oloroso Muy Viejo (Pounds 15.49, also listed by Adnams). This is more for dessert or between-meals drinking unless you share the French sweet taste for aperitifs. A very rare wine is the 70-year-old Solera Oloroso Extra of Blazques (Adnams, Pounds 26.25) and the Wine Society's 30-year-old, very sweet Carascal Viejo Oloroso Dulce (Pounds 7.75). Palo cortado is a very concentrated dry wine, often claimed to have the bouquet of an amontillado and the flavour and body of an oloroso although more delicate. It breeds no flor and is said to have been common before phylloxera destroyed the Jerez vineyards at the end of the last century. Then, it became a rarity found in only one in every 3,000 casks. Today, though, palo cortado obviously occurs much more often as it can be found on supermarket shelves. A wine labelled palo cortado that is clearly sweet is not a true one, but Valdespino's Palo Cortado (Wine Society Pounds 5.75) has a touch of the rich, raisiny Pedro Ximenez sherry used in cream sherries. Adnams lists Hidalgo's Jerez Cortado (Pounds 7.35) and the superior Dos Cortados from Rosario Farfante (Pounds 9.60). Averys of Bristol has a Lustau Palo Cortado (Pounds 7.39) while Lay &amp; Wheeler also sells Hidalgo's Jerez Cortado (Pounds 8.30). Finally, from one of the specialist wholesalers, Almacenistas, comes Lustau's Palo Cortado Cayetino del Pino (Wine Society, Pounds 5.75 a half-bottle). All these three types of sherry are to be savoured slowly rather than tossed off, and are worth the attention given to great wines.</p>

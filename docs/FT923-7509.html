			<p>920818 FT  18 AUG 92 / More Chinese students pay ONE IN every seven students enrolling in Chinese universities at the start of the new academic year next month will pay for the privilege, writes Yvonne Preston from Beijing. The 100,000 new fee-paying students is the highest number in the 40 years since China's universities were nationalised and tuition fees abolished. Fees are 2,000 yuan (Pounds 190) a year. Students who pay their own way must find their own jobs on graduation. Free education is for students passing the highly competitive university entrance exams who are mostly assigned jobs at the end of their courses. Even they pay fees of around Pounds 19 a year. The State Education Commission said growth in the number of fee-paying students was a natural outcome of the reform drive of Deng Xiaoping.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by C.G.: "Kohl and Yeltsin Intend To Present </F> German-Russian Normalcy"]    [Text] Bonn, 10 May -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin,  accompanied by Foreign Minister Andrey Kozyrev, Economics  Minister Aleksandr Shokhin, and Defense Minister Pavel Grachev,  is scheduled to arrive in Bonn this Wednesday [11 May]. In  addition to the cultivation of German-Russian relations, the  visit is intended to demonstrate Russia's importance within the  network of European relations. The Federal Government also has  an interest in strengthening Russia's self-confidence by  including it in agreements and preventing the emergence of  distrust that could turn into aggressiveness. Yeltsin will hold  talks with President Richard von Weizsaecker and Chancellor  Helmut Kohl; on 13 May, he will meet with business and industry  representatives. Yeltsin will visit telecommunications and  high-tech companies in Baden-Wuerttemberg. German industrialists  would have preferred a round of talks to discuss their wish for  a reduction of investment barriers in Russia. Yeltsin's schedule  apparently did not allow such a program.    The German economic sector deplores discriminating tax laws  and legal insecurity in Russia. Kohl's proposal that Western  firms repair the leaks in Russian oil and gas pipelines could  not be implemented, nor have the Russian nuclear power plants  been made safe. The seven major industrial nations (G7) and the  European Union (EU) programs to this end are making hardly any  progress because Moscow insists that Russian nuclear power  plants are safer than those in the West. During Yeltsin's  visit, the Federal Republic will reportedly not make any new  financial pledges, since the current scope for Hermes [credit  insurance company] credits has not been fully exhausted.  However, the Federal Government will confirm that it will  continue to support the course of reform. The government  believes that even though Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin is  pursuing reform more slowly, "it is more important that the  basic course be continued." Bonn does not doubt that the  Chernomyrdin government is serious about carrying out reform.  The Moscow chief of government had sent many foreign advisers  home and asked Western governments to appoint more serious and  more experienced experts.    This time, no "joint statement" will be signed in Bonn, no  agreements will be concluded, and the course of the visit is to  present normalcy. The aim of the visit has been defined in Bonn  as "psychological." It has been noted increasingly in recent  months that Russia has the impression that it is not being taken  seriously as a great power and a nuclear power. As U.S.  President Bill Clinton did in Moscow in January, Kohl will now  stress to Yeltsin that Moscow is being treated as an equal  partner, and Germany is supporting the integration of Russia  into European institutions. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel (Free  Democratic Party -- FDP) will make clear to Andrey Kozyrev that  "Russia belongs to us, and we want Russia to become integrated."    According to Kinkel, the fact should be considered that  following the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, Russia is feeling  like a "solitary state" without any allies.    In the Bonn talks, Kohl, Kinkel, and Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe (Christian Democratic Union -- CDU) will advocate NATO's  offer of "Partnership for Peace." According to the Chancellor's  Office, Russia's role as a great power cannot be ignored in this  respect. Regarding Moscow's statements that the "Partnership for  Peace" should be replaced by a special relationship with NATO,  as Russia has in mind, the Federal Government wants to find out  "what and how Russia will sign." What type of special role  Moscow has in mind has not been fully discussed. According to  government officials, a separate relationship between Russia and  the United States, Great Britain, France, and Germany, which  some Russian politicians are seeking, is out of the question and  is at best useful only in certain situations. NATO as a whole  and Moscow should define their mutual relationship, because  otherwise, the smaller alliance and EU members would be  offended. Germany considers the request that NATO consult  Russia before making any alliance decision unacceptable, because  this would be tantamount to an indirect Russian right of veto.  Bonn differentiates between the offer of a "Partnership for  Peace" including a voluntary right of consultation on a  case-by-case basis and the more far-reaching Russian demand. In  his talks with Yeltsin, Kohl will argue that Clinton, too,  recommends the application of NATO's partnership concept to  Russia. Like Kohl, Kinkel is considering the option of taking  Russia's importance into account in this respect. In addition  to the "Partnership for Peace" framework agreement that would be  equal for all partners, the second part of the agreement, which  will be formulated "individually" for every country, could  contain modalities that would be tailored to Russia. Officials  in Bonn believe that the signing of a partnership agreement with  Russia could be made more attractive by accompanying it with a  statement. They mention as an example of higher etiquette, a  signing ceremony in the presence of the NATO Council and an  address by its chairman. Bonn rules out Russia's NATO  membership and its accession to the EU: "Then we might as well  pack up."    Bonn assesses Russia's troop withdrawal agreement with  Latvia as a favorable start. Bonn will presumably call upon  Moscow to observe European rules in dealing with southern  neighbors like Georgia. Kohl and Kinkel will express their wish  for an early conclusion of a cooperation agreement between the  EU and Moscow, and recommend to Moscow that it guarantee working  alternatives for Western banks. The negotiations, including  those on nonmilitary nuclear deals, are making slow progress.  Bonn advocates preparatory talks this summer on the admittance  of Russia to the Council of Europe.    The Federal Government does not consider feasible a joint  farewell ceremony in Berlin for the Russian, U.S., British, and  French troops in the presence of all chiefs of state and heads  of government. Since Russian Supreme Commander Burlakov in  eastern Germany has objected to the idea suggested by Kohl and  Yeltsin that the influence of German classics on Russian  literature of the 19th century should be mentioned in Weimar,  and cultural ties for the future should be stressed, the  compromise now will probably be that Yeltsin and Kohl will speak  at a wreath-laying ceremony at the former Soviet memorial in  Berlin-Treptow and at a subsequent meeting in the Russian  Embassy in Berlin. If Yeltsin rejects Weimar, the ceremonies  could be concentrated into half a day in Berlin; according to  Bonn, the military presence should then be confined to a  Bundeswehr detachment, a Russian guard of honor, and a Russian  military band at the Treptow memorial. A week later, U.S. Vice  President Al Gore, President Francois Mitterrand, and Prime  Minister Major will seal the withdrawal of the protective powers  in Berlin. Agreements in the wake of the Two-Plus-Four  negotiations envision the Russian troop withdrawal from Germany  by the end of 1995 -- which was advanced to the end of August  1994 during Kohl's visit to Moscow in 1992 -- and the withdrawal  of the Western contingents from Berlin at a later date, so that  Bonn also considers a separate farewell justified for this  reason as well. Bonn officials are annoyed with Burlakov, who  with his criticism of Bonn's plans, and possibly with the  protection of Grachev, is apparently trying -- so they say -- to  nail Yeltsin down.    The talks on setting up a German consulate-general in  Koenigsberg (Kaliningrad) will be difficult. When Kinkel was in  Moscow in March, the Russian government was no longer ready to  talk about the planned setting up of a German mission and said  that this was a matter that had to be decided by the chiefs,  Yeltsin and Kohl. Moscow hinted in March that Koenigsberg was a  touchy issue. The Russian Security Council also put Koenigsberg  on its agenda, in addition to the "Partnership for Peace." The  return of German art objects, which is envisioned in the  cultural agreement, is also disputed.  <H5>  Russia Needs a Special Role </H5>   CDU foreign policy expert Karl-Heinz Hornhues has advocated  a  contractual special relationship between Russia and NATO.  Hornhues, who is deputy floor leader of the Christian  Democratic Union/Christian Social Union in the Bundestag, said  in Bonn on 10 May that Russia was having problems with NATO's  "Partnership for Peace" program, because, unlike the other  Central and East European countries, Moscow was "independent" in  foreign and defense policy terms and could look after its  security on its own. However, the Soviet Union's former  alliance partners had joined the "Partnership for Peace" to  increase their security in cooperation with NATO. In addition,  Russia maintained "political order" in East European and Central  Asia, which was not welcomed but tolerated by the West, because  the NATO states themselves were not prepared to make available  to the United Nations or the CSCE peace troops for missions in  Central Asia or the Caucasus. Hornhues said: "Without Russia,  there would be no prospects for a just peace in the nationality  conflicts between Armenians and Azerbaijanis, in Georgia or  Tajikistan." Moscow's claim for a special relationship with the  European Union and NATO was based on Russia's "security policy  independence and its role as a power maintaining order."  Hornhues said, however, that by speaking about "safeguarding  Russian interests in nearby countries" and by stating big power  claims, Russia also created the suspicion of pursuing  neoimperialist goals. Nonetheless, the states of the Western  alliance should think about "whether they should not offer  Russia a special system of relations and treaties with NATO soon  that clearly go beyond the Partnership for Peace." According to  Hornhues, the preparedness to do so depends in particular on the  United States, which "long ago developed a means of cooperation  common between alliance partners" on problems of  intercontinental and nuclear security. Hornhues said: "A  special treaty relationship between Russia and NATO would not  only diminish Russian reservations against membership of the  Central and East European countries in NATO; for the Central and  East European countries, too, closer Russian relations with NATO  would mean more security."</p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS believes that potential bacterial hazards are diminished as long as handling accords with good manufacturing practices. FSIS is, therefore, considering that processing and storage requirements are warranted for the raw materials used to make the product and for the product itself. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS is considering proposing handling requirements that would provide that material to be processed into boneless poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be processed within 2 hours from the time it is separated from the bones of poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses, except that such product may be held for no more than 72 hours at 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or less, or held indefinitely a 0  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (^18  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or less. Within 2 hours of the mechanical deboning operation, FSIS is also considering proposing that boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be chilled to 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or less, frozen to 0  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (^18  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or less, or cooked. FSIS is further considering proposing that boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids be used as an ingredient in a poultry or meat food product directly after being processed, except that it may be held prior to such use for no more than 72 hours at 40  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (4  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or less or indefinitely at 0  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F (^18  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;C) or less. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS wishes to receive comments on whether specific handling requirements other than those being considered are appropriate for specific types of starting materials. In addition, in order to avoid confusion about the parts or physical state of poultry that may be processed into boneless poultry with 0.6 percent or less bone solids, FSIS intends to provide a definition of ``poultry carcasses or parts of carcasses.'' The terms ``poultry carcasses'' or ``parts of carcasses'' would apply to whole carcasses or disjointed portions of such carcasses that are ``ready-to-cook poultry'' within the meaning of 9 CFR 381.1(b)(44) of the poultry products inspection regulations. In other words, the head, feet, crop, oil gland, trachea, esophagus, entrails, mature reproductive organs, and lungs of the slaughtered poultry have been removed and such poultry is free from protruding pinfeathers and vestigial feathers and suitable for cooking without need of further processing. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS is considering that adoption of the handling requirements discussed above would eliminate the need to require that the temperature of rooms or compartments in which equipment for mechanical deboning of raw poultry is operated be maintained at 50  <!-- PJG 0040 degreeslatlong --> &cir;F. or less. Thus, if the requirements FSIS is considering are adopted, FSIS would need to rescind 9 CFR 381.47(e). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> C. Tentative position: Limitations on Use.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> At a level of 0.6 percent or less bone solids content there is no need for consumer concern regarding potential fluoride contribution of mechanically separated product made from fowl (i.e., mature female chickens). <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (1) Tentative position: Kind of product limitation.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> FSIS's tentative position on amending the poultry products produced by mechanical deboning with 0.6 percent or less bone solids covers such product prepared from any kind of poultry. It is not, however, FSIS's intention to permit use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids as an ingredient in any given poultry product regardless of the kind of poultry from which it is made. Such action would be inconsistent with existing regulatory requirements and interpretations and could, among other things, result in false or misleading labeling. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> FSIS intends to provide that when a poultry product is required to be prepared from a particular kind of kinds of poultry (e.g., chickens), use of boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids of any other kind (e.g., poultry product made from turkey) should not be permitted. This provision would assure that boneless poultry product made from a different kind of poultry is not used in a poultry product represented as containing ingredients from a particular kind or kinds of poultry. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> (2) Tentative position: Limitation on product made from fowl.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> In the past, the Agency has had a policy of discouraging the use of MDP containing 1.0 percent or less bone solids content for use in baby, junior, and toddler foods because of concern for higher levels of fluoride present in the bones of mature poultry. However, FSIS believes that at the low level of 0.6 percent or less bone solids content there would be no reason to place a restriction on boneless poultry products with 0.6 percent or less bone solids for use in baby, junior, and toddler foods based on the potential fluoride contribution of product made from fowl to dietary intakes. Furthermore, there is research to indicate a very poor absorption of fluorine from bone particles coupled with a large body of research indicating beneficial effects of fluoride at lower levels. With the restriction of 0.6 percent or less bone solids content, levels of fluoride present would not present a health and safety concern. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

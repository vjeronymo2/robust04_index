			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By reporter Zhang Yijun (1728 4135 0193)] </F>   [Text] Beijing, April 6 (XINHUA) -- Wu Yi, minister of  foreign trade and economic cooperation, said today: China hopes  that the United States will "take positive and pragmatic [ji ji  wu shi 4480 2817 0523 1395]" steps to cast aside man-made  obstacles and make joint efforts with China to push forward  bilateral trade and economic cooperation.    Wu Yi will lead a Chinese Government economic and trade  delegation to visit the United States 11-20 April. On the eve  of her U.S. trip, she told XINHUA that China's sustained, rapid,  and healthy economic growth and its grandiose economic  development plan will create even more favorable trade and  investment opportunities for U.S. enterprises.  <H5>  The Upcoming Session of the Joint Committee on Commerce and </H5> Trade [JCCT] Is Very Important    As for the purpose of her U.S. trip, Wu Yi said that the  most  important thing during her mission is to co-chair, with U.S.  Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown, the Eighth Sino-U.S. JCCT  Session scheduled for 13-14 April in Washington.    According to her, the JCCT session, as an annual meeting  between the Chinese and U.S. Governments, is a most important  occasion for discussing bilateral economic and trade relations.  She called the session another major event following the  Sino-U.S. summit meeting in Seattle and the talks between  finance and foreign ministers of the two countries.    She revealed that during the forthcoming session, the two  sides will discuss trade and investment policies, and  cooperation and legal matters in such areas as information,  energy, transportation, the chemical industry, and environmental  cooperation.    During its visit to the United States, the Chinese  delegation  will hold trade and investment negotiation meetings in Los  Angeles and New York on 11 and 19 April, respectively.  <H5>  To Discuss 800 Investment Projects and Purchase Goods Worth </H5> Hundreds of Millions of U.S. Dollars    Wu Yi said: The trade and investment negotiation meetings  will be China's first large-scale trade and investment promotion  activity to be held in the United States in the past 15 years.  The activity is sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign  Trade and Economic Cooperation with assistance from the U.S. law  firm Graham and James and the U.S. Asian Association. The  Chinese trade negotiation group will be made up of senior  officials, experts, and business executives from eight  ministries and commissions of the State Council, three national  corporations, and 26 provinces and municipalities. Meanwhile,  the ministry's four affiliated corporations, which will be in  the United States to negotiate exports and imports, plan to buy  U.S. goods worth hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars.    She said: To further promote investment and trade  cooperation between the two countries, the trade negotiation  group will mainly brief U.S. businessmen about China's reform,  opening up, and economic development, and will help prospective  U.S. investors find opportunities in China.    She revealed that China will offer about 800 key investment  projects at the negotiation meetings, including the construction  of hydroelectric and thermal power stations, highways, railways,  airports, and wharfs; and projects in industrial raw and semi-  finished materials for the machine-building and electrical,  electronics, petrochemical, and metallurgical industries; as  well as in agriculture, livestock breeding, and forestry.    It Is Imperative To Remove Obstacles in Developing  Sino-U.S. Economic and Trade Relations    After briefly reviewing the development of economic and  trade  relations between China and the United States, Wu Yi said  bilateral trade and U.S. investment in China have grown  continuously in recent years despite some problems that have  cropped up.    Since the two countries established diplomatic relations in  1979, trade between the two countries has developed rapidly.  According to statistics from the General Administration of  Customs of China, bilateral trade jumped from $2.45 billion in  1979 to $27.65 billion in 1993, an increase of more than 11.3  times. Meanwhile, U.S. businessmen's investment in China has  been increasing each year. As of now, the number of U.S.-funded  projects in China exceeds 8,000, involving an agreed upon total  investment of $11 billion, topping the list of all foreign  investment. More than 50 of the U.S. major firms have opened  business bases in China.    Wu Yi held that a major reason for the rapid development of  bilateral trade, investment, and cooperation is the fact that  the two economies are highly supplementary to each other.    However, she stressed that if the bilateral trade and  cooperation are to develop further, the U.S. side should take  further steps to remove man-made obstacles. The United States  should relax controls on U.S. technology exports to China,  resume financing for feasibility studies for projects undertaken  by the U.S. Trade Development Agency, resume risk guarantees by  the private U.S. Investment Company for U.S. Investment in  China, and resume preferential loans by the American Import and  Export Bank to relevant construction projects in China, so as to  further tap the the potential of China's imports from the United  States and U.S. investment in China.  <H5>  Most-Favored-Nation [MFN] Status and China's Rejoining the </H5> GATT    Touching on the issue of MFN status, Wu Yi said: This is a  purely trade issue and it should not be entangled with issues  with which it has nothing to do. Proper handling of MFN status  is an important condition for the further development of  bilateral trade and economic coopeation. China hopes to remove  the shadow of MFN status and achieve greater development in  bilateral economic and trade relations.    Wu Yi said: China has always opposed the practice of linking  MFN status to the human rights issues, as views on human rights  and explanations on the meaning of human rights differ from  country to country. China and the United States have  differences of view on the human rights issue, and they may  discuss them through other channels on the basis of mutual  respect, noninterference in each other's internal affairs, and  seeking common ground while preserving differences. The two  sides should in no way let this nontrade factor stand in the way  of furthering the bilateral trade and economic cooperation.    On the issue of China's restoration of its contracting party  status in GATT, Wu Yi said that major progress was made at the  16th Session of the GATT Working Party on China last month.  Most GATT members voiced support for China's "reentry into the  GATT" orally and in action.    Minister Wu Yi said: During bilateral talks, the United  States has said it will firmly support China's reentry into  GATT. She hoped that the U.S. side would effectively fulfill  its promise, take a positive attitude in handling the matter of  China's reentry into the GATT, promote the course of negotiation  for China's "reentry into the GATT," and will truly keep its  promise and be as good as its word.</p>

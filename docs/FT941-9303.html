			<p>940215 FT  15 FEB 94 / Navy will mothball carriers The Russian navy is mothballing three of its five aircraft carriers, admitting yesterday it did not have the resources to keep them afloat, Reuter reports from Moscow. The Kiev, part of the Northern Fleet, and the Minsk and the Novorossiysk from the Pacific Fleet, are still young. The Kiev was commissioned in 1975, the Minsk in 1978 and the Novorossiysk in 1982, according to Jane's Fighting Ships, a standard reference. The navy said all three needed an overhaul, but Russia had neither the resources nor a shipyard to carry out the work.</p>

			<p>941008 FT  08 OCT 94 / Arts: Furniture shines up its image - Saleroom Not so very long ago, antique furniture - most especially the brown English variety - occupied a genteel backwater of the international market. Suddenly it is centre stage. Now it is not paintings but top-drawer furniture - and those decorative items the dealers and auction houses offer with it - that is being gift-wrapped with splendid catalogues, world tours and black-tie evening sales, and it is furniture that is riding a roller-coaster of spectacularly successful sales and record prices. In 1990 the J. Paul Getty Museum paid a record Pounds 8.6m for the so-called Badminton Cabinet; last year a piece of English furniture, the 'Anglesey Desk', made over Pounds 1m. In December, the collection of furniture, silver and other objects belonging to the couturier Hubert de Givenchy, again sold through Christie's, this time in Monaco, realised Pounds 17.67m. Its handsome catalogue included a separate volume, with a marathon 25-page catalogue entry, for the great silver 'Hanover Chandelier' made for George II to the designs of William Kent. The catalogue for the forthcoming sale of treasures from Houghton at Christie's in December promises to be even grander. It seems that furniture and what used to be called the decorative arts are no longer the poor relations to painting and sculpture. The best have been accorded the dignity and status of works of 'art', not 'craft'. Every aspect of design and manufacture is a subject of study, every detail of provenance recorded. Like the Rokeby Venus or the Portland Vase, these masterpieces also take their name from the great houses or collectors who once claimed them. The changing status of furniture is due in large part to the coming of age of furniture history. Enormous inroads have been made into the - still shadowy - world of cabinet-making since the Furniture History Society was founded in 1964. Now that it is possible to devote 25 pages to the description, history, provenance, etc of a Kent chandelier or six pages to an ormolu Matthew Boulton mantel clock - the sort of treatment once only meted out to a great Picasso or a famous Old Master  - who can fail to be impressed? It is not only the auction houses that have benefitted from the collecting public's apparent susceptibility to glossy, authoritative catalogues. John Hobbs, a former partner in the London furniture dealers Carlton Hobbs, believes the business really took off after the publication of its first exquisite, scholarly catalogue of stylishly presented furniture. The firm played a large part in establishing a taste for flamboyant Regency furniture, and for levelling out the difference in prices between exceptional pieces, be they French, Italian, Russian or English. Revealingly, in John Hobbs' ambitious new venture in partnership with Paris-based dealer Ariane Dandois - eight gallery spaces of impressive furniture, sculpture and works of art in the old Design &amp; Decoration Building at 107 Pimlico Road - there are no less than three full-time researchers. Given that English rather than Continental furniture is rarely signed and poorly documented, the auction houses have astutely focused on provenance. Recent auction successes have revealed that 20th-century provenances can be made as enticing as those of the 18th. In 1991 Christie's sold the Sam Messer collection for Pounds 7.7m, doubling the pre-sale estimate and establishing a record for a collection of English furniture. Its catalogue essay outlined the important role of the furniture historian and connoisseur FW Symonds on post-war collecting. Now it seems that any piece from a Symonds collector or collection is charmed and destined for great heights. The Messer sale was a turning point. It re-established a taste for rich and restrained carved Chippendale furniture that seemed particularly appropriate to the new decade. The trade was alarmed by the gung-ho estimates. Messer's splendid George III commode attributed to Chippendale bore an estimate of Pounds 250,000-350,000; the hammer came down at Pounds 850,000. At the Geoffrey Blackwell sale in 1992 - another Symonds collector - estimates were far from conservative. Even so, a George II walnut mirror estimated at Pounds 20,000-30,000 was knocked down at Pounds 85,000, a George II burr walnut kneehole dressing table (estimate Pounds 40,000-50,000) at Pounds 125,000. In July, a George II walnut card table that had belonged to Percival Griffiths, Blackwell and Sir James Caird, fetched Pounds 120,000 hammer, four times the lower estimate. These extravagant prices beg the question that if the auction room is the best place to sell a great piece of furniture, can it be the best place to buy? The furniture market may be in danger of over-heating. No one would benefit from collectors and dealers left with a glut of over-expensive, unsaleable furniture on their hands. But unlike the overblown Impressionist market of the late 1980s, it is still not possible to buy a piece of furniture in January and sell it at a profit in July.</p>

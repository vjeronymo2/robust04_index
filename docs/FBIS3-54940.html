Summing up the results of his work  in 1993, in an interview to INTERFAX, he stressed that he sees  in this one of the guarantees for the unity and integrity of  Russia. Kazannik also said that the General Procuracy has  dismissed all cases involving charges of economic crimes which  were instigated for political reasons so as to compromise  political figures.    Touching on his predecessor Valentin Stepankov, the general  procurator told journalists that on 24 December he signed an  edict sacking him from the bodies of the procuracy. After his  resignation, Stepankov was offered various fields of work,  including the post of trade counsellor at the Russian Embassy in  Malta.    Aleksey Kazannik also said that criminal proceedings on  charges of corruption are soon to be instituted against Viktor  Barannikov and Andrey Dunayev.    In conclusion Russia's general procurator gave the assurance  that he will not allow the examination of the case concerning  the Moscow events of early October 1993 to be spun out over a  long period.</p>

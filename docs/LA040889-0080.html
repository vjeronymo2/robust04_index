			<p><P> April 8, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MAJOR FIRMS BACKING POLICE, LIBRARY BOND MEASURES  </P> <P> Big business interests are giving heavily to campaigns for two bond measures on  Tuesday's municipal ballot, campaign finance records show.  </P> <P> The measures are Proposition 1, which would raise $53.4 million to repair and  expand libraries, and Proposition 2, which would provide $176 million to  upgrade Police Department facilities.  </P> <P> Campaign managers for the bond measures said that most of their funds have been  raised from large corporations, some with interests in downtown development.  </P> <P> Charles Reed, chairman of Citizens for a Safer Los Angeles, the Proposition 2  campaign committee, said he was able to raise $325,000 with telephone calls to  fewer than 35 area corporations. "I didn't get one turndown," Reed said.  </P> <P> "A safer Los Angeles is good for business," said Bob Lavoie, campaign manager  of the committee.  </P> <P> Proposition 2 would allow the city to build two new police stations and a new  training facility and to modernize or replace all of the existing stations.  </P> <P> Many of the large donations are being made in the closing days of the campaign,  according to campaign finance records on file at the city clerk's office.  </P> <P> Among the big corporate sponsors of the campaign are Arco, $25,000; Times  Mirror Co., $15,000; Pacific Telesis Group, $10,000; Occidental Petroleum  Corp., $2,500, and Southern California Edison Co., $2,500.  </P> <P> The library measure is being supported in large part by real estate developers  and businesses with an interest in the downtown library office tower project --  even though no funds from the bond measure will be used in that project. Branch  libraries would be the sole beneficiaries of Proposition 1.  </P> <P> Craig Steele, co-manager of the Yes on L.A. Libraries campaign, said the  developers and many of the tenants have taken an interest in the library as a  result of their association with the project.  </P> <P> Development firm Maguire Thomas Partners, which is rebuilding the downtown  library under separate funding, was one of the big contributors to the library  bonds campaign, giving $5,000. Other contributors include the law firm of  O'Melveny &amp; Myers, $7,500; Shapel Industries, $2,500, and KDG Architecture  and Planning, $1,250.  </P> <P> In all, the campaign has raised $60,000.  </P></p>

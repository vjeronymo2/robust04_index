			<p>930605 FT  05 JUN 93 / UK Company News: Coopers &amp; Lybrand to undertake review of Hartstone HARTSTONE Group's bankers have appointed Coopers &amp; Lybrand to undertake a thorough review of the group's current financial position ahead of agreeing to any refinancing arrangement. Shares in the hosiery and leather goods company - which issued two profits warnings within a week - have fallen from a 1993 high of 277p to yesterday's closing price of 39 1/2 p. It is believed that the banks have agreed to a standstill arrangement which will apply until the work by Coopers is completed. The company recently said that it had breached at least one banking covenant which calls for 2.5 times interest cover. One of the company's directors yesterday named the senior employee who has been suspended after he revealed that he had arranged for certain funds derived from a foreign exchange hedging contract to be paid to an account for his benefit. He is Mr Michael Small, the company treasurer who came to Hartstone from Credit Suisse First Boston. An advance of Pounds 50,000 to Mr Small may also be irrecoverable. It is understood that some of the company's directors were unaware of the loan until this week. The lenders to Hartstone are being led by Chemical Bank of the US, which has held a number of meetings recently with the company and its advisers. One of the group's advisers yesterday said that the banks were 'broadly supportive at this stage.' He described the Coopers remit as an information gathering exercise which 'is not unusual in such situations.' Hartstone's current auditors, Binder Hamlyn, said that their position remained unchanged in spite of the Coopers' appointment. 'Our relationship with the company and its directors is still very good,' it said. Hartstone said earlier this week that its profits for the year ended March 1993 would be not less than Pounds 9m after Pounds 12m of exceptional costs. Then on Thursday it added that profits could be reduced by a further Pounds 260,000 after arrangements came to light over payments due to a subsidiary company. In March the company's brokers, Barclays de Zoete Wedd, were predicting profits of Pounds 22m after exceptionals.</p>

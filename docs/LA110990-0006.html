			<p><P> November 9, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN CHIDES PUBLIC FOR SPLIT VOTE;  </P> <P> POLITICS: HE BLAMES DIVIDED GOVERNMENT -- SUCH AS STATE'S REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR  AND DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATURE -- FOR BOGGING DOWN THE SYSTEM.  </P> <P> A relaxed but defensive Gov. George Deukmejian said Thursday that voters must  share the blame for governmental gridlock when they elect a governor of one  party and a Legislature controlled by the other, as they did on Tuesday.  </P> <P> "You know, when the public says they're unhappy about the fact that a lot of  major issues are not solved in Sacramento or in Washington, they also sort of  have to look at the way in which they themselves voted," said Deukmejian,  holding what aides said would be his last press conference in Los Angeles as  governor.  </P> <P> "How do you expect a governor or a President to get his programs through when  you send (to the Capitol) a Legislature and (state) constitutional officers of  the other party who are virtually opposed to everything he said he was going to  do? We had that same problem (in Sacramento) and now we see it in Washington.  And here again we see it in this upcoming (Pete Wilson) Administration."  </P> <P> On Tuesday, California voters elected a Republican governor and a Democratic  lieutenant governor, placed Democrats in most other state offices and  strengthened the Democrats' grip on the Legislature.  </P> <P> Political scientists increasingly in recent years have blamed divided  government -- both in Washington and Sacramento -- for government stalemate. In  California, this also has led to a glut of ballot initiatives sponsored by  special interests.  </P> <P> "There just needs to be a lot more discussion about this," the outgoing  Republican governor insisted. "People shouldn't be quick to blame a governor or  blame a legislature and say, 'What's the matter with you guys? Why can't you  get along? Why can't you resolve it? Why can't you all recognize there are  problems that need to be resolved?' When, in fact, through their votes, they're  sending people up there (to Sacramento) with diametrically different approaches  and philosophies."  </P> <P> Deukmejian is particularly sensitive about this because his public popularity  steadily declined in the past year. The governor's image -- as well as the  Legislature's -- took a big hit during the summer because of a monthlong budget  stalemate.  </P> <P> A statewide survey of registered voters last week by The Los Angeles Times Poll  found that only 41% approved of "the way George Deukmejian is handling his job  as governor," while an equal number disapproved. In mid-September, a Times Poll  showed 50% approval and 42% disapproval. Last December, Deukmejian's  "negatives" were significantly lower: Only 25% disapproved of his job  performance, although 41% approved and 34% said they did not know enough about  the two-term governor to offer an opinion.  </P> <P> The Times Poll also recently found that voters do, indeed, favor divided  government. By 4 to 3, people said they prefer that "one party controls the  Legislature and the other party controls the governor's office so they can keep  a check on each other," rather than having one party control both branches of  government "so they can work together and achieve the party's goals."  </P> <P> Asked at his press conference whether he felt he had been unfairly criticized  for inaction, Deukmejian unhesitantly replied: "Every hour. Every hour. You  know, all the time. I mean, we get criticized without any reference, really, to  what the situation is."  </P> <P> Based on the argument against divided government, a reporter told the governor,  voters on Tuesday should have elected Democrat Dianne Feinstein to work with  the Democrat-controlled Legislature.  </P> <P> "No, they should have elected a Republican-controlled Legislature because they  were voting for a governor who went before all of the people of the state. He  got the majority (of votes) so he should really have a Republican-controlled  Legislature to support his program," Deukmejian answered.  </P> <P> Throughout the the world, this is called a parliamentary system, but Deukmejian  stopped short of advocating that.  </P> <P> The lame-duck governor said Republican Wilson's election meant that voters did  not want to steer very far from the course he has set in Sacramento for the  past eight years.  </P> <P> Deukmejian also denied that Wilson will inherit a budget deficit, contending  that there are ample funds in a state reserve to end the present fiscal year in  the black. Other state officials, however, have estimated that the deficit  could climb as high as $2 billion.  </P> <P> Asked how he thought Californians would remember his legacy, Deukmejian  deadpanned: "I think they're going to miss this wild and crazy guy."  </P></p>

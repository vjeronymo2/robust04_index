			<p>920603 FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: GE shares dip on fraud allegation SHARES in General Electric dipped yesterday after it announced the US Defence Department had suspended future aircraft engine contracts with the company because of allegations that it committed fraud in the sale of military jet engines to Israel. A GE spokesman said the company would appeal against the decision, which it felt lacked both 'fair process and merit.' On the New York Stock Exchange, the company's shares stood at Dollars 75 1/2 , down Dollars  7/8 , at close of trading. The Pentagon's action follows a so-called 'whistleblower' suit by a former GE employee alleging that a group of employees in the company's aero engine division conspired with an Israeli general and fraudulently diverted money into his personal accounts to influence Israeli jet engine purchases. GE fired a top official allegedly involved in the scheme a year ago. The company said yesterday that since learning of the allegations in December 1990 it had co-operated fully with the Justice Department. It felt the ban was a case of 'turning these efforts against us.' The spokesman said the ban did not affect existing contracts. It was not clear how long it might last. GE is a major supplier of jet engines to the US military, and analysts said a relatively brief ban was unlikely to affect its sales. The 'whistleblower' suit - in which an employee blows the whistle on his colleagues - is one of several which have embarrassed GE in recent years. In April, another former GE official, who had been dismissed by the company, filed a suit alleging it was conspiring with de Beers, the South African group, to fix the price of industrial diamonds. Mr Jack Welch, the chairman of GE, has dismissed these claims as 'pure nonsense.'</p>

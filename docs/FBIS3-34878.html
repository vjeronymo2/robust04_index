			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed commentary] </F>   [Text] Under conditions that are reported to be very tense  in the occupied regions of Palestine because many towns have  been surrounded by Zionist troops, the Palestinian and Israeli  negotiators have resumed talks in the coastal Egyptian city of  Taba. Under an agreement concluded between the two sides last  week, the Palestinian team eventually agreed to jointly man with  Israel border passages linking the autonomous regions with Egypt  and Jordan. It has also consented to assign the security of  Jewish townships and movement of their residents in the occupied  Palestine to the Zionist army.    Of course, conclusion of the agreement last week led to a  series of protests and objections by various Palestinian parties  and the Syrian press. According to those opposing the  agreement, what has actually taken place is the transfer of  total control of the border check posts to the Zionist regime.  [Word indistinct] the Israeli troops will have veto power  concerning movement in the autonomous regions. The Zionist  regime has even opposed the hoisting of the Palestinian flag on  the common border check posts.    In fact, insistence of the Zionist regime and the United  States on the conclusion of such an agreement has once again  proved the reality to the world people that the Israeli claim on  a just and broad-based peace is totally false. From the outset  of the negotiations with the Arab delegation, the Zionist regime  clearly proved the point that it wants peace outside the  framework of the Security Council resolutions, and with minimum  concessions to the Arabs. The obstacles which Israel has  created in the negotiations from the very beginning, either  during the rightist government's rule or the rule of the present  leftist faction, clearly showed the point that in the deal what  cannot be included is the restoration of the lost rights of the  Arabs.    The Zionist regime not only does not honor the agreement  that  it has itself signed, but its prime minister clearly announces  that the timetable for the withdrawal was a mistake right from  the beginning, and that at least one month is required to reach  an agreement with the Palestinians.    Set against this, the Palestinian nation, with no confidence  in the Israeli promises and paying no attention to the U.S.  support -- the main backer of the Zionist regime's attacks -- is  continuing the struggle by hoisting the flag of the Palestinian  nation's oppression and taking its just cry on the intifadah  scene [as heard] to the world people.</p>

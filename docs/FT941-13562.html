			<p>940125 FT  25 JAN 94 / UK Company News: Lep gets Pounds 89m from sale of property interest Lep Group, the freight forwarding and security company restructured by its banks in 1992, is to sell for Pounds 89m its long-term leasehold interest in Swiss Bank House, the Swiss Bank Corporation's London headquarters, on the River Thames south of St Paul's Cathedral. The interest in the property was owned by St Paul's Vista, a Lep subsidiary, and had a book value of Pounds 76m in Lep's balance sheet at the end of 1992. Swiss Bank House is currently used to secure Pounds 75m of 7.3 per cent secured notes of St Paul's Vista, due in 1995. Lep said the proceeds of the sale would be used to provide alternative security for the notes, with the net balance being available to reduce group borrowings. Lep said in October it had debts of about Pounds 340m. The disposal is in line with the group's stated objective of focusing on its businesses of international freight forwarding and security services.</p>

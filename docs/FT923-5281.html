			<p>920902 FT  02 SEP 92 / Labour go into attack on economy SENIOR Labour frontbenchers will tomorrow launch the party's autumn campaigning with a commitment to an emergency programme of measures to help revive the economy. The proposals, to be discussed at a meeting of the shadow cabinet's economic sub-committee, broaden the range of remedies the opposition is urging on the government. A few Labour backbenchers have criticised the economic team for giving ministers too easy a ride. Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, said yesterday that there was a growing clamour among businessmen for a change in government policy. Labour says the absence of business and consumer confidence is one of the main barriers to recovery, and that unless the fear of unemployment can be lifted, people will not spend instead of saving. The central elements of the party's recovery programme are measures to reduce unemployment, encourage investment and boost the housing market. Labour wants these measures introduced with co-ordinated action in the European Community to consider employment and fiscal measures and concerted pressure on the Bundesbank to signal an interest rate cut. There was, Mr Brown said, growing recognition in Germany of the need for lower interest rates in the light of the increased sluggishness of the German economy. He emphasised that Labour had no policy for devaluation, but said that the meeting of EC finance ministers in Bath on Friday should consider the case for revaluation. Mr Brown also called on Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, to hold an urgent meeting with building societies to discuss whether housing associations could buy up some unsold properties to help to get the housing market moving. He renewed his warnings that unless the government took action, there was a risk of an irretrievable loss of industrial strength. He said: 'What is becoming increasingly clear is not only that the economy is stuck in recession far longer than ever the government promised, but also that we face the loss of industrial capacity which may never be replaced.'</p>

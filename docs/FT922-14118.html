			<p>920408 FT  08 APR 92 / Peru's military to crack down on guerrillas PERU'S military looks set for a swift crackdown against the country's guerrillas and drugs traffickers following President Alberto Fujimori's dissolution of Congress in favour of a military-backed 'government of emergency and national reconstruction.' Troops were reported yesterday to be standing ready for action in the Upper Huallaga Valley, north-east of Lima, where Sendero Luminoso, the Maoist guerrilla group, and drugs traffickers have long held sway. The crackdown on Peru's press intensified yesterday, with the closure of the leading news magazine Caretas, as it became clearer that the opposition American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (Apra) was the key target of Sunday night's government-armed forces strike. Mr Agustin Mantilla and Mr Abel Salinas, former Apra interor and economy ministers, have been arrested along with Mr Luis Negreiros, a leading Apra trade union figure. Mr Alan Garcia, the former president and recently re-elected Apra secretary general, has slipped the net. Mr Fujimori said last night that today 'security forces would be removed from all news media who in reality were there to provide protection'. Diplomatic sources said the president intended to put his emergency measures to a plebiscite within six weeks. The armed forces, underpaid, ill-equipped and constantly accused of human rights violations, have long been agitating for a freer hand in dealing with Peru's two principal subversive groups. 'President Fujimori is obsessed with achieving the pacification of Peru,' said a political analyst in Lima. 'He sees insurgency as the main stumbling block to attracting foreign investment and believes that only by giving the army its head will he achieve this.' 'By militarising the country further he is simply playing into Sendero's hands - it's just what they've always wanted,' said another analyst. Mr Fujimori lamented the 'lack of international comprehension' of his actions in a speech on Monday night, but hoped this would change when his measures were fully understood. 'This is not a traditional coup d'etat but a change of course which reflects the true aspirations of the Peruvian people,' he said. However, international condemnation of Peru's actions intensified yesterday. President George Bush ordered suspension of some Dollars 320m in US economic and military aid to Peru, according to an official. Mr David Mulford, US Treasury undersecretary for international affairs, said yesterday at the meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank in Santo Domingo that the US might vote against new multilateral aid for Peru. cabinet on Monday night. Ministers stood by their president, some looking enthusiastic, others unhappy. A prominent absentee was former premier Mr Alfonso de los Heros, who resigned to be replaced as chief minister by the low-key Mr Oscar de la Puente Reygada.</p>

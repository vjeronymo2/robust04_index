			<p>940308 FT  08 MAR 94 / Survey of Credit Management (11): 'I'm keen on the embarrassment factor' - Late payers, watch out Lord Strathclyde, the youthful minister of state for small firms and consumer affairs, enjoys the thought of embarrassing companies which fail to pay their bills on time. He is waging his own personal battle against late payers, who have been accused of depriving British companies of more than Pounds 50bn in cash through unpaid invoices. If he receives a complaint from a disgruntled supplier, 'I will send a letter to the chairman (of the debtor company),' he says. Of course, he adds, the debtor is given a fair hearing. But nevertheless: 'I'm keen on the embarrassment factor.' Debate over the solution to late payment is reaching fever pitch, with responses to a consultative document on the subject issued by the Department of Trade and Industry expected by the end of the month. The document followed comments by the UK Chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, in his November budget, that failure to settle invoices on time could mean 'the difference between survival and failure' for many UK companies. Mr Philip Mellor, senior analyst with Dun &amp; Bradstreet, says that in annual surveys by the credit information provider, late payment has consistently ranked in the top three concerns of companies questioned. The Confederation of British Industry also found, in 1991, that one in five of its smaller members thought their survival was threatened by late payment. But the solution is less than clear. The proposal which sparked the most controversy has been legislation to impose a statutory right to interest on late payments. A survey of almost 500 smaller companies by SG Warburg, the UK brokers, last month, showed that 58 per cent of those questioned favoured legislation. But a substantial minority - 29 per cent - opposed legislation. The campaign to introduce statutory interest has been backed by prominent names including Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank, and Mr Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks &amp; Spencer. They have all backed proposals put forward by the Forum of Private Businesses, a vociferous lobby group which has campaigned for legislation for about 10 years. The forum suggests that, among other measures, companies be allowed to claim interest on overdue invoices for up to six years, even if the main debt had been separately collected. Legislation, say its supporters, would end the uncertainty surrounding payment, which plagues smaller businesses. This is particularly important, as the economy begins to recover, to companies strapped for cash. 'We should not allow those smaller companies, without assets to fall back upon, to be penalised by late payment,' Mr Mellor says. The Forum is unperturbed by sceptics who say that companies are unlikely to pursue interest. Legislation with a six-year option would force late payers to make provision for contingent liabilities in their accounts, says Mr David Harrop, of the Forum. This would encourage late payers to improve their performance. While Lord Strathclyde himself admits that there appears to be a considerable head of steam building up behind this option, the issue must present a difficult dilemma for the Government. How can it increase regulation while preaching deregulation?; When should interest charges begin if the standard payment times vary, industry by industry? And how would the already overloaded courts cope with an increase in cases? 'Legislation only sounds simple if you say it quickly,' says Lord Strathclyde. Opponents of legislation cite a variety of arguments against the proposal. 'Small companies owe money as well as are owed money,' says Mr Tim Corbett, business development director of Barclays Commercial Services, the factoring firm. ' If they owe money to their suppliers they will be targeted too, and could find themselves on the losing side.' Opponents argue that charging interest may well encourage late payment. Some companies may decide interest provides a legitimate excuse for not paying and 'use the supplier as an alternative source of finance,' says Mr Ben Allen, chairman of the Association of British Factors and Discounters (see profile, Page II). Then there are those who cite the experience of those European countries such as France and Germany, which have legislation, but where payment times actually appear to be lengthening. 'I do not think legislation will make a blind bit of difference,' says Mr John Butterworth, managing director of Royal Bank Invoice Finance, whose parent, the Royal Bank of Scotland, actually supports legislation. Mr Butterworth suggests that the best option would be to use the existing system, which allows collection of interest through the courts if it has been specified in the contract. This is a cumbersome and lengthy process, which few companies use. The legislation being proposed would apply the right to interest universally, irrespective of the contract. 'We would like to avoid legislation if possible,' says Mr Mellor of Dun &amp; Bradstreet, 'but looking at all the voluntary measures that have been put forward to date, none has worked.' Opponents would argue that peer pressure has been effective with some of the UK's largest companies. 'GEC was one of the worst offenders and they have been shamed into changing their policies,' says Mr Allen of the ABFD. He favours the DTI's second option - a British Standard on prompt payment, as well as measures to force companies to publish their payment times in the annual accounts. Need for change is is about the only issue on which all parties agree. Yet Lord Strathclyde is wary of even that seemingly simple goal. 'However you change the climate of late payment, you must tackle the problem of financial management within companies - in the UK it's appalling.'</p>

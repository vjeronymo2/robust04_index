			<p>940712 FT  12 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: One for the road to healthy living Sir, Dabbling in futurology is clearly a hazard to journalistic objectivity. Michael Prowse's speculations on lifestyles 50 years hence are interesting ('Why vegetarians will inherit the earth', July 11), until he touches on alcohol and its future. Then his crystal ball disintegrates due to an overload of errors and half truths from today's world. The litany of social woes Mr Prowse seeks to attribute to alcohol reads like an extract from a Band of Hope pamphlet. His opinions conveniently ignore some rather important facts. First, 95 per cent or more of those who drink do so without harm and are far removed from the problems of excess, which affect only a small, unhappy minority - but who colour Mr Prowse's thinking. Second, estimates of the social cost of abuse, on which he places much emphasis, are notoriously unreliable - even when produced by the US government. They vary from as little as 10 per cent of the Dollars 100bn quoted to up to 40 per cent more. Questioning commentators might be a little more cautious about statistical reliability when they see divergences as wide as this. Mr Prowse is right on one point. In the US heart disease is the leading cause of death. In which regard a better predictor of why alcohol will still be a part of healthy lifestyles in 2044 can be found in a recent pronouncement from the World Health Organisation, assessing alcohol and health. 'It can be concluded, therefore, that moderate drinking provides a moderate protective effect against cardiovascular disease, as compared with abstention and heavy drinking.' Perhaps Mr Prowse should think again about giving up at least one of his fleeting pleasures. A little of what he fancies should do him good. No less than the WHO says so.

			<p>910424 FT  24 APR 91 / Observer: Moreover Humphrey Harrison is a young stockbroker on the make, and good luck to him. He has just set up a consultancy called Europe Energy Environment, and managed to recruit some impressive names for its letterhead. Dr Rilwanu Lukman, immediate past-president of Opec; Tom Burke, one of Michael Heseltine's special advisers; Professor Eugene Khartukov, the Soviet energy adviser; and Silvan Robinson, an ex-Shell man and now with Chatham House, all have much more distinguished backgrounds than the 34-year-old Harrison, ex-Kitcat &amp; Aitken. Can his coup in recruiting them have anything to do with his being yet another South African?</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Shenyang, April 5 (XINHUA) -- An export-oriented  economy has been developing rapidly in the commercial sector in  Northeast China's Liaoning Province over the past year.    In 1993, the province's commercial enterprises alone  attracted more than 200 million U.S. dollars in foreign funds,  tripling the total of the past five years.    The operation of commercial enterprises used to be confined  strictly to domestic traders. Since 1988, Liaoning began to  stress the development of the export-oriented economy among its  commercial enterprises.    At present, over one-fourth of the commercial enterprises in  the province have foreign trade operations and have set up trade  relations with more than 60 countries and regions in the world.    By the end of last year, the province already had 106  foreign- funded commercial enterprises.    Liaoning was one of the earliest provinces in China to open  jointly-funded hotels. At present, jointly-run Star hotels in  the province involve an investment of some 144 million U.S.  dollars.    In addition, the province sent 450 cooks and other technical  personnel to work abroad last year.    With China opening wider to the outside world, commercial  enterprises in Liaoning are also broadening their scope of  foreign trade.    To promote the development of export-oriented enterprises,  the provincial government has been strengthening foreign  exchanges. In 1993, commercial enterprises in the province  received more than 8,000 foreign businessmen and sent abroad 180  visitors.</p>

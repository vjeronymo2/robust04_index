			<p><P> February 10, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TV &amp; VIDEO  </P> <P> "Diff'rent Strokes" star Gary Coleman is suing his parents and former business  adviser, alleging they took too big a share of his earnings. A lawsuit filed in  Santa Monica Superior Court also claims that W.G. and Edmonia Sue Coleman and  the adviser, Anita DeThomas, caused his assets to be managed unwisely. Coleman,  who turned 21 Wednesday, started acting when he was 5. Earlier this week,  Coleman's "Diff'rent Strokes" co-star, Todd Bridges, 23, pleaded innocent to  attempted murder for a Feb. 2 shooting that police described as a drug-related  assault.

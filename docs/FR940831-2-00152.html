All Runzheimer-developed worksheets conformed to the OMB-approved materials.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=4 --> 3.4.2&blank;Outlet Selection  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Proper outlet selection is crucial to measuring living-cost differences accurately because misjudgment can seriously affect survey results. Runzheimer paid particular attention to choosing appropriate outlets, focusing on three key guidelines to ensure proper outlet selection.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> First, for areas that had numerous outlets from which to choose, Runzheimer identified targets in several different geographic areas. For example, in the Washington, D.C., area, Runzheimer selected outlets in and around six different geographic areas: that is, two areas in Virginia, two in Maryland and two in the District of Columbia.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer's second guideline was that for any one marketbasket item, all outlets be similar in type. For example, Runzheimer surveyed two of the three food items in full-service grocery stores and the third food item in a warehouse-type grocery store in all locations where such stores are found. Gathering prices from all warehouse-type stores in one location and all full-service grocery stores in another would have distorted price comparisons.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The last guideline involved the diversity of outlets in Runzheimer's sample. We believe that pricing different items in different types of outlets more accurately portrays living-cost differences. For example, for efficiency, Runzheimer could have priced all clothing items in department stores. However, to incorporate price levels at other types of outlets that sell clothing items, whenever possible, Runzheimer surveyed some items in men's and women's clothing stores, some items in department stores, other items in shoe stores and still other items in discount department stores.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Runzheimer's research analysts selected outlets on the basis of:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Personal experience of Runzheimer on-site research associates and travelling researchers;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Informal telephone interviews with knowledgeable residents in each area;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Yellow pages sections of area telephone books;  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Area chambers of commerce and information bureaus; and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &bull;Experience gained from other surveys conducted by Runzheimer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> With new businesses constantly appearing (and old ones disappearing), outlet selection will be an ongoing process. Also, one can expect a portion of outlets to refuse to participate every year. Therefore, updating Runzheimer's outlet sample is a necessary and important part of each pricing survey.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> An example of refining outlet selection for this year's survey is the attention paid to defining the distinguishing differences between restaurants categorized as appropriate for family dining and those appropriate for fine dining. OPM developed a matrix which defined such characteristics as menu selections, atmosphere, table setting, seating, reservations, and AAA rating. This allowed Runzheimer researchers to compare apples to apples between the allowance areas and the Washington D.C. area. Also, OPM established guidelines directing Runzheimer to survey 100% family restaurants for breakfast, roughly 75% for lunch, and roughly 66% for dinner.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

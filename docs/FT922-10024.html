			<p>920505 FT  05 MAY 92 / Survey of Hong Kong (2): A state of near limbo - China relations FIVE YEARS before Britain is due to hand back Hong Kong to China relations between the two over the colony remain in a state of near limbo. Little progress is being made either by the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group (JLG) - the body charged with co-ordinating and negotiating the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China - nor, it would seem, in the six-monthly meetings between the foreign ministers of both countries. The events of June 4, 1989 - the Tiananmen massacre  - and their international aftermath have cast a long, dark shadow over Anglo-Chinese relations. The visit by Mr John Major, the British prime minister, to Beijing last September secured a HKDollars 114bn airport and related infrastructure projects, but it does not seem to have resulted in much else. If this were not worrying enough another factor has been added to problems: the power struggle in Beijing. Chinese officials - already under instructions to teach the Hong Kong government a lesson for letting people take to the streets at the time of June 4 - are keeping their heads down. These officials are in no mind to take the initiative in negotiations lest they incur the disfavour of a leadership yet to be determined. Furthermore, many of the officials China has put forward to lead the negotiations are not seen as having much political clout in Beijing. Lu Ping, the head of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs office of the State Council, is seen as a highly intelligent official but one who lacks the seniority of his predecessor - the Long March veteran Ji Peng Fei  - and therefore his access to the highest level of decision-making in China. The upshot of this is that, to the consternation of the Hong Kong government, the work load of the JLG mounts. There still remains to be processed some 400 international treaties relating to trade - bilateral and multilateral. Some derive from Hong Kong's dependent status on the UK others have been signed in the colony's own right. Many are obscure - such as the European convention on pallets, which agrees an international standard for the size of pallets - but they are part of everyday life and to ensure their post-1997 legality have to redrawn. Other issues before the JLG are the stuff of high politics. They include: Air services agreements. The Chinese are stalling, they say, because the UK will not show them secret annexes to the agreements. Britain believes that CAAC, the aviation monopoly in China, is using its considerable influence in Beijing to frustrate agreement being reached. CAAC wants access to Hong Kong's airways and the airways beyond, they say. Military lands. There are 19 military sites in Hong Kong. The British want to vacate many before 1997, thereby leaving the Hong Kong government free to develop them. It wants to know from the Chinese which sites the People's Liberation Army needs. The Chinese position is that it wants them all; Britain has offered five so far, including HMS Tamar, the headquarters of British forces in the colony. According to one British official: 'They are being too greedy and we can't yet see a deal that is to the advantage of Hong Kong.' However, hopes are that the Chinese will compromise. Mr Anthony Galsworthy, Britain's senior representative to the JLG, hinted at the UK's preparedness to compromise at a press briefing after the JLG meeting in March. 'We should not expect to get 100 per cent of what we want,' he said. 'This is a negotiation." The heyday of Anglo-Chinese relations is looking more and more like the period between the signing of the Joint Declaration in late 1984 and June 1989. Since then the Chinese government's attitude toward the British has reverted to type. The UK is regarded with suspicion and is seen as wanting to denude Hong Kong of its wealth before June 1997 while, at the same time, leaving in place structures which will perpetuate British influence. The main reason for this distrust is, from Beijing's point of view, the failure of the UK's client government in Hong Kong to crack down on movements in the colony which advocate democracy on the mainland. From the Chinese point of view a failure to crack down is an implicit endorsement of their activities. China sees these groups as a threat; some of them gave aid to pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing in 1989. To the suspicious Chinese the development of local democracy in Hong Kong has also been a considerable worry. It is now clear to many that China did not anticipate the effect that a change to electoral politics would have on the ability of the Hong Kong government (and by extension its post-1997 clone) to govern. Last September's elections have changed the face of Hong Kong politics from a cosy, consensual style of autocracy (the style of Hong Kong government China thought it would inherit) to a fractious, argumentative and party-based competitive style of politics. Many newly-elected local politicians have challenged the legitimacy of the colony's 'executive-led' government. The consequence for those who have to negotiate Hong Kong's future with Beijing is unenviable. Recently British negotiators have detected the formation of a new line emanating from Beijing. One has dubbed it the 'doctrine of no change' - meaning the Hong Kong government cannot alter the way it does things, or the machinery of government. If it tries the wrath of heaven descends. It is now commonplace for senior Chinese officials to comment publicly and provocatively upon Hong Kong government policy. This is deeply unsettling to the government - to unsettle is probably the motive  - and the colony as a whole. Recently there have been high profile interventions about the government's plans to 'corporatise' Radio and Television Hongkong (that is, change RTHK's status from that of a government department to a statutory corporation) and, more worryingly, the government's annual budget. Concerns about inflation and the new airport are frequently aired and, earlier this year, Beijing, without consultation, appointed 44 local worthies to advise it on Hong Kong affairs. The Joint Declaration speaks of the need for closer co-operation during the second half of the transition. Britain has agreed to consult on these issues but has resisted Beijing's demands that it become involved in the detail of plans. The outlook, therefore, for Anglo-Chinese relations is mixed. Resolution of some outstanding problems can be expected. By the end of this year the power struggle in Beijing may have produced a clear winner, and this may lend some security to the position of officials, especially those negotiating Hong Kong's future. A new, more positive, line may emanate from Beijing.</p>

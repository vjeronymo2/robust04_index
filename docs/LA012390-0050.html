			<p><P> January 23, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SHOULD INVESTORS BRACE FOR A MORE VOLATILE MARKET?  </P> <P> As the stock market took another tumble Monday, it inevitably made many  individual investors again wonder whether the market is becoming more volatile  -- and perhaps too volatile for their financial health.  </P> <P> The question has recently inspired much debate and research. But many who have  studied the issue have concluded that the wrenching rises and falls shouldn't  be of great concern to the investors who are willing to invest for the long  term.  </P> <P> It's not hard to understand what investors find so scary in the market's  gyrations. For many, memories have still not faded from the Oct. 19, 1987,  crash, which sliced 508 points from the Dow. Then there was the 190-point  "mini-crash" of last Oct. 13. And Monday's drop was preceded by a 71.46-point  drop in the Dow on Jan. 12.  </P> <P> Unquestionably, these daily point swings in the Dow are greater and come more  swiftly than they used to. But when price changes are analyzed on a percentage  basis, and over a longer intervals, the story is different.  </P> <P> Ibbotson Associates, an investment research firm in Chicago, has concluded that  when stock price changes are measured on a minute-to-minute or hour-to-hour  basis, they are indeed more volatile than they used to be. But when monthly or  yearly changes in prices are tracked, there's no appreciable difference from  earlier decades, the research firm says.  </P> <P> Ibbotson studied the daily variations in the prices of the Standard &amp;  Poor's 500-stock index and found that over the past four years, the index had  swung more violently than at any time since the 1920s. But the monthly and  yearly changes in the S&amp;P 500 are only about average, Ibbotson says.  </P> <P> Laurence B. Siegel, a managing director at Ibbotson, says there may be three  reasons stock prices have become more volatile on a minute-to-minute or  hour-to-hour basis in recent years.  </P> <P> The use of computers has allowed institutional traders to more quickly analyze  what's occurring in the financial world and to more quickly buy or sell  securities or futures once they've decided to act. Also, in the past four  years, stock prices have been relatively high; investors have been skittish as  they have considered selling their holdings and taking profits.  </P> <P> Last, so-called program trading techniques may also have contributed to the  gyrations, Siegel says. He adds, however, that "there is less solid evidence  that programs are a factor."  </P> <P> To put recent volatility in perspective, Siegel said that October, 1987, was  only the fifth-most volatile month in the century.  </P> <P> While he discounts the significance of the short-term fluctuations, Siegel  acknowledges their psychological impact. "Long-term investors aren't hurt by  daily volatility, but that doesn't make it any easier to swallow when the  market falls out of bed," Siegel says.  </P> <P> The Paine Webber investment firm has also taken up the volatility question, and  it concluded after analyzing daily changes in the S&amp;P index that stocks  were slightly more volatile in the 1980s than in the 1970s.  </P> <P> One reason for the increased movement, the firm's researchers note, is that in  the 1980s central banks allowed interest rates to fluctuate more freely without  intervening. That movement, in turn, brought quicker changes in the securities  and currency markets.  </P> <P> Also contributing to the greater volatility was the closer meshing of world  financial markets, they say. Now changes in the markets of one country are more  likely to have a greater impact abroad.  </P> <P> Joanne Hill, director of derivative-products research at Paine Webber,  suggested that the stock market's gyrations seem greater in part because the  daily changes in the Dow index are large. "If we split the Dow, we wouldn't  feel like things are as volatile as they are," she said.  </P> <P> But analysts say if there is not a long-term increase in volatility, the  markets are without question unusually unstable this month. They blamed  investors' insecurities about weak corporate earnings, interest rates and the  world economy.  </P> <P> And many see more wild swings ahead.  </P> <P> Edward Lavarnway, director of options trading at First Albany Corp., says in  the past four weeks the S&amp;P 500 index has been about 50% more volatile than  normal, as judged by the statistical measures called standard deviations.  "Right now, investors don't know which way to turn," he says.  </P></p>

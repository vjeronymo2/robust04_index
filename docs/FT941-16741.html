			<p>940108 FT  08 JAN 94 / Bifu warns on performance pay The banking ombudsman is to be warned by Bifu, the banking union, that moves to put bank staff on performance pay will lead to growing friction with customers. The union said yesterday that it feared that performance targets and the scrapping of traditional pay structures would mean more 'high-pressure' selling of products. Lloyds Bank last year introduced merit pay, and more than 75 per cent of its staff received it, with average increases of 3.4 per cent. Lloyds intends to maintain the scheme this year while the other clearing banks have indicated to Bifu that they would like to discuss performance pay shortly. Many building societies have already introduced performance pay.</p>

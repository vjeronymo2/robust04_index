Today, the Angolan head of state will  have lunch with Francois Mitterrand.

They will have to  play a role in the country's political future, French  Cooperation Minister Michel Roussin said. He added that before  relaunching its cooperation [programs], the international  community should make sure that any agreement between the  government and UNITA [National Union for the Total Independence  of Angola] be a stable one. [passage omitted]    The French interior minister wanted to clarify the situation  about UNITA's friendship with France. It [the friendship] has  been apparently replaced by state-to-state relations. However,  the military embargo remains. [passage omitted]</p>

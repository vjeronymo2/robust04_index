			<p>930821 FT  21 AUG 93 / Unitary v water's edge: seeking a company tax deal: A look at how the Californians do it - and how the British want it done THE war over California's system of unitary taxation has dragged on for so long now that views on both sides have become deeply entrenched. But the stakes, both in a series of lawsuits that could reach the Supreme Court soon and in a potentially damaging war of retaliation between the British and US tax authorities, are high, and the search for a solution appears to be gathering steam. Around Dollars 900m (Pounds 600m) is at issue in the suit brought against California's tax authorities by Barclays Bank of Britain, along with other similar cases which depend on its outcome. Another Dollars 3.1bn is involved in closely linked suits brought by US-based multinational companies. In addition, retaliation ordered by the UK government, due to take effect on January 1 if the dispute is not settled, could cost Californian companies with UK subsidiaries some Pounds 250m. The row concerns California's system for assessing how much of a company's income should be taxed in the state, simple enough for a corner shop that does business in only one place, but much more complicated for a group with operations around the world. International tax treaties are almost universally built on the 'arm's length' principle: taxable profits for a subsidiary in one country will be assessed as though it were conducting its business independently, and products it buys from its parents will be priced as though they were bought from an unrelated third party. The unitary system, on the other hand, calculates the worldwide income of the company, and assesses the tax due in proportion to the percentage of the group's property, payroll and sales in the state. The problem is that tax authorities in one country will only recognise that companies have already paid taxes in another country if they are calculated according to internationally agreed principles, so a company taxed on the unitary basis by California may end up being taxed a second time elsewhere on the same income. Different companies may benefit from either approach, depending on their circumstances. It depends on whether a company earns most of its profits in the place where most of its property and employees are based. A California company with lots of new overseas subsidiaries which are losing money in their first years of operation would be taxed less under the unitary system because these losses would be counted in its worldwide income. While opposition to unitary taxation is led by the UK, not all British companies operating in California spurn it. British Petroleum has spoken in favour of unitary assessment at hearings of the California legislature. Although one would never guess it by the furious arguments over the issue, unitary assessments in fact ceased to be obligatory in California as a result of changes in the tax law in 1986 and 1988. Instead, companies can elect to be taxed under the 'water's edge' system, in which only activities inside the US are considered. Britain's practical concerns over this system, which would all be addressed by the bill now expected to pass the California legislature by the middle of September, are the fee charged to those who choose the water's edge system; some complicated paperwork imposed only on companies choosing water's edge; and the franchise tax board's right to override the choice of water's edge. 'We are moving in the direction of completely eliminating all perceived discrimination against those who prefer the water's edge,' says Mr Brad Sherman, chairman of the California state board of equalisation and a member of the franchise tax board, who has taken the lead in the search for a solution. But the UK also objects to the continued existence of unitary assessment as an option, and makes it clear it is looking for a mandatory water's edge system. 'Anything less would fall short of that preferred solution,' says a senior UK Treasury official. 'I think they so hate worldwide unitary taxation that they wish to stamp it out,' comments Mr Sherman. Mr Peter Welch, chairman of the Unitary Tax Campaign, a grouping of British companies that has been fighting the California system for years, is worried that other states may be waiting to move to unitary assessments if California is allowed to keep the system on its own books - as they did in the 1970s and 1980s before the threat of retaliation forced most to pull back. California's threadbare state finances would actually benefit from a mandatory water's edge approach. Any time a company can choose between two systems of assessment, it will logically choose the system which costs it least. Removing this choice would generate an estimated Dollars 155m-Dollars 175m in additional tax revenue. But for that very reason, efforts to promote mandatory water's edge assessment have died in the legislature in the face of concerted opposition from California business, which wants desperately to keep the choice. 'I think mandatory water's edge is a wonderful idea. Unfortunately it is not on the table,' says Mr Sherman. One of the great ironies of the unitary tax battle is that Barclays Bank is now probably the party with the least interest in seeing California and the UK settle their differences.</p>

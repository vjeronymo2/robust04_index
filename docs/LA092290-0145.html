			<p><P> September 22, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS': IS IT COMEDY OR BIGOTRY?  </P> <P> The complaints against "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All To You,"  registered by Costa Mesa residents John and Ernie Feeney as being  "anti-religious bigotry," are totally ludicrous ("Pair Seek to Close Play in  Costa Mesa as 'Anti-Religious,' " Sept. 12). I don't know when I have spent a  more enjoyable afternoon filled with lots of delightful laughs!  </P> <P> It seems that some people . . . state that this play "goes beyond satire and  viciously attacks the beliefs of the Catholic Church." Is it the truth that  offends the Feeneys? If the play hadn't presented the truth about Catholic  dogma, then there is nothing to be upset about!  </P> <P> We are all spirits housed in the body, so where is our spirituality toward God  instead of dogmas of various religious faiths? Dogmas did not come from God!  </P> <P> "Sister Mary Ignatius" and "The Actor's Nightmare" were excellent and gave many  people much needed laughter. I have certainly seen PG-13 movies that were not  as funny and certainly were more offensive in language, dress and love scenes  than this play.  </P> <P> Get Spiritual, not Religious! They are two different things. God is spirit and  we are letting church leaders dictate to us religious dogmas and symbolism, not  the spirituality of God.  </P> <P> Grants from the government have most certainly been squandered in many more  wasteful and sinful ways than any grant received by the Costa Mesa Civic  Playhouse.  </P> <P> I am sure God and his Son, Jesus, had some good chuckles with "Sister Many  Ignatius."  </P> <P> H.A.

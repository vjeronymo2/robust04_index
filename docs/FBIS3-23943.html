The refugees came to Azerbaijan in  earlier times and are still coming. They did not always expect  that a good destiny awaited them in Azerbaijan...But, about this  a bit later.    The majority of people coming to Azerbaijan have been  "southerners" -- Iranian Azeris. Iranian refugees came to  Azerbaijan even during the time of Tsarist Russia. They were  basically dissatisfied with the political situation in Iran,  they were participants in the national liberation struggle and  the unemployed who wished to earn money to buy a piece of bread.  These emigrants functioned freely on the territory of Tsarist  Russia and did what they wished. No matter that the interests of  Tsarist Russia in Azerbaijan coincided with the interests of  neighboring Iran, the Tsarist government was unable to send the  refugees back, or return them to their own homeland. Even then  domestic opinion was taken into consideration.    Later, during the period of Soviet Russia, even newer armies  of refugees began to come to Azerbaijan from Iran. These,  basically, did not accept the rule of Reza Shah and were  national freedom fighters, headed by Heydar Emioghlu. At first,  the Soviet state met them with great sympathy. But a few years  later, Mirjefer Baghyrov, at Stalin's order, imprisoned these  refugees as "doubtful persons," and returned them to Iran where  some were hanged and some exiled to Iran's southern provinces.    After the S. Pishevari movement a number of members of the  Azerbaijan Democratic Party tried to emigrate from Iran to  Azerbaijan. At the last moment, the emigres met with automobile  accidents, were shot, or exiled. All of this happened on the  territory of the USSR.    The number of refugees did not diminish even after the  victory of the Islamic revolution in Iran. On the contrary, they  significantly increased. In the period after the revolution, the  fate of the refugees coming to Azerbaijan was somewhat  different. Only a few of these refugees, those who were  dissatisfied with the political situation in the USSR, went back  to Iran. (Employees of the KGB put them back over the border to  Iran.) The Soviet state gave some of them visas and they set  forth for the West. As for most of the refugees, normal  conditions were established for them. In some places of  residence, additional amenities were given to these refugees.  The last emigre wave from Iran took place during the Elchibey  presidency. At this time some of the refugees came with the  desire to live in democratic, independent Azerbaijan, and  others, simply, because their security was not guaranteed in  Iran. And in high circles in Azerbaijan granting them  citizenship was even discussed...[passage illegible]    In our opinion, if such a step were taken, it could create  very unpleasant consequences for us. There is a notion in the  West that the Azerbaijan Republic has little concern for the  Helsinki Convention and UN resolutions. According to UN  resolutions every individual has the right to live in the  country of his choice and the ruling powers of each country are  obligated to create normal conditions for the refugees.    But, at the same time, peoples of our neighbor country have  negative feelings toward Azerbaijan, and the faith of the  democratic forces and the national liberation movement of Iran  in independent Azerbaijan is being shaken.    And finally, ties between Northern and Southern Azerbaijan  could weaken.</p>

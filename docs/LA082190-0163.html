			<p><P> August 21, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> HOLDOUTS;  </P> <P> BEARS, MCMICHAEL MAKE NO PROGRESS  </P> <P> The Chicago Bears and holdout defensive tackle Steve McMichael remained at an  impasse after the latest contract talks failed to resolve their differences.  </P> <P> No new negotiations were scheduled after McMichael and his agent met for more  than two hours Monday with Bears finance director Ted Phillips.  </P> <P> And with just two exhibition games to go before the regular season starts, the  stalemate frustrated Coach Mike Ditka.  </P> <P> "There seems no sense of urgency, and that's always bothersome," Ditka said.  "If there is a sense or urgency, you get it done. You don't vacillate and  jockey for position. You meet head-on and say, 'Hey, let's talk about this  thing.' "  </P> <P> The team originally offered to raise McMichael's $500,000 contract to $775,000  this year. But that offer was withdrawn after McMichael rejected it and missed  the start of training camp July 26.  </P></p>

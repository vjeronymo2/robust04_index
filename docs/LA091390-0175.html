			<p><P> September 13, 1990, Thursday, Ventura County Edition  </P> <P> FOR THE KIDS TIDE POOLS;  </P> <P> WATER WONDERS;  </P> <P> THE CHANNEL ISLANDS VISITOR CENTER OFFERS A CLOSE-UP VIEW OF LIFE ABOVE AND  BELOW WATER.  </P> <P> Park Ranger Pat Hackney reached into the indoor tide pool at the Channel  Islands National Park Visitor Center and pulled out a round, bumpy sea  cucumber.  </P> <P> "Want to touch it?" he asked one of the kids surrounding him by the tide pool.  </P> <P> "Yuck," was her answer.  </P> <P> That's not surprising, given the disgusting manners of the sea cucumber. It has  the unusual ability to upchuck its intestines to distract its enemies. Then it  simply regrows them.  </P> <P> That's but one curious fact about the marine life in the artificial tide pool  at the Ventura Harbor. Hackney held up a strand of kelp and showed that it  grows at the astonishing rate of 18 inches a day. Then he picked up a Wavy Top  Turban Snail and pointed to its "trap door" that enables it to crawl inside its  shell to be safe from enemies.  </P> <P> The tide pool -- also home to abalone, scallops, anemones, starfish, crabs and  coral -- is an example of the sea life that can be found in the Santa Barbara  Channel. The little pools are what is left behind when the tide goes out.  </P> <P> This indoor pool is a gathering spot for children and parents on Saturday and  Sunday at 3:30 p.m. when Hackney or other rangers feed the pool dwellers. Not  that the inhabitants need the handout of mussels. They get what they need from  the kelp. The morsels of mussel are an added treat and give the 20 or so  onlookers a chance to see and hear more about the fish.  </P> <P> Hackney dropped a mussel tidbit near a crab and in less than a second it was  gone. Another crab hauled away a shell with a morsel on it. Hackney fed a  little piece of kelp to an abalone.  </P> <P> He said tide pools are not easy to find around Ventura. But they are prevalent  around the Channel Islands or at Carpinteria State Beach and farther north  along the coast.  </P> <P> The visitor center at the end of Spinnaker Drive has a lot to offer for free.  On Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m., one of the rangers gives a 30- to 40-minute  program in the center's auditorium on topics related to the Channel Islands.  </P> <P> On a recent Saturday, Ranger David Ethell talked about the endangered  California Brown Pelican that breeds on West Anacapa Island, the only breeding  spot for the birds in the Western United States.  </P> <P> The birds live almost entirely on anchovies. They dive-bomb for fish from  heights of 30 to 50 feet.  </P> <P> "They put their wings behind them, open their beaks and go for it," said  Ethell, standing next to a stuffed pelican.  </P> <P> Pelican numbers dwindled to a precious few during the 1960s because the  chemical DDT got into the food chain, Ethell said. Because of it, their egg  shells were too thin and would break when the 35-pound birds sat on them. DDT  was banned in 1972, and the bird population increased.  </P> <P> The rangers present other programs on such topics as whales and the Chumash  Indians. In "Pinnapeds on Parade," they dress a child from the audience in a  life preserver, put fins on his hands and feet to simulate flippers and cover  him with fake fur to show how the seals and sea lions adapt to marine life.  </P> <P> In the Chumash program, a ranger talks about how the Indians lived off the sea  and how they traveled across the Santa Barbara Channel in their canoes made of  driftwood logs.  </P> <P> The center includes a museum of sorts that illustrates how the Indians  survived. Children can pretend they are grinding grain like the Indians did  using sand, a rock mortar and pestle.  </P> <P> Children can handle caliche, sand castings of once live plants. They can see an  example of a caliche ghost forest, similar to the eerie outcroppings on the  islands. They can see a stuffed island fox and find out what other plants and  animals can be found on the islands. The center also sells books, maps and  posters.  </P> <P> For a better view of the islands and Ventura, visitors can climb up to the  center's observation deck to use the telescopes. They can also see a 25-minute  film about the islands.  </P> <P> </P> <P> * WHERE AND WHEN: The Channel Islands National Park Visitor Center, located at  the Ventura Harbor at the end of Spinnaker Drive, is open daily from 8 a.m. to  5 p.m. For information, call 644-8262.  </P></p>

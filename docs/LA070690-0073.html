			<p><P> July 6, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Spelling Entertainment Idles Sale Plans: Spelling Entertainment, which  announced Sept. 29 that it was exploring a sale to help reduce parent Great  American Communications Co.'s debt load, said it did not find satisfactory any  of the recent bids submitted to buy the company.  </P> <P> Spelling is 46% owned by GACC, which in turn is controlled by Cincinnati  investor Carl M. Lindner. GACC had put Spelling up for sale in order to pay off  $125 million in reset notes due in October, but that debt is now being  restructured. A senior Spelling executive did not rule out an eventual sale of  the company if a buyer makes an attractive bid.  </P></p>

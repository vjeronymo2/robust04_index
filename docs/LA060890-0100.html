			<p><P> June 8, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MOVIE REVIEW;  </P> <P> 'BASHU': BEIZAI'S TESTAMENT TO POWER OF LOVE  </P> <P> There's nothing in the subtitles to tell us, but it's clear that the  bombardment with which the wondrous "Bashu, the Little Stranger" (at the AMC  Santa Monica 7) commences is an Iraqi assault. The location is southern Iran  along the Persian Gulf, and in a flaming village the camera picks up a small  boy who manages to stowaway aboard a truck, which he alights after passing  through vast stretches of desert to the verdant rural Far North around the  Caspian Sea.  </P> <P> This boy, a dark, handsome 10-year-old named Bashu (Adnan Afravian) might as  well be an alien from another planet. The peasantry, whose way of life has  changed little over the millenia, find his Arabic dialect incomprehensible --  never mind that he can't understand its dialect either -- and refer to him as a  piece of coal because of his dusky skin. Even the bold-featured Nai (Susan  Taslimi), as beautiful as she is sturdy, whose two small children have found  him in the fields, casts a stone at him. But you know very well that this  radiant earth mother is eventually going to take him in.  </P> <P> There's much of Anna Magnani in Taslimi's gestures and volcanic talent -- in  her tenderness and passion and humor. This superbly gifted actress and the  equally resourceful Afravian take this film way beyond sentimentality. The  flowering of Nai's love for Bashu parallels his own struggle to find a place in  a totally foreign and frequently hostile environment.  </P> <P> "Bashu, the Little Stranger" is a pure joy in which there are absolutely no  false moves and both laughter as well as tears. Every movement of the camera,  its every placement, its every composition, indeed, every cut in the film is  exactly right, serving unobtrusively to tell a story.  </P> <P> Yet because the film's veteran writer-director Bahram Beizai, aided by the  extraordinary cinematographer Firooz Malekzadeh, is first and foremost a  storyteller, all sorts of subtle implications and symbols arise, in regard to  anti-war as well as anti-racist sentiments. (Iranian audiences will probably  suspect that rather than "job-hunting" Nai's husband is actually off to war --  especially considering his condition upon his return.)  </P> <P> "Bashu, the Little Stranger" is finally a testament to the transforming power  of love and its ability to transcend the limits of experience, education and  ethnicity. Although just short of two hours, "Bashu, the Little Stranger"  (Times-rated Mature; too intense for small children) is always brisk and  lively; it's as modest as it is flawless.  </P></p>

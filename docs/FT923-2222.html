Despite a reduction of gross margins in the second half, pre-tax profits for the 12 months to May 31 jumped some 38 per cent, from a depressed Pounds 775,000 to Pounds 1.07m. Exports accounted for 44 per cent of turnover marginally ahead at Pounds 15.6m. There were record orders for the autumn/winter collections. Mr Christopher Norland, chairman, said that bad debts increased reflecting late deliveries from fabric and sub-contract manufacturing suppliers and slower payments by customers.

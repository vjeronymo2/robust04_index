			<p>930512 FT  12 MAY 93 / Kinkel's visit to Zagreb CROATIA'S military support for the Bosnian Croats will come under sharp criticism when Mr Klaus Kinkel, Germany's foreign minister, makes his first visit to Zagreb on Friday, writes Judy Dempsey. He will have talks with President Franjo Tudjman and Mr Zdenko Skrabalo, the Croatian foreign minister, and is expected to ask why Croatia continues to back Bosnia's Croats militarily. Requests for German economic aid to reconstruct the Croatian economy are unlikely to be high on the agenda as long the area remains unstable.</p>

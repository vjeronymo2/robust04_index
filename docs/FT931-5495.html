			<p>930305 FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cookson poised to join rights issue queue COOKSON GROUP, the industrial materials company, is expected today to announce a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise about Pounds 200m. The money will be used to repay borrowings and invest in business development. The company was understood last night to be in meetings with its advisers, Lazard Brothers, to arrange pricing of the issue. Cookson will also bring forward the announcement of its results for the year to December 31, which are expected to be in line with market expectations for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 72m, a sharp rebound from Pounds 34m in 1991. It will be Cookson's second rights issue in two years. In March 1991 the company launched a Pounds 82.8m rights at the same time as announcing a fall in profits and a cut in the dividend. A hectic acquisitions spree in the late 1980s had left it heavily burdened by debt. Management changes in 1991 brought in Mr Richard Oster as group managing director and Mr Robert Malpas as chairman. Disposals have rationalised the group around its core materials business. Cookson's shares have responded strongly, rising from 122p last September to 213p yesterday, a gain of 2p on the day. The new management has won backing in the City and one analyst said last night the rights 'Won't be too badly received'. Cookson is expected to announce net debt of about Pounds 280m at the end of last year, implying gearing of some 63 per cent compared to 53 per cent at the interim stage in June. One analyst said gearing could rise to more than 80 per cent this year, taking account of the group's convertibles and exchange rates. 'You are looking at a balance sheet leaving little room for development,' the analyst said.</p>

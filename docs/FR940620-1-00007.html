			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The Council expressed concern that the standard for reporting noninsider transgressions was vague and difficult to apply. The Council noted that determining when a substantial basis exists for identifying a suspect can be complex and raises questions as to whether criminal intent can be inferred. The Council suggested that this determination should be vested in System general counsels or their attorney designees. The FCA expects that, in reporting noninsider transgressions, an institution will often be able to use its own judgment in determining whether it appears that a criminal violation has occurred. In complex cases, however, institutions should continue to feel free to obtain advice, legal or otherwise, as necessary. A System association may always consult with its affiliated district bank during consideration of all the facts and circumstances to determine whether it is more probable than not that a criminal activity occurred.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council also commented that an institution should have discretion on whether to report known or suspected criminal activities of State criminal laws to State law enforcement authorities. In response to this comment, the proposed regulation was amended to provide that nothing in this part shall be construed as reducing, in any way, an institution's general responsibility to report criminal activities to the appropriate investigatory and/or law enforcement agencies, whether Federal, State or local. Therefore, institutions would have to be cognizant of, and take the necessary steps to comply with, State reporting requirements. The appropriate law enforcement agency would then decide whether or not such acts constitute a violation of a criminal statute.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council was concerned that the proposed regulation did not identify whether a Farm Credit Bank (FCB) or a Federal land bank association (FLBA) would report known or suspected criminal activities when the FLBA services the loans of the FCB. Due to this concern, the FCA amended &sect;617.2(a) to clarify that an FCB would have the responsibility to refer known or suspected criminal activities identified by the servicing FLBA to the appropriate law enforcement agency.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council commented that the proposed criminal referral regulation appears to make the criminal referral process burdensome because the institution lacks the discretion not to refer known or suspected criminal violations above the threshold amounts. At this time, it appears that any additional burden would be slight and offset by the regulation's benefits, such as the promotion of efficiency and timeliness in reporting, investigating, and prosecuting known or suspected criminal activities. Also, the regulation would standardize the reporting process and ensure that all individuals, including borrowers, employees, officers and directors, are treated equally. It is believed that the proposed regulation, which conforms to those proposed and final regulations of other financial regulatory agencies, would improve the law enforcement agencies' response to System institutions' reports of criminal activities. However, commenters may want to provide empirical information on the cost of compliance, as requested above.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council questioned the institution's role or ability to make a recommendation concerning prosecution. The Council suggested that reporting ``minor'' violations could hamper System relationships with the U.S. Attorney as well as with its customers. While the regulation establishes threshold referral levels, an institution is free, nonetheless, to express its view on whether prosecution does or does not appear to be warranted to the Federal authorities, including a U.S. Attorney or other investigatory agency. A well-reasoned recommendation against prosecution in appropriate cases should go far toward addressing the Council's concern without undermining the uniformity that the referral requirements seek to promote.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council commented that the 14-day period to report criminal activity was insufficient to investigate, document, review, and submit referral information. On further reflection, the FCA agrees. To ensure thorough documentation and reporting by System institutions, the FCA has amended the proposed regulation, increasing the reporting period to 30 calendar days from the date of discovery of the known or suspected criminal violation. Nonetheless, System institutions would be encouraged to submit a criminal referral report as soon as possible following the discovery of a reportable known or suspected criminal activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Council commented that it was uncertain as to when the period for reporting a criminal referral begins. Upon further consideration, the proposed regulation was amended to address this concern. The reporting period would begin when management has discovered that there is a known or suspected criminal activity. In the alternative, the reporting period would begin when management should have discovered that there was a known or suspected criminal activity. This amendment is believed to be appropriate because management must ensure the institution's safety and soundness and should be diligent in the exercise of their attendant duties, e.g., the timely identification and reporting of known or suspected criminal activity, and in the adequate investigation and documentation of such criminal activity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

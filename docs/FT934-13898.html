			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / December long gilt future reaches new contract high December long gilt future reached a new contract high of 114.26 after the Bank of England announced there would be no gilt auction in November and dealers speculated that October's auction may be the last this year. The record size of the October auction, slated at Pounds 3.5bn, and the government's well advanced funding programme sparked speculation that the Bank might also cancel the December auction. There would be no gilt auction next month because of the timing of the Budget. Page 21 Lex, Page 20</p>

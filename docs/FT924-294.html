			<p>921229 FT  29 DEC 92 / Arts: Today's Television A hidden camera in Truckers (8.00 C4) reveals how an international lorry driver talks and bribes his way through border controls and police checks in Europe. Winter Dreams (BBC2, also at 8.00) is a ballet by Kenneth MacMillan which he re-worked for television some time before his death in October. Inspired by Chekhov's 'Three Sisters' and set to music by Tchaikovsky, it is a study of the passions and longings of the three sisters who are danced by Darcey Bussell, Viviana Durante and Nicola Tranah. Rowan Atkinson's 'silent comedy' skits leave me stone cold so I shall not watch Merry Christmas Mr Bean (8.30 ITV) but millions will, and the programme may well win awards like its predecessors. However I shall be trying the opening episode of The Vampyr since its full title is The Vampyr - A Soap Opera (9.00 BBC2) and the idea of up-dating a 19th century romantic opera seems interesting. It continues daily until Sunday. That is followed (9.25) by a one-off black comedy from BBC Scotland, The Bogie Man, starring splendid Robbie Coltrane as a man of many disguises.</p>

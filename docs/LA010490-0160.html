			<p><P> January 4, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BRIEFLY  </P> <P> Wells Fargo Appeals Lien: The San Francisco-based bank appealed in U.S.  District Court in Los Angeles for relief from a statewide lien on its real  estate holdings obtained by Ted Hays, a 78-year-old former developer.  </P> <P> Hays recently won a $700,000-judgment against the bank for a mistake that Hays  said ruined his business. Wells Fargo claimed that it was exempt from a  requirement to post a bond while it appealed the Superior Court judgment,  prompting Hays to seek the lien. A hearing is scheduled in federal court today  on the bank's request to lift the lien, which prevents Wells Fargo from selling  any of the affected properties.  </P></p>

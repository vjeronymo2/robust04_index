			<p>940422 FT  22 APR 94 / Observer: Ex-PM for hire How far is ex-Australian premier Bob Hawke prepared to go in his bid to supplement his parliamentary pension? Quite a long way it seems, if recent comments by Conrad Black, the Canadian newspaper magnate, are to be believed. Black yesterday told an Australian senate committee hearing into foreign ownership of Australia's print media that Hawke had offered to act as his organisation's 'eyes and ears' in Canberra in return for a Dollars 50,000 fee. The offer was turned down because 'we didn't think that he was the best person to tell us what Mr Keating was thinking', said Black, in an apparent reference to the bitter Labour party leadership battle between the two former friends. So much for Hawke's chances of getting a seat with the rest of the great and the good on Black's Daily Telegraph board.</p>

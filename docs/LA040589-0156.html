			<p><P> April 5, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> PUBLIC AFFAIRS SHOWS DECLINE 51%, NADER SAYS  </P> <P> Public affairs programming on television has decreased by more than half in the  last 10 years as a result of deregulation by the Federal Communications  Commission, says a public interest group started by Ralph Nader.  </P> <P> The group, Essential Information, said there has been a 51% decrease in  issues-oriented public affairs TV programs since 1979.  </P> <P> The group called for re-establishment of the FCC's Fairness Doctrine, which the  agency repealed in 1987, and for a return of so-called 5-5-10 rules that  required broadcasters to devote certain percentages of their broadcasting hours  to non-entertainment programming.  </P> <P> The report, by Jim Donahue, was attacked immediately by broadcasters and by an  FCC official who said the results were "incredible."  </P> <P> John Kamp, an FCC spokesman, said the report "sounds terribly bogus."  </P> <P> As for the Fairness Doctrine, Kamp said the "commission found that it decreased  the amount of public interest programming available . . . which was the  opposite of what it was intended to do."  </P> <P> </P> <P> 'Rogue Agency'  </P> <P> At a news conference, Nader said the FCC under Chairman Dennis R. Patrick and  his predecessor, Mark S. Fowler, was a "rogue agency that has dangerously  transformed power from the public to private commerce in sheer violation of the  (1934 Communications Act)."  </P> <P> Nader said the FCC believed that marketplace pressures would force station  owners to broadcast issues-oriented programs.  </P> <P> That has not happened, Nader said, and the FCC refuses "to respect the access  rights, the response rights of the audience."  </P> <P> The study by Essential Information, which Nader founded in 1982, examined TV  listings for programs at 217 stations in 50 markets on seven days in early  1988.  </P></p>

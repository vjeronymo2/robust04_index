			<p>BFN     [Text] Vienna, June 21 KYODO -- North Korea has extended  visas for the two inspectors of the International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) who remained at the nuclear complex in Yongbyon,  IAEA sources said Monday.    The sources interpreted the visa extension shortly ahead of  an expected meeting between U.S. and North Korean diplomats  Tuesday as a conciliatory gesture from Pyongyang to set the tone  for the talks.    The inspectors' visas, which would have expired at the end  of  this month, were extended for two weeks, they said.    North Korean President Kim Il-song promised former U.S.  President Jimmy Carter during unofficial talks in Pyongyang last  week he would allow the two officials to stay.    Commenting on Carter's trip, U.S. President Bill Clinton saw  "hopeful signs" earlier Monday for an end to the standoff over  North Korea's alleged nuclear weapons program.    Speaking in a live TV interview, Clinton said the U.S. will  resume high-level talks with North Korea provided Pyongyang  keeps its promise to freeze its controversial nuclear program.    Upon return from Pyongyang Carter declared Sunday that "I  personally believe the crisis is over" and that Kim "wants to be  sure" the crisis on the Korean peninsula is over.    North Korea in may started to remove the fuel rods in its  5-megawatt reactor in Yongbyon, some 90 kilometers north of  Pyongyang, without the required agency supervision.    The U.N. nuclear watchdog pulled out its team in late May  after negotiations with Pyongyang broke down over the  inspectors' demand to be able to select, segregate and secure  some 300 fuel rods for measurement needed to verify whether  nuclear material had been diverted in the past.    In response to a request by the U.N. Security Council, the  agency, however, retained two inspectors to report on the  removal activities.    They have since been observing the fuel removal and were  allowed to continue checks of surveillance cameras at Yongbyon  facilities.    According to their report, reactor workers have meanwhile  discharged all spent nuclear fuel rods, but have not yet started  to load the reactor core with new ones.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Andrey Palariya] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 23 Feb -- The U.S. Government has brought  charges against CIA employee Aldrich Ames and his wife Maria  Ames, accusing them of spying for the former Soviet Union and  then Russia. The U.S. Justice Department said that Ames and his  wife were arrested on Monday during a joint operation conducted  by the CIA and the FBI. According to the information of the  Justice Department, the Ames had been spying against the United  States since 1985 and had received more than $1.5 million for  that, which they deposited in bank accounts in the United States  and abroad.    Yuriy Kobaladze, head of the Russian Foreign Intelligence  Service press office, whom an ITAR-TASS correspondent contacted  by telephone this morning, declined to comment on the case of  the arrest of the U.S. couple accused of spying for Russia.  However, he remarked that "this question should be put, rather,  to the CIA."    At the same time it seems that there's no point in blowing  up  a political scandal out of this episode. After all, even in a  changing world, intelligence remains intelligence with the  specific means and interests that are peculiar to it.  Incidentally, the leadership of the United States and other  Western countries have confirmed on several occasions that they  have no intention of curtailing intelligence activity against  Russia.</p>

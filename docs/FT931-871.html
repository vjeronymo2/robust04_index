			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / International Company News: Campaign against Clark sale A CAMPAIGN against the sale of C&amp;J Clark is being organised by members of the family which has controlled Britain's largest shoe manufacturer for 167 years. Many members of the family and the company's employees are believed to object strongly to the recommendation by a majority of the board that Berisford, the property and agribusiness group, be allowed to bid for the company. Meanwhile, the four directors who have opposed the tender process yesterday presented a series of alternatives to allow Clark's to remain independent, yet provide an exit for those shareholders seeking to sell their stakes. Berisford beat rivals Fii, the UK shoe manufacturer which was offering Pounds 156m, and a consortium of existing shareholders, backed by Electra Investment Trust, to win the recommendation with its estimated Pounds 160m bid. The bid from Berisford has sparked fears among employees of widespread redundancies, while many members of the family feel an obligation to the company's Quaker inheritance and its UK manufacturing operations. Berisford, for its part, has said it remains committed to shoe manufacturing in the UK, although Clark's must operate in an internationally competitive environment.</p>

			<p>940728 FT  28 JUL 94 / UK Company News: TI to get more from Snecma joint venture TI Group, the specialist engineer, yesterday said it would retain a greater share of profits than previously anticipated from Messier-Dowty, its newly-formed landing gear joint venture with Snecma, the French state-owned aero-engine manufacturer. Negotiators extracted improved terms from Snecma after revised profit forecasts for the joint venture company suggested there would be a lower than expected contribution from Messier's spare parts business. Under the original deal the two companies agreed TI would receive an additional Pounds 11m of any profits generated by Messier-Dowty in its first three years. The agreement was drawn up to reflect a Pounds 30m differential between the value of Dowty Landing Gear, which TI acquired two years ago, and Messier-Bugatti Landing Gear. However, the lower contribution expected from Messier meant the differential has widened since the deal was first announced last summer. A completion agreement signed yesterday by the two sides showed that the Pounds 11m limit on TI's additional share of the profits had been lifted, and the group would instead receive 90 per cent of the joint venture's profits in 1995, 80 per cent in 1996 and 62.5 per cent in 1997. Thereafter, profits will be shared on a 50-50 basis. 'TI should receive a somewhat higher return from the joint venture during the first three years than it would have received from Dowty Landing Gear as a stand alone business,' said Mr Tony Edwards, chief executive of Dowty Aerospace.</p>

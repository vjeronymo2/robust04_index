			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Indian brokers start protest strike Indian stockbrokers went on strike yesterday in protest at a decision by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi), the market watchdog, to suspend forward trading in securities. The authorities imposed the ban on Monday in an attempt to slow a rapid surge in share prices, up 29 per cent from early November as investors rushed back into the market in large numbers for the first time since last year's Rs40bn (Pounds 850m) Bombay securities market scandal. The intervention triggered a sharp sell-off on kerb (unofficial) markets and on the Madras Stock Exchange, the only exchange which stayed open yesterday, where the local index fell 3 per cent. The autumn rally, which took the Bombay Stock Exchange's index of leading stocks to an 18-month high, was started by overseas investors buying shares for the first time since India last year opened its stock market to foreigners. The authorities acted this week out of concern that too many local investors are trying to take advantage of this wave of foreign buying by trading in the forward market, where purchasers can carry outstanding purchases from one settlement period to the next without paying for them in full, and so can acquire control of large volumes of shares with relatively little money. The informal forward market, which accounts for 70 to 90 per cent of trades, has long been a target of Sebi's attention. Officials believe its operations allow infringements of securities regulations to be disguised. Brokers say the market, called badla, is vital for efficient trading. Officials are particularly anxious to avoid a repetition of last year's scandal in which money was illegally siphoned from banks and invested in speculative stock market trading. A parliamentary committee is completing a report into the affair which is expected to pin some blame on the authorities for failing to monitor the markets adequately. The last time the forward market was suspended was during last year's scandal. This time Sebi has put no time limit on its order. It has instructed brokers to clear half their forward positions by January 6 and the rest by January 20. Brokers are furious at the board's action because forward trading accounts account for much of their business. Foreign investors expressed concern that the board's intervention increased the uncertainties of investing in India but added that the liquidation of forward positions would increase the supply of stock to long-term investors. Mr Mark Bullough, director of the Indian operation of Jardine Fleming, the international investment bank, said: 'Overall, foreign financial institutions do not appear unduly concerned by this particular regulatory change.'</p>

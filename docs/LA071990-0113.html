			<p><P> July 19, 1990, Thursday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> CERULLO CLOSE TO BUYING OUT BAKKERS' S.C. THEME PARK  </P> <P> Local evangelist Morris Cerullo may be just a few days away from closing a  $45-million deal to purchase the Heritage USA theme park in South Carolina. If  the sale goes through, Cerullo may move his San Diego-based ministry to the  park, a spokesman said.  </P> <P> U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Thurmond Bishop of Columbia, S.C., approved the  previously announced deal Wednesday but the transaction is conditional upon the  consent of two PTL creditors who are out of the country. The creditors'  lawyers, however, have said their clients will approve the agreement.  </P> <P> Cerullo, who heads World Evangelism of San Diego, agreed in May to a two-part  deal to acquire the scandal-plagued religious empire formerly run by defrocked  evangelist Jim Bakker. Cerullo is in escrow to complete the first phase, the  purchase of the PTL cable TV network for $7 million. Last month, Cerullo paid a  $1-million deposit to acquire the real estate and theme park segment of PTL.  </P> <P> "We are obviously happy with Judge Thurmond Bishop's decision to conditionally  approve our offer," Cerullo said in a prepared statement. "We are extremely  hopeful that, by next Tuesday, all the creditors will issue their approval and  we can go forward with the New Heritage USA. . . . As soon as final approvals  are achieved, we will be assembling a team of top-notch professionals to  oversee and operate the facility."  </P> <P> About 100 PTL creditors have already approved the agreement. Cerullo will  withdraw from the bidding for the park if the two remaining creditors balk at  the agreement, Cerullo spokesman Alan Elias said.  </P> <P> Dennis W. Shedd, who was appointed trustee by the bankruptcy court to manage  the liquidation of the PTL estate, has said he will sell off the park piecemeal  if he cannot find a buyer for the entire property. He did not return calls to  his Columbia office Wednesday. Cerullo will not comment on his plans for  Heritage park until the sale is final, but he does intend to renovate the  facility, according to his statement released Wednesday. Dormant since  September, the park would not be ready to operate again until sometime next  year, Elias said.  </P> <P> "He intends to run it as a for-profit business, with all the money going back  into the ministry, just like a business," Elias said. "They have $52 million in  bills to pay."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Of the Heritage USA park's 2,200 acres, only about 500 are developed. The park  now includes a 500-room hotel, another hotel of the same size under  construction, a water slide, a shopping mall and miniature railroad. Ownership  of the land is disputed by an Indian tribe that has claimed in a lawsuit that  it was illegally taken from them by the U.S. government in the 1800s.  </P> <P> Elias declined to reveal details of the financing of the deal, except to say  that it "has been secured through a line of credit by established  institutions."  </P> <P> Morris Cerullo World Evangelism ministry acquired the cable TV network by  outbidding evangelist Oral Roberts, who offered $6.3 million. That part of the  deal is scheduled to close Aug. 29, pending Federal Communications Commission  approval, Elisa said.  </P> <P> PTL broadcasting headquarters are inside Heritage USA in Fort Mill, S.C., and  Cerullo will move his TV studio and possibly his ministry's headquarters from  San Diego to the PTL facility if he purchases the park, Elias said.  </P> <P> "That's being considered by the board of directors," Elias said. Cerullo's  headquarters office in San Diego nowemploys about 40 people, he said.  </P> <P> Cerullo, a 58-year-old faith healer, has in the past declined to discuss his  ministry's finances. Founded in 1961, Worldwide Evangelism produces a daily TV  program called "Victory With Morris Cerullo" that is carried by 40 stations  nationwide. The show is also broadcast in Canada, and the ministry has  operations in Great Britain, the Philippines and Zimbabwe.  </P> <P> The evangelist has been known for ambitious but failed attempts to expand the  reach of his ministry in San Diego. He bought the downtown El Cortez Hotel and  tried to convert it into an evangelism school before selling it in 1981.  </P> <P> He also proposed a 200-acre retirement center and religious education center on  land the church owned in the Mira Mesa area, but he ended up selling the  property to a home builder.  </P> <P> PTL has been under the control of a U.S. Bankruptcy court since June, 1987, two  months after Jim Bakker resigned the ministry following a sex-and-hush-money  scandal involving former church secretary Jessica Hahn.  </P> <P> Bakker is serving a 45-year federal prison term in Minnesota on fraud and  conspiracy convictions last October for allegedly deceiving Heritage USA  investors.  </P> <P> Cerullo was once a friend of Jim Bakker and his wife, Tammy, and occasionally  appeared on the Bakkers' TV program.  </P></p>

			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Where can higher education programs operate? <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter expressed concern that the neighboring communities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> language in 2519.100 would not allow a program to operate across  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State lines.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation's intent was that higher education programs should address needs in the communities where  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the programs operate, regardless of where the institution of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> higher education is located. The regulations have been revised  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to make this clear.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2519.100 has been revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Parts 2520&hyph;2524_AmeriCorps  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (1)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Living Allowance Match <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Under the proposed regulations,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs receiving educational awards only grants were exempt  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> from the living allowance requirement. One commenter suggested  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that they should not be, arguing that it would make it more difficult for low-income individuals to participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation has revised its regulations to not allow  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> this exemption.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2522.240 has been revised.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another commenter requested that grantees be able to provide  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> their 15% match for living allowances on an in-kind basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In general, the Corporation wants to ensure that every  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> AmeriCorps participant receives a living allowance sufficient to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet reasonable expenses while participating. By definition, a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> living allowance match must be in cash. However, in certain instances where a program has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> received a waiver from providing the minimum living allowance,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Corporation will consider on a case-by-case basis waiving or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reducing the matching requirement. For example, a program that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> houses its participants may not count that housing as an in-kind  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> match, but it may be eligible to apply to have the 15% matching  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement waived or reduced.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: A section (5)(iii), allowing for waivers of the 15%  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matching requirement, has been added to &sect;2522.240(b).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Preselection of programs <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Commenters objected to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement that applicants for AmeriCorps preselect and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specifically identify in their applications the subgrantees they  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> will fund. Some commenters argued that because of the tightness of the timeline, the competitive process is likely to be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> circumvented if preselection is required.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the Corporation appreciates the difficulties  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> preselection raises in light of the timeline, for both legal and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> policy reasons this requirement has not been changed. The statute requires a State applicant  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to describe the ``jobs or positions into which participants will  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be placed'' (section 130(c)(1)). It is the Corporation's view that such  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a description would be inadequate without a corresponding description of the programs in which those jobs or positions would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be located. Moreover, section 130(b)(2) of the statute requires  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``description of the process and criteria by which the programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> were selected.'' From a policy standpoint, preselection is required in order to ensure that the Corporation funds only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-quality programs.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (3)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Diversity <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . Several commenters recommended modifications  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to the participant diversity provisions contained in &sect;2522.100.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> One commenter stated that programs that are unable to achieve racial and gender diversity should not receive Federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> funds. Conversely, other commenters expressed concern that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> racial diversity requirement may exclude eligibility minority  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> agencies that would have predominantly minority participants. A number of commenters suggested that the Corporation require  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversity of program staff and include that as an evaluation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> criterion. One commenter suggested that the Corporation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> encourage programs to engage in joint activities with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations involving participants of different backgrounds to enhance  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> community-building.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation declines to make the achievement of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversity a requirement or to establish regulatory exceptions to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the mandate that every program seek diversity. The Corporation,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in establishing the requirement that every program actively seek to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be diverse in a number of important areas, attempted to strike a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> balance between competing concerns. On the one hand, diverse  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs will help strengthen communities. On the other hand, there are some very good programs that, for legitimate substantive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reasons, will not to be able to achieve diversity in one or more  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ways. The requirement, as written, will lead to diverse programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> except in cases where diversity does not make sense or is not attainable (e.g., a professional corps program requiring  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> specific skills or education should not be required to include as  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> participants individuals who do not have such skills or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> education).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation agrees with the suggestion that programs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also should seek actively to establish a diverse staff. In many  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> cases where a program's staff is very small, it may not always be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> possible to have a staff that is diverse in all ways. Within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> these constraints, however, programs should seek to establish a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> staff that is as diverse as possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Finally, the Corporation agrees that_especially for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs that lack diversity in one or more ways_it is a good  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> idea for programs to engage in joint activities with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> organizations involving participants of different backgrounds to help build communities; programs are encouraged  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to do so where possible.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Change: &sect;2522.100(f) has been modified to include staff  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> diversity.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (4)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> 50% rule <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . One commenter recommended that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation drop the waiver provision from the requirement that at least 50% of funds going to each State go to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-need areas. (&sect;2521.30(b)(3)(iii))  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In principle, the Corporation believes strongly that each  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State should in fact do everything possible to comply with the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 50% requirement. Thus in order to attain a waiver from this provision, a State will have to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> demonstrate in an extremely compelling manner not only that there  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are not enough viable high-quality programs operating in areas of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> need within the State to meet the 50% requirement, but that it has made a good-faith effort to locate such programs. Finally,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> no waivers will be granted to individual States if it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> necessitate not complying with the 50% rule in the aggregate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Corporation is statutorily required to ensure that a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimum of 50% of the total funds going to States go to high-need areas.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> And although the Corporation is committed to meeting this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement in the aggregate, it may not always be possible to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> meet the requirement on a State-by-State basis. For example, the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Corporation's review process may result in the selection in a given  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> State of a high-quality program that does not operate in an area  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of need. If there were not other high-quality programs within  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that State that did operate in high-need areas, without the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> waiver provision the Corporation would be unable to fund the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high-quality program. For this reason, the waiver provision has  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> been retained.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (5)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Participant eligibility <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (2522.200(b)) One commenter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> stated that the regulations state that a participant must have a high-school diploma to participate, whereas in fact a diploma  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> is only required to receive the educational award.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> This section has not been changed. The regulations state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that in order to participate an individual must either have a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> high school diploma or its equivalent, commit to obtaining one, or be deemed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> unable to obtain one.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (6)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> National Leadership Pool and Recruitment <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (2522.210(b)(1)(c)) The Corporation received a number of comments  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> on the national leadership pool and recruitment requirements. One commenter suggested that the regulations allow anyone  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruited to the national leadership pool to be placed back into  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> his or her original program. The same commenter argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> programs should not be required to accept national leadership  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> pool participants; instead, the Corporation should operate a pilot  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> leadership program. Other commenters suggested that the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> &sect;2522.100 requirement that AmeriCorps programs agree to select a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> certain percentage of participants from the national and state  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recruiting pools be eliminated.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In order to maintain regulatory flexibility, these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements have not been amended. To the extent that these  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comments are incorporated into Corporation policy it will not be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> done in regulations but rather in application materials and other guidelines. However, two items should be noted: (a)  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although programs must agree to accept a certain percentage of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> nationally recruited participants, the Corporation may not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> require every program to do so, and will likely consider  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceptions on a case-by-case basis; and (b) programs will not be required to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accept leadership pool participants.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (7)  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Child Care <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> . (2522.250(a)) One commenter argued that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> child care benefits should go to prospective participants who  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have undependable child care as well as to participants who don't have child care at all.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

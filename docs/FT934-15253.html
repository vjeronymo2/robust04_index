			<p>931013 FT  13 OCT 93 / Port-au-Prince tense as armed men roam the streets THE Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince was tense yesterday, with many shops and offices closed and heavily-armed men roaming the almost empty streets. Public transport was at a standstill. Small-arms and machine-gun fire was heard through the night, following Monday's violent demonstrations which prevented the landing of US troops on a UN mission intended to oversee the restoration of democracy on the island. The offices of national radio and television were occupied by plainclothes police auxiliaries, known as 'attaches', who also led Monday's demonstrations. The UN special representative in Haiti, Mr Dante Caputo, cancelled a planned trip to Washington because of the incident. He blamed the Haitian military for Monday's incident, saying the attacks were an insult to the UN and a clear violation of the agreements signed in New York between the army and exiled president Mr Jean-Bertrand Aristide, due to return to Haiti at the end of this month under the peace plan. The USS Harlan County, carrying the troops, remained anchored outside port yesterday as US officials tried to negotiate a plan for its safe arrival. In Washington Mr Warren Christopher, secretary of state, yesterday accused Haiti's military leaders of violating the UN-mediated accord and warned that if sanctions were reimposed, they would be severe. 'By their actions, Gen (Raoul) Cedras and Chief of Police (Joseph Michel) Francois are inviting reimposition of severe economic sanctions that could affect their country and would also affect them personally,' Mr Christopher said. Gen Cedras, who led the 1991 coup which ousted Mr Aristide, condemned the violence but said he sympathised with the Haitians' outrage at the threat to their sovereignty.</p>

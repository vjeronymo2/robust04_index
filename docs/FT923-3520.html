			<p>920911 FT  11 SEP 92 / UK Company News: Imports hit Bernard Matthews LOW PRICE turkey imports from the European Community and US producers were blamed yesterday by Bernard Matthews, the Norfolk-based meat processor, for a 65 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits. In the 28 weeks to July 12 the group reported profits of Pounds 2.16m compared to Pounds 6.16m in the 1991 period, and halved its interim dividend to 1p (2p). Turnover fell by 10.3 per cent to Pounds 65.7m (Pounds 73.28m) and earnings per share fell to 1.33p (3.33p). Profits were also depressed by interest charges of Pounds 29,000 compared to interest receipts of Pounds 157,000 in the 1991 period. Mr Bernard Matthews, chairman, said the sharp reduction in profits was expected following his profits warning earlier in the year. He said that following poor Easter sales the group was experiencing extremely difficult trading conditions, especially with sales of whole turkeys and turkey meat. 'These difficulties are being caused by the very low prices offered on the UK market by both EC and US producers.' Although the company has successfully launched a range of new value-added products, and is setting up a marketing organisation to introduce its branded products into other EC countries, Mr Matthews said that in the short term the UK market is likely to remain depressed. He warned that full year profits will probably be less than half those in 1991 when profits were Pounds 13.2m.</p>

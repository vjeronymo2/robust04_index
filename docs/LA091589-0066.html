			<p><P> September 15, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: AWARDS  </P> <P> The first five winners of a new Japanese-sponsored arts prize called the  Praemium Imperiale will be announced today in New York, recognizing lifetime  achievement in architecture, music, painting, sculpture and theater/film. The  recipients, who will receive $100,000 each, are recommended by an International  Committee of Advisers composed of three former European prime ministers  (Jacques Chirac of France, Edward Heath of Britain and Amintore Fanfani of  Italy), one former West German chancellor (Helmut Schmidt) and David  Rockefeller, former chairman and chief executive officer of Chase Manhattan  Bank. Praemium Imperiale organizers expect their creation to become the  equivalent of the Nobel Prize, which does not recognize artistic fields other  than literature. ALEENE MacMINN  </P></p>

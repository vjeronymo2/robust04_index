			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE TIMES POLL;  </P> <P> LEAD INCREASES FOR FEINSTEIN AS SUPPORT WIDENS  </P> <P> Having broadened her base of support, Dianne Feinstein now leads John K. Van de  Kamp by 13 percentage points with just one month to go in their race for the  Democratic gubernatorial nomination, according to The Los Angeles Times Poll.  </P> <P> The contest appears to be changing dramatically as the June 5 election nears.  The "gender gap" has become less of a factor than it was a few weeks ago,  interviews showed. Women still support Feinstein strongly, but more men also  are moving into her camp.  </P> <P> The former San Francisco mayor likewise has broadened her base geographically.  She now is backed by every major region of the state. In fact, she is running  as well in Los Angeles County as in her native Bay Area.  </P> <P> Voters are turning their attention to the long race as the finish approaches --  and as the candidates campaign more aggressively in public and pour millions  into television and radio commercials. People are starting to focus on the  candidates' messages and becoming less inclined to choose sides based solely on  instant reflex -- "She's a woman" or "He's from L.A."  </P> <P> The Times poll found Feinstein to be leading Atty. Gen. Van de Kamp among  registered Democrats by 37% to 24%, with a large 39% still undecided. This  represents little change from a Times survey in late March, when Feinstein held  an 11-point lead.  </P> <P> By contrast, an early April survey conducted by Mervin Field's California Poll  showed the two candidates to be running virtually even.  </P> <P> The Times poll found additional good news for Feinstein: Her lead increases  among those voters considered the most likely to cast ballots. For example,  projecting a turnout of half the registered Democrats -- which is somewhat  higher than in recent gubernatorial primaries -- Feinstein's lead edges up to  15 points.  </P> <P> On another high-stakes political issue, The Times poll for the first time found  voters to be supporting Proposition 111, which would double the gasoline tax  over a 5-year period and raise the state spending limit to finance the lion's  share of an $18.5-billion transportation development plan. Voters favored the  measure by 47% to 40%, with 13% undecided.  </P> <P> A companion ballot measure, Proposition 108, which would authorize a $1-billion  bond issue to pay for light-rail transit, was supported by a much larger  margin: 63% to 23% with 14% undecided.  </P> <P> The Times poll, directed by I.A. Lewis, interviewed 1,732 registered voters by  telephone for six days ending Thursday night. Among those surveyed were 792  Democrats and 694 Republicans, plus 246 independents and members of minor  parties. The margin of error for all voters is three percentage points in  either direction. For either the Democrats or Republicans separately, the error  margin is five points.  </P> <P> U.S. Sen. Pete Wilson long ago virtually clinched the Republican gubernatorial  nomination by scaring off any major opposition in the primary. And he now is  running virtually even with either of the potential Democratic nominees in  hypothetical November matchups, the survey showed.  </P> <P> The Times poll found Democratic women preferring Feinstein over Van de Kamp by  17 points. But men also favored her by nine points, a significant increase  since the previous Times survey.  </P> <P> Feinstein led by 13 points in Los Angeles County, Van de Kamp's home turf,  where he once served as district attorney and has always had high name  recognition because of the bakery chain his family founded. She was up by eight  points in the rest of Southern California and by 10 points in the Bay Area. But  by far her biggest strength was in the rest of Northern California, where she  led by 20 points.  </P> <P> The 56-year-old Feinstein has benefited politically from her hard-line  positions on both the death penalty and abortion rights. She strongly advocates  each and this places her in the mainstream of Democratic voters, the survey  showed.  </P> <P> Among Democrats, 46% said they both "favor abortion" and "the death penalty for  murderers." And among these mainstreamers, Feinstein led Van de Kamp by 21  points.  </P> <P> Van de Kamp, 54, personally opposes abortion and the death penalty. But he  supports a woman's right to decide for herself whether to have an abortion and  has pledged to carry out the death penalty if he is elected governor. These  seeming conflicts between personal beliefs and public positions, however,  confuse many voters and leave them skeptical, previous Times surveys have  found.  </P> <P> In the latest poll, only 13% of Democratic voters both supported abortion and  opposed capital punishment, the liberal positions advocated by most party  leaders. These voters gave Feinstein only a slight edge. A more conservative  group that both opposed abortion and favored capital punishment represented 16%  of the Democratic Party. And among these voters, the candidates were running  virtually even.  </P> <P> Overall, Democratic voters favored abortion by 5 to 2 and supported the death  penalty by more than 3 to 1, the survey showed.  </P> <P> The Times poll also was told by nearly three-fourths of the registered voters  interviewed that they would be willing to have their taxes raised for certain  specific purposes -- a level of public acquiescence that might surprise elected  officials who still fear the prospect of renewed uprisings from the tax revolt  of the late 1970s.  </P> <P> For example, 51% said they would accept a tax increase for education. Among  other problems deemed worthy of tax increases were crime (44%), the environment  (39%), health care (38%), the homeless (37%) and affordable housing (34%).  </P> <P> The disquieting news for Gov. George Deukmejian and the coalition of political,  business and labor leaders pushing Proposition 111 was that voters appeared to  be lukewarm toward the idea of increasing taxes for transportation development.  Only 30% supported the idea.  </P> <P> And leaving aside both Propositions 111 and 108, there was only tepid support  for the concept of raising taxes to pay for either new road construction or  mass transportation systems. Voters tended to prefer keeping transportation  taxes at their present level, though they were a bit more inclined to support  tax increases for public transit than for highways.  </P> <P> Still, the Times poll found evidence that it is not the prospect of a gas tax  increase, per se, that bothers voters the most about Proposition 111. By 5 to  1, they said their "greatest concern" about the sweeping proposal is not the  prospect of paying higher taxes at the gas pump, but of not having these new  taxes "spent wisely" by state government.  </P> <P> Nearly four in 10 people described their local traffic as "very congested." One  in five said they have "seriously thought about moving" to escape congestion.  </P> <P> But perhaps thinking of last October's devastating Bay Area earthquake, voters  by 3 to 1 placed a higher priority on repairing old highways to make them safer  than they did on building new freeways to ease traffic congestion.  </P> <P> Voters also tended to be a bit hypocritical about all this. On the one hand,  they said the "most important" transportation problem is "too many cars on the  streets." On the other hand, four in 10 reported that they "drive alone on the  freeways most of the time." A majority, however, said they would use a rail  transit system if one were available.  </P> <P> As for Proposition 111, voters were divided about equally on it in Los Angeles  County, which has become a nationwide symbol of traffic congestion. In the Bay  Area, however, where traffic tie-ups are just as bad, voters were backing the  measure by 19 percentage points.  </P> <P> Democrats were supporting the proposal by 15 points, but Republicans were about  equally divided.  </P> <P> Proposition 108, the companion $1-billion bond measure for rail transit, was  receiving big support throughout the state -- 3 to 1 in Southern California, 3  to 1 in the Bay Area and more than 2 to 1 in the rest of Northern California.  </P> <P> But voters are divided about evenly on a rival measure, Proposition 116, which  would authorize a $1.9-billion bond issue for commuter rail systems.  </P> <P> And while the electorate has started focusing on the gubernatorial race, it  still seems to be ignoring other statewide contests, such as the Democratic  nomination for attorney general. In that battle, Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Ira  Reiner is leading San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith by 24% to 16%, with 60%  undecided. The bulk of Reiner's backing -- 59% -- comes from Los Angeles  County. But Smith's support is more evenly divided around the state.  </P> <P> </P> <P> VOTER PREFERENCES  </P> <P>  The Los Angeles Times Poll interviewed 1,732 registered voters, including 792  registered Democrats and 694 registered Republicans.  </P> <P> Democrats were asked:  </P> <P> If the Democratic primary were held today, for whom would you vote?  </P> <P> GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Dianne Feinstein: 37%  </P> <P> John Van K. de Kamp: 24%  </P> <P> Someone Else: 1%  </P> <P> No Opinion: 38%  </P> <P> ATTORNEY GENERAL  </P> <P> Ira Reiner: 24%  </P> <P> Arlo Smith: 16%  </P> <P> Someone Else: 1%  </P> <P> No Opinion: 59%  </P> <P> STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER  </P> <P> Michael Blanco: 2%  </P> <P> Ray Bourhis: 1%  </P> <P> Conway Collis: 1%  </P> <P> John Garamendi: 10%  </P> <P> Bill Press: 8%  </P> <P> Walter Zelman: 6%  </P> <P> Someone Else: 1%  </P> <P> No Opinion: 71%  </P> <P> Republicans were asked:  </P> <P> If the Republican primary were being held today, for whom would you vote?  </P> <P> LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR  </P> <P> Marian Bergeson: 7%  </P> <P> John Seymour: 10%  </P> <P> Somone Else: 1%  </P> <P> No Opinion: 82%  </P> <P> TREASURER  </P> <P> Angela (Bay) Buchanan: 18%  </P> <P> Thomas W.

			<p><P> July 26, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE;  </P> <P> KILLER GETS DEATH PENALTY  </P> <P> David (Moochie) Welch was sentenced to death for the December, 1986, slayings  of six people, including two children, in an east Oakland home. Alameda County  Superior Court Judge Stanley Golde chose to follow the jury's recommendation of  death. "There is no circumstance which extenuates the gravity of this crime,"  said Golde in issuing the sentence. He added, "His entire life is a life of  violence." Welch, 31, was convicted on June 19 of six counts of murder stemming  from the bloody, predawn shooting rampage that left his former girlfriend and  five others dead. Welch had a long-running feud with the woman's family. Golde  cited Welch's criminal history, which includes rape, sodomy, assault with a  deadly weapon and assault and battery on various guards and jailers during  previous jailings.  </P></p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Aleksandr Krotkov, RABOCHAYA TRIBUNA economic </F> observer: "The President's Six Edicts"]    [Text] The president's edict "On Reform of State  Enterprises" adopted by him at the beginning of the week evoked  a contradictory reaction in the country. Liberal market  advocates saw in it a step backward to the socialist  authoritarian method of production management and communists, a  change of the signboard not affecting the economic foundation of  present Russia, while centrists viewed the document with guarded  expectation.    We will recall that the edict provides for the transfer of  most state enterprises not subject to privatization to  government expense. The new status significantly limits the  rights of production workers in the management of plants and  factories. Without the consent of the government they can no  longer establish subsidiary firms, lease out premises, and take  credits. No matter what monetarists may say, such restrictions  are fully justified.    As soon as a power declares that it intends to reserve for  itself the right of an owner of a number of production  structures, it would be totally unwise to stop controlling their  activity, closing its eyes to the plundering of its property and  to its passing to private individuals.    The part of the presidential edict that discusses the  prohibition to reduce work places at state enterprises seems  much more interesting and important. If we take into  consideration that the change in status will affect primarily  chronically (within the last two years) unprofitable plants,  among which the lion's share belongs to the military-industrial  complex (its privatization will be affected to the smallest  degree), it becomes obvious: The authorities have finally  realized the danger of mass bankruptcies and mass unemployment  in the country.    Another thing is also obvious: The unprofitable military  industry can be kept afloat only at the price of gigantic budget  subsidies and the budget can be replenished only at the expense  of profitable enterprises through an increase in the tax burden.  Hence it follows that the president's and the government's  intention to lower taxes by 10 to 20 percent, as promised in  another presidential edict ("On Some Problems of Tax Policy"),  is either an open bluff, or a sincere attempt to keep up with  the second "rabbit," which will never be caught.    Well, something always has to be sacrificed. The chief thing  is to see to it that this tax sacrifice is not in vain and that  unprofitable enterprises do not drag with them to the bottom the  ship of the Russian economy, which is sinking as it is.</p>

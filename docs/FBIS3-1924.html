			<p>Language: <F P=105> Chinese </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Chen Weiwei (7115 4850 0251): "The Fight Against </F> Corruption Is Not Over Yet"]    [Text] The period from the second plenary meeting of the  Central Military Commission in August last year to the almost-  concluded third plenary meeting has been permeated by the main  line of carrying out an in-depth struggle against corruption to  cope with the development of reform and opening up.    The comrades present at the meeting pointed out: The fight  against corruption over the past six months has been smooth; its  development has been healthy; phased achievements have been  made; and the expected requirements have basically been met.  But vigilance in the fight against corruption should not be  lowered, because negative and corrupt practices are likely to  recur: As soon as you relax, they will come back. In the fight  against corruption, no achievement can be made with one battle.    Some participants pointed out: We are losing some of the  achievements that we made in the previous period of fighting  against corruption; in the next period, we should consolidate  and develop the achievements we have made and should formulate  the relevant laws and regulations to fundamentally resolve  problems.    This year the fight against corruption will face a heavy  task  and severe test. Comrades attending the meeting analyzed this  issue from the following aspects:    --This year is a year of reform, in which many major reform  measures will be introduced. How should we increase the impetus  of reform, promote development and stability, maintain the  impetus of the combat against corruption, and produce better  results? This is a serious subject and test which cannot be  evaded. Comrades present at the meeting said: The process of  deepening reform is a process of adjusting the relations of  rights and responsibilities between the state, localities,  enterprises, and laborers; this will inevitably involve  interests in all areas and cause certain contradictions.  Because the impetus of reform is becoming stronger and the  formulation of behavior standards is falling behind, there will  be an increase in violations of laws, regulations, policies, and  systems. All levels of party and government leading  institutions and leading cadres should devote more efforts to  reform; if they cannot properly "do two types of work  simultaneously," a situation will arise in which "one type of  work is stressed to the neglect of the other." This will have a  direct impact on the fight against corruption and will add to  its difficulties. We are facing a prominent practical problem:  Deepening reform and extensively adjusting the relations of  interests will enhance the vitality of life in society, but will  also cause new contradictions and bring about many sensitive  problems. This point should be taken into account in the fight  against corruption.    --The next period of fighting against corruption will  develop  in a more in-depth way. Will there be a further breakthrough in  it? This is also a test. The comrades present at the meeting  pointed out: In the previous period of the fight against  corruption, comparatively speaking, many achievements were made  in looking into the symptoms of problems and in easy areas, but  this year's work will involve more obstacles and difficulties as  well as an in-depth and fundamental reform of the structure and  system. We should make greater efforts.    --In this new year, how should we maintain and develop a  positive trend in the fight against corruption, preserve the  masses' enthusiasm for this fight, and transform their worries  into peace of mind and confidence? This is another test for us.  The comrades attending the meeting said: The masses' feelings  about the fight against corruption can be summed up this way:  Their confidence is increasing, but they are still worried. On  the one hand, they are happy to see the achievements in the  fight against corruption; on the other, they are worried about  whether this combat will weaken, cool down, and stop. The  masses want the combat against corruption to be continued; they  want to see new achievements in it and are unwilling to see a  decline after a period of time. If a decline happens, this will  seriously damage their initiative against corruption, will turn  their hope into disappointment, and will even cause resentment  among them. Without the masses' trust, support, or  participation, it will be difficult to carry out the fight  against corruption.    General Secretary Jiang Zemin's speech and Comrade Wei  Jianxing's report have explicitly arranged this year's work.  The comrades present at the meeting pointed out that their task  is to ensure the implementation of the speech and report and to  work to the satisfaction of the party and masses.</p>

			<p>940120 FT  20 JAN 94 / The FT500 (26): Exit from ERM spurs success - A sector that last year did particularly well, especially in the United Kingdom and Switzerland / Sector Analyses - Banking It may not have been much of a year in many industries but the FT500 shows how good it was for banks. The precipitous rise in share prices of Swiss and UK banks propelled them sharply up the rankings, while British investment banks rose even faster on the back of near-perfect trading conditions. The banks' success was a bad advertisement for the European Union. Not only did the market capitalisation of UK banks rise following Britain's exit from the exchange rate mechanism, but the universal banks that trade in foreign exchange gained from currency turmoil amid speculation against the ERM. The newest European bank also emerged as the most valuable. HSBC Holdings, the bank holding company formed by Hongkong and Shanghai Bank to coincide with its takeover of Midland Bank, rose to eighth place. Its roots in the booming Asia Pacific market made it the 23rd most profitable company. The big three Swiss banks consolidated their position in the sector. They were no longer held back by their very strong capital and weak profits from domestic retail banking. Instead, their strength helped their securities trading, and attracted risk management business from derivatives. This gave each of the big three a big push up the rankings. Union Bank of Switzerland rose 10 places to 15th, and Swiss Bank Corporation rose to 38th from 62nd. CS Holding rose to 36th from 68th after taking over Swiss Volksbank, which left the FT500 from its 494th ranking last year. Yet the success of UK banks showed it was not necessary to have impressive earnings to rise in value. British banks such as Barclays and National Westminster rose because of future promise rather than achievement. Shares rose as investors discounted recovery several years into the future. Barclays was the best example of the emergence of UK banks as recovery stocks after the bad debt problems of the 1980s. Although it had the dubious achievement of being the third least profitable company by losing Dollars 369.1m, it rose 13 places to 31st place measured by market capitalisation. Other UK banks which rose significantly in the rankings because of the rerating of UK bank shares on expectations of recovery included Royal Bank of Scotland, up from 216th place to 144th, and TSB Group, up to 112th place from 145th after returning to profitability. The sharpest rise in the rankings by a British bank came from another bank with roots in the Asia Pacific. Standard Chartered, which for years has been seen as an accident-prone and inadequately managed bank, rose 94 places to 165th place on the back of a startling share performance. The other commercial banking market which achieved a good result was Spain. Spanish retail banks were helped by high net interest margins, and recovery from bad debt. The two highest ranked were Banco Bilbao Vizcaya which rose from 98th to 92nd, and Banco de Santander, which rose 24 places to 101st. Ironically, the sharpest Spanish rise came from Banesto, a retail banking recovery story that went wrong. Its share price rise after JP Morgan, the US bank, masterminded a capital restructuring, pushed it from 243rd to 184th place. Nevertheless, excessive loan growth forced the Bank of Spain to rescue Banesto late last year. Meanwhile, Banco Popular, the most profitable Spanish bank, moved up gently from 183rd to 160th. German banks fell in the rankings, in spite of the strength of the D-Mark, on emerging problems of loan provisions in the deteriorating economy. Deutsche Bank dropped from 10th to 12th place, Bayerische Vereinsbank from 90th to 94th, and Commerzbank from 99th to 105th. The strongest individual performance by a bank came from Svenska Handelsbanken, the only leading bank in Sweden, Norway and Finland which did not need state assistance to escape the banking crisis. Its sharp turnaround into profit catapulted it 243 places up the rankings to 223rd. However, the boost in fortunes for financial services firms was not confined to banks. The exceptional trading conditions for bonds and equities, and the sharp rise in European and Asian stock markets helped both investment banks and their asset management arms to rise briskly in the FT500. One of the newest entries to the FTSE-100 index also rose sharply in the FT500. Schroders, the UK investment bank, was among the biggest gainers this year, rising 101 places to 228 on strong profits. The achievement reflected a wider rerating of merchant and investment banking shares in the UK. Another strong gain came from SG Warburg, the UK investment bank, which rose 36 places to 220th as its shares gained from pan-European strength. Warburg was pushed up by the rise of Mercury Asset Management, the fund manager of which it owns 75 per cent, to 296th place (up 125). Among investment banks which entered the FT 500 amid strong trading conditions were Hambros, the UK investment bank, and Baer Holdings, the Swiss private bank and fund management company. A question for next year will be whether they can sustain their position despite earnings volatility. However, in spite of doubts over whether next year can be as good for banks, it is clear that 1993 proved an exceptional year in at least some European markets. Whether the recovery will be matched in other markets as asset quality problems subside will be seen in next year's index.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- LEADING BANKS BY MARKET CAPITALISATION  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Rank Company                         Dollars m   Rank  Sector  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    1 HSBC Holdings                     27351.9      8     112    2 Deutsche Bank                     22586.3     12     112    3 Union Bank of Switzerland         20321.2     15     112    4 National Westminster Bank         12787.6     30     112    5 Barclays                          12749.7     31     112    6 CS Holding                        11873.9     36     112    7 Swiss Bank Corporation            11782.0     38     112    8 Lloyds Bank                       11283.5     44     112    9 Internationale Nederlanden Group  10591.0     49     121   10 Dresdner Bank                     10565.8     50     112  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   11 ABN Amro Holding                   9706.7     57     112   12 Suez (Compagnie Financiere de)     9099.4     62     112   13 Societe Generale                   8984.2     64     112   14 Abbey National                     8218.6     69     112   15 Paribas                            7790.5     73     112   16 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya               6060.3     92     112   17 Bayerische Vereinsbank             6041.7     94     112   18 Bayerische Hypo. &amp; Wechsel Bk      5888.1     97     112   19 Banco de Santander                 5721.9    101     112   20 Commerzbank                        5500.4    105     112  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   21 Argentaria                         5248.8    107     112   22 TSB Group                          5089.1    112     112   23 Banco Central Hispanoamericano     5038.5    113     112   24 Bank Austria                       4689.9    124     112   25 Royal Bank of Scotland Group       3960.3    144     112   26 Generale de Banque                 3513.7    158     112   27 Banco Popular Espanol              3497.7    160     112   28 Standard Chartered                 3428.4    165     112   29 Mediobanca                         3361.4    168     121   30 Banco Exterior                     3321.2    171     112  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   31 Banesto Group                      3139.8    184     112   32 Kredietbank                        3098.6    185     112   33 Den Danske Bank                    3068.2    186     112   34 Bank of Scotland                   2955.6    192     112   35 Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken      2884.3    199     112   36 Creditanstalt-Bankverein           2790.7    206     112   37 Credit Local de France             2743.5    209     122   38 Cetelem                            2696.2    210     112   39 Credit Comm de France              2635.0    215     112   40 Allied Irish Banks                 2627.9    217     112  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   41 Banca Commerciale Italiana         2604.7    219     112   42 Warburg SG Group                 2600.3    220     121   43 Svenska Handelsbanken              2558.7    223     112   44 Schroders                          2451.4    228     121   45 Berliner Bank                      2258.3    248     112   46 Credito Italiano                   2184.3    256     112   47 BHF Bank                           2099.8    263     112   48 Credit Foncier de France           2077.6    265     121   49 Bancaire (Compagnie)               2076.4    266     121   50 Banque Bruxelles Lambert           2053.3    267     112  -----------------------------------------------------------------------   51 Mercury Asset Management           1828.2    296     122   52 Bank of Ireland                    1809.2    299     112   53 IFINT                              1796.3    304     121   54 Leu Holding                        1534.4    354     112  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

			<p><P> November 8, 1990, Thursday, Valley Edition  </P> <P> CAMPAIGN NOTEBOOK;  </P> <P> CATHIE WRIGHT TAKES WIN IN STRIDE AND IN SONG  </P> <P> On a night of computer breakdowns and torturously late election returns, state  Assemblywoman Cathie Wright was one happy exception to the bevy of nail-biting  candidates.  </P> <P> Confident of success in her low-profile campaign, Wright spent the evening  feting fellow Republicans in proper style -- hopping her way through Ventura  and Los Angeles counties in a sleek, dark blue limousine.  </P> <P> Keeping tabs on election results via color TV and mobile phone, the  velveteen-clad, Dr Pepper-swigging Wright stopped in at several GOP parties,  capping off the night in Burbank with an a cappella rendition of "God Bless  America" for her longtime friend and newly elected Assemblywoman Paula Boland.  </P> <P> Boland's eyes brimmed with tears as Wright sang and "it was kind of an  emotional moment for all of us," said John Theiss, Wright's administrative  aide.  </P> <P> "That's one of Paula's favorite songs, I do believe, and for Cathie to sing it  to her was a real special moment," Theiss said. Afterward, he said, the entire  group of well-wishers at the Burbank Hilton sang "We Are the Champions."  </P> <P> Boland and Wright, both winners in the Republican-dominated 38th and 37th  Assembly Districts, hugged each other and watched the midnight returns  together.  </P> <P> Real estate broker Boland, who had not acknowledged her victory over Democratic  teacher Irene Allert until 10% of the vote came in, finally made it official.  And Wright, who campaigned heavily for Boland, "was right there to show her  support and welcome her" to Sacramento, Theiss said.  </P> <P> One singer who didn't make Boland's celebration was Gladys Knight, whom Boland  described as a friend from real estate transactions. Boland said she had  expected the entertainer to attend.  </P> <P> Losers found solace in small and unexpected places Tuesday night.  </P> <P> For Allert, a political novice from Kagel Canyon who achieved an impressive  showing against the well-connected Boland, it came in a bottle of Shalimar  perfume.  </P> <P> A gift from her friend Sharon Molander, the heady scent evoked more innocent,  less complicated times together at Immaculate Heart College. Even then,  Molander said, other women turned to Allert for leadership and support.  </P> <P> "She was one person who didn't fall apart in a crisis," said Molander, who  joined about 150 Allert supporters, many of them nurses and teachers, at a cozy  Granada Hills house.  </P> <P> While the scent of Shalimar wafted through Allert's party, cosmetics were  apparent at Jim Salomon's gathering in Beverly Hills.  </P> <P> Trade consultant Salomon, who lost the 23rd Congressional District race for the  second time to incumbent Anthony C. Beilenson, said later he had too little  time to remove the slightly orange makeup before greeting supporters. Still,  the Woodland Hills resident reveled in a glowing endorsement from the Malibu  Times.  </P> <P> The weekly newspaper endorsed eight candidates -- Salomon the only Republican  among them. He read the endorsement, which called him bright and eager, to  supporters because he felt his presence alongside seven Democrats "was  particularly noteworthy."  </P> <P> A healthy sense of realism and a practical spouse served Democrat Richard  Freiman well.  </P> <P> The Agoura Hills attorney and TV writer may have lost the 21st Congressional  race to incumbent Elton Gallegly, a Republican institution from Simi Valley.  But at least he had reservations lined up for a weekend in Las Vegas.  </P> <P> Freiman's wife, Leslie, said that even though "we really don't like to gamble,"  she planned the trip months ago "so we don't sit around feeling depressed"  about the election.  </P> <P> Staff writers Tracey Kaplan, Amy Kazmin and Christopher Pummer contributed to  this story.  </P></p>

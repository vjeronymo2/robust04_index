			<p>920507 FT  07 MAY 92 / World Trade News: German grain blamed for Gatt stalemate GERMAN refusal to agree to cuts in grain prices lies at the heart of the stalemate over farm trade reform in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, according to a senior US administration official. 'Everyone thinks the French are the problem - and the French obviously do have a problem - but they are not the only or even the worst problem,' the official said. 'The Germans are the ones who are resisting the decline in grain prices.' The German government has failed to provide a lead in breaking the farm trade deadlock in spite of mounting international expectations that they would do so. Hopes of a breakthrough in March during a state visit to Washington by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were frustrated when he arrived and departed with no initiatives. The chancellor has apparently been 'very distant' even at summit meetings where Mr Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, has spoken on trade matters on the country's behalf. Germany's role will come into sharp focus in July when it hosts a summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Munich. Two previous G7 summits have made commitments to resolve the farm trade problem with no effect, and a third failure would be both an embarrassment to Germany and a blow to the standing of the G7. Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, was not willing this week to endorse explicitly the complaint against Germany. She nevertheless conceded: 'The Germans have the capacity to facilitate an outcome.' She emphasised that the EC's failure to find a common position on farm trade reform was the critical obstacle to progress in the long-stalled Uruguay Round. 'Since the problem is agriculture, and that is the impediment that has to be swept away and the Europeans have the broom, we have to wait until they have a consensus as to how they are going to treat with it,' she said. Mr Arthur Dunkel, the director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt), released at the end of 1991 a comprehensive plan for the reform of the world trading system. This included proposals to cut subsidised farm production and agriculture export subsidies and to open all markets to farm exports. Within days, the plan was rejected by the EC, which has been hobbled by its own efforts to reform Europe's Common Agriculture Policy. A frustrated US agriculture official recalled: 'It was as if the Dunkel Final Act fell out of the sky.' Intensive talks between the US and EC have brought negotiators close to agreement. It has been widely assumed that France, which is a leading farm exporter, was the principal impediment. However, the US official said: 'Whether it is export subsidies or rebalancing or internal supports, it comes down to the price of grain . . . and the Germans are the primary obstacle.' The mood in Washington improved from 'despondency' to 'mere frustration' after the visit of Mr Jacques Delors, the EC president. Mr Delors convinced US officials that he was determined to reach a settlement and agreed to intensify bilateral negotiations. 'I believe that they want to achieve a deal,' said Mrs Hills. 'I didn't have that feeling five or six months ago.' Officials hope to arrange a EC-US ministerial meeting in Washington later this month followed by discussions at the OECD.</p>

			<p>940209 FT  09 FEB 94 / Oil yard problems forecast to persist The Scottish oil platform fabrication industry faces difficulties until at least 1996, according to Mackay Consultants, the Inverness consultancy specialising in North Sea affairs, David Lascelles writes. One of its four large yards - possibly two - may have to close down. The firm estimates that capacity use was less than 20 per cent last year and notes that employment has fallen by 5,500 in the past 18 months. The report attributes the decline primarily to the overall decline in UK North Sea work. Other factors include a move away from conventional steel platforms, a lack of competitiveness and increased competition from other fabricators. Mackay notes that only one leading yard, UIE at Clydebank, near Glasgow, did well in 1992-93 though its work will currently run out in May. Of the others, Highland Fabricators at Nigg on the Cromarty Firth and Trafalgar House at Methil, Fife, performed disappointingly, and McDermott at Arderseir, near Inverness, disastrously.</p>

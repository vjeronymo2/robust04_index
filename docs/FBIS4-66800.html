			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, March 30--Expanded list of imports under  the Special Import Licence (SIL) covering a host of items,  introduction of a new category of super star trading houses,  simplification of duty exemption scheme and continuation of  value-based advance licensing (VBAL) with some safeguards are  the salient points of the important changes in the export-import  (Exim) policy, reports PTI.    The modifications announced to the 1992-97 Exim policy by  the  Union commerce minister, Mr Pranab Mukherjee, in Lok Sabha  today, also paid special attention to the simplification and  streamlining of the procedural aspects of the Exim policy.    To make the SIL financially more attractive, a number of  items relating to healthcare, sports, communication and office  equipment, some consumer goods/consumer durables not reserved  for SSI [Small-Scale Industry] units and spares and components  are being permitted under the modified policy. All existing  valid licences and the ones issued hereafter will be eligible  for import of these items of payment of normal custom duty.    For import of second-hand machinery, the condition of  maximum  seven years of age as well as submission of chartered engineer  certificate has been dispensed with.    The commerce minister said the important changes being  announced in the Exim policy take effect from today.    For deemed exports, the policy is designed to strengthen  industrial base by offering more facilities to indigenous  manufacturers. The duty-free licence holders would be able to  source their goods from local manufacturers instead of importing  the same with an added advantage of deemed export benefits.    The facility of advance release order has been extended to  special imprest licences, advance intermediate licences,  transferred advance licences and sensitive list items in terms  of value.    The powers to grant export promotion capital goods (EPCG)  licence, currently centralised in the office of the director  general of foreign trade, is centralised, Mr Mukherjee said.  Regional officers can now permit imports up to Rs 25 [rupees]  lakhs.    For 100 percent export-oriented units (EOUs) export  processing zone sector, their areas of activity have been  broadened by providing for trading, re-export after repacking  and labelling and also repairs, reconditioning and  re-engineering.    The requirement of prior approval of development  commissioner  of EPZs [Export Processing Zone] for inter-unit transfer has  been dispensed with. EOUs/EPZ units debonding modalities have  been liberalised and procedures for third party exports by  these units have been further simplified.    The new policy also has taken away some components required  for the manufacture of finished products in the electronic  industry. Fishermen can now import outboard motors freely.    Relaxation has been provided for the import of  prototypes/samples for product development.    For the import and export of items which are not covered by  the negative lists of exports and imports, the restriction of  value addition, which was acting as an irritant has been removed.    Under the special import licence, the minister said the  fillip provided to the exporters by SIL was not serving the  desired objective as the premium on these freely tradable SILs  has dropped to very low levels due to general import  liberalisation. As such, it has been decided to render the SILs  more attractive by including a host of items. However, gold and  silver will now be importable against SIL on concessional rate  payment of customs duty in foreign exchange, as applicable to  incoming passengers, by the holders of EEFC [expansion not  given] account.    On VBAL, the minister said a marginal misuse by unscrupulous  elements should not be allowed to create hardships for the  larger number of genuine exporters.    As such, he said the scheme is being continued with  safeguards. Procedures have been simplified under the duty  exemption scheme. Minimum value addition under the advance  customs clearance permit has been reduced from 15 to 10 percent.  Third party exports under the scheme will now be permitted.    Four zonal licensing committees have been set up at Delhi,  Bombay, Calcutta and Madras with a view to rendering quick,  efficient service and they will permit licences up to Rs one  crore in respect of cases where norms have not yet been fixed.    Revalidation and export obligation procedures under VBAL  scheme have been further streamlined by permitting regional  offices to allow extension up to 12 months. Input-output norms  have now been finalised for 3,383 items as against 2,200 on  March 31, 1993.    For Small Scale Industry (SSI), it is permitted to increase  their capacity by way of investment inplant and equipment beyond  Rs 75 lakhs, provided they undertake a minimum export obligation  of 75 percent of their annual production.    In a bid to ensure cost effectiveness and in order to make  the life of exporters less bothersome, legal undertaking (LUT)  has been further rationalised. LUT limit granted to export  houses/trading houses/star trading houses which was three times  of the last year's exports, will now be five times and in  respect of other exporters, LUT limit has been enhanced two  times from one-and-a-half times permitted earlier.    Unlimited LUT facility has now been extended to super star  trading houses.    Exporters under advance licence scheme can now give the bank  guarantee in two parts in respect of licences issued for a value  of one crore of rupees and above. In other cases, they can  replace their original bank guarantee with a reduced value after  completing 50 percent of exports.    The requirement of supporting manufacturer to be indicated  in  the DEEC [expansion not given] book has been dispensed with.    Handicapped persons can now import cars fitted with special  controls. Items relating to computerised braille printing  presses, text reading system for visually handicapped, spherical  lenses of magnification like spectacle magnifier, hand held  magnifier and table magnifier will now be permitted to be  imported freely. Artificial limbs for physically handicapped and  disabled and frequently modulated hearing aid systems for  hearing impaired persons in group situation will also be freely  imported, Mr Mukherjee said.    Explaining the details of the new category of super star  trading houses, the minister said all those exporters with trade  turnover of Rs 750 crores average free on board (FoB) during the  preceding three licensing years of Rs 1,000 crores during the  preceding year are eligible to become the super star trading  houses.    Such houses, he said, would be entitled to the membership of  apex consultative bodies concerned with trade policy and  promotion, representation in important business delegations,  special permission for overseas trading and special import  licences at enhanced rate.</p>

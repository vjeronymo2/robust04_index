			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / World Stock Markets: Sydney Goodman Fielder, Australia's largest food group, yesterday told the Australian Stock Exchange that it was 'not aware of any recent major change in the beneficial ownership of its shares', writes Nikki Tait in Sydney. The statement followed a spate of intense bid and/or stake-building speculation, resulting from some very heavy trading of the group's shares on Monday. Around 26m shares changed hands, more than 2 per cent of the equity, but the share price, at ADollars 1.62, has failed to move. Goodman has been the subject of much management upheaval in recent times, and reported a 12 per cent fall in first-half profits after tax.</p>

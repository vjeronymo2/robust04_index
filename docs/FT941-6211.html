			<p>940303 FT  03 MAR 94 / International Company News: Turnround for TelecomAsia TelecomAsia, the Thai telephone concessionaire that became the largest capitalised company of the Stock Exchange of Thailand when its shares were traded publicly for the first time last December, has reported net profit for 1993 of Bt564.7m (Dollars 22.3m), below projected earnings of Bt878m, but a strong turnround from 1992's loss of Bt41.1m, writes William Barnes in Bangkok. The company, a subsidiary of the Charoen Pokphand group, is likely to report sharp swings in profits because the company will only get a significant income from its core business of supplying and operating 2m telephone lines in Bangkok after several years. A surge in sales of mobile phones enabled the Thai telecoms group Shinawatra Computer &amp; Communications, to report a 49 per cent increase in profits for 1993. The unconsolidated net profit of Bt1.02bn (Dollars 40m) compared with Bt683.8bn in 1992. The group's 60 per cent-owned mobile telephone subsidiary, Advanced Info Services, showed strong growth with a 114 per cent rise in net profit to Bt978.1m from Bt452.3m.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Baku (June 21) TURAN--Although the prices for bread  were increased, the bread deficit in Azerbaijan still remains.  The State Concern for bread products told TURAN that grain  deliveries are delayed due to tension at the North-Caucasian  railway.    The same source also said that 200 cars with grain  travelling  to Azerbaijan are presently at that railway.    On June 17 Turkey shipped 24,000 tons of grain to  Azerbaijan.  According to specialists, this grain delivery is unable to solve  bread deficit in the country where every-day need in bread  totals more than 2,000 tons.    An employee of the State Concern for bread products said  that  those who live in villages come to Baku to buy bread since,  actually, bread is not delivered to Azerbaijani republics  [plural as received]. This fact worsens the bread deficit in  Azerbaijan as well.</p>

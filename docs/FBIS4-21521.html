			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press release from the UK Department of the Environment: </F> "23 million pound Construction Research Program Announced"]    [Text] The Department of the Environment will put 23  million pounds into construction innovation and research in  1994/5, Construction Minister Tony Baldry announced today.    Over a hundred separate research projects are to be funded,  covering areas ranging from low energy building design, and  constructional use of low grade timber, such as forest  thinnings, to the integration of virtual reality with standard  industry software packages.  <H5>  Announcing the Programme, Mr. Baldry Said: </H5>   "We have two key priorities for this year. The first is to  ensure that the research we are carrying out is what the  industry needs and wants. The best way to do this is through  collaboration with our industry partners. We will be consulting  them on whether the work undertaken for us by the Building  Research Establishment meets requirements; and we will be  increasing to five million pounds the proportion of research  expenditure devoted to projects funded jointly with industry.    "So that we can extend joint projects even further in  1995/6,  we will be improving our guidance for prospective future  partners on the opportunities for collaborative research.    "Our second priority is to ensure that industry makes the  most of research results. We will be looking very carefully at  the way the research is taken up and exploited.    "On top of our own research programme, we are working with  the construction industry to develop a research strategy for the  whole industry that will provide a cohesive programme across all  areas. Our aim is to maximise the impact that research and  innovation has on the industry's efficiency and competitiveness."  <H5>  Notes For Editors </H5>   The following are examples of work to be funded as part of  the 1994/95 collaborative research programme:    -- a project with the Richard Rogers Partnership which will  aim to assist the design of advanced low energy buildings across  Europe through workshops, exhibitions and publication of a  report aimed at design practitioners; - projects with the  Centre for Window and Cladding Technology focusing on the use of  advanced glazing materials; thermally improved frames; fixings  for natural stone; and the performance of glazing gaskets;    -- a LINK initiative involving DOE [Department of Energy]  and  the Science and Engineering Research Council [SERC] aimed at  improving construction quality and productivity through a  greater integration of design and construction. Academics and  industry representatives will work together towards the  application of more innovative design and construction  technologies including greater use of IT tools. DOE and SERC  will contribute 2.5 million pounds each towards this initiative  over a six year period;    -- a project with the University of Salford and the Advanced  Robotic Research Laboratory aimed at producing a low cost tool  which will integrate virtual reality functionality with standard  industry software packages to improve the presentation of new  designs for professionals and clients;    -- a project with the Tavistock Institute and contracting  organisations within the industry to improve the approach to  procurement, management of materials supply contracts and  subcontracting in general. The objective is to shift the  emphasis from securing minimum price on materials and services  contracts to a partnership approach between the different  organisations involved in design and construction thus achieving  better value for money and quality in the final building;    -- preparation with the Building Services Research and  Information Association of a guide for building services  companies on the opportunities in the Chinese and CIS markets.  This follows similar studies of market opportunities in Europe  and the aim is to encourage British companies to exploit these  two potential markets areas;    -- a study with Ceram Building Technology on new approaches  to masonry cavity walling taking into account the need for  better levels of thermal insulation to reduce energy consumption  and thereby CO2 emissions. The study will look particularly at  the prevention of rain penetration, ensuring that wall  thicknesses are economic but effective and that improved levels  of insulation can be achieved in a practical, buildable way;    -- the production with the Construction Industry Research  and  Information Association of a series of guidance notes which  outline the key environmental impacts of a number of common  building and construction elements and systems. The aim is to  assist designers at the preliminary design stages of a project  and once a basic solution has been selected, to provide valuable  information for specifiers and material and product  manufacturers;    -- a three year project with Hooke Forest Construction Ltd  to  develop ways of maximising the use in construction of low grade  timber materials, such as forest thinnings, through new skills,  technologies, products and markets. The aim would be to reduce  the UK's dependence on timber imports and provide forest  conservation;    -- a project with Billington Osborne-Moss Engineering Ltd  (BOMEL) which seeks to benchmark the productivity of the UK  construction industry. The project will develop a detailed  methodology for the measurement of productivity and look to  transfer the productivity levels achieved on successful  construction sites to others across the country;    -- an extension of the Building Research Establishment's  BREEAM (BRE Environmental Assessment Method) programme to  schools. BREEAM has been highly successful in alerting  developers, designers and others to the contribution they can  make to reducing the environmental impact of their buildings. It  has so far been based around the assessment of the environmental  impact of new build offices and the subsequent award of a  certificate to those reaching the required standard. The  objective would be to extend coverage of the scheme to existing  school buildings and to produce an associated educational pack  for teachers and pupils thereby raising public awareness of  these issues. Research funded by the DOE will continue to  support its statutory responsibilities for Building Regulations  and also help improve the efficiency of the construction  processes and thereby the quality, performance and reliability  of buildings.

			<p><P> April 1, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> ELECTIONS LONG BEACH CITY COUNCIL;  </P> <P> BREAD-BUTTER ISSUES DOMINATE CAMPAIGNS;  </P> <P> SERLES ADMITS VOTES VIOLATED LAW BUT CALLS ACTIONS AN OVERSIGHT  </P> <P> Planning Commission Chairman Jim Serles has acknowledged that he  "inadvertently" voted on two issues in violation of the state  conflict-of-interest law, but said two other breach-of-ethics accusations  stemmed from clerical errors that have since been corrected.  </P> <P> Serles, a candidate for the 3rd District City Council seat, was accused by his  opponent, Doug Drummond, of violating the state Political Reform Act by  accepting more than $250 in campaign donations from developers and businessmen,  then voting in favor of four projects they brought to the Planning Commission.  </P> <P> City Prosecutor John Vander Lans said he hopes to make public the results of an  investigation of the charges before the April 10 election. Serles, a dentist,  and Drummond, a retired police commander, are vying for the council seat left  open by Jan Hall.  </P> <P> Vander Lans said he has concluded his investigation of four  conflict-of-interest allegations, which are possible misdemeanors. But he  declined to disclose his findings until a fifth charge -- that Serles  misrepresented the value of donated office space -- is fully examined. A  retired Los Angeles County sheriff's detective was hired by the city to examine  that charge, and Vander Lans is pressing for a decision before the election.  </P> <P> "I think the public is entitled to know something about this prior to the  election," Vander Lans said.  </P> <P> In an interview at his Naples home last week, Serles said he did indeed vote on  two of his contributors' projects, but that one was an oversight and the other  a misunderstanding.  </P> <P> "I have never been beholden to anyone," he said. "These accusations are totally  without merit."  </P> <P> Serles said he accepted a $750 contribution from developer Dale Robinson four  months before voting in favor of the developer's plans to build a two-unit  condominium. The project was unanimously passed by the commission without  discussion, along with several other non-controversial items, according to  Serles. He said he was not aware that Robinson had contributed to his election  campaign.  </P> <P> Serles also acknowledged voting for a 51-unit townhouse development after  receiving a $600 contribution from realtor Larry Agajanian, but that the  Planning Commission record identifying Agajanian as owner of the property is in  error.  </P> <P> Agajanian said in an interview that he had submitted an offer to buy the land,  but has never owned it.  </P> <P> Serles said he was unaware that it is necessary to abstain from voting if the  contributor even participates in a project.  </P> <P> "Now that I have been informed that the word participant also is part of the  regulation, I would excuse myself," he said.  </P> <P> A third allegation accuses Serles of accepting $1,000 from developer Robert  Kendrick, then voting on Kendrick's controversial plan to develop some  abandoned Pacific Electric right of way.  </P> <P> But Serles said the Planning Commission record was incorrect and that a tape  recording of the proceeding shows he actually abstained. "I have never voted on  a Kendrick issue," he said, adding that he returned the $1,000 to Kendrick  nevertheless.  </P> <P> "Once the allegation was made, I wanted to make absolutely clear that if there  was any potential conflict of interest, the integrity of the Planning  Commission was foremost in my mind," he said.  </P> <P> In the fourth allegation, Serles is accused of voting for the expansion of the  Belmonte restaurant on 2nd Street after he reported a $300 donation from its  owner. But a check produced by Serles revealed that his campaign disclosure  statement was in error, and the contributor was actually the owner's wife.  Contributions by a spouse are not a violation, state officials have said.  </P> <P> The final charge accuses Serles of accepting donated office space with a value  that exceeded the $1,000 campaign contribution limit. Drummond said he inquired  about the value of the space and was quoted a price higher than the  $300-a-month value Serles reported.  </P> <P> Serles said he accepted the value the owner put on the space, which sat empty  for more than two years before he moved in.  </P></p>

Speaking at the "Biotechnology and AIDS" conference  currently  in progress in Florence, Aiuti stressed how these revelations  "confirm the existence of the virus in Italy in the Seventies."    In making his claim, Aiuti cited research by virologist  Ferdinando Dianzani and separate research by Carlo Baroni and  two other scientists, who performed biopsies on tissues from  living patients. Dianzani in his address at the conference did  not agree fully with Aiuti but stated that, according to his own  conclusions, the first death by AIDS in Italy occurred in 1978.    Also announced at the conference yesterday by Peter Piot of  the World Health Organization (WHO) was the start of first-stage  trials of an anti-AIDS vaccine within the month on 35 volunteers  from Brazil, Thailand and Uganda, under WHO auspices. The main  aim of the trials will be to determine the safety and the  effectiveness of the vaccine, chosen from a group of 12 possible  vaccines developed over the last few years.    Duke University immunologist Dani Bolognesi, speaking at the  conference, warned however that some of these latest candidate  vaccines, like many of their forerunners, have also come from  laboratory-produced strains and thus may not produce  substantially different results from those already known, and  may not have the same effects on human beings as on laboratory  animals.    Hopes are increasingly turning towards the positive signs  coming from studies into seropositives whose longevities are  longer than expected and whose high levels of anti-bodies, known  as CD-8 Lymphocytes, seem to have a neutralizing effect on the  HIV virus, which causes AIDS.    Bolognesi pointed out that researchers should be looking for  ways to imitate the natural resistance of these anti-bodies in  formulating the next stages of vaccine research.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By John Kohut in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The NPC wound up yesterday by passing a new budget  law and a law giving Xiamen legislative power, but a surprising  number of delegates voted against or abstained on both pieces of  legislation.    More than a fifth of the 2,721 delegates voted against or  abstained on the new budget law which outlaws deficits at all  levels of government. Though no deputies spoke openly about the  opposition, analysts said it appeared to represent provincial  displeasure at having to reign in finances.    The final vote was 2,110 for, 337 against, and 225  abstentions. Forty-nine deputies failed to press the buttons  which tally results electronically.    The budget law will enable central and local governments to  raise funds through domestic and foreign loans, but in doing so  some economically more backward areas will be at a disadvantage.  As a result of yesterday's voting, Xiamen, one of the country's  five special economic zones, has been empowered to enact its own  laws and regulations, giving the southeastern coastal city the  same legislative powers enjoyed by provincial people's  congresses.    The law is aimed at facilitating the economic opening up of  Xiamen. While 2,307 delegates voted for it, 251 representing  nearly 10 per cent of the total voted against, 144 abstained and  19 did not vote. Premier Li Peng's government Work Report,  which called for a growth rate of nine per cent this year and an  inflation rate of no more than 10 per cent, was overwhelmingly  approved with 2,655 for, 23 against, 25 abstentions and 18  people failing to vote.    The Budget, which sees a record deficit of almost 67 billion  yuan (HK$59.49 billion) [Hong Kong dollars], was passed with  2,403 in favour, 178 against and 129 abstentions. "There's an  imbalance of development, so the current Budget may be  beneficial to the eastern area and the western area will be  affected adversely," said Liu Ronghui, a deputy from Shaanxi  province, explaining why there were some negative votes.    The Plan for Economic and Social Development which calls for  a cooling down of investment, was approved by 2,584 deputies.    Opposition to the Supreme Court and Supreme Procuratorate  reports was significant, with total votes against and  abstentions being 335 and 464 respectively. "Some people may  have some opinions about the state of social security," Mr Liu  said.</p>

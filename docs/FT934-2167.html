			<p>931215 FT  15 DEC 93 / Halifax cuts rates to savers by 0.5 points to aid lending Halifax building society, the UK's largest, has cut its rates to most savers by 0.5 percentage points from today. The Halifax move to widen its margins to support mortgage lending follows its announcement last week of a reduction of 0.35 percentage point in its base mortgage rate, to 7.64 per cent, which followed the recent 0.5 point cut by the Bank of England in base rates. The conflicting pressures on societies over their savings rates - which must attract investors and enable societies to offer competitive mortgage rates - were shown by Alliance &amp; Leicester, the fourth largest. Having cut its rates to investors, it launched a one-year investment bond intended to compete with the government's plans for a 'granny bond'. Woolwich building society, the third largest, followed Halifax with a cut in its rates to savers of an average of 0.41 percentage points. Its standard variable mortgage rate is to fall by 0.24 points, to 7.75 per cent, to existing borrowers in January, and to new borrowers with immediate effect. Mr Dick Spelman, Halifax general manager in charge of marketing, said the new savings rate represented a fair balance between the interests of the society's borrowers, who total almost 2m, and its 12m savers. A&amp;L's move reflects concern among societies about the government's plans for a guaranteed income bond for people over the age of 65. The A&amp;L bond, called Special Edition, will carry a variable interest rate and will offer the option of taking a monthly income if a balance of more than Pounds 2,500 is maintained. Further evidence of societies' concern to keep their savers came from National &amp; Provincial, the eighth largest. It said that where its savers had obsolete accounts yielding little interest, even if they did not respond to being asked which new account they would like to transfer into, it would move them automatically to whichever it thought the most appropriate. Retail savings are particularly important to building societies, since, unlike other mortgage lenders, their access to cheaper, wholesale markets is limited by their regulatory regime.

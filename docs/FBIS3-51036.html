Venezuelan Foreign  Minister Fernando Ochoa Antich, meanwhile, said that the latest  incidents at the Colombian border have complicated bilateral  relations between the two countries. He said that repeated  kidnappings, incursions into Venezuelan territory by Colombian  guerrillas, and the incident involving a helicopter transporting  a National Guard patrol have cast a shadow over the negotiations  between Venezuela and Colombia.    [Begin recording] [Ochoa] As you know, they are currently in  the middle of an election campaign in Colombia. We managed to  keep the Colombian issue out of the political debate in  Venezuela. Nevertheless, it is a leading issue in both countries  that has created heated debates whenever there is a political  process under way. I believe the current situation is the  result of the heated debates in the Colombian election process.    [Unidentified reporter] Would you say the current state of  relations between Colombia and Venezuela is optimal?    [Ochoa] Right now there is the helicopter issue. Venezuela  has also filed claims regarding kidnappings, border safety, and  the presence of guerrillas and illegal aliens in Venezuela.  These are things that undoubtedly complicate bilateral  relations. [end recording]</p>

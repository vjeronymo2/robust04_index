			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / New director for World Bank The World Bank yesterday named Mr Richard Frank to join the troika of managing directors who hold sway over its operations under the presidency of Mr Lewis Preston. Mr Frank, vice president for finance and planning at the International Finance Corporation, the World Bank affiliate responsible for private sector investment, will succeed Mr Ernest Stern, viewed as the most powerful figure in the Bank's hierarchy. The World Bank's president is traditionally an American. Mr Frank will take the American slot, joining Mr Sven Sandstrom from Europe and Mr Gautam Kaji from Asia. Mr Frank's skill in tapping capital markets may prove useful in an environment in which donor governments, and especially the US Congress, are increasingly reluctant to provide new funds. In a separate announcement, the International Monetary Fund named Ms Burke Dillon to be director of its administration department, and Mr Alan Tait as its special trade representative in Geneva.</p>

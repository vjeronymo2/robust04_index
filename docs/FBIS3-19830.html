			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Studio interview with Austrian Foreign Minister Alois Mock </F> by Elmar Oberhauser -- live]    [Text] [Oberhauser] Dr. Mock, it was reported from  Brussels before your arrival here that you are dismayed and  concerned about this development [dispute in European Union over  blocking minority]. Does this mean resignation?    [Mock] It certainly does not mean resignation. There have  been crises in the European Union [EU] in the past, but one must  not regard it too lightly either. The atmosphere among the 12  member states is becoming increasingly difficult. We have a  situation where the four rounds of negotiations with Norway,  Sweden, Finland, and Austria have been concluded, and this  cannot, so to speak, be used because there is a dispute between  the 12 over the minority vote and the necessary number of votes.  Therefore, I appealed very vigorously to President Pangalos. I  said that we had come to Brussels three times. This was no  joke. We noted three times that an agreement was not achieved.  There is more at stake than a little more influence of one or  another member state. However, I must say it is my impression  that the majority of the EU states, excepting Spain and Britain,  are resolutely sticking to their position, the position of the  treaty.    [Oberhauser] You are not the only one who has expressed  dismay and concern. Let me put it like this: Kinkel,  professional optimist and German foreign minister, says he is no  longer prepared to predict whether the January 1995 entry date  for the four members that one is striving for can be maintained.  Do you think that it is still realistic? There are only a few  days left. President Klepsch said on this program a few days ago  that the whole thing has to be settled by early April.    [Mock] I also had a long talk with Klepsch today and he  assured me that the ratification proceedings could be compressed  if the parliamentary groups agree. In that case, he thinks it  is still possible. Actually, he was more optimistic than the  members of the Commission, above all President Delors, or the  members of the Council of Ministers. There they are openly  talking about a possible major crisis.    [Oberhauser] Why are the Britons so stubborn in this  question?    [Mock] You see, it is a fact that, in contrast to the  general assumption, the voting rights of the medium-sized and  small states are very strong. One must not forget that, when it  becomes a member, Austria will have four votes in the Council of  Ministers. We have more than 7 million inhabitants. Germany,  with 80 million, has 10 votes. Britian is very concerned. It  sees the danger that it will be at too much of a disadvantage,  that it will have to pay a big country's share into the budget  and to bear responsibility in many other respects, and that the  medium-sized and small states will have too much say in  determining the political course -- it cannot be that bad  because otherwise the French and the Germans would also be  concerned about it -- which is not the case. This is special  behavior by the British, who always supported us in our efforts  for membership.    Thus, one really has to say that the whole thing is very  complicated.    [Oberhauser] You are a diplomat and -- I put it like this --  in Britain your party friends, the conservatives, are in power.  Is there no opportunity to talk to the Britons on this level?  They sit together with you in the European Democratic Union,  for example. Or have there been negotiations on this level that  have not been successful?    [Mock] I assure you telephone conversations have been going  back and forward all the time, not only with one's own party  friends, but across party lines. It is an eminently political  question, however, and it has also become somewhat a question of  prestige. Therefore, there is a great danger the date for the  ratification of the treaty will be missed. This problem will  certainly also be solved.    In the days when De Gaulle vetoed England's entry and on  another occasion De Gaulle refused to go to Brussels no  government member went to Brussels for six months. The EU even  survived that. We are not here to deal with crises, however; we  want to act.    [Oberhauser] When you have talks, for example, with Prime  Minister Major....    [Mock] Yes?    [Oberhauser] Once again, how much chance is there of  achieving the result you are striving for before this deadline?    [Mock] Let us say fifty-fifty. You have rightly said that  these are speculations. Next Saturday and Sunday, the ministers  will meet in Greece with the new applicants for membership with  whom the negotiations have been concluded. For the first time,  we will participate in a Council of Ministers meeting. It would  be somewhat macabre if one had to state on that occasion that we  have lost one year. This crisis will also be solved, but the  question is at what cost.    [Oberhauser] However, Pangalos, Greek minister for European  affairs, said a few days ago that it is a mistake to go ahead  with this enlargement now. Is this not a background against  which there is little hope for the whole thing?    [Mock] I would say that the number of those -- I do not  number Pangalos among them -- who believe that the EU should not  be enlarged further is increasing. The problems are increasing  and are becoming more difficult. This is what I always meant  when I talked of a window. Either one manages to become a  member or one will not manage it for a very long time. Last  week, a Norwegian diplomat told me the following: If we had  signed in 1972, it would have been far cheaper for us. Spain  became a member before Norway and made demands regarding fishing  waters. I do not want Austria to be forced to negotiate again  when perhaps the Czech Republic or Poland make demands because  they also want to become members.    [Oberhauser] One final question, Mr. Foreign Minister: If  all goes smoothly in Greece on Saturday, you will say that all  has worked out well and nothing has happened. If all is not  well, however, and the entry date of January 1995 for which one  is striving cannot be maintained, what will be the consequences  in terms of substance for Austria's efforts? For example, what  effects do you expect on the mood of the population?    [Mock] There will definitely be a certain disappointment.  There is no doubt about it. However, if the objective is  considered as worthwhile, one has to continue one's efforts.  Today, compared with 1955, this treaty has been called the new  state treaty for Austria. In those days, one traveled to Berlin  and Moscow for 10 years. We did not have to travel for such a  long time to get it this time. Unfortunately, we now have to  watch how the creators of the EU are unable to come to agreement  on one point. They will come to agreement, hopefully very soon.    [Oberhauser] That is to say, your readiness to continue to  travel to Brussels, if necessary, is unchecked?    [Mock] Yes.    [Oberhauser] Thank you for having been our guest.</p>

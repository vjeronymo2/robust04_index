			<p>Language: <F P=105> Arabic </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Ziyad al-Shillah] </F>   [Excerpt] Muhammad Sa'id al-Nabulsi, governor of the  Central Bank of Jordan [CBJ], has announced that the  Jordanian-Israeli agreement initialed in early December on  opening branches of Jordanian banks in the occupied West Bank  provides a comprehensive umbrella allowing for the possibility  of opening branches of all Jordanian banks. The agreement gives  the CBJ full responsibility for supervising the work and  competence of these banks. He said that Jordan is currently  considering another draft memorandum of understanding concerning  opening branches of Jordanian banks in the Gaza Strip.    In an exclusive statement to AL-RA'Y, al-Nabulsi said that  the Jordanian-Israeli agreement includes a memorandum of  understanding and seven technical annexes. It is now awaiting  the approval of the Council of Ministers, which has the right to  amend, approve, or cancel the agreement. He asserted that  Jordan's aim is to establish a basis for durable and strong  Jordanian-Palestinian relations to serve the interests of both  sides, confront Israel's measures to permanently link the  Palestinian economy with the Israeli economy, and prevent  marginalizing Jordan's role both in the economic arrangements  for the occupied territories and in the regional arrangements.    Al-Nabulsi pointed out that the agreement will help toward  using the Jordanian dinar and Jordanian banking system in the  occupied territory to facilitate various economic operations  concerning trade movement and the transfer of capital for  investment. This will serve Jordanian interests both in  exporting to the occupied territories and in reaping the  earnings accrued from these investments. The agreement will  give the Jordanian banks a new opportunity to give loans and  invest their surplus cash, something which will reflect  positively on the size of these banks operations and profits.  It is expected that the financial and currency markets in  Jordan will expand, utilizing the occupied territory's financial  deals. This will expand the base of banking and increase the  flexibility and efficacy of the Jordanian financial and currency  policy.    Al-Nabulsi said that the framework within which work is  being  done is expected to generate an influx of real revenues and  foreign currencies into the kingdom because of the circulation  of the Jordanian dinar and the opening of Jordanian Banks in the  West Bank.    Al-Nabulsi noted that Jordan had been in constant contact  with the Palestinian side concerning the reopening of banks and  that they were informed of the negotiations procedure and they  urged Jordan to quickly reach an agreement with the Israeli  side. He said the agreement on banks realized great progress  even before the signing of the Palestinian-Israeli Declaration  of Principles and was in harmony with Jordan's banking and  currency role approved in the draft Palestinian-Jordanian draft  agreement. Moreover, Jordan responded to the Palestinian side's  demands to incorporate in the Jordanian-Israeli agreement a  provision invalidating the memorandum of understanding at the  end of the Palestinian transitional phase as enunciated in the  Israeli-Palestinian Declaration of Principles or when the  banking and currency powers and responsibilities have been  transferred to the Palestinians.    Dr. al-Nabulsi said the most important points in the  memorandum of understanding signed by Jordan and Israel are the  following:    1. Opening branches of Jordanian banks in the West Bank will  take place in two stages. In the first stage, all branches of  Jordanian banks closed in June 1967 will be reopened. In the  second stage, branches of other Jordanian banks will be opened.    2. Any Jordanian bank wishing to open a branch should obtain  CBJ approval before receiving the approval of the specialized  quarter in the occupation authority.    3. Supervision of the branches will be organized on the  basis of the Basel international agreement on banking, which  says that the head office has full responsibility for the  branches' credit status and liquidity (in Jordanian dinars).    4. The CBJ will carry out inspection of branches  periodically, or whenever there is a need.    5. Dismissing the memorandum of understanding signed by the  two parties on 20 August 1986 and implementing the new  memorandum of understanding on the branches of Cairo-Amman Bank.  Implementation of this memorandum will expire when an agreement  is concluded by the two sides, which should take place before  the end of the transitional stage as set in the declaration of  principles signed by the Israeli Government and the PLO on 13  September 1993, or when the authority and the banking and  monetary responsibilities are transferred to the Palestinians.    He said that it is worth noting that the meaning of the area  mentioned in the memorandum of understanding is the West Bank.  Jordan is studying a draft of a similar memorandum of  understanding on opening branches of Jordanian banks in the Gaza  Strip.    On coordination with the Palestinian side, Dr. al-Nabulsi  emphasized that Jordan has been in constant contact with the  Palestinian side on the reopening of branches of Jordanian  banks. He said the Palestinians were aware of the progress in  the negotiations, and they urged Jordan to expedite reaching an  agreement with Israel. It is also worth noting that progress  was made in the negotiations on the banks before the  announcement of the Palestinian-Israeli declaration of  principles. These negotiations have been in harmony with  Jordan's monetary and banking role as agreed on in the  Jordanian-Palestinian economic agreement. Furthermore, Jordan  responded to the Palestinian request for adding an article in  the Jordanian-Israeli agreement that ends the memorandum of  understanding immediately with the end of the transitional stage  in accordance with the PLO-Israeli Declaration of Principles, or  when the authority and financial and monetary responsibilities  are transferred to the Palestinians.

			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / France and UK signal improved relations at summit BRITAIN and France yesterday signalled a strengthening in bilateral co-operation covering defence, foreign affairs and Europe. But the first full-scale Franco-British summit since 1991 left the two sides still at odds over completion of the Uruguay round of world trade talks. After a day of talks headed by Mr John Major, the prime minister, Mr Edouard Balladur, his French counterpart, and President Francois Mitterrand, the two sides announced a series of agreements which confirmed the warming in relations since Mr Balladur's conservative government took office in March. Mr Major also voiced support for the embattled French franc, which has been under sustained pressure on foreign exchange markets. 'It is not in anyone's interests to have currency turmoil in Europe,' he said. The agreements reached yesterday included an opening date for the Channel tunnel. It will be officially opened by the Queen and Mr Mitterrand on May 6 next year. On the EC, Britain and France said they had found much common ground concerning subsidiarity - the decentralisation of decision-making from Brussels to national governments. Mr Major said the two sides had agreed a list of 24 items of community legislation that 'needed to be amended or withdrawn'. On defence, the two sides agreed that the joint nuclear weapons commission, which defines joint policy on nuclear issues, would be made permanent. While officials said they agreed on the need for a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, they remained divided on agriculture. 'We have a point of friction,' said Mr Mitterrand, referring to the Blair House agreement on agricultural production between the EC and the US which France has described as unacceptable in its present form.

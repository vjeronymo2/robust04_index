			<p><P> August 22, 1989, Tuesday, San Diego County Edition  </P> <P> SCOOTERS POLISHED, CLOTHES PRESSED;  </P> <P> S.D. MODS RIDING HIGH FOR THE WHO  </P> <P> The Who is coming to town, and local mods like Bartley Mendoza and Scott Harper  are ecstatic.  </P> <P> They are, after all, philosophical descendants of the English mods of the '60s,  who considered the Who their preeminent musical ambassador.  </P> <P> The Who's "music said a lot at the time, and still says a lot today," said  Mendoza, the 26-year-old leader of San Diego mod revival band Manual Scan.  "They symbolized everything the first generation of mods stood for, and what we  continue to stand for: freedom, rebellion, daring to be different.  </P> <P> "They went out of their way to canonize the mod legend with their  'Quadrophenia' album, plus they're one of the few original mod groups you can  still see, that's still kicking."  </P> <P> "The Who was one of the first mod bands, and they influenced every mod band  that came later," added Harper, a 22-year-old journalism student at San Diego  City College.  </P> <P> "That's why we look up to them as much as we do -- they're the fathers of our  movement."  </P> <P> Along with the estimated 400 other latter-day mods living in San Diego, Mendoza  and Harper spent much of last weekend polishing their scooters, ironing their  pegged pants and narrow-lapel shirts, and taking their parkas to the dry  cleaners in preparation for tonight's Who concert at San Diego Jack Murphy  Stadium.  </P> <P> Just after noon today, they'll start arriving in Balboa Park for a preconcert  rally around the El Cid statue. Compact discs by the Who will be awarded to the  mod with the nicest Vespa scooter, the mod with the nicest Lambretta, and the  mod who traveled the farthest distance. Joining the local contingent will be  mods from Los Angeles and as far away as Phoenix.  </P> <P> "I've got friends coming in from all over the western United States," Harper  said. "It's going to be a real reunion. I expect to see a lot of faces I  haven't seen since 1982, the last time the Who played San Diego."  </P> <P> At 3 p.m., the mods will caravan to the stadium.  </P> <P> "Because the Who is currently on its 25th anniversary reunion tour, a lot of  people are saying that they're washed up, that they've had it," Harper said.  "But how can you say that when they're reuniting mods from all over the  country, kids whose only common bond with the original mods from England is the  chance to see the Who in their own town?"  </P> <P> The first generation of mods consisted of working-class youth from London  rebelling against society.  </P> <P> They wore fancy duds like Italian mohair suit jackets, pegged pants, dressy  shirts with narrow lapels and pointy leather shoes.  </P> <P> "At the time, that was real rebellious," Harper said, "because kids were not  supposed to dress up for shows."  </P> <P> They got around on scooters rather than cars, Mendoza added, "because scooters  typified freedom: they didn't tie you down; you could drive, and park, wherever  you wanted to, in places where cars couldn't."  </P> <P> They donned parkas "to prevent their clothes from getting wet or disheveled by  the wind," Mendoza said. And, instead of the cheery mop-top music of the  Beatles and other purveyors of the so-called "Liverpool sound," they listened  to black American rhythm-and-blues, as interpreted by such  </P> <P> British bands as the Small Faces, the Action, Them, and the Who, who had burst  out of London's blue-collar West End playing a wild mix of James Brown, Motown  and blues covers.  </P> <P> "The Who was the first band to go out into the neighborhoods, into the suburbs,  and unite mod kids from all over Britain," Harper said. "In their songs, they  talked to the kids in their own language -- they not only understood what the  mods were all about, they were part of it."  </P> <P> The English mod scene peaked in the middle 1960s, when the Who topped the  charts with such anthems as "My Generation" and "The Kids Are All Right."  </P> <P> "Eventually, the whole mod movement got so big that, even in America,  department stores like Sears had mod fashion sections . . .," Mendoza said.  </P> <P> "It was more than just a movement; it was an attitude, a life style."  </P> <P> By the end of the 1960s, mod had become passe, and acid-rock and psychedelia  were the latest rage. And yet in the middle '70s, the movement began a revival  that has since seen hordes of second-generation mod kids listening to the same  music, wearing the same clothes, and espousing the same attitude as their  first-generation mod parents.  </P> <P> "It's just something we can identify with, this feeling of rebelliousness, of  youth, that the original mods stood for," Mendoza said. "And the Who captured  this feeling perfectly."  </P> <P> After today's Who concert, Mendoza said, most of the local mods will go for a  cappuccino at the Gelato Vero Caffe in Mission Hills or dancing at the 2581, a  hip dance club in East San Diego. Both are regular mod hangouts.  </P></p>

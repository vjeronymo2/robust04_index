			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Gerardo Lopez is the new vice minister for  agriculture and Sergio Garay is the new vice minister for  livestock. The two new vice ministers were presented on 16 April  by Agriculture and Livestock Minister Arsenio Vasconcellos. The  two new vice ministers have very good references; each in their  respective spheres have provided important services for the  Agriculture and Livestock Ministry. It is hoped a difference in  important ministry's activities will be noted. [passage omitted]</p>

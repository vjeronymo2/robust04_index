			<p>940908 FT  08 SEP 94 / Tajiks agree to delay elections Tajikistan yesterday postponed presidential elections scheduled for later this month, bowing to pressure from Moscow to open the field to opponents fighting a guerrilla war against the government. The Tajikistan parliament voted overwhelmingly to delay the September 25 elections until November 6. It was unclear, however, whether Mr Rakhmanov was genuine, given that he failed to lift a ban on the main organised opposition, the Islamic Renaissance party and the Democratic party. He merely told parliament: 'We want as many candidates as possible to contest the elections, including those from the opposition.' If genuine, it would be a significant step toward ending a guerrilla war with opponents based across the border in Afghanistan by drawing them into the political process. The vote follows intense pressure from Moscow and neighbouring Uzbekistan - both worried about the spread of instability - to end the fighting. Mr Rakhmanov is almost entirely dependent on Russian economic and military support to prop up his government, particularly the 25,000 Russian troops stationed in Tajikistan.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [DUMA PRESS report] </F>   [Text] Georgi Purvanov, Doncho Konakchiev, Krasimir  Premyanov, and Yanaki Stoilov were elected deputy chairmen of  the Executive Bureau of the Bulgarian Socialist Party [BSP]  Supreme Council at the Supreme Council's first meeting on 11  June. Nikolay Kamov and Klara Marinova are the old-new BSP  spokesmen. Ten persons were elected members of the BSP  Executive Bureau. In addition to those 10 members, Zhan  Videnov, chairman of the BSP Supreme Council, and Nora Ananieva,  chairperson of the Parliamentary Union for Social Democracy  [PSSD], are also members of the BSP Executive Bureau by virtue  of the posts they hold. Thus the new Executive Bureau consists  of 18 members.    During the discussion of the membership of the Executive  Bureau of the BSP Supreme Council, an objection was expressed  regarding the fact that most of the candidates are people's  representatives. The proposal to observe the principle of the  regional representation was rejected. Several candidates  withdrew their candidacy, others were rejected, and new  candidates were nominated. The list proposed by Zhan Videnov  was slightly amended. The new names on this list are Yanaki  Stoilov, Violeta Ivanova from Pernik, and Miroslav Popov.  Already at the beginning of the discussion Zhan Videnov stated  that he had intended to propose Yanaki Stoilov, but was not able  to meet him and talk to him. Zlatimir Orsov withdrew his  candidacy for private reasons. Georgi Pirinski also withdrew  his candidacy in a categorical manner and explained this by the  fundamental differences in anything related to the party's  economic policy.    Ivelin Nikolov, chairman of the BSP Gabrovo City  Organization, reported the wish of the BSP Gabrovo organization  not to elect Krasimir Premyanov as a member of the Executive  Bureau because of his work style. According to Nora Ananieva,  certain changes in the PSSD leadership could be expected because  several members are also members of the Executive Bureau and  thus they would be too busy.    The participants in the plenum of the BSP Supreme Council  elected the BSP Supreme Council leading organs -- 15 commissions  and their leaderships. The commission chairmen will propose  their memberships. After a discussion by the Executive Bureau  they will be approved by the Supreme Council at one of its next  meetings.    The BSP Supreme Council instructed the Executive Bureau to  make the necessary changes in the BSP registration which spring  from the decisions of the 41st BSP Congress, in accordance with  Article 10 of the Political Parties Bill.    The BSP Supreme Council instructed BSP Chairman Zhan Videnov  to prepare a draft program for the Supreme Council's work during  the second half of 1994, which will be discussed at the next  Supreme Council plenum, at which the BSP structure, budget, and  payroll will also be updated.    After the plenum the new membership of the Executive Bureau  met. On 14 June the Executive Bureau will issue its general  assessment of the congress' work, spokesman Nikolay Kamov said.    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Membership of the BSPSupreme Council Executive Bureau                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Ex officio: Zhan Vasilev Videnov, Supreme Council chairman; Nora Krachunova  |  |Ananieva, PSSD chairman                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Elected                                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |                         |Votes For                |Votes Against            |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Deputy chairmen                                                              |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Georgi Sedefchov Purvanov|90                       |12                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Doncho Donchev Konakchiev|57                       |45                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Krasimir Andreev Premyan-|55                       |47                       |  |ov                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yanaki Boyanov Stoilov   |85                       |17                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Spokesmen                                                                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nikolay Georgiev Kamov   |94                       |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Klara Vulova Marinova    |85                       |17                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Members                                                                      |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Anzhel Raymond Vagenshta-|95                       |7                        |  |yn                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Anton Marinov Grigorov   |94                       |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Vladimir Vladimirov Tope-|55                       |47                       |  |ncharov                  |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Violeta Vasileva Ivanona |68                       |34                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Kiril Stoyanov Zhelev    |94                       |8                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Lyubomir Panayotov Kolar-|83                       |19                       |  |ov                       |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Miroslav Kostadinov Popov|62                       |40                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nikola Petrov Koychev    |97                       |5                        |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Nikolay Kirilov Dobrev   |86                       |16                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Yuriy Mitkov Borisov     |82                       |20                       |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

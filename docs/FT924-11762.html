			<p>921023 FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Caterpillar advance beats forecasts CATERPILLAR, the US heavy equipment manufacturer, unveiled a profit of Dollars 23m, or 23 cents per share, in the third quarter, reversing a Dollars 37m, or 37 cents loss in the same quarter a year ago. The results were stronger than Wall Street analysts had expected. Sales for the quarter were Dollars 2.68bn, up 14 per cent. Despite the third-quarter gain, Caterpillar reported a loss for the first nine months, of Dollars 163m, or Dollars 1.60, compared with a loss of Dollars 86m, or 85 cents. Sales within the US rose 13 per cent in the quarter, to Dollars 1.18bn. The sales gains stemmed primarily from shipments deferred from earlier in the year when operations were hit by a strike. Revenues from financial subsidiaries also rose as portfolio assets expanded. The company's sales outside the US were Dollars 1.41bn, up 14 per cent from the third quarter last year. Foreign sales amounted to 55 per cent of Caterpillar's overall sales. Caterpillar said it expected domestic and overseas demand for construction machinery to be weaker in 1992 than in 1991 due to a globally weak economy and forecast that its fourth-quarter results would be 'marginally profitable'.</p>

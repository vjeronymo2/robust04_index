			<p>941107 FT  07 NOV 94 / Survey of China (6): Baffling questions for China-watchers - The country's economic structure and performance If, as has been said, there are lies, damned lies and statistics, Chinese data must fall within a particularly obscure sub-category of the latter. People want to know how poor (or rich) China now is and how fast its economy has been growing. Few questions about China are more important - and none are more difficult to answer. After 1949, China borrowed both its economic system and its statistical approach from the Soviet Union. Instead of gross national product, statistics were prepared in accordance with the material product system (MPS), which excludes all services not directly related to production (such as education, health, passenger transport and government). This system also relies on comprehensive reporting from a directly-controlled network of productive units, instead of the more flexible sample surveys used in decentralised market economies. In a command economy, statistics on output are also management accounts, which means that reporting units have an incentive to exaggerate their output. Faulty in conception, China's statistical system was damaged by the Great Leap Forward. Then, during the Cultural Revolution, the national statistical system was closed down for approximately a decade. Even the collection of data on material product did not recover fully until the middle-to-late 1980s. Mr Qiu Xiaohua, senior statistician at the State Statistical Bureau (SSB), admits, in addition, that output of township and village enterprises, which are increasingly important to the Chinese economy, continues to be scantily reported. Also inadequate is information on personal income and expenditure, essential for the calculation of gross national product and purchasing power parity (PPP) estimates of national income. Furthermore, the shift to the preparation of data in accordance with the United Nations System of National Accounts (SNA), which started only in 1985, will not be fully completed until the second half of the 1990s. Given such defects, serious difficulties arise if Chinese data are to be compared either with those of other countries, or over time. The simplest comparisons should be for GDP at market exchange rates. The World Bank now suggests that GNP per head in 1992 was US Dollars 470. India's GNP per head was US Dollars 310, it says, but even countries like Sri Lanka (US Dollars 540) and Zimbabwe (US Dollars 570) rank above China. The World Bank's estimate is a big jump from previous ones, which derived directly from the SSB's measure of GDP per head (in yuan). It is widely believed that the World Bank kept Chinese GNP per head down deliberately to ensure its eligibility for concessional lending. If so, it followed the Chinese lead. Now, however, the Bank has delivered an upward adjustment of 34 per cent. Fourteen percentage point of this is for reporting failures. Particularly large corrections have been made for housing consumption, grain output, rural industrial output and rural service-sector consumption, all of which are thought to be significantly under-recorded. Meanwhile, eighteen percentage points of the adjustment are for price distortions, the argument being that the output of some sectors - notably housing and coal - are significantly underpriced relative to market economies at comparable standards of living. (Note that the corrections are multiplicative, not additive.) Even after these upward adjustments, China's GNP in 1992 was only US Dollars 546bn, which was smaller than Spain's. An alternative approach, which seems more realistic in certain respects, is to estimate the purchasing power of GDP at international prices. Since services are very cheap in poorer countries (because wages are so low), the result is to increase estimated GDP relative to richer countries by substantial amounts. Widely-reported calculations that China already has the third largest economy in the world are derived from what amount to guesses of its GDP per head at PPP. Rather more solidly based calculations on the same lines make India the world's sixth largest economy, which is less widely publicised. As the table indicates, China's GDP at PPP has been estimated at between US Dollars 1,000 and US Dollars 3,000 per head. Nobody knows more precisely as yet, because the necessary surveys have not been carried out, although steps are now being taken to do so. But surveys will be particularly difficult in China, because of the country's size and the discrepancy in quality between Chinese goods and services, on the one hand, and those in more advanced countries, on the other. Some analysts have tried to solve the problem of estimating China's real GDP by relying on physical indicators - such as output of grain, coal or steel - or social indicators - such as longevity, number of physicians or school attendance. These are then related to the past performance of other countries, in order to obtain estimates of income per head for China today. Such comparisons are fraught with danger, because the structure of China's economy is quite dissimilar to that of market economies. Its historic emphasis on commodity output and investment, means, for example, that comparisons with past levels of output in the Korean Republic or Taiwan almost certainly exaggerate Chinese GDP today. Still more risky is casual empiricism. Visitors to Shanghai can see it is quite prosperous, but - as the chart shows - its income per head (at market exchange rates) is utterly unrepresentative of China as a whole. What is also important to remember is that it contains just over 1 per cent of China's population. The safe conclusion is that China is still a very poor country, with a modest GDP at market prices. It has a far larger GDP at PPP, mainly because of the consequent revaluation of its low quality non-tradeable services. The latter adjustment indicates nothing new about China's global significance, however, as is too often supposed, beyond what is already implicit in the huge population. Can any more confidence be placed in the reported rates of economic growth? Between 1978 and 1993, according to SSB statistics, the Chinese economy expanded at a compound annual rate of 9 per cent a year, for an overall increase of 260 per cent. The largest country that has ever reported comparable rates of economic growth over a long period is Japan, which has only a tenth China's population. There are good reasons, however, to question both the rate and the quality of reported rates of growth. If the measured GDP per head in 1992 and its reported growth between 1980 and 1992 are worked backwards, GDP per head becomes US Dollars 195 in 1980 (in 1992 dollars). If so, China's income per head was then below India's - indeed among the lowest in the world. The problem becomes worse if China's growth is worked still further back. If official rates of growth are run back to 1965, it turns out that China's GDP per head was less than half of India's in that year. This is inconsistent with statistics on the quality of life in China, compared to India's, at that time. It is more plausible to assume the current relationship is roughly correct, but growth rates in China have been lower. In common with most state-socialist countries there is also a tendency to under-estimate inflation and exaggerate real output increases. One reason is that this is a way for managers of state enterprises to claim undeserved success. Furthermore, GDP data for the late 1970s and early 1980s are, in any case, known to be both incomplete and inaccurate. According to successive World Development Reports China's GDP head rose only from US Dollars 260 in 1979 to US Dollars 370 in 1991, a nominal increase of only 42 per cent (see chart), even though the SSB reported a rise of 166 per cent in real GDP over the period. The reason for this discrepancy between the growth of Chinese GDP at domestic and international prices was the steep devaluation of the official exchange rate from Yn1.55 to the dollar in 1979 to Yn5.32 in 1991. This slide (which implies a large depreciation in real terms) is a reminder of the price distortions that existed in the Chinese planned economy. These price distortions remain pervasive. Foodstuffs, urban housing, many services and coal have been underpriced, while many manufactures have been overpriced, particularly in view of their poor quality. In the presence of distortions, measured growth may mean little improvement in economic welfare. It may largely reflect transfers of income from under-priced to over-priced sectors. It is worth remembering that reported rates of economic growth under socialism in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were generally faster than those of western Europe, while investment was also higher. Yet the opening up of these economies has shown that they were in fact falling further and further behind. China's economy still remains state-socialist in important respects. While the share of the state enterprises in output has apparently fallen to below half of total industrial output, more than 60 per cent of total fixed investment, amounting to over 20 per cent of GDP, still goes to the state sector. Chinese statistics report that nearly half of the increase in total output between 1978 and 1993 was investment and that investment grew by 360 per cent in real terms between 1978 and 1993 (a compound rate of growth of 11 per cent), while consumption grew by only 212 per cent (a compound rate of 8 per cent). Given the uncertainty about the economic rate of return on investment, it may be wise to view the growth rate of consumption as a more accurate indicator of the economy's performance than that of GDP. Finally, when considering the quality of growth it is worth remembering the rapidly-growing environmental problems: falling water-tables; dead lakes and rivers; and polluted air. Properly accounted for, such costs would subtract substantially from past Chinese performance. Large sums will have to be expended on cleaning it all up in future. In sum, both the reported rate of economic growth and its effects on economic welfare must be questioned. Bits of the Chinese economy are internationally competitive: export performance demonstrates that. Equally obvious are improvements in the living standards of the population. Even so, the view that the entire Chinese economy has been growing as fast as South Korea's may be a significant exaggeration. If one is to know accurately how well China is performing and how rich it is, the shift to an internationally open and domestically competitive market economy needs to be completed. There is still quite a long way to go - and then the statistics must catch up.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alternative estimates of China's GDP  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source of estimate                 Year     Dollars  Total GDP  Share of                                          per capita  (Dollars   world                                                       '000bn)   GDP (%)  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- World Development Report 1994 a   1992          470       0.55     2.4 Lardy (1993) b                    1990  1,000-2,000  1.14-1.37 5.1-6.1 New York Times (20 May 1993) b,c  1992        1,600       1.66     6.0 World Bank (1992) b               1990        1,950       2.20     9.9 World Bank (1993) b,d             1991        2,040       2.35    10.9 Summers &amp; Heston (1991) b         1988        2,308       2.56    15.0 Asian Wall Street Journal  (31 May 1993) b,e                1990        2,598       2.90    13.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- a Based on the official exchange rate b Based on the purchasing power of the Chinese currency c Derived from IMF d Update of estimates in the previous row e Extrapolation/update of estimate in the previous row  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Source: Nicholas R.

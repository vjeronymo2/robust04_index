			<p>920908 FT  08 SEP 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: De Beers remains in the dark about extent of Russian diamond smuggling DE BEERS, the South African group which controls about 80 per cent of the world's rough (uncut) diamond trade, yesterday admitted it had no clear idea of how many gem stones were being smuggled out of Russia. It also became clear yesterday that De Beers faces competition from Japan in Yakutia, where 99 per cent of Russian diamonds are mined and where it hopes to help set up a cutting centre. In any case, the South African group is not confident of its grip on the Russian diamonds business and therefore wants to reconfirm its existing five-year contract which gives it a virtual monopoly of Russia's rough diamond exports. De Beers concluded an agreement in 1990 that gives its Central Selling Organisation exclusive rights to sell Russian rough diamond exports until 1995. It advanced a Dollars 1bn loan to the former Soviet Union against stockpiled diamonds which were moved to London. However, though Russia has continued to abide by the terms of the deal the agreement has repeatedly been called into question. 'We hope that uncertainty in the diamond market will be ended by a pronouncement of the diamond commission which should show that CSO is Russia's best opportunity,' said De Beers deputy chairman, Mr Nicky Oppenheimer. Mr Valery Skripchenko, the deputy head of a group within Russia's budget committee which is looking into the structure of the diamond industry, suggested yesterday that De Beers was also seeking a monopoly of Russian exports of polished stones in addition to that it enjoyed for rough gems. He suggested a fresh parliamentary investigation could be launched when parliament reconvened on September 22. His objections appear to have been prompted by an outline agreement reached last week by De Beers with Yakutia, the semi-autonomous republic within Russia, to set up a stone-polishing factory. Mr Gary Ralfe, the De Beers' director responsible for liaison with Russia, said that if the agreement went through, his group would supply technology for the plant and 'help' sell the polished stones it produced - which would still account for a tiny proportion of rough gems mined in Yakutia. But if Yakutia instead concluded a diamond-polishing deal with a rival Japanese company called ARDA, De Beers would have no control over polished stones sales by Yakutia, which does not yet have its own stone-cutting capacity. Asked about the smuggling problem, Mr Ralfe said it was impossible to tell how many diamonds were leaking from the former Soviet Union in contravention of the 1990 agreement. He believed smuggling was taking place without the sanction of government authorities and that the Russian problem was nothing like on the scale of the illegal flood of diamonds out of Angola.</p>

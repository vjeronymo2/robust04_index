			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / LWT plan for link up may block hostile bid London Weekend Television is planning to try to ward off the hostile takeover bid by Granada, the television, leisure and rental group, by linking with Yorkshire-Tyne Tees, a company in which it already holds 14 per cent. Anglia Television would also be involved in the defence, which will be unveiled to LWT shareholders next week. LWT chairman Sir Christopher Bland is determined to avoid a takeover by Granada if there are alternatives that make more sense to his shareholders. The link would probably take the form of an agreed merger. If the defence deal is confirmed, LWT, Yorkshire, Anglia and Tyne Tees could be brought together in a single super-company as soon as government ownership rules allow. The four combined would be bigger than the merged Carlton and Central and control more than 30 per cent of total ITV advertising. Last week Carlton announced an agreed Pounds 624m takeover of Central subject to parliamentary approval. Granada's bid for LWT earlier this week was a share deal worth around Pounds 600m with a 528p per share cash alternative. Granada's shares closed up 12p at 496p, valuing the offer at around Pounds 610m. As part of LWT's defence against Granada, a three-way deal is understood to have been agreed. The reason behind this is the proposal by the government which would mean no independent television company could own more than two regional franchises. Because the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees group already holds two broadcasting licences, any deal with LWT would involve the disposal of one of them. The franchise change, which will take effect on January 1, has been approved by the Commons and goes to the Lords on Monday. Lex, Page 26</p>

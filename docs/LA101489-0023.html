			<p><P> October 14, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> CS LONG BEACH SEEKS SECOND CONSECUTIVE WIN  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach will play a San Diego State football team that is missing  its leading rusher and scorer tonight at 7 in a nonconference game at San Diego  Jack Murphy Stadium.  </P> <P> Running back Darrin Wagner, a redshirt freshman who leads the Aztecs (1-3-1)  with 424 rushing yards and 10 touchdowns, was ruled out of the game by Coach Al  Luginbill after missing practices this week without permission.  </P> <P> The loss of Wagner could dull an offense that is one of the most potent in the  country. The Aztecs, led by 6-foot-8 quarterback Dan McGwire, are averaging  511.4 yards and 32.8 points a game. Wagner will be replaced in the Aztecs'  one-back offense by Ron Slack, a senior from Pasadena Muir High School.  </P> <P> The 49ers (3-3) are coming off last Saturday's 55-48 Big West Conference  victory over New Mexico State, their first win over a Division I-A team this  season.  </P> <P> Running back Jeff Fassett, who last week became the first Long Beach player in  12 years to rush for 100 yards in consecutive games, will try to extend his  streak. Fassett has gained 249 yards in 27 carries in the last two games. CURT  HOLBREICH  </P></p>

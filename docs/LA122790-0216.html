			<p><P> December 27, 1990, Thursday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> P.M. BRIEFING;  </P> <P> INDIANA TRASH LAW RULED DOWN  </P> <P> A federal judge today ruled that provisions of Indiana's new law regulating  out-of-state trash are unconstitutional, saying the flow of rubbish into the  state is all part of commerce.  </P> <P> U.S. District Judge John D. Tinder concluded that the law's three key  provisions violate the Constitution's commerce clause that allows free trade  among the states.  </P> <P> "However noble and popular these three provisions of House Enrolled Act 1240  appear to be, they must give way to the constitutional principles," Tinder  wrote. The same protection that the commerce clause gives to the citizens of  other states who feel the need to (export) waste into Indiana protects Indiana  citizens when they export hazardous waste to other states. "Commerce, even in  such 'bads' as waste, is a two-way street," he wrote.  </P></p>

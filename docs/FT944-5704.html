			<p>941202 FT  02 DEC 94 / Accountants claim tax breakthrough Price Waterhouse, the accountancy firm, yesterday claimed a landmark victory for a client, Uniholdings, in a High Court case against the Inland Revenue. The case concerned a transaction by Uniholdings, a UK company, in which it borrowed foreign currency in order to invest in shares. Because of currency movements Uniholdings made a loss on borrowings in dollars but a gain on a forward purchase of dollars designed to hedge against foreign exchange exposure. The Inland Revenue, said Price Waterhouse, claimed the gain was liable to tax but that no relief was available for the loss. 'The judge rejected the Revenue's claim because as the borrowing and the forward purchase of dollars was a composite transaction there was absolutely no possibility of our client making a gain,' said Mr Guy Madewell, a Price Waterhouse tax partner. Price Waterhouse said the decision was the first in which a taxpayer company had claimed the benefit of composite transactions law. The judgment is open to appeal.</p>

			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> DEUKMEJIAN GETS ON BOARD  </P> <P> Pending negotiations on health insurance between Gov. George Deukmejian and  leaders of the Legislature are, in effect, the last opportunity for Sacramento  to address a problem too long neglected. A growing coalition of Californians is  ready with an expansive and constructive initiative for the November, 1990,  general election if they fail.  </P> <P> Deukmejian has moved into the controversy in the face of two pieces of  legislation that offer complementary corrections of the failure in the state to  provide any form of health insurance to an estimated 5 million persons. The  governor must also feel a mounting pressure for him to assume some leadership  on health issues after the understandably harsh criticism of his budget vetoes  of public-health and mental-health funding for the 1989-90 budget year.  </P> <P> Part of the problem has been created by the negativism of the California  Chamber of Commerce and the passivity of the California Business Roundtable, in  contrast to other parts of the country where business leaders are seeking  solutions to the problem. The failure of California businessmen to respond is  even more perplexing given the evidence that it is they, through payroll-funded  health insurance, who must pick up more and more of the cost of the uninsured.  </P> <P> The Assembly has now approved two useful bills, AB 350, sponsored by Assembly  Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) and AB 328, by Assemblyman Burt Margolin  (D-Los Angeles). Brown's bill would mandate employer-funded health insurance,  which would extend coverage to half or more of those not now covered.  Margolin's bill is broader, creating a state insurance plan to underwrite  subsidized state insurance for lower-income persons and assure universal  coverage.  </P> <P> Margolin's bill is, in general, a preview of an initiative being drafted by the  Health Access Foundation. The growing coalition now includes many major  health-consumer groups. The California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems is  actively participating and the California Medical Assn., while basically  supporting the Brown bill, is also joining the talks. Most conspicuous by its  absence from the consultations is the Chamber of Commerce.  </P> <P> We have no doubt that a legislative remedy is preferable to traveling the  initiative route. But we are also convinced that the patience of Californians  is running out. The coalition working on an initiative has the breadth and  sense of responsibility to offer a useful alternative if the governor and the  Legislature once again fail to produce.  </P></p>

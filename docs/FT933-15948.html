			<p>930706 FT  06 JUL 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Franc under more pressure THE FRENCH franc yesterday came under more pressure inside the European exchange rate mechanism as dealers took the view that France will find it hard to live with the current pace of Bundesbank interest rate cutting for much longer, writes James Blitz. Last week, the Bundesbank reduced its discount rate by 50 basis points to 6.75 per cent, in a move which added to hopes that European monetary policy was easing and that tensions in the ERM had subsided once and for all. However, the Bank of France almost immediately took advantage of the German cut, bringing its intervention rate down to Germany's discount rate level last Friday. Some dealers argued yesterday that the speed with which the French authorities followed the German move suggested that France would do what ever was necessary to ease monetary policy and boost the economy. That sentiment has pushed the franc nearly two centimes lower against the D-Mark in the last week, to finish yesterday at FFr3.386 from a close on Friday night of FFr3.383. On its ERM divergence indicator, the franc ended yesterday at a remarkably low level of minus 61 percentage points. The French franc has partly been undermined by a broader feeling in foreign exchange markets that Europe's central banks have been too ambitious in trying to decouple their monetary policies from the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank cut - and signs that M3 money supply growth is falling into line with Bundesbank targets - helped to strengthen the D-Mark against several European currencies yesterday. The Danish krone closed a touch weaker at DKr3.8483 per D-Mark. The divergence between the Dutch guilder and the D-Mark also narrowed, to 36 basis points, having been as high as  1/2 percentage point in recent weeks. Even the dollar has shown signs of weakness against the D-Mark, after breaking through the key level of DM1.67 three weeks ago: although last night it closed in London unchanged on the day at DM1.6960. However, the French franc appears particularly vulnerable, having been undermined by a rising tide of grim economic news. Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation, said the French economy is undermined by bad consumer expenditure and corporate earnings figures, and a belief that the government of Mr Edouard Balladur, the French prime minister, has only a limited window of opportunity to boost the economy before the presidential elections due in 1995. Sterling was the one currency to perform strongly against the D-Mark yesterday, rising  1/2 pfennig on the day to close at DM2.5625. The currency was helped by higher than expected figures for net consumer credit in May, and a report from Treasury advisers showing that the UK was set for above trend growth.</p>

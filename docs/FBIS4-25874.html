			<p>BFN     [Text] Beijing, June 14 (XINHUA) -- Chinese President Jiang  Zemin met and had a discussion here this evening with a Hong  Kong delegation on how to maintain the territory's stability and  prosperity.    Jiang, also general secretary of the Central Committee of  the  Communist Party of China, told Herbert Liang, president of the  Chinese Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong and head of the  delegation, "A common task that we are confronted with is how to  maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity during its  transitional period and after 1997".    Jiang urged Hong Kong people from all walks of life to unite  and do everything beneficial to its stability and prosperity.    He said that the way forward will by no means be very  smooth.  But, he added: "Our determination in resuming the exercise of  sovereignty over Hong Kong will be unshakable."    "I am full of confidence in Hong Kong's stability and  prosperity", Jiang said.    During the meeting, Jiang congratulated the Chinese  Manufacturers' Association of Hong Kong on the 60th anniversary  of its founding.    He expressed the hope that the association will continue to  strengthen its economic cooperation and ties with the Chinese  mainland and make fresh contributions to the Motherland's reform  and opening to the outside world and to Hong Kong's smooth  transition, prosperity and development as well.    Liang told Jiang that his association has set up an office  in  Beijing aimed at enhancing its links with the capital and the  mainland as a whole.    Besides, he said, the Hong Kong Association and the  all-China  Federation of Industry and Commerce have jointly sponsored a  seminar on economic cooperation and trade between Hong Kong,  China's inner land and the northern parts of the country to  explore chances and potentials for developing such cooperation  and trade.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The most prominent event in Algeria today is the  inauguration of the Transitional National Council. The radio  team at the headquarters of the former National People's  Assembly will give more details. Over to Messaoud Aouchallouch:    [Messaoud] Yes, Rachid. Ladies and gentleman, peace be upon  you. Rachid, the official inauguration ceremony began at about  1105, presided over by Liamine Zeroual, the state president.  The president gave an address at the beginning of which he  focused on the importance of the Transitional National Council  as an institution which embodies one of the most important  resolutions of the National Consensus Conference and one of the  essential foundations for the fruitful completion of this  decisive stage. It is also considered an important means of  implementing the program to extricate the country from the  crisis and achieve democracy within the framework of respect for  the deep-rooted values of the Algerian people.    Liamine Zeroual made a point of recalling the state's  obligations to achieve all the goals of the platform of national  consensus, especially those related to organizing free and  democratic elections which give the choice of the nation full  sovereignty. He noted that this council emphasizes the main  characteristic of the government's endeavor to tackle the  problems of the country; this endeavor is reflected in the  political and social consultation.    The state president seized this opportunity to explain a few  positions around which a lot of controversy was aroused in  respect of the efforts aiming at reviving the political and  social dialogue within a legitimate framework and specified  objectives, as he described it. Liamine Zeroual said: Our  invitation to dialogue -- he said this as an explanation -- our  invitation to dialogue emanates from our deep conviction that it  is the path that will allow us to gather all national forces  which are far from any extremism and imported ideas from  whatever source. However, I would like to make clear to you,  the state president went to say, that the effort which I began  last March within the framework of reviving the political  dialogue was not understood correctly by some parties.  Therefore, it is imperative for everyone to define his position  very clearly according to the defined framework and objectives,  and away from any calculations or maneuvers.    Concerning the state, I would emphasize here, the state  president added, that it will shoulder, without any hesitation  and with full determination, all its commitments in leading the  transitional period. In this respect, the restoration of  stability to the country and the protection of the security of  the individuals and properties come at the fore of our  priorities. The state will continue to achieve these objectives  without ceasing until the total elimination of violence and  terrorism from our society.    After the head of state's address the national anthem was  played, and Mr. Bouchaib, the most senior of the members,  announced that the session was adjourned and that it will resume  later in a closed session. Regarding the presidency of the  council, I should point out that according to the latest reports  this will go to a person who represents the institution of the  state, Mr. Abdelkader Bensalah, the former spokesman for the  National Dialogue Commission, who was a member of the dissolved  National Assembly and chaired one of its committees. He was  also a director of ECH-CHAAB newspaper and is now a senior  official in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.    If the choice of Bensalah as the only candidate is finally  confirmed, the elections will be unopposed and will take place  10 days after this inauguration, bearing in mind that Article 34  of the National Consensus Document stipulates that the president  of the Transitional National Council should be elected by the  members of the Council for the duration of the transitional  period.</p>

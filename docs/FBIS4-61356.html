			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, April 29 (CTK) -- Russia, which at the  beginning of April was considering the possibility of offering  Slovakia credits for the completion of the nuclear power station  in Mochovce, West Slovakia, is now showing interest in the  Russian Ministry of Nuclear Energy putting direct capital into  the project, Slovak Deputy Premier Brigita Schmognerova said  today.    Schmognerova arrived in Moscow yesterday with Slovak Economy  Minister Peter Magvasi [as received; according to the referent  item, the Slovak delegation consists of Schmognerova and Finance  Minister Filkus] for a two-day visit. At the beginning of April  Magvasi had given news of the possibility of credits to the  value of $450 million.    Schmognerova, who has been negotiating with Russian Nuclear  Energy Minister Viktor Mikhaylov, said Russia was proposing the  creation of a joint enterprise for the completion of the first  block of the power station in Mochovce and would be interested  in the enterprise dealing with other blocks later.    Filkus and Schmognerova have also been negotiating the  method  for the repayment of the Russian debt to Slovakia, which after  the division of Czechoslovakia took on debts from Moscow to the  value of $1.6 billion.    Slovakia was considering further supplies of spare parts for  the Defense Ministry as a means of repayment, and is expecting  that during the completion of the first block of Mochovce part  of the Russian supplies will be covered in this way,  Schmognerova said.    Filkus said that he had invited his Russian counterpart  Sergey Dubinin to visit Slovakia, and they could then agree on a  document on the repayment of the Russian debt. This could later  be signed in Moscow by the Slovak president or premier. At  present, he said, there are two proposals for an agreement, both  of which are found unacceptable for each side respectively.</p>

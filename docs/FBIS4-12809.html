			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Press review] </F>   [Text] The newspaper TISHRIN comments on the U.S.  Administration's announcement of a deal to supply Israel with  sophisticated F-15 assault planes, as well as Yitzhaq Rabin's  reiteration of his rejection of complete withdrawal from the  Golan and his demand that a channel for secret negotiations with  Syria be created, saying: Syria has repeatedly rejected these  loaded calls, and announced that the Washington talks are the  proper framework for negotiations, and that the Syrian  delegation to the peace talks is authorized and empowered to  conduct the negotiations. Nonetheless, Israeli officials have  not thus far given up their hopes in this regard.    TISHRIN adds: It is clear that the Israelis want to deal  with the Arab sides one at a time, just as they have done with  the Palestinians, who have allowed themselves to negotiate with  their Israeli interlocutors from a position of weakness. The  end result is that the Palestinians were dragged to an agreement  that has only consecrated occupation and settlement activities  in the occupied territories.    TISHRIN asserts that these Israeli calls are falling on deaf  ears in Syria, which has had a taste of Israeli games and  deceptive tactics.    TISHRIN goes on to say: The Israelis did not engage in the  peace process to achieve peace, but rather to extract an Arab  recognition of their entity. Their engagement in this process  has failed to elicit an Israeli commitment to the principles and  resolutions of international legitimacy. The Israelis were  encouraged in this by the United States, which has showered them  with financial and military aid under the pretext of pacifying  the Israelis and prompting them to walk the path of peace.  However, the result was that Israel has not made a single move  in the direction of peace. As a matter of fact, its security  concerns, or to be more exact, its attempts to obtain funds and  weaponry from Washington, have been on the increase. Even the  U.S. loan guarantees, which Israel pledged will not be used to  promote settlement activities, have been used to beef up  existing settlements and build new ones. Meanwhile, the United  State has failed to lift a finger.    TISHRIN concludes by saying: Given all this, the Arabs  cannot work miracles. For, they have done their utmost to  advance the peace process and sincerely dealt with the peace  efforts. However, their sincere intentions in this regard have  run into the Israeli intransigence. As for the U.S. role, it  has failed to measure up to the level required by the cause of  peace. It has failed to distinguish between the aggressor and  the victim. Indeed, it has most often shown a bias in favor of  the aggressor.    For its part, the newspaper AL-BA'TH says: After two years  of engagement in the peace process, the Israeli prime minister  has reiterated his rejection of complete withdrawal from the  occupied Golan, and again demanded either the creation of  channels for secret negotiations with Syria, or that the level  of the bilateral talks negotiators be upgraded. By making such  statements against the background of the talks currently under  way with the PLO and the international efforts being made to  advance the peace process, Rabin is setting impossible  conditions to beleaguer the peace process in order to promote  Israel's control of the region's resources.    AL-BA'TH adds: Israel's claims regarding the so-called  Syrian conditions are groundless. This is because the peace  initiative was grounded in the implementation of international  legitimacy resolutions in the first place. It goes without  saying that these resolutions provide for a complete Israeli  withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, including the  Golan. Similarly, the Madrid conference and the Washington  peace talks were held on the basis of this peace initiative.  The Washington peace talks have identified the party that is  evading to obstruct peace efforts.    Concluding its commentary, AL-BA'TH says: By reiterating his  impossible conditions and emphasizing his rejection of complete  withdrawal from the Golan, Rabin has shown that he could not  care less about the terms of reference of the peace initiative,  chief among which is the principle of trading land for peace.  As for Rabin's determination to conclude separate deals with  the Arab sides, it will not help achieve peace. For the results  of the Oslo and Cairo agreements speak for themselves. Worse  still, the potential harm of these agreements is too serious to  be underrated, contrary to the views of some people. This is  because the region will not see stability except when there is a  comprehensive peace based on the withdrawal of occupation troops  from all occupied territories.    The newspaper AL-THAWRAH says: In the course of its efforts  to promote human rights and ensure compliance with the relevant  international resolutions and conventions, the civilized world  community must heed Israel's oppression, injustice, and  repression against the Palestinian people. Israel must be held  responsible for the consequences of its conduct in the occupied  territories.    AL-THAWRAH believes that recent developments, which have  shown Israel's escalation, maneuvering, and circumvention of the  peace process to render it void of any meaningful content,  cannot evoke optimism. In such a climate, one cannot envisage a  peaceful settlement of the regional conflict. The Tel Aviv  rulers' deliberate escalation of the situation in the occupied  territories and southern Lebanon, coupled with Rabin's  statements on a partial withdrawal from the Golan, are all  signals and indications showing that peace has never been, and  will never be Israel's option unless it is imposed by  international legitimacy; that is, by the implementation of  international legitimacy resolutions on all fronts.    AL-THAWRAH adds: Conquering nations and forcing dictates on  them cannot produce peace. Peace becomes achievable when Israel  recognizes the rights of others and accepts the restoration of  their legitimate rights, which are enshrined in the relevant UN  resolutions.    AL-THAWRAH concludes by saying: The path to just and  comprehensive peace is not paved with roses. Likewise, peace is  not achievable when separate deals and partial solutions are  reached, particularly since such deals have demonstrated their  futility, and failed thus far to bring security and stability  even to their authors, let alone the entire region. It is no  longer acceptable to acquiesce to Israel's aggressiveness and  noncompliance with the relevant international legitimacy  resolutions. It follows from this that nobody, including the  U.S. cosponsor of the peace talks, should be allowed to continue  to support Israel.</p>

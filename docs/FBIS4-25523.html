			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Gao Jin'an: "Urban Plans to Vitalize Investment in </F> Nanning"]    [Text] Nanning, capital city of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous  Region, has unveiled a major programme for infrastructural  development to woo foreign investors and to catch up with the  better-developed coastal cities.    The investment will mainly go to projects in transportation,  telecommunications, energy, power and other urban projects, a  senior city official announced yesterday at a press conference  in Beijing.    Xie Ruxuan, mayor of Nanning, said the city will invest over  3 billion yuan ($344 million) this year into the projects, a 40  per cent increase over last year.    He promised that infrastructure funding will continue to  rise  in the coming years to further improve its investment climate  and build the city into a transportation hub linking Southwest  and South China with Southeast Asia.    Nanning, with a population of 2.6 million, is located at the  centre of the autonomous region and serves as an important venue  for Southwest and Central China.    At present, the Nanning-Kunming Railway, a trunkline  connecting both ends of Southwest China, is under construction  and will be completed in 1997. A number of highways and  expressways are also being built or planned.    The State Council in 1992 granted Nanning the same policies  given to coastal cities in the early 1980s, providing a good  chance for Nanning to catch up with the coast.    In the past two years, the city has approved nearly 400  foreign- funded enterprises with a promised investment of about  $1 billion. The joint ventures and investments include projects  in transportation, energy, agriculture, commerce, real estate  development and industry.    Xie said about 60 per cent of the city's total $34.46  million  in exports were produced by joint ventures.    Last year, the industrial output value topped 10 billion  yuan  ($1.15 billion) for the first time, an increase of 18.7 per cent  over the previous year.    In a sign of its robust economy, the city has no industrial  stockpile, as 99.7 per cent of its products are sold on the  market, Xie noted.    The city plans to invest 16 billion yuan ($1.84 billion) in  the next six years to start 31 major industrial projects, but  the mayor did not go into detail on the projects.    The capacity of its digital telephone system exceeded 88,500  lines last year, compared with 15,000 lines in 1990. This year,  the city will invest 500 million yuan ($57 million).</p>

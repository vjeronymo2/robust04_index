			<p><P> April 6, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P>  KITCHEN CABINET: NEW LOOKS FOR 1988'S FAVORITES  </P> <P> When a new product proves a success, there follows, almost inevitably, a  variation on that product from the same or another manufacturer. Like sequels  to hit movies, these follow-up products prove that tried-and-true ideas can be  the best.  </P> <P> The CafePresso ($200) is an innovative product from Krups that really took off  as soon as it was unveiled in the marketplace last year. Consumers bought the  machine not just for its black matte finish but mainly for its versatility.  What's new this year is the addition of white CafePressos. Although there  appears to be a strong demand and promising future for black kitchen  appliances, outselling white in many cases, Krups gambled on a white unit to  please people who go for a pristine, all-white look in kitchens.  </P> <P> The key selling point of CafePresso is its dual function. Compact looking, the  appliance features a powerful four-cup espresso/cappuccino machine and an  eight-cup drip coffee maker. Aside from being uncomplicated, the CafePresso  offers speed. Its fast steam action froths milk for cappuccino in a matter of  seconds.  </P> <P> Another extremely handy feature, also available on Krups' other coffee makers,  is Stop 'N Serve. Pioneered by Krups, this design makes it possible for the  brewing cycle to stop when the carafe is removed as for a quick one- or two-cup  serving. However, the brewing resumes automatically when the carafe is  replaced.  </P> <P> The idea of holding heat in a brewed pot of coffee has been achieved in the  invention of an insulated carafe in a coffee system. Ever since the concept was  introduced by a European company a few years ago, other manufacturers have  followed, hoping to achieve the same success.  </P> <P> Last year Black &amp; Decker released its full-size Thermal Carafe Drip Coffee  Maker ($58.98) in Euro-styling with a white base and smoked black water  reservoir. Coffee is brewed directly into an all-white vacuum-bottle thermal  carafe. When tightly covered with its lid, the insulated carafe keeps the  coffee hot and fresh for hours even though the machine is shut off. The plastic  carafe is totable and can be placed directly onto a serving table immediately  after heating without damaging the surface. An automatic drip feature  interrupts coffee flow when the pot is removed.  </P> <P> A similarly styled upgraded version is equipped with an analog clock/timer  ($75.98). It can be set the night before and programmed to brew anytime within  the next 24 hours. Taking advantage of the same concept and new this year is  Black &amp; Decker's personal-size Four-Cup Thermal Carafe Coffee Maker  ($44.98).  </P> <P> Considering changing patterns in coffee drinking habits, Black &amp; Decker's  marketing manager Jeff Bye says, "More Americans than ever are drinking coffee,  but they're drinking fewer cups a day. . . . Our new personal-size coffee  makers were created so that coffee drinkers who want only a few cups can enjoy  flavorful coffee without wasting a drop."  </P> <P> Like the full-size models, the personal-size coffee systems are designed with a  brewing light that signals when coffee is ready and automatic drip stop. And,  for peace of mind after rushing out the door, all units were created with an  automatic shut off feature after the brewing process is completed.  </P> <P> Black may be the strong statement in small portable appliances, but white seems  to be the direction taken by manufacturers for major kitchen appliances. This  clean contemporary look follows the sleek European style of kitchen design. GE  Appliances' new line of kitchen and laundry appliances is called  "white-on-white." Creating a softer, sophisticated design with an integrated  look, the models are white with white control panels and subtle gray graphics.  </P> <P> One of the first units to arrive is the Spacecenter 27 side-by-side  refrigerator. The new all-white unit (model TFXW27F) offers the same GE  Refreshment Center door, an exclusive custom dispenser offering chilled water  and crushed or cubed ice. The door swings down and becomes a built-in counter  space for handy serving of beverages and snacks.  </P> <P> "This refrigerator, designed as a food management system that allows for  efficient organization of a large quantity of foods and beverages, has been  highly popular since we introduced it in 1986," said Gary M. Christensen,  general manager of GE's refrigeration products. Another innovative feature is  the electronic monitor with solid state electronics that light up and beep to  alert the user of possible problems.  </P> <P> For convenience, there is a Quick Serve System under the refrigerator shelf  that contains five storage dishes that are microwaveable and dishwasher proof.  The model also includes a food-saver system with three vegetable/fruit pans,  door shelves that hold gallon containers, 3-liter bottles and six-packs.  </P> <P> </P> <P> The Krups CafePresso are available at Bullock's, Broadway and Robinson's.  </P> <P>  The Black &amp; Decker thermal carafe coffee makers will be available end of  April at Broadway, Adray's and Home Express (Orange County).  </P> <P>  The GE Spacecenter 27 (model TFXW2F) is available at GE appliance dealers.

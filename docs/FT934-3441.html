			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Blood, sweat and tears - for others: Contenders line up for next Sunday's democratic parliamentary elections Mr Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of Russia's extreme right-wing party, is campaigning on a platform of 'blood, sweat and tears' - for everyone, that is, except the Russians, writes Chrystia Freeland. 'Why should we create suffering for ourselves?' the husky, 47-year-old lawyer-turned-politician asks. 'We should create suffering for others.' Translating this rhetoric into a political programme, the head of Russia's deceptively named Liberal Democratic Party says he will make Russia rich again by selling arms to the highest bidder, including such pariah states as Libya and Iraq, and by bringing an immediate halt to all subsidies - including the sale of fuel at less than world prices - to other former Soviet republics. Mr Zhirinovsky supports President Boris Yeltsin's draft constitution because it would lay the ground for the sort of strong, centralised state he favours. He is also promising to renew Russia's international prestige by defending the rights of ethnic Russians everywhere, bullying Russia's immediate neighbours and talking back to the west. His aggressive Russian nationalism has, however, forced him to engage in some contortions to explain his own, not entirely 'pure' ancestry. He stresses that although he comes from Alma Ata, capital of Kazakhstan, 'I was born among Russians and so I consider myself to have been born in Russia itself.' But, while Mr Zhirinovsky's flamboyant style and hyperbolic language make it tempting to dismiss him, there are growing indications that the extreme right, rather than the Communists, will be the beneficiary of the protest vote in this weekend's elections. 'The Russian people have three choices,' Mr Zhirinovsky says. 'We can either choose that which we have now by voting for Gaidar or Yavlinsky, which does not suit many people. Or we can choose to go backwards, by voting for the Communists, which also does not suit many people. My party represents a third choice.' Mr Zhirinovsky, who seeks simultaneously to emphasise his humble origins (his autobiography begins with a sentimental description of his birth and childhood in a crowded, communal apartment) and his superior intellect ('tell your readers that Zhirinovsky knows four languages and graduated with honours from Moscow University' he instructs a journalist), is refreshingly frank about which sectors of Russian society are most likely to opt for his 'third choice'. 'In the large cities, where the more cultured, better educated, more prosperous classes live, we will not do so well. But in the small cities, in the rural areas of Russia, among the poor, among the young, among the military personnel, we will be supported.' As one of the few leading politicians to have never been a member of the Communist party, he certainly has the potential to conjure up a dangerously appealing vision of Russia. With his promises to 'bring the non-Russian republics to their knees', reverse 'Gorbachev's and Yeltsin's policies of giving everything to the west' and, most magically of all, to raise wages while stopping inflation, Mr Zhirinovsky represents what many Russians dream of: a Russia which is a great power, but not a Communist one.</p>

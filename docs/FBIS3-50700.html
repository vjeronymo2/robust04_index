Fifteen armored personnel carriers, jeeps equipped with  light  artillery and several ambulances crossed San Cristobal on  Tuesday around 2200 apparently heading toward Ocosingo, which  was still occupied by the rebels of the Zapatist National  Liberation Army [EZLN].    Military authorities are still keeping quiet regarding the  ongoing operations against the EZLN, which launched a surprise  attack on 1 January. Apparently, some 12,000 soldiers are  participating in the counteroffensive.    According to several witnesses, the rebels -- who reportedly  total 1,000 -- continued their withdrawal from various towns on  Tuesday, moving their casualties to the mountain area.</p>

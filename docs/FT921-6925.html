			<p>920225 FT  25 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: EC, SEC may hold talks on New York listing THE European Community is likely to enter into direct negotiations with the Securities &amp; Exchange Commission - the US securities regulator - over removing obstacles to the listing of German and other European companies' shares on the New York Stock Exchange. The development follows unsuccessful attempts last year by a number of large German companies to persuade the SEC to moderate its requirement that all foreign companies wanting to list their shares in the US should comply with full listing requirements. Not a single German company has a listing in the US, chiefly because of an extreme reluctance to publish figures in line with US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as required by the SEC. US accounting rules require far greater disclosure than the German equivalent and have a tendency to make reported profits look more generous than in Germany. German companies, including Daimler-Benz, the big chemicals companies and some big banks, are believed to have argued with the SEC last year that their shares ought to be accepted for a listing on a reciprocal basis - namely that if they have met listing requirements in Germany they ought to be accepted in the US too.</p>

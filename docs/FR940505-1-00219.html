			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> If the enhanced in-use I/M liability threshold is reached,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA proposes that manufacturers become subject to a selective  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recall and be responsible for all subsequent vehicle repairs that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> are identified by the enhanced I/M emission test at the enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in-use I/M standards (described previously) and the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> purge/pressure tests. Manufacturers would thereafter be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for all vehicle repairs within that engine family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> model year until the end of the vehicle's useful life. A  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's repair responsibility would begin after the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability threshold is reached, with no retroactive liability.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is not proposing reimbursement from the manufacturer to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> individual vehicle owners for repairs that occurred prior to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exceeding the enhanced in-use I/M liability threshold.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also concerned that some repairs to high mileage  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles could cost more than the vehicle is worth. EPA is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> therefore proposing to allow a manufacturer to remedy an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> emissions failure by purchasing (or offering to purchase) the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle. The manufacturer could then remove the vehicle from  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> service instead of making the necessary repairs. The actual  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> value could be determined through a National Automobile Dealer's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Association (NADA) publication (e.g., ``Blue Book value'') or via  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> negotiation. The latter is always available, but, as the only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option, could become quite involved and result in vastly  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> different prices being paid for similar vehicles. EPA therefore  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proposes that the manufacturer be allowed to offer the average  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> retail value for the vehicle in question as specified in the NADA  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> ``Official Used Car Guide,'' if the manufacturers elects this  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> option. One option would utilize the national ``Blue Book'' to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> avoid the possible effects of this program on ``Blue Book'' levels  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> in California. Another option would be to use the ``Blue Book''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> applicable in the specific FIP area. EPA is also concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the ``Blue Book'' value may not fully compensate an owner for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> time and energy needed to find a new vehicle and other intangibles.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA requests comment on other methods of determining values that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> proximate the market value of the vehicle, as well as the value  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to its owner, but provide reasonable protection for the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Under this proposal, the vehicle owner has the option of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejecting the manufacturer's offer to purchase their vehicle.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Instead, the owner could repair the vehicle at his or her own  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> expense or sell the vehicle in an area not subject to enhanced  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I/M and the enhanced in-use compliance program. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturer's liability to repair the vehicle would end after  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the offer to purchase the vehicle was either consummated or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rejected in writing.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is also concerned whether the manufacturer would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> exercise its responsibility to repair the vehicle in a way which  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> minimized inconvenience to the owner. EPA therefore proposes  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that all required repairs be performed in an expeditious manner  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and requests comments on specific requirements that could be used  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to ensure this was in fact done. Specifically, EPA proposes, and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requests comments on, requiring manufacturers to provide a rental  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicle of equivalent value and function free of charge if the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> repairs required more than two days in total.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> f. Geographic coverage <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> .  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing that enhanced I/M be used in the designated  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> California FIP areas of Sacramento, Los Angeles, and Ventura.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> EPA is proposing to limit the geographic scope of the I/M-based  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> recall program to the FIP areas. EPA does not believe it would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be appropriate to apply the I/M-based recall program to areas not  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> having full enhanced I/M based on the I/M 240 test.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> However, vehicles from outside the three FIP areas do impact  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> air quality in the three FIP areas. Therefore, EPA requests  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> comment on the option of including the vehicles tested in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying enhanced I/M 240 test programs in other nonattainment  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> areas in California in the I/M-based recall program. The test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results from such vehicles would then also be used to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance with the liability threshold. Under this option, only  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a state enhanced I/M program which either duplicates the federal  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> program or is approved by the Administrator as equivalent would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be allowed to participate.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> g. Data collection from test-sites. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Agency proposes that enhanced I/M testing facilities  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> submit the results of all I/M tests, as well as engine family  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> data from the underhood label, on all vehicles tested, to EPA on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a monthly basis. This information will be used to calculate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> failure rates. In addition, personnel at such facilities would  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> be required to retain and maintain results from I/M tests for a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> period of one year.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> h. Manufacturer notification of liability. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  The Agency will provide manufacturers with cumulative test  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> results on their engine families on a monthly basis.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Additionally EPA will notify vehicle manufacturers, by letter,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> within thirty days after the rate of failure meets or exceeds the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> liability threshold. Manufacturers' responsibility for repairs  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> begins 30 days after EPA sends notification.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> I/M personnel will notify owners of failing vehicles, when  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles are brought in for emissions testing, with whom  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility for repair lies. Vehicle owners must be informed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> when repair responsibility for vehicles has been shifted to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> manufacturers. EPA requests comment on requiring manufacturers  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to inform all vehicle owners, by letter, if the failure rate for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the enhanced in-use I/M standards has exceeded the liability  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> threshold. Such a letter would state that vehicle owner repair  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsibility has ended and that the manufacturer is thereafter  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> responsible for vehicle emission repairs until the statutory  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> useful life ends as long as the vehicle is participating in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> qualifying enhanced I/M program and has not been abused or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> tampered. One negative aspect of such a requirement is that it  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> may lead vehicle owners to care less carefully for their  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> vehicles, given the knowledge that much maintenance would now be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> covered by the manufacturer.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> 5.

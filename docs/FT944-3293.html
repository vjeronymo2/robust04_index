			<p>941214 FT  14 DEC 94 / People: Departures Humphrey Odd, managing director of Diesel Marine International and John Kirkham, DMI's finance director, are to leave the company on December 31 in a cost-cutting move by parent Torday &amp; Carlisle. The head office staff of the North Tyneside-based engineering group and of DMI, its biggest subsidiary, are to be merged. Group chief executive Eric Brightmore will become managing director of DMI and group finance director Steve Scott will become DMI fd as well. The departures of Odd and Kirkham are intended to be the final fall-out from a difficult few years for T&amp;C, which led to the departure in early 1994 of Paul Torday, then chief executive. 'Major changes of personnel are over,' says Brightmore, who became chief executive in April. This year the group closed its Newcastle headquarters and moved to a building adjacent to DMI. With DMI comprising two thirds of the group there is no longer a need, says Brightmore, for two head office staffs. 'It's a cost-cutting streamlining,' he added. The changes mean the five executive directors on the T&amp;C board will also be directors of DMI. Odd, currently a T&amp;C director, declined to comment on his departure.</p>

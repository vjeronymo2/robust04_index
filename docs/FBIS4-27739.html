			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Thor S. Orig] </F>   [Text] Foreign Secretary Roberto Romulo and German  Ambassador Dr. Peter Scholz signed recently a protocol on  financial assistance which secures funds for further enhancement  of vital infrastructures.    Under the arrangement, Germany will provide a loan of  Deutsche Marks (DM) 30 million for the Philippines to meet the  demands for electricity generation in Metro Manila including the  construction of a 230-KV high voltage transmission line between  Labrador and Masinloc and the Labrador substation expansion.    In addition, Germany grants another DM 20 million for the  improvement of potable water supply in seven rural areas.    Power and water supply are two of several major concerns of  RP [Republic of the Philippines]-German cooperation.    By financing these projects through KfW (Kreditanstalt fuer  Wiederaufbau, Frankfurt) Germany continues to address critical  points of Philippine development with emphasis on environmental  protection.</p>

			<p>920219 FT  19 FEB 92 / Maxwell lawyers risk clash with MPs by keeping silent LAWYERS acting for Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother Ian have risked a confrontation with MPs by again refusing to answer questions sent by the House of Commons committee investigating the raiding of Maxwell companies' pension funds. In a letter to the social security committee, lawyers for the brothers have refused to allow even written responses to the MPs' questionnaire, in spite of earlier indications that they might break their silence. Their decision could prompt MPs to call for a full debate on the Maxwells' apparent defiance of parliament's authority - although many MPs may be anxious to avoid political rows so close to the general election. Last month, when the brothers appeared before the committee, their lawyers said they had a 'a precious constitutional right and a historic one' to remain silent. The Maxwells' lawyers have repeatedly referred to the possibility of their clients facing legal action over the conduct of companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell, and similar arguments are believed to have been used in their letter to the committee. They had previously indicated that written answers to the MPs questions might be possible. However, they suggested guarantees would be required to ensure that the information would not be made public until the risk of prejudicing any trial had passed. The cross-party committee is looking into ways of preventing abuse of pension funds. It gave trustees of all the Maxwell pension funds, including the Maxwell brothers, two weeks to reply to 70 questions on the Maxwell pension fund raids. The questionnaire asked how much was missing from each pension fund, when the trustees had become aware it had gone, and how it had disappeared. Trustees were also asked if they were party to the signing of any transfer of funds. About 50 questionnaires were sent out. Most have now been returned and the responses are expected to be published by the Commons shortly. The committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, will meet soon to decide its response to the Maxwells' continuing refusal to answer questions, and whether to recommend further action.</p>

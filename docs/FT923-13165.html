			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / International Company News: Legal charge exacerbates Bethlehem loss BETHLEHEM Steel, the second-largest US steel group, yesterday reported a second-quarter loss of Dollars 64m after taking a Dollars 25m charge in connection with a legal battle. The company said that, excluding the charge, its net loss for the period was Dollars 39m, a little better than the Dollars 45m loss recorded in the same period of last year. Bethlehem only announced its bottom line figures yesterday and said its complete results for the period would be unveiled on July 29. The Dollars 25m charge increases the company's reserve for loss contingencies in connection with a dispute over title to coal previously mined by Bethlehem. In early June, the Kentucky Supreme Court filed a 4-3 opinion adverse to Bethlehem in the case. Bethlehem said that in the second quarter its steel production costs were lower than in the first quarter, but average realised prices were also lower for most of its products. It expected prices to improve later this year and in 1993 if the US economy improved.</p>

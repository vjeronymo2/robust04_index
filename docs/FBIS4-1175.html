			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Statement issued by the ANC on the SAPA PR Wire Service on </F> 24 April]    [Text] Once again enemies of democracy have plunged our  country and its people into a period of mourning with a car  bomb-blast that left 9 people dead and 92 others wounded in the  Johannesburg city centre on Sunday 24 April.    According to eye-witness accounts, a white man was seen  alighting from the car used in the blast and rushing away from  the scene minutes before the explosion. In the ensuing  explosion, ANC, PAC [Pan-Africanist Congress], Cosatu [Congress  of South African Trade Unions] offices in the vicinity, private  homes and business premises were damaged. Windows,  communication lines and computers at ANC headquarters and  regional offices were seriously affected.    A member of the ANC local government transitional team and  ANC PWV [Pretoria, Witwatersrand, Vereeniging] regional  elections candidate Susan Keane, who was on her way to a meeting  at ANC PWV regional office was killed. Her colleague and a  member of the ANC PWV regional executive committee Joan Fubbs  escaped unhurt but had to be treated for shock at a local  hospital.    Although the ANC cannot at this stage point accusing fingers  at a specific organisation or persons, the ANC believes that the  blast is an attack on peace, democracy and the forthcoming April  27 elections by a tiny minority. Their plans must not succeed.    The ANC appeals to all our people, black and white not to be  provoked into rash actions but to hand down their verdict on  such heinous acts by massively turning out to the polls on April  27 to vote for democracy.    The ANC extends its deepest sympathy to members of the  bereaved families and wish those wounded a speedy recovery. We  express our sympathy with all those whose homes and business  premises have been damaged.    In this regard, the ANC dips its banners in memory of one of  our glorious daughters of our country, our beloved Susan Keane.  It is unfortunate that she died at a time when all she had  lived and struggled for throughout her life is about to come to  fruition. Our people deserve the right to live without fear of  violence and intimidation.    The ANC calls for a speedy and thorough investigation into  the cold-blooded murder and injury of innocent men and women of  our country. In this context, we call for the arrest and  prosecution of those responsible.</p>

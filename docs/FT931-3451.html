			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad The battle between Airtours and Owners has become an unedifying dogfight. Thomas Cook's last-minute move to buy 8.4 per cent of Owners' shares in the market at 152 1/2 p apiece may have tilted the balance in the defence's favour. If so, Cook could then proceed with its tender offer for a further 12.5 per cent of Owners' shares at 150p enabling the two parties to consummate their strategic alliance. This may serve Cook's interests well. It is not clear if it is as good for all Owners' shareholders. The guiding principle of the Takeover Code suggests that an offeror should treat all the offeree's shareholders equally. Cook has not made a bid and therefore has no such obligation. Nevertheless, it has cynically tried to curb Owners' shareholders' freedom of choice. Although not prepared to bid, Cook is prepared to scupper a rival offer by dislodging some loose institutional holders of Owners' shares. It would then be able to deter further bids with its large blocking stake. Wavering shareholders should reject such tactics. The Airtours' offer still looks the best alternative. Sadly, this tale confirms how some bids have degenerated into back-room deals between companies and fund managers. Small shareholders might be forgiven for feeling cheated.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Seoul, Feb. 7 (YONHAP) -- The government said on  Monday that inter-Korean trade is not affected by the  regulations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  or the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it takes place  inside the nation.    A senior official at the National Unification Board (NUB)  said, "inter-Korean trade is naturally recognized as an  'internal transaction' according to the basic agreement between  South and North Korea concluded in early 1992 as well as to the  United Nations Charter and the GATT regulations, both of which  admit the self-determination rights of a divided country."    The government will send its final implementation plan to  the  gatt on Feb. 15, but the issue of inter-Korean trade will not be  included, according to the official.    The clarification of NUB's position on inter-Korean trade  came after Kyongsillyon, the Citizens' Coalition for Economic  Justice (CCEJ), recently announced that inter-Korean trade  should be recognized as an internal affair just as that of West  and East Germany had formerly been.</p>

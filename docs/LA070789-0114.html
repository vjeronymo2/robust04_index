The building will be a duplicate of the Transamerica Building,  a white, precast concrete office tower built four years ago.  </P> <P> Koll's partner in the building is Zenitaka Corp., which acquired the  joint-venture rights from Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Cos.  </P> <P> Zenitaka, a 100-year-old contractor, acquired in the same deal the  joint-venture rights with Koll to a second site nearby, Koll said. Both sites  are next to the Transamerica building and the five-story Marine National Bank  building, which are joint ventures of Koll and the life insurance company.  </P> <P> Gensler &amp; Associates designed the new, 234,500-square-foot building, which  is scheduled for completion in 1990, Koll said.  </P> <P> Koll Center Irvine is a 104-acre, $1-billion office and retailing center on  both sides of the San Diego Freeway at Von Karman Avenue. The new building will  be the 13th in the center.  </P></p>

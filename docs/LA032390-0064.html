			<p><P> March 23, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BUSH'S NEW SECURITY-STRATEGY PLAN SIDESTEPS ISSUE OF SOVIET TARGETS  </P> <P> Despite sweeping changes in the East Bloc, President Bush's first National  Security Strategy differs little from previous plans and makes no mention at  all of Soviet targets that would be attacked in a nuclear war.  </P> <P> The Administration was expected to begin revising the existing nuclear war  plans because of the radically changed political atmosphere and the anticipated  U.S.-Soviet strategic arms treaty to cut nuclear arsenals up to 50%.  </P> <P> For example, at least hundreds of targets in Eastern Europe -- such as  Bulgarian steel mills and Polish seaports -- are expected to be eliminated, now  that political changes have loosened those countries' ties to the Soviet Bloc.  </P> <P> Since previous strategy reports have outlined Soviet target policy, the  omission in the Bush report sent to Congress on Tuesday initially raised  speculation that the Administration had begun a targeting review. However, a  senior Administration official said the omission had "no particular  significance." And other officials confirmed that the Pentagon under Bush is  following the same guidance on targeting inherited from the Reagan  Administration.  </P> <P> That guidance calls for attacking leadership bunkers occupied by party leaders,  including Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, whose reforms are supported by  the Administration.  </P> <P> Various experts said the White House omitted any reference to targeting because  a review of basic targeting concepts could undercut the Pentagon's request for  new weapon systems, such as the B-2 Stealth bomber, which are designed to carry  out the attacks as now planned.  </P> <P> The President wrote that his strategy report comes at a time of "truly  breathtaking" change and "historic opportunity" in international affairs.  </P> <P> A report "fact sheet" highlighted 14 policies. When presidential aides were  asked to identify one policy that was new since the Berlin Wall fell in  November, they could not do so.  </P> <P> "The report doesn't break a lot of new ground," one official admitted.  </P> <P> The Reagan Administration's language on targeting is apparently still reflected  in the Pentagon's super-secret nuclear war plans. Reagan's 1988 strategy report  said that targeting policy is to "hold at risk Soviet war-making capabilities,  including both the full range of Soviet military forces and the war-supporting  industry. . . ."  </P> <P> It adds that the policy also is to "place at risk . . . the mechanisms for  ensuring survival of the Communist Party and its leadership cadres. . . ."  </P> <P> In its section on deterring nuclear war, the Bush report did not address  targets. Instead, it reiterated the call for funding multibillion-dollar  weapons programs: the B-2 Stealth bomber, the D-5 Trident submarine-launched  missile and the MX and Midgetman mobile intercontinental missiles.  </P> <P> "The Administration just doesn't want to raise the subject of targeting," said  one expert.  </P> <P> A European expert who recently talked with Administration officials said: "They  don't want to rock the boat just now. It might cost them support for their  program."  </P> <P> A targeting review would certainly find that a significant portion of the  current targets could be eliminated.  </P> <P> "The only way to bring the East Europeans into a war on the Soviet side today  would be to attack them," one analyst said, expressing dismay that U.S. nuclear  weapons apparently are still aimed at the newly reformed governments in  Czechoslovakia and Poland.  </P> <P> More important, a targeting review could raise doubts about aiming so many U.S.  weapons at Soviet weapons because if the Soviets launched a surprise attack,  the Soviet missiles would probably be en route rather than in their silos when  U.S. warheads struck.  </P> <P> "If they decided that such targeting doesn't make sense, it would undermine  funding for the D-5 missile and maybe even the MX," another expert said.  </P></p>

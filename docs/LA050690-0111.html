			<p><P> May 6, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> AMERICA'S LOST MAIN STREET;  </P> <P> ROUTE 66 THE MOTHER ROAD BY MICHAEL WALLIS (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $29.95; 256  PP.; 0-312-04049-0)  </P> <P> You're heading southwest out of Springfield, Ill., on old 66 -- the Mother  Road, as John Steinbeck called it once and Michael Wallis calls it often --  when you come on Our Lady of the Highways.  </P> <P> She's nothing much, really, but she's really something. A statue of the Virgin  set in an alcove on the edge of a cornfield by the side of the road, she's  advertised by a series of hand-painted signs leading you phrase by phrase  through the Hail Mary along half a mile of fence posts. Schoolchildren made  those signs, and dreamed up the Virgin and paid for her in 1959 (she cost $400  shipped from Italy, plus another $500 for the construction of her grotto), and  the farmer who gave her a piece of his cornfield back then is still taking care  of her today.  </P> <P> An item about Our Lady of the Highways: When the Interstate came in, blowing  the communities along this section of Route 66 back into the socioeconomic  equivalent of the previous century, the Feds wanted the signs taken off those  fence posts. Devotional hand-lettering and modern superhighways, they felt  quite rightly, do not mix. But the signs were four inches inside the farmer's  property line, and the farmer wasn't an easily intimidated sort, so today you  can still read that sequential Hail Mary and view Our Lady of the Highways. If,  that is, you're not in a hurry to get somewhere.  </P> <P> But then, if you were in a hurry, you wouldn't be on old 66 in the first place,  would you?  </P> <P> So why would you be? Well, as Michael Wallis' opening line observes, "Route 66.  Just the name is magic." That it is; those double sixes roll fast and snappy  with a gambler's edge, a certain smooth swagger perfect for the first (and  American) internal-combustion century. And then also there's "Route 66. An  inspiration to literature, music, drama, art, and a nation of dreamers," which  it certainly has been. And there's the highway as "truly a road of phantoms and  dreams" which was "fashioned from vision and ingenuity." There's a great deal  else besides -- Wallis is really gunning the gush here, honking his hyperbole  -- until, finally, the promotional prose concentrates itself into two themes  which will accompany your whole long ride.  </P> <P> The first theme is "Diners and cafes with big-boned waitresses. Waitresses who  served up burgers, plate lunches and homemade pie. Waitresses with coffeepots  welded to their fists. Waitresses with handkerchiefs and corsages pinned to  their bosoms. Waitresses, like Steinbeck's Mae, who called everybody 'Honey,'  winked at the kids, and yelled at the cook."  </P> <P> Waitresses, in fact, for 2,400 burger-studded miles, all the way from downtown  Chicago to Palisades Park at the foot of Santa Monica Blvd., just yards short  of the Pacific. (That's the turf of Route 66, the continent's first paved  connection between Lake Michigan and the ocean.) Waitresses beckoning you on  through eight states, your accumulated distance consumed by the expectation of  their ribs, dogs, custards, pies, fries, or, in the westerly reaches at least,  burritos, tacos and beans.  </P> <P> That's how it is in Wallis' book, and that's how it was in reality throughout  many years of 66's pre-eminence, a series of greasy redolences motivating  generations forward: Kerouac wanna-be's looking for America, the Beaver in the  back seat on the traffic-jammed holiday road, millions getting their first  sight of mountains, deserts and ultimately ocean. Perhaps not, however, the  earlier Okies taking Steinbeck's "road of flight" to Bakersfield and beyond, or  soldiers and sailors heading for hell in the Pacific; the burger heaven whose  memory is still tangible along 66's now broken ribbon wasn't fully in place  until the early 1950s.  </P> <P> Wallis' journey leapfrogs from meal to meal, then, and between excursions into  skeletal communities and phantom tourist traps and the odd still-cooking  enterprise (the Pig Hip Restaurant in Illinois, Tulsa's Metro Diner, Lillian  Redman's justly praised Blue Swallow Motel in Tucumcari) he samples what real  all-American road food remains available and reports his experiences  faithfully. On the worth and wonder of what food has vanished, he can only  speculate, and he does that too.  </P> <P> The second theme of the book emerges from all this shifting gastronomy, these  ghostburgers and big-boned waitresses and their surrounding Americana. From  beginning to end, Wallis equates Route 66 with a familiar nostalgicist's  package: the combination of small-town culture, high personal individuality,  low technology and crime rates, and other pleasant attributes which make up the  generally agreed-upon family version of Yesteryear's U.S.A.  </P> <P> He mines this vein with a vigor leading almost to exhaustion, and doesn't stop  there; we're also hard-sold the proposition that the modernity supposedly  visited upon us by the Interstates which replaced Route 66 -- the fast food,  the cultural standardization, the shopping malls, the small-boned waitresses --  is deeply regrettable.  </P> <P> So two-lane 66, completely paved from Chicago to the ocean by 1937 and  completely bypassed by 1984, was once the great western artery of the national  vitality and is now an all-American treasure to be preserved and honored, while  I-55 and the rest are conduits of pestilence. OK?  </P> <P> OK, so relax and go with it. At those points where Wallis' efforts to make and  remake his point overheat his honest but somewhat under-horsed creative engine  (usually at significant junctures like chapter endings), you can always look  out the window. The roadside vistas he gives us in pictures old and new (many  of the new ones made by his wife, Susan Fitzgerald Wallis) are at least half  the trip.  </P> <P> And what a trip it is, as indeed it used to be when it was taken in reality;  the Mother Road was a mother in more ways than one. Here, for instance, while  we're somewhere close to getting out of Illinois, we have Wallis telling us  that there were "only a few inches and a cigarette paper between you and death  on Route 66," and there were "wrecks with victims so badly mangled that they  begged state troopers to shoot them and end their misery." He may not be  exaggerating, either, because farther on, in Arizona, we have a former  tow-truck driver saying: "I got tired of those wrecks. When the interstate came  along and traffic slowed down, a gentleman stopped and asked what I was going  to do, and I said, 'Stand in the middle of the highway and shout GLORY! at the  top of my lungs.' " A sole dissenting voice on the interstate vs. 66 issue,  this; elsewhere, the charms, quirks and violences of the Mother Road are much  more warmly remembered.  </P> <P> Here, for instance, are the Phillips 66 Highway Hostesses smiling for the  camera in 1939. These engaging and responsible women, plainly but smartly  uniformed, "cruised the highway providing assistance to motorists and inspected  rest rooms for cleanliness." They carried neither guns nor gas masks -- yes, it  was indeed another age -- and there were of course six of them, not five or  seven. The hostesses owed their jobs, incidentally, to an Oklahoman (Frank  Phillips, the oilman of Michael Wallis' last book, "Oilman"), just as Route 66  itself was born from the ambition of a booster of that state, Cy Avery, and  first embedded in the public imagination by the artful work of others: Lon  Scott, Andy Payne, Jack Culbreath, Will Rogers. Even today, says one of what is  evidently a small legion of admiring "roadologists," "Oklahoma is where it's at  as far as Route 66 goes."  </P> <P> Many other points of interest elsewhere, though: the Mother Road running  through Illinois and Missouri and Arkansas into Oklahoma along the 19th-Century  telegraph route, the old Wire Road ripped down and repaired again and again and  again in the War Between The States; the genuinely cavernous Meramec Caverns of  Missouri, claimed rather tentatively as one of Jesse James' hiding places and  quite authoritatively as the birthplace of the self-adhesive promotional bumper  sticker; the more grimly ghostly Arizona cave where in 1874 a band of Apache  raiders and their Navajo women captives were trapped and burned to death by the  women's husbands and brothers; Gallup, N. M., where later concentrations of  Native Americans, publicly alcoholic, earned the town the name "Drunk City" and  got it included on Mother Teresa's list of the world's forsaken places; the  highway's many red-light districts and overnight or hourly passion pits (the  originals -- the motor court was a 66 invention); and their opposite, those  long, dry, lonely Western runs for which you really needed the canvas water  bags you could buy and hang on your door handles; and of course their opposite,  the dreaded Jericho Gap west of Groom, Tex., where rain and mud combined into a  seasonal gumbo which made wreckers rich; and more, more, more, fully half a  hardscrabble continent's jumble of still-raw history. Sometimes in fact there  are so many stories and histories, and such a clamor of long-ignored voices  from the sides of this bypassed road that you're grateful for Wallis' regular  feed stops. A strawberry milkshake quiets the ghosts, a griddle is home in any  largeness.  </P> <P> It's that kind of feeling which distinguishes Wallis' book, that uniquely  American sense of a past still young and wild and accessible, of all the  national times and deeds and souls not very far away yet. Often all you need to  see this history is a slightly different angle on the everyday. That's what  Wallis has given us, and quite nicely too.  </P></p>

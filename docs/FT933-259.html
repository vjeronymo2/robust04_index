			<p>930930 FT  30 SEP 93 / Rise in French unemployment rate slows THE rise in French unemployment slowed markedly in August, with the rate of joblessness remaining steady at about 11.7 per cent, according to official figures released yesterday. The figures showed that there were 3.22m people out of work in August, up 4,000 from July. The average monthly increase in unemployment this year has been about 30,000, creating a serious political problem for the government, which has committed itself to curbing the rise in joblessness. A spokesman for the Labour Ministry welcomed the August figures, arguing that they showed the rise in unemployment is beginning to stabilise. Private sector economists also said the figures were better than expected but predicted that the rate would continue to rise until the end of the year. Mrs Marie Owens-Thomsen, economist at Midland Global markets, said yesterday's figures suggested that the trend rate of increase had stabilised, but that the rate of unemployment would probably reach 12.5 per cent by the end of December. The release of the figures coincides with the opening of the parliamentary debate on the government's five-year jobs plan. The plan, introduced on Tuesday, aims to make working hours more flexible, encourage part-time work and reduce the costs to employers of hiring new workers. However, it has been criticised for not going far enough on tackling labour market rigidities.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / International Company News: World International changes name WORLD International, the Hong Kong holding company for the late Sir Y. K. Pao's stock market-listed empire, is to change its name to Wheelock and Company in an attempt to reassert itself as a traditional hong, or trading conglomerate. The new name crystalises a change in strategy for the group, which had previously focused management attentions on the larger 44 per cent-owned property investment company, Wharf Holdings. Wheelock, founded in Shanghai in 1857, was one of southern China's most prominent trading houses. The bulk of the group's businesses were taken over in 1985 by the World group, which evolved into little more than an investment holding company for stakes in Wharf, department store operator Lane Crawford, and various listed property interests. The rationale for the name change is clearly to distance the group further from Sir Y. K. Pao's Worldwide Shipping group, and to re-establish itself under his son-in-law Mr Peter Woo as one of the four largest hongs, alongside Hutchison Whampoa, Jardine Matheson, and Swire Pacific. The aim would clearly be to lift the company's stock market rating from that of an investment holding company, to that of a broadly-based trading house: the Pao family's sole group shareholding is its 59 per cent stake in World. Mr Woo announced that he would step down to the post of honorary chairman of Wharf at the end of next year in order to concentrate his activities on World and on his charity commitments. Mr John Hung, who has also moved to become executive director of World, said the company planned to expand its interests into consumer businesses, trading, and financial services. He said the Wheelock name was well known in China, and might aid its expansion into consumer-related activities on the mainland. Wharf is now being promoted as the asset-intensive part of the group, with its property and infra-structure portfolio, while World will concentrate on management-intensive businesses. Analysts suggest that there could be some inter-group asset swaps in order to fine-tune the corporate realignment.</p>

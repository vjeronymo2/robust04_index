			<p>940212 FT  12 FEB 94 / Sport: Ice skaters turn up the heat - The red-hot drama at Lillehammer / Winter Olympics Skating is the story of the winter Olympics, which start today in Lillehammer, a little town in Norway 120 miles north of Oslo. The hot news includes the return of Torvill and Dean; the physical attack on America's ice belle, Nancy Kerrigan; and the re-appearance of German star Katarina Witt - once described, memorably, as 'sex on skates'. All are themes that will have global audiences glued to their television screens. British ice dancers Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean won gold medals in the 1984 Olympics. Judges gave them unanimous 6.0s for artistic merit as they glided around the rink to Ravel's stirring Bolero. Their 100 per cent score is unique. Since then, they have been professionals, taking their own highly-profitable ice show on tour from the tropics to the Arctic. They are taking a huge gamble in Norway, though. Revision of the rules by the International Skating Union allows professionals such as Torvill and Dean, Witt and US male gold medallist Brian Boitano to bid once more for glory at an 'amateur' level. But it does not explain why they feel compelled to do it. Kristi Yamaguchi, who won the women's individual gold medal in 1992 at Albertville, does not understand. She says she cannot imagine why anyone would turn their backs on the certain rewards of professionalism for the plain fare and butterflies of a fortnight at Lillehammer (pop: 23,000). Since December, Torvill and Dean's comeback trail has included wins at the British championships and victory - by the narrowest of margins - at the more demanding European titles in Copenhagen. But no one ever has returned to the Olympics after a decade and won gold. To this, Dean retorts: 'Obviously, we think we can win. Jayne wouldn't be trying if we didn't think it was possible. We're not doing this to make up the numbers. It's costing us a lot of money, possibly into six figures if you include lost professional opportunities. 'We've been skating solidly for 10 years and we're better than we were in 1984. Doing six numbers a night in an ice show is harder work than one four-minute number. We've developed artistically and our stamina is just as good.' Their four-minute turn in Norway will be as a virtual reincarnation of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, sashaying to the swing notes of Let's Face the Music and Dance. New ISU rules ban such highly-wrought routines as Bolero; the new ones are much lighter in tone. Despite that, Witt is performing her routine to the idealistic 1960s' ballad Where Have all the Flowers Gone? Gold medallist in 1984 and 1988, she is only 28 and claims her return to the Olympic front-line is in pursuit of global peace. Witt's recent progress, however, has been as erratic as the world's quest for harmony. She fell heavily when unveiling her new programme at a Frankfurt show, managed only second in her national competition, and burst into tears when a lacklustre showing in Copenhagen left her no higher than eighth. Yet, her supporters within skating - and they are legion - insist that Witt's forte always has been artistic and emotional expression on the ice. Triple jumps may be left to the youngsters but 'Kati' can bring on the tears, especially for the big event. Little by way of choreographed drama, though, could match the attack in Detroit last month on US skater Nancy Kerrigan. She was competing at her country's national championships and attempting to qualify for Lillehammer. As the glamorous Kerrigan sat at the rink-side, an assailant smashed at her knee with an iron bar. Screaming in pain, she was taken to hospital. Later, Jeff Gillooly, former husband of Kerrigan's main US rival, Tonya Harding, admitted his involvement in the assault. More damning still, Gillooly claimed to federal prosecutors that he, Harding, her bodyguard Shawn Eckardt and two other men conspired to injure Kerrigan and keep her out of the Olympics. Harding has proclaimed her innocence and no independent evidence has been produced to implicate her. Nevertheless, the US Figure Skating Association plans a disciplinary hearing while leaving the actual decision as to whether she can compete in Norway to the US Olympic Association. Adding to the confusion, one of the most powerful figures in the International Olympic Committee, Canadian lawyer Dick Pound, has suggested that while the matter remains in legal limbo, Harding should be allowed to take part. Harding herself has launched a Dollars 20m lawsuit against the USOA and sought an injunction restraining it from taking any action to discipline her before the resolution of any legal proceedings arising from the assault. US team spirit in Lillehammer should prove interesting. Kerrigan, meanwhile, seems to have emerged with her position enhanced. She has been pronounced physically and mentally fit for the Olympics, and it is inconceivable that a team selector would keep her on the bench. After watching her perform at a practice rink, US Olympic official Chuck Foster said: 'If there were any doubt or any questions about Nancy Kerrigan's skating condition, she answered them for us totally.'

			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / International Bonds: Swiss issue coupons fall below 6% COUPONS on Swiss franc straight bonds fell below 6 per cent yesterday, with a SFr300m 10-year issue for Osterreichische Kontrollbank, a regular borrower in the sector. Lead-manager Swiss Bank Corp admitted that the terms of the deal, with a coupon of 5.5 per cent, looked aggressive. The last time rates were at this level was nearly four years ago, when they were on the way up, it said. The market is convinced that rates have further to fall, it said, as the Swiss franc benefits from a shift of sentiment caused by the currency turmoil in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and other European countries. The previous issue from Osterreichische Kontrollbank, in early October, for SFr300m over 10 years through SBC, had a coupon of 6.25 per cent. In addition to the Austrian state guarantee, this latest issue could be helped by the general shortage of new paper at this time of the year, agreed bankers. SBC surprisingly led a second deal on a day when most other houses reported little or no new issue activity. Credit Local de France is raising SFr125m over seven years through a private placement, which SBC said was greeted less enthusiastically than the OKB bonds. It carries a coupon of 5 3/4 per cent. Elsewhere, the market expects the two separate Y10bn Euroyen issues for Daicel Chemical Industries to find their way back to Japan fairly quickly. One issue is for four years, the other is for seven years. Moody's, the rating agency, has lowered the long-term ratings of Banque Nationale de Paris and Credit Lyonnais. BNP's senior debt was cut to Aa1 from Aaa while Moody's cut the Credit Lyonnais rating to Aa3 from Aa2.</p>

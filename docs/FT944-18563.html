			<p>941003 FT  03 OCT 94 / International Company News: Ciga reduces debt Ciga, the Italian luxury hotels group controlled by ITT of the US, has cut its losses and reduced debt in the first half of 1993. The consolidated net loss for the first six months of the year reached L64bn, compared with L110bn in the equivalent period of 1993, thanks partly to an improved performance from the core hotels division. The group's share issue earlier this year has also allowed Ciga to reduce its debts to L232bn at June 30, compared with L1,102bn six months earlier. ITT, the US conglomerate which owns the Sheraton hotel chain, has 35.25 per cent of Ciga, and has launched a formal bid for a further 35.25 per cent, which will close at the end of this week.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Tokyo, June 3 KYODO -- Japan, South Korea and the  United States will seek sanctions against North Korea acceptable  to China over Pyongyang's refusal of full inspection of its  nuclear facilities, a senior Foreign Ministry official said  Friday [3 June].    "The United States feels it has been betrayed by North  Korea," the official said.    Senior officials from the three countries will discuss  slapping sanctions on North Korea in talks Friday and Saturday  in Washington following Pyongyang's rejection of unimpeded  inspections of its nuclear facilities.    Shunji Yanai, director general of the Foreign Ministry's  Foreign Policy Bureau, will attend the meeting.    The Japanese Government confirmed Friday that it will  firstly  call on the U.N. Security Council to adopt a resolution blaming  North Korea and if the United States proposes a resolution  seeking economic sanctions against the North, Japan will agree  to it, government sources said.    Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a session of the House  of  Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee on Friday that without  winning China's support the Security Council would not be able  to exert any pressure on North Korea to accept the international  call for inspections.    China is one of the five permanent Security Council members  and if it exercises its veto power, can knock down any  resolution.    A U.S. official said one main topic at the meeting will be  Washington's request that Tokyo halt remittances to North Korea  from pro-Pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan, which  are believed to be a major source of Foreign Currency for the  isolated, economically weak country.    If a veto by China prevents a possible U.S.-sponsored  resolution from being adopted by the Security Council, the three  nations are likely to impose their own sanctions against the  North, the sources said.    In case the U.N. Security Council cannot reach agreement  over  the sanctions issue due to anticipated opposition from China,  North Korea's traditional ally which favors a soft approach in  the nuclear controversy, Japan would offer "maximum cooperation"  in multilateral punitive measures, he said.    Japan could do its part by halting cash remittances to North  Korea from pro-pyongyang organizations and residents in Japan  and suspending trade with the communist country, Kakizawa said.    Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Kumagai reiterated Tokyo's  concern over North Korea's defiance of the inspection demands.    "We are deeply concerned about this situation," Kumagai told  a news conference.    "We would like to weigh what action to take in close concert  with the countries involved, such as the United States, South  Korea and China," he said.    Kumagai later said before a lower house panel, "we have no  specific sanctions in mind. We will tenaciously try to  persuade" North Korea to reach a negotiated settlement of the  nuclear row.    On Thursday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  informed the U.N. Security Council that Pyongyang's refusal to  let inspectors conduct an unimpeded check of discharged fuel  rods has made it impossible to verify whether plutonium has been  diverted in the past to manufacture atomic bombs.    North Korea last month started to exchange without IAEA  supervision the 8,000 fuel rods in its 5-megawatt reactor at  Yongbyon, sparking another Security Council statement last week  urging compliance with the agency's inspection demands.</p>

			<p>920121 FT  21 JAN 92 / New Treuhand marketing strategy aims to lift sales THE Treuhand, Germany's privatisation agency, is adjusting its marketing strategy in an attempt to sell the remaining companies in its portfolio by the end of the year, writes Andrew Jack. The 6,000 former East German enterprises still held by the agency will be sold in sectors to allow more targeted advertising to potential buyers, starting this week with the wood and furniture industry. Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen, the accountancy and consulting firms, have been appointed to act as 'mail boxes' to receive inquiries from potential international bidders. The initiatives are in part a reflection of Treuhand disappointment that it has not had more international interest in the sales. Price Waterhouse and Arthur Andersen will receive a small payment for their service, and will provide basic information on businesses being sold.</p>

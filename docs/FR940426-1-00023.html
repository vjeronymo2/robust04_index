			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The ``right to purchase'' concept has been applied to call options, warrants, convertible and exchangeable securities, and target securities in exchange offers and mergers. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 85 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  The scope of the rule is limited, however, and does not encompass a wide variety of derivative securities and instruments developed in recent years that do not give the holder the right to acquire another security. Nonetheless, these instruments derive their value in whole or in part from an equity security or from a group of equity securities, and thus potentially raise the same manipulative concerns underlying Rule 10b&hyph;6. For example, cash-settled index-related securities and instruments, such as narrow-based index options, have a value that may be derived in significant part from a component security. Similarly, the sale of a put option <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 86 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  is closely analogous in terms of its potential impact on the underlying security as a purchase of a call option, but it is not a right to purchase.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 85 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Convertible securities are considered to be rights to purchase when the holders would find it economically beneficial to convert, such as when the securities are ``in-the-money.'' See 1983 Release, 48 FR at 10631 n.28.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 86 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 10b&hyph;6 has been interpreted to cover sales of put options on a security in distribution on the theory that the puts are ``bids'' for the security in distribution, even though it is the sale rather than the continuing open position that is more likely to affect the price of the underlying stock through arbitrage or otherwise. Securities Exchange Act Release No. 17609 (March 13, 1981), 46 FR 16670.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 1.22.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should bids for and purchases of debt securities distinct from those in distribution continue to be regulated? In what circumstances is the price of or trading activity in an outstanding bond likely to be relevant in evaluating a debt offering of the same issuer?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 1.23.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Are there objective standards or quantitative models for identifying the securities that should or should not be covered? Are factors other than stated interest rates and maturities relevant to the ``same class and series'' analysis, such as differences in ratings, rankings (senior versus subordinated), and redemption features? Commenters favoring an objective approach may wish to suggest ``bright line'' factors, the presence or absence of which would establish conclusively that two securities are not of the same class and series.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 1.24.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Should the ``right to purchase'' concept be retained, or should it be replaced with a ``price-related security'' concept that would include all securities having a significant price relationship with the security in distribution? Commenters favoring such an approach should address how ``price-related securities'' should be defined and how to exclude securities or other instruments whose prices have a highly attenuated economic relationship to and, therefore, little potential impact upon the security in distribution.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Question 1.25.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Under what circumstances should it be permissible to purchase a security in distribution in the normal course of business as part of a standardized or non-standardized ``basket'' of securities?  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> VI. Stabilization  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Concept Five:  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Stabilization of offerings should be restricted in order to minimize its manipulative impact.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> A. Current Regulatory Approach  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The express purpose of stabilization is to affect a security's price. Therefore, during securities offerings, where the underwriter has the purpose to induce others to buy the offered security, stabilization is a form of manipulation. As a rationale for permitting stabilization through regulation, the Commission pointed to the significant risks to which underwriters are subject in firm commitment underwritings. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 87 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  In Rule 10b&hyph;7, the Commission codified previously articulated guidelines for determining which transactions effected to peg, fix, or stabilize the price of a security constitute lawful stabilization as a means to facilitate the placement of securities in an orderly manner, and which transactions constitute unlawful manipulation.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 87 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> Release 34&hyph;2446.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Rule 10b&hyph;7 applies to ``any person who, either alone or with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly, stabilizes the price of a security to facilitate an offering of any security.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 88 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  Stabilizing transactions are those involving ``the placing of any bid, or the effecting of any purchase, for the purpose of pegging, fixing or stabilizing the price of any security.'' <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 89 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  To prevent stabilizing activities from improperly affecting the market for a security, Rule 10b&hyph;7 prohibits certain specific activities, including bids or purchases not necessary for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the open market price of the security, and stabilizing at a price resulting from unlawful activity. The rule establishes the price level at which a stabilizing bid may be entered, and rules of priority for the execution of independent bids at times when a stabilizing bid has been entered. In addition, the rule regulates the number of stabilizing bids that an underwriting syndicate may enter in any one market at any one time, and the entry of stabilizing bids on markets other than the principal market for the security being stabilized. The rule also requires that notice be given that the market will be or is being stabilized, and requires a person effecting stabilizing transactions to keep the information and make the notification required by Rule 17a&hyph;2 under the Exchange Act. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=5 f=1 --> 90 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 88 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;7(a).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 89 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.10b&hyph;7(b)(3).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=5 f=1 --> 90 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 17 CFR 240.17a&hyph;2. Rule 17a&hyph;2 generally requires the managing underwriter in an offering that is being stabilized to record specified information on the offered security, each stabilizing purchase, and the identity and commitments of syndicate members, and to furnish similar information to each syndicate member.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

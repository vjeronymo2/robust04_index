			<p><P> January 29, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> SCIENCE / MEDICINE;  </P> <P> SUPER-COLD PHYSICS SEEKS NEW LOWS: 'ABSOLUTE ZERO';  </P> <P> RESEARCH: SCIENTISTS HOPE TO LEARN HOW MATTER ORGANIZES ITSELF WITHOUT THE  DISTURBING EFFECTS OF HEAT, AND WHY MATERIALS BECOME SUPER-CONDUCTING OR  SUPERFLUID.  </P> <P> Until recently the coldest spot in the universe has been the empty void of deep  space. But space is balmy compared to the ultra-frigid temperatures being  pursued by laboratories in New York and Florida, where dueling refrigerators  are approaching the ultimate in cold: a state called absolute zero.  </P> <P> For scientists who pursue record cold temperatures, absolute zero is a place of  beauty and mystery. In this super-cold clime, strange and new phenomena begin  to unfold: Conductors become super-conducting (losing all resistance to the  flow of electricity); fluids become superfluid (losing all viscosity); and all  matter attempts to reach a state of perfect order.  </P> <P> "We have theories. We have laws. But we really don't know what will happen  until we cool things down," said Robert Richardson of Cornell University.  "Low-temperature physics is largely the physics of the unknown."  </P> <P> Near the ultimate limits of cold, the research refrigerators that fill entire  buildings are so sensitive that even stray radio waves, or earthquakes on the  other side of the world, can create vibrations that jiggle the super-cold  atoms, which -- like rubbing two sticks together -- will send temperatures in  the experiment soaring.  </P> <P> Absolute zero is 459.67 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. Scientists measure such  extremes not in degrees, but in a scale that uses units called Kelvins, or K,  which are named for William Thomson Kelvin, the 19th-Century British physicist  who proposed the scale. Absolute zero is 0 K.  </P> <P> Until scientists learned to manipulate cold in their laboratories, the lowest  known temperature in the universe was 3 K, occurring in the void of space  between the stars. Early in this century, scientists managed to liquefy helium  gas by subjecting it to repeated cycles of cooling in special refrigerators.  Once liquefied, helium stays colder than 4 K and can be stored in the  laboratory equivalent of a thermos bottle. Several years later, in 1911,  scientists found that certain materials suddenly become superconductors at  these low temperatures.  </P> <P> In the last few years, laboratories in Britain, Japan and Finland -- using ever  more sophisticated refrigerators and better insulators -- have reached  temperatures of a few millionths of a Kelvin. In special settings, individual  atomic nuclei have been cooled to a few billionths of a Kelvin.  </P> <P> Scientists at new laboratories funded by the National Science Foundation at  Cornell University and the University of Florida are now trying to match, and  perhaps exceed, these record lows. They hope to learn how matter organizes  itself without the disturbing effects of heat and why materials become  super-conducting or superfluid. Researchers are trying to cool down silicon,  helium and thin films of metals such as silver and platinum.  </P> <P> In all materials, in solids as well as gases and liquids, the atoms are  constantly in motion, vibrating and colliding with each other, creating thermal  energy. The wilder the motion, the greater the heat.  </P> <P> "Before the laws of quantum mechanics were revealed, absolute zero was thought  of as the temperature when all motion would come to a stop," when atoms, and  their subatomic components such as electrons and protons, would stop their  frenetic vibrations and collisions, "and would collapse as if into a black  hole," said Dwight Adams, a low-temperature physicist at the University of  Florida at Gainesville.  </P> <P> This is now known to be untrue. At absolute zero, atoms would still vibrate.  Electrons would still swirl in a cloud around the nucleus. Indeed, helium would  even remain in a liquid state at absolute zero, unless it was placed under  enough pressure to force it into a solid.  </P> <P> But the atomic order at 0 K would be perfect. In a solid, each atom, though  quietly wiggling, would occupy a precise location in the material. In a liquid  or gas, even though the atoms may move from spot to spot, they would move in  unison. They would all be in perfect order, or in what physicists call the same  quantum state.  </P> <P> To reach this state, all thermal energy must be extracted from the system.  Atomic motion must be slowed to a crawl. To get to this cold, scientists must  first employ a special "dilution refrigerator," which is basically an elaborate  version of an ordinary kitchen fridge, but with a lot more pumps, valves, heat  exchangers, condensers and tubes, which are filled with liquid helium instead  of Freon.  </P> <P> Liquid helium, already under 4 K, can cool materials down to a few thousandths  of a Kelvin. But to go further requires super-conducting magnets. These magnets  are immersed in the liquid helium and surround a rod of copper. The low  temperatures and the high magnetic field cause all the nuclei in the copper  atoms to align like tiny compass needles that all point in the same direction.  The researchers then reduce the magnetic field, which causes the copper nuclei  to resume their random orientations. This return to random order absorbs the  last rays of heat from the environment.  </P> <P> But these temperatures are the most tenuous of states. The enemy is stray heat  from outside. The researchers at Cornell and Florida have constructed whole  rooms and buildings to shield their refrigerators from heat, which sneaks in as  radio waves, or from cosmic background radiation, or from anything that causes  vibration: trucks on the freeway, distant earthquakes, slamming doors. Each  creates minute vibrations that jar the super-cold atoms and cause them to bump,  raising temperatures.  </P> <P> Yet no matter what the scientists do they will never quite achieve absolute  zero. The closer they get, the larger the relative effect of the slightest  amount of heat that gets in. "We can get close, very close, but it will always  be beyond us," said Richardson of Cornell. And that is part of its allure, he  said.  </P> <P> Just How Cold Is Zero Kelvin?  </P> <TABLE CWL="2.22IN:1.89IN:1.67IN:2.00IN:2.11IN:1.78IN:1.89IN:2.00IN" WDM="ABS" NCOLS="8"> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Boiling  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Body  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Freezing  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Bismarck,  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> South  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Neptune  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Absolute  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (Water)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Temp.  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> (Water)  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> N.D.*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Pole*  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="C" CVJ="C"> Zero  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL> </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Kelvin  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 373  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 310  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 273  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 231  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 183.8  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 49.7  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Celsius  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 100  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 37  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 0  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -42.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -89.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -233.3  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -273.2  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> <TABLEROW> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="L" CVJ="C"> Fahrenheit  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 212  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 98.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> 32  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -44  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -128.6  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -370  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> <TABLECELL CHJ="R" CVJ="C"> -459.67  </TABLECELL> <CELLRULE>  </CELLRULE> </TABLEROW> <ROWRULE>  </ROWRULE> </TABLE> <P> </P> <P> * Coldest recorded temperatures  </P></p>

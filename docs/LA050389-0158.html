			<p><P> May 3, 1989, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> KLAMATH FALLS DROPS BID FOR '98 WINTER OLYMPICS  </P> <P> A Klamath Falls group has withdrawn its request that the 1998 Winter Olympic  Games be held in the southern Oregon city.  </P> <P> The withdrawal came Tuesday in a meeting here between the Klamath Falls Winter  Games Organizing Committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee's site selection  team.  </P> <P> "The reason is we can't meet their requirements for data, which are required by  Friday," said Linda Grover, a member of the organizing committee.  </P> <P> She said the site team wanted explicit data on funding facilities, traffic  flows, revenue sources and studies on projected income from the facilities  after the Olympics, among other information.  </P> <P> "They want a mountain of information," said Michael Hartfield, a city  spokesman. "Nobody knew they wanted that kind of information just to make the  initial decision."  </P> <P> The seven-member site selection team toured Klamath Falls and the surrounding  ski areas, including Mt. Bachelor ski resort and Diamond Lake Nordic skiing  area, on Sunday and Monday.  </P> <P> Klamath Falls was the last stop on the team's 21-day tour of the five U.S.  cities in the running as the U.S. entry for the 1998 Winter Games.  </P></p>

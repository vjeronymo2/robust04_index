			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (30) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 Household Freezers, Retrofit. (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> freezers. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted household freezers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B. R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;152a, and HCFC&hyph;124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted household freezers. See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (31) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 Household Freezers, New. (a) HCFC&hyph;22.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new household  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> freezers. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new household freezers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) HFC&hyph;152a. HFC&hyph;152a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in new household refrigerators. HFC&hyph;152a does not contribute to ozone depletion. In addition, HFC&hyph;152a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are significantly lower than those of most alternatives. Although HFC&hyph;152a is flammable, a risk assessment demonstrated it could be used safely in this end-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (d) Stirling cycle. Stirling cycle systems are acceptable as an alternative technology to household freezers using CFC&hyph;12 or R&hyph;502. See the discussion on the Stirling cycle under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (32) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;500 Residential Dehumidifiers, Retrofit. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted residential dehumidifiers. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted residential dehumidifiers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (c) R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B. R&hyph;401A and R&hyph;401B, which consist of HCFC&hyph;22, HFC&hyph;152a, and HCFC&hyph;124, are acceptable as substitutes for CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 in retrofitted residential dehumidifiers. See the discussion on these blends under retrofitted CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;502 industrial process refrigeration.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (33) CFC&hyph;12 and R&hyph;500 Residential Dehumidifiers, New. Please note that different temperature regimes may affect the applicability of substitutes within this end-use.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (a) HCFC&hyph;22. HCFC&hyph;22 is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new residential dehumidifiers. See the discussion on HCFC&hyph;22 under new CFC&hyph;11, CFC&hyph;12, CFC&hyph;113, CFC&hyph;114, and R&hyph;500 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (b) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in new residential dehumidifiers. See the discussion on HFC&hyph;134a under retrofitted CFC&hyph;12 centrifugal chillers.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (34) CFC&hyph;12 Motor Vehicle Air Conditioners, Retrofit. (a) HFC&hyph;134a. HFC&hyph;134a is acceptable as a substitute for CFC&hyph;12 in retrofitted motor vehicle air conditioners. HFC&hyph;134a does not contribute to ozone depletion. HFC&hyph;134a's GWP and atmospheric lifetime are close to those of other alternatives which have been determined to be acceptable for this end-use. However, HFC&hyph;134a's contribution to global warming could be significant in leaky end-uses such as MVACS. EPA has determined that the use of HFC&hyph;134a in these applications is acceptable because industry continues to develop technology to limit emissions. In addition, the number of available substitutes for use in MVACS is currently limited. HFC&hyph;134a is not flammable and its toxicity is low. While  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> HFC&hyph;134a is compatible with most existing refrigeration and air conditioning equipment parts, it is not compatible with the mineral oils currently used in such systems. An ester-based lubricant should be used rather than mineral oils.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / UK Company News: Pentos Pounds 36m in the red after exceptional costs Pentos, the specialist retailing group which is undergoing a restructuring under its new management, reported a Pounds 36m pre-tax loss for the half year to July 2 after exceptional costs of Pounds 10.5m. There were restated losses of Pounds 10.6m last time. Commenting on the results Mr Bill McGrath, who took over as chief executive in January, said they 'should mark a low point in Pentos' fortunes'. He added that 'considerable progress' had been made in implementing strategic initiatives and refocusing the group since receiving the proceeds of its Pounds 45m rescue rights issue in May. Mr McGrath emphasised that the group's management was only able to focus fully on implementing the initiatives after receipt of the rights proceeds and accordingly the results 'do not reflect any of the resulting benefits'. Turnover of continuing operations increased by 7 per cent to Pounds 97.9m (Pounds 91.5m) including a 2 per cent increase in like-for-like sales at Dillons, the flagship bookstore chain. The group also includes Ryman stationers and Athena Galleries, the cards and poster chain. The exceptional costs cover a number of items, including Pounds 5.7m related to Dillons to cover a more accurate determination of year-end creditors, provisions for prior year debtors, under-accrued property costs and redundancy costs of Pounds 400,000 which Mr McGrath said should result in full-year savings of Pounds 2m. Operating losses widened to Pounds 22.3m (Pounds 7.4m) before unchanged interest charges of Pounds 3.2m. Mr McGrath said the losses were attributable to a number of factors including accounting changes and the fact that before the rights issue many suppliers were reluctant to supply stock. Dillons sales rose 7 per cent to Pounds 57.5m and trading losses were Pounds 13m before exceptional charges. Ryman reported a Pounds 3.8m loss on flat sales from continuing operations of Pounds 16.7m while Athena's loss on continuing activities was Pounds 5m on static sales of Pounds 16.2m. Losses per share were 17.2p (6.4p) and the interim dividend is again passed. COMMENT The latest exceptional costs, while unexpectedly high, should mark an end to the house cleaning at Pentos. Meanwhile the rights issue has enabled the group to re-establish good relations with is suppliers and begin rebuilding the balance sheet which shows bank borrowings of Pounds 62.3m at the end of the first half. Looking ahead, Mr McGrath believes Dillons can continue to grow its market share which has recovered from a low of 31.5 per cent in June, and is well positioned to take advantage of the likely demise of the net book agreement. Managers are now under instructions to build sales. Barring the unexpected, the group should break even in the second half. Those still holding the shares which slipped  1/2 p to 14p yesterday, should hang on.</p>

It is not clear if their costs are higher than the proposed residential treatment facilities. It is also unclear how many of them will be able to qualify under the new regulations, and what this will do to the supply of care and its cost.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In any event, it does not appear that more eligible individuals will come into the program because of this regulation. Currently, there are approximately 42,000 recipients of services under this category.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> As for the implementation of requirements for comprehensive programs and coordination of State authorities concerned with provision of mental health services, as well as the requirements for coordinated plans of care, they will probably increase administrative costs somewhat, but will reduce program costs by ensuring that the most appropriate and efficient form of care is utilized. The magnitude of these costs and savings is difficult to determine but probably is negligible, given the number of recipients involved.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> For these reasons, we are not preparing analyses for either the RFA or section 1102(b) of the Act since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not result in a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and would not have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866, this proposed regulation was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=84 g=1 f=1 --> List of Subjects  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 440  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Grant programs_health, Medicaid.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 441  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Family planning, Grant programs_health, Infants and children, Medicaid, Penalties, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 447  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Standards for payment.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR Part 483  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Requirements for States and long term care facilities. <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG QTAG 02 --> <!-- PJG /QTAG -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 42 CFR chapter IV would be amended as set forth below:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=52 g=1 f=1 --> PART 440_SERVICES: GENERAL PROVISIONS  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> A.

			<p>930730 FT  30 JUL 93 / BT under more scrutiny THE SATELLITE business of British Telecommunications would be subject to more regulation under proposals published yesterday by Oftel, the telecommunications regulator. Under Oftel's plans BT would have to publish a financial statement covering the activities of the division, which sells satellite capacity to rival operators. BT would also be barred from seeking investment contributions from other operators. The review concerns the provision of satellite capacity with Intelsat and Eutelsat - satellites funded and operated by consortia of telecommunications companies.</p>

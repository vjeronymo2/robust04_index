			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4702 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The public hearing on the Service's proposal to list the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered species with critical habitat was scheduled for August 31, 1993, in Mobile, Alabama. The comment period remained open until October 13, 1993. A notice of the hearing was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on July 27, 1993 (58 FR 40109), and a legal notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Birmingham News  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on August 1, 1993. This public hearing was subsequently canceled at the request of some members of the Alabama Congressional delegation. A cancellation notice was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 24, 1993 (58 FR 44643), and legal notices were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Birmingham News  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on August 29, 1993; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Montgomery Advertiser <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 29, 1993; and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clarion Ledger <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on August 27, 1993.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The public hearing on this proposal was rescheduled for October 4, 1993, at the William K. Weaver Hall Auditorium on the campus of Mobile College, Mobile, Alabama. The comment period remained open until October 13, 1993. A notice of the hearing and extension of the comment period was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on September 13, 1993 (58 FR 47851).  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Due to the tremendous interest in this issue, a large number of people who came to the October 4, 1993, hearing had to be turned away due to space constraints. Although neither the Act nor the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.) required that a second hearing be held, the Service decided that it was in the best interest of all concerned parties that they have an opportunity to comment on issues raised by the Alabama sturgeon proposed rule. Therefore, an additional public hearing was scheduled in Montgomery, Alabama, on November 15, 1993, to allow for additional comments from the interested public. A notice of the second hearing, reopening of the comment period (from October 25, 1993, to December 8, 1993), and notice of availability of a scientific panel report was published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 55036). Legal notices for this second hearing appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Birmingham News  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on October 26, 1993; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobile Press-Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 24, 1993; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Montgomery Advertiser <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on October 29, 1993; and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clarion Ledger  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on October 29, 1993. The scientific panel report was prepared by ichthyologists to specifically review three issues: (1) Examine the taxonomy of the sturgeon, (2) comment on the likely existence of the fish based on available data, and (3) make suggestions as to what information would be necessary to conclude that the taxon is likely extinct.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The November 15, 1993, hearing was canceled in response to a preliminary injunction issued on November 9, 1993. The timing of the injunction gave the Service insufficient time to publish public hearing notices of cancellation in either the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  or area newspapers. A second public hearing notice appeared in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 289) dated January 4, 1994. The hearing was scheduled for January 13, 1994, and the comment period was extended through January 31, 1994. Legal notices for this rescheduled hearing were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Birmingham News  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> on December 26, 1993; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobile Press-Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 26, 1993; the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Montgomery Advertiser <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 27, 1993; and the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clarion Ledger <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on December 28, 1993. As outlined in the January 4, 1994,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  notice, the preliminary injunction restrained the Service and others from: (1) Disseminating the scientific panel report to the public and (2) utilizing or relying upon the scientific panel report or any product of the experts' deliberations in connection with the decision-making process on the proposal to list the Alabama sturgeon and designate its critical habitat. The January 4, 1994, notice also referred to another court order issued December 22, providing, in most relevant part, as follows:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Federal defendants and defendant-intervener, and those acting in active concert with them, are hereby permanently enjoined from publishing, employing and relying upon the advisory Committee report .&blank;.&blank;. for any purpose whatsoever, directly or indirectly, in the process of determining whether to list the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered species.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> In a notice appearing in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  (59 FR 997) on January 7, 1994, the January 13, 1994, public hearing was canceled and rescheduled for January 31, 1994, at South Hall  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=6 f=1 --> # <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 1. Montgomery Civic Center, Montgomery, Alabama. The comment period was extended to February 15, 1994. Cancellation of the second public hearing was made to provide more notice of the hearing to the public. Legal notices for the rescheduled public hearing appeared on January 19, 1994, in four area newspapers: the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Birmingham News,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Mobile Press-Register, Montgomery Advertiser, <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  and  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Clarion Ledger.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Mention was also made in this notice that, in keeping with the court restrictions issued in  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Alabama-Tombigbee River Development Coalition  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> (Coalition) v.  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Fish and Wildlife Service,  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Civ. No. 93&hyph;AR&hyph;2322&hyph;S, the Service considered itself compelled to enforce the following constraints on the submission of oral and written comments while the court restrictions remained in effect: (1) Individuals or organizations could not refer to the scientific report or to any drafts or other products derived from the preparation of that report in presenting any oral statement or written comment and (2) individuals or organizations could not attempt to bolster their oral or written comments or opinions by referring to the scientific report as authority. Therefore, the Departmental hearing officer at the next hearing was authorized to terminate the opportunity to speak of any person making a statement if, in the judgment of the hearing officer, that person disregarded the instructions not to address the scientific report or its contents. Written comments or materials which contained information that violated the above restrictions would be marked and thereafter excluded from the administrative record while the court restrictions remained in effect.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

General  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> The FCA Board adopted final collateral evaluation regulations on November 12, 1992. The regulations were published in the  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=4 --> Federal Register <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  on November 20, 1992 (57 FR 54683), and became effective March 1, 1993. The regulations addressed the System's collateral evaluation practices and procedures, including the need for:  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> (1) Consistent methodology; (2) independence and controls; and (3) consistent educational and qualification requirements. The regulations set basic requirements for real property appraisals, including the use of State licensed and/or certified appraisers, functional independence, and compliance with Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP). The real property appraisal requirements adopted were similar to the requirements of the other Federal regulatory agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The objective of the present amendments is to provide additional flexibility in appraisal and independence requirements, without jeopardizing the overall integrity or enforceability of the FCA's collateral evaluation regulations. By providing additional flexibility in the use of State-sanctioned appraisers and relief from the more stringent real estate appraisal requirements, the FCA addresses regulatory burden concerns.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The amendments are being adopted as interim regulations with a delayed effective date and request for comments in order to provide interested parties an opportunity to comment on the regulations. However, the FCA believes adopting the regulations in final is required to provide System institutions with the necessary guidance to address revisions to their collateral evaluation requirements and necessary staffing needs. The regulatory revisions also establish requirements that are similar to the requirements recently adopted by the Federal regulatory agencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The FCA adopted, on May 5, 1994, a ``no action'' position relative to the System institutions' compliance with certain real estate appraisal requirements in response to the then-pending regulatory revisions by the Federal regulatory agencies. The FCA's ``no action'' position was intended to serve as a temporary means of eliminating any competitive disadvantage suffered by System institutions. However, the ``no action'' position provides more flexibility than the FCA would consider a prudent long-term regulatory position. Therefore, these regulatory revisions are intended to eliminate any competitive disadvantage for the System institutions and establish the necessary guidance and parameters for the System's collateral evaluation practices and procedures. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </SUPPLEM> <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

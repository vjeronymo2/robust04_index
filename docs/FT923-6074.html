			<p>920827 FT  27 AUG 92 / Bank raises tender rate in Finland THE Bank of Finland raised its tender rate to 17 per cent from 15.5 per cent yesterday to try to stem capital outflows and calm international financial markets. The action followed yesterday's steep rise in Swedish interest rates. The troubles of the ailing Finnish economy, however, show signs of coming to an end. Yesterday the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development published its annual survey on Finland which suggests that last winter's devaluation and wage restraint have helped to boost exports and improve business confidence. In a surprisingly optimistic survey the OECD points to a 3.3 per cent increase in GDP next year after a decline of 6.1 per cent in 1991 and 1.3 per cent this year. It also predicts a surge in industrial output of 5.5 per cent in 1993 after a drop of 9.3 per cent last year and a 1 per cent increase this year. The survey sees a powerful export led recovery with a 7.5 per cent improvement in exports in 1992 and 8.5 per cent next year. Unemployment may fall to below 11 per cent next year.</p>

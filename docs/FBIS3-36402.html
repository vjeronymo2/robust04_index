			<p>Language: <F P=105> Ukrainian </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kiev -- "RUKH-PRESS" has reported that the first  official meeting of William Miller, the U.S. ambassador to  Ukraine, and Vyacheslav Chornovil, head of the People's Movement  of Ukraine [Rukh], took place on 4 February. After the meeting  they informed Ukrainian and foreign journalists about the main  subjects of the conversation. The opposition leader informed  the ambassador in detail about the purpose of Rukh's activity  and shared his views on the current political situation.  Vyacheslav Chornovil said about the Supreme Council resolution  of 3 February that "although Ukraine was not even preparing to  become a member of the Nuclear Club, the rate and conditions of  forced disarmament were determined without taking into account  the interests of the Ukrainian side." However, observed the  Rukh chairman, it is still not too late to correct the situation  with additional agreements.    Replying to William Miller's question regarding Rukh's  attitude to the latest events in the Crimea, the opposition  leader stressed that the creation of a territorial autonomy, and  moreover, the holding of presidential elections vividly show the  incapability of Ukraine's leadership, headed by Leonid Kravchuk,  to secure territorial integrity or to build a unified  independent Ukraine.    William Miller, the U.S. ambassador, expressed concern at  the  disappearance of Mykhaylo Boychyshyn, the deputy chairman of  Rukh. "His disappearance is a tragedy, and it is very  unfortunate that no one is reporting information about the fate  of this person," noted the diplomat.    The ambassador did not say a single word about an increase  in  U.S. assistance to Ukraine after the signing of the trilateral  statement, which Leonid Kravchuk and Anatoliy Zlenko spoke about  in the Supreme Council on 3 February.</p>

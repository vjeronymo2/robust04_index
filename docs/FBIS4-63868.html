			<p>BFN     [Text] Vilnius, May 25, BNS -- The chiefs of Estonian,  Latvian and Lithuanian Air Forces agreed to cooperate in  controlling air space and training pilots.    According to an agreement signed Tuesday [24 May] at the  Meskuciai air base in Lithuania, the three nations intend to  create a joint system of air space control.    Baltic defense officials say the plan has a number of  technical and financial advantages, especially considering  intentions to join NATO structures.    Supposedly, a Baltic air space control system can be created  in 5 to 10 years.    During talks in Meskuciai, the three countries agreed to  create a joint pilot training center in Lithuania. On  Wednesday, Estonian Air Force pilots flew their first training  flights on Lithuanian planes.    Lithuania's Air Force is considered the strongest among the  Baltic states with its four Czech-made jet fighters L-39, two  transport planes L-41, which were donated by the German  Government, and several Soviet-made AN-2 biplanes.    Two Lithuanian L-39's and one helicopter will participate in  celebrations of the 75th anniversary of the Latvian Air Force in  Riga Saturday. The celebration will also be attended by a  Lithuanian delegation, headed by the acting Air Force Chief,  Colonel Stasys Murza.</p>

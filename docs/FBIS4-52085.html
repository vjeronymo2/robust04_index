			<p>BFN     [Text] According to a news dispatch, there was fighting  along the Thai-Cambodian border opposite Sa Kaeo Province.  Khmer Rouge soldiers attacked Cambodian Government forces at  Sra Kradan and the Poipet market, killing one government soldier  and six villagers and wounding six others at a Poipet market.    The fighting took place about five KM from the Thai border.  Some 1,000 Cambodians attempted to cross into Thai territory at  Ban Wangmon and Ban Khok Sabang of Aranyaprathep District, Sa  Kaeo Province as a result of the fighting. However, Thai  soldiers at the border area did not allow them to enter the Thai  soil.    Thach Koan, deputy governor of Cambodia's Banteay Meanchey  Province, said that there were no casualties on the part of the  government. He also added that there were no Khmer Rouge  soldiers in Poipet. Cambodian forces seized four Khmer Rouge  tanks. He said that he would talk with Thai officials on  reopening a border checkpoint in the next 10 days.    Sa Kaeo Governor Kasem Chaisit said that the closure of the  border checkpoint has affected the merchants. The two sides  will try to reopen it as soon as possible. The governor of  Banteay Beanchey sent a letter through the Thai-Cambodian Border  Coordination Office asking for the talks. The talks are set to  be held in Thailand on 10 May.</p>

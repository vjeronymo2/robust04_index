			<p>910502 FT  02 MAY 91 / The Lex Column: Scottish banks Bank of Scotland has made something of a habit of rights issues, without ever meeting the positive reception accorded yesterday's Pounds 194m call. But the successful issue and 12 per cent dividend increase, timed to coincide with what the bank hopes is the bottom of the economic cycle, will probably not act as an incentive for other clearing banks thinking about propping up their ailing capital ratios. Despite the unfortunate symmetry of the Pounds 202m of bad debt provisions in its full-year figures, Bank of Scotland knows it can tell a better story than its competitors. The contrast with the rights issues in recent years by Midland, Standard Chartered, or for that matter Barclays, is obvious. The market believes Bank of Scotland will make good use of the rights proceeds despite a slide in second-half profits which augurs badly for the first six months of this financial year. It is probably right. The loan book expanded by a fifth last year and will grow again this year by more than 10 per cent as it uses its strengthened capital position to pursue the higher-margin business now available. Underlying profits were respectable enough to justify the dividend increase; yet more reason for the other banks to be envious. As for the Royal Bank of Scotland, its performance was slightly more typical of the sector. The maintained interim dividend simply emphasised how much it over-estimated the outlook by raising its final payment nearly 17 per cent last November.</p>

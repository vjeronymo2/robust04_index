			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / Letters to the Editor: Chemicals industry improving its record Sir, The UK chemicals industry is one of Britain's most successful manufacturing sectors and one of the most frequently criticised on environmental issues. Yet it is almost certainly the sector most publicly committed to improving its environmental performance Since 1989 the industry has adopted the international Responsible Care voluntary programme for performance improvement in health, safety and environment matters. My association represents most of the UK industry and membership is conditional upon participation in the Responsible Care programme. We have just published, as a first for UK industry, a three-year range of Responsible Care performance data for the industry. We intend to publish more. Deepening recession may have caused environmental priorities to wane elsewhere but not in the chemicals industry. Despite the recession the sector has continued to spend an increasing percentage of its total capital outlay on environmental protection. Indeed, in 1992 the industry made capital and operating expenditure totalling Pounds 1bn on environment protection. Less than 55 per cent of that was required in order to comply with legislation. There are a range of problems associated with developing and implementing environmental legislation at European Community and UK government level, both for the lawmakers and for industry. The chemicals industry continues to work with legislators to help create a civilised policy on the environment. We are making much progress towards an accord on what is desirable and workable.

			<p>920311 FT  11 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Clondalkin rises to IPounds 13.6m Taxable profits of Clondalkin Group, the Dublin-based company involved in printing and packaging, expanded from IPounds 11.9m to IPounds 13.6m (Pounds 12.7m) in 1991 with the strongest growth coming from the US. A number of factors were responsible for static sales of IPounds 151.1m (IPounds 151.6m), including raw material prices. Tax at 24 per cent (21 per cent) accounted for IPounds 3.22m (IPounds 2.5m) and left earnings at 25.08p (22.64p). A proposed final dividend of 2.683p makes a 4.381p (4.056p) total. At year-end net debt had been reduced from IPounds 10.6m to IPounds 1.58m. Directors are to seek shareholders' approval for the purchase of up to 15 per cent of the company's issued equity.</p>

			<p>931204 FT  04 DEC 93 / Luanda and Unita clear last hurdle to ceasefire The Angolan government and Unita rebels said yesterday they had cleared the last obstacles to a ceasefire agreement at talks in Lusaka, agencies report. They said they would report details, probably today, to United Nations mediators who have been trying to bring an end to the long-running conflict in Angola. 'All conditions are now complete for the ceasefire,' said a rebel negotiator. The key dispute had been over arrangements for disarming rebel forces. This issue threatened to derail the peace talks which opened in the Zambian capital of Lusaka on November 15 under the chairmanship of UN envoy Alioune Blondin Beye. But the disagreement appeared now to have been settled. The UN has been seeking a ceasefire for the whole country, allowing free movement of goods and people. The UN envoy was due to fly to Angola's capital Luanda today for consultations. One diplomat said he believed the envoy would press on with outstanding political questions which the rebels wanted resolved. These related to what role Unita would play in a future government. The government and Unita have battled each other since Angola's independence from Portugal in 1975. The war halted after a peace accord in May 1991 but Unita, led by Mr Jonas Savimbi, took up arms again after disputing its defeat in UN-supervised elections in September 1992.</p>

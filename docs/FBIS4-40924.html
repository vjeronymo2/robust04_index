			<p>BFN     [Text] Moscow, June 9, RIA -- The communist faction in the  State Duma made a statement Wednesday in which it denounces the  unilateral, in its opinion, position of the Russian leadership  on the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The statement  says that certain quarters in the USA are trying to make North  Korea accept the humiliating terms of settling this problem.  The Russian communists express bewilderment that the Russian  side is ready, though with reservations, to join the repressive  measures with regard to North Korea. The authors of the  statement believe that it is in the interests of Russia to  "maintain balanced relations both with North and South Korea"  and to create conditions for a dialogue between them. Communist  MPs propose that a representative of the Foreign Ministry should  report to the parliament about the Russian- South Korean talks  that took place last week and about contacts with North Korea  aimed at resolving the nuclear problem.</p>

			<p>921130 FT  30 NOV 92 / Black Wednesday's bill Despite the ridiculous slogan attributed to Henry Ford, 'history is bunk', history will not go away, an example being the cost of the British government's un-successful attempts to defend sterling's ERM parity up to Black Wednesday, September 16. That new and most useful periodical, Central Banking*, has provided an analysis in its autumn issue. Although its own estimate is probably too high, it has helped to prise out some information. The best estimate of the sums expended by both the Bank of England and other central banks in defending sterling during the period is in the region of Pounds 15bn to Pounds 20bn. This includes drawings made on the special Ecu facility announced on September 3 and on proceeds of earlier Ecu borrowing. So it is double counting to add them all together. The best approximation to the capital loss would be to apply to the sums expended the 15 per cent devaluation of sterling against the D-Mark, which gives a loss of around Pounds 2 1/4 bn to Pounds 3bn, near the upper end of what was estimated by outside observers immediately afterwards. This is obviously not exact. For instance, some of the outstanding amount to be repaid is Ecu denominated; and the pound was devalued a little less against the Ecu than the D-Mark. Nevertheless it is in the right ballpark. We are not talking about small sums. What is most likely to anger the chancellor is not the numbers in Central Banking but the assertion in the magazine that the loss is 'just as if Norman Lamont had personally thrown entire hospitals and schools into the sea all afternoon'. It is true that the transactions of the Exchange Equalisation Account are excluded from the UK Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. But look at the well-known Dollars 1bn gain of a private fund manager, George Soros, from the devaluation of sterling. Suppose that Mr Soros had been less skilful and had lost an equivalent amount. Is there any doubt that he and his fundholders would have been poorer? Capital losses in the public sector can be spread over a longer period - it would be absurd to raise British taxes in one year to make up foreign exchange losses. But they have not vanished into thin air. A more important revelation in Central Banking is of a letter from a former president of the Bundesbank, the late Dr Otmar Emminger, written in 1978 before the start of the ERM and accepted by the German government, opting out of any obligation of unlimited intervention in support of weaker currencies. The substance of the letter was known to other central banks. Indeed the whole concept of unlimited intervention was basically a bluff. Quite apart from the controversy about the effects of such intervention on the German money supply, there is an obligation to repay these sums within 75 days - only a fraction can be rolled over. Repayment becomes less credible once intervention gets into the stratosphere. For instance, by the weekend of the Italian lira devaluation, the Bundesbank had spent DM90bn in support of currencies against their ERM margins, in practice the lira. In addition some DM200bn had previously been expended in intramarginal support of currencies before they had reached their limits, making a grand total of no less than DM290bn. There were other ignored warning signals. When a currency had reached 75 per cent of the maximum permitted divergence in the ERM grid, consultations with partner countries should be triggered, covering fundamental policy. Yet the British government, as far as is known, was not prepared either to raise interest rates or to raise the question of realignment. By the weekend of the lira devaluation, the Bundesbank had notified the German government that intervention had reached unmanageable proportions and once again raised the question of a wider realignment in return for a larger cut in interest rates. Recent contacts between the House of Commons treasury committee and the Bundesbank have suggested that this proposal was not passed on by Jean-Claude Trichet, the French chairman of the Monetary Committee. The French riposte, with which one can sympathise, is that the German position was surely clear enough and was not dependent on one particular channel for its transmission. One Bundesbank view is that some good may still come from the confusion if it is now clear that: realignments are still within the rules of the ERM game; ERM members can temporarily opt out during periods of stress; and unlimited intervention is for the birds. But why did it take an international catastrophe to establish these elementary points? Of course a case could have been made, as I indeed tried to, for a harder version of the ERM. But it was simply ostrich-like to pretend that the core player, Germany, accepted such a hard version when in fact it did not. *53 Clarewood Court, Crawford Street, London W1H 5DF.</p>

			<p><P> April 29, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> Heartfelt gratitude fo NBC for its presentation of Franco Zeffirelli's  magnificent "Jesus of Nazareth." This miniseries offered my family a treasured  view of the real meaning of Easter, a tapestry of eternal love triumphant over  death. The thoughtful exclusion of commercials during the conclusion was  especially appreciated.  </P> <P> Claire Haller, Blue Jay  </P></p>

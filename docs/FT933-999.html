			<p>930925 FT  25 SEP 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Paring down costs and carving a niche CASTLEFORD is one of those earthy Yorkshire towns where the symbols of an affluent middle class remain inconspicuous in a culture overwhelmingly influenced by low technology industry and tight family budgets. One public house offers a three-course lunch at Pounds 2.75. From the windows of the town's centre for small business, you can see shoppers packing Aldi and Netto, the shock troop supermarkets for rock-bottom food pricing. Inside the centre, the short history of Nile Productions underlines a not always obvious point. Even in an unfashionable environment, little companies in the softer service industries can make a go of it. Nile is an 'events' company, arranging presentations mainly for so-called company internal communication days, as well as offering script writing, print design and organising the supply of promotional gifts and sound and lighting systems. Among its clients are such names as Citroen and the Halifax building society. Started in 1991 by Tim Rhodes and Stephen Bindley, Nile had Pounds 200,000 turnover in the 12 months to May 1993 and hopes for Pounds 300,000 this year. The founders took nothing from the venture in the first year. In its third year each extracted a salary of Pounds 15,000, which was almost doubled by a bonus out of profits. Rhodes says they could see a niche for themselves, partly defined by their company's meagre operating costs. 'When you are working for a large company offering what we do the sums involved are fabulous,' says Rhodes. 'The end result is that a lot of money is spent but the value is very poor because of mismanagement and bad buying-in of services and equipment. The client does not get value. Everything goes through several pairs of hands and everyone takes a mark up. It is a nice industry in many ways but there is a lot of greed.' Nile's cost structure certainly makes those of a big city service company look decidedly unattractive. Both put in Pounds 12,000 to start the business. Rent on the office - big enough for three people, filing cabinets and computers - is a miserly Pounds 135 a month. This also covers the services of the receptionist at the centre which was set up by Wakefield district council. 'Our total overheads are about Pounds 600 a month,' Rhodes says. The company employs no other staff but brings in freelances when needed. Though the two Nile directors worked in the industry for some years - Rhodes for Harrogate's conference centre, Bindley as a conference production technician - they say they brought no clients with them. The first contract was a financial services presentation for women given by the National &amp; Provincial building society. Nile charged the society Pounds 350. The second was setting up a public address system and video projector with operator for a meeting of the Macclesfield Conservative Association. Nile secured its biggest client when it won the contract to do some of Citroen's dealership days - occasions for the French car company to provide its dealers with information about the company and indulge in a spot of corporate bonding. Nile offers Citroen lighting, sound systems, installation of multi-screen video walls, slide make-up slides and design of point of sale material. It charges about Pounds 1,000 for preparing and running a dealership day and might do 40 in a year. Other important clients are Software Box, a Yorkshire software retailer, British Rail's Watford management centre and the North-West regional health authority. 'We write to companies and do some cold calling but most work comes from word of mouth,' says Bindley. Nile has to pitch for almost all its jobs and this is one of the biggest costs: 'About 50 per cent of our time and money goes on failed pitches,' Bindley says. 'We get 20 per cent of the jobs we pitch for. An average pitch costs us Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 2,500 to make. So we need Pounds 12,000 profit from one job to adequately cover for lost pitches. It can be very frustrating, especially when the client simply rips off our ideas and uses them itself.' Nile tries to keep job specifications tight when it employs freelances for design and lighting work. 'A piece of work and what it costs can go haywire if the designer is a wacky guy. If a person is not taking responsibility for the final budget he doesn't have loyalty to the end client.' Nile aims for a pre-tax return of 10 per cent. Jobs arrive in fits and starts and as with so many small businesses, Nile's owners occasionally endure a disastrous spell. 'I had three telephone calls in one day last year which ended our chances of getting Pounds 150,000 of work,' says Bindley. When that happens I take the day off, go for a wander, sit in the woods. It's all you can do.' Still, there are compensations in running your own enterprise. 'It's the ultimate toy.' Nile Productions.

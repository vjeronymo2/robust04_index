			<p>921021 FT  21 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Paterson rise restricted by falling naira PATERSON ZOCHONIS, the soap and detergents conglomerate, yesterday announced a 64 per cent advance to Pounds 16.2m in operating profits for the year ended May 31 as Nigerian authorities stepped up the pace of debt repayments on foreign exchange transactions made in the early 1980s. However, the 40 per cent devaluation of the Nigerian naira left Paterson with pre-tax profits only 5 per cent ahead at Pounds 26.6m on turnover of Pounds 227.3m (Pounds 215.1m). Mr Alan Whittaker, finance director, said Nigerian authorities had made significant progress on repaying debts arising from the foreign exchange shortage of the early 1980s. The country had been unable to supply hard currency in exchange for the company's local earnings. Paterson, which wrote off the total debts of about Pounds 10m at the time, received Pounds 7.3m last year taken for now into operating profits, against Pounds 2.2m in 1991. Return from associated companies, largely based in Nigeria, fell from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 2.7m due to the fall in value of the naira. The devaluation affected the net asset value, which fell from 384p to 377p per share. Investment income suffered from lower interest rates and the decline in equities to fall by Pounds 5m to Pounds 13.3m. Paterson is still sitting on a cash mountain of Pounds 157m. Mr Whittaker said the company continued to look for opportunities, although many better acquisitions had already been snapped up by leading groups. Paterson intended to stick with soaps and detergents and Mr Whittaker said it was likely the company would make several smaller acquisitions. In trading terms, Paterson's businesses had been 'very solid', Mr Whittaker said. In the UK, where Paterson's Imperial Leather brand of soap leads the market, Cussons had improved profits. Exports had also continued to advance. There were some losses in south-east Asia, however. Mr Whittaker said the company's efforts there would be worthwhile in the longer-term. The outlook for the first half was encouraging and the company promised that profits would not be less than last year. Mr Whittaker said Paterson should be able to regain investment income losses. The final dividend is raised to 9.2p for a total of 11.45p (10.4p). Earnings were higher at 33.79p, against 32.19p.</p>

The 39-member coalition shadow government, whose composition  was published on Tuesday and is to be put before President Levon  Ter-Petrosyan, is headed by ex-prime minister Vazgen Manukian,  formerly one of the leaders of Ter-Petrosyan's Armenian National  Movement and today one of the leaders of the National Democratic  Union.    National Democratic Union member David Vardanian, head of  the  parliamentary Foreign Relations Commission, has become the  shadow foreign minister. Vagan Oganesian from Dashnaktsutyun,  the largest opposition party, has taken the defense portfolio.  Ter-Petrosyan's former national security adviser Ashot  Manucharian has been appointed interior minister, while the post  of industry minister has gone to Karen Demirchian, former leader  of the Armenian Communist Party. The cabinet also includes ten  members of the present government.    "The list is rather inconsistent, but the final version will  appear after it is officially presented to the Armenian  president," Ter-Petrosyan's aide Levon Zurabian told Interfax.</p>

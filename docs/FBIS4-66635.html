			<p>CSO     [Text] New Delhi, Feb. 27. -- An unscheduled debate on  important Foreign Affairs took place in the Lok Sabha today.  During question hour the Opposition expressed its strong  reaction to the recent "anti-Indian" statements made by  Washington.    The External Affairs Minister, Mr. Dinesh Singh, said that  India has told USA that the views expressed by President Clinton  and other officials on Jammu and Kashmir will affect relations  between the two countries.    However, he added that the Indian representative there had  already replied to the anti-India views, so there was no need  for him or the Prime Minister to take up the matter with the  U.S. President or the Secretary of State.    Mr. Dinesh Singh's defence of the Government's low-key  reaction to the statements of President Bill Clinton and the  U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South Asian Affairs on  Kashmir and Punjab was resented strongly by a section of the  Opposition. Mr. Singh justified the Government stance saying  that the U.S. Administration had "corrected" its earlier stance  stating "that these views do not constitute and should not be  construed to imply any change in the U.S. policy". He said that  India, thus, should accept it.    The Minister said the unanimous resolution on Kashmir passed  by Parliament last week and the statements of the Indian  Ambassador to the USA and the Government spokesmen had an impact  the world over.    Earlier, the Minister of State for External Affairs, Mr.  R.L.  Bhatia, while answering supplementaries said that India was  doing everything to tell the world that the present situation in  Jammu and Kashmir was the result of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism  in the state. However, he said, Kashmir was a bilateral issue  between India and Pakistan, which should be resolved within the  framework of the Shimla Agreement. No other country would be  allowed to mediate on the issue, he said.    The Home Minister, Mr. S.B. Chavan, told the Rajya Sabha  that  the Government was committed to greater transparency in its  handling of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and had initiated  strenuous efforts to reactivate political activity, adds PTI  [Press Trust or India].    Moving a statutory resolution seeking further extension of  President's rule in the State for a period of six months from  March 3 in the House, Mr. Chavan quoting the Governor's report  said there had been a visible improvement in the situation.    He said that as a part of greater transparency the  Government  had allowed a delegation of the International Commission of  jurists and three ambassadors from the European Commission to  visit Kashmir.    Meanwhile, 20 people including 10 militants, two of them  self-styled commanders, and three women were killed while 14  others including an area commander were arrested in the Kashmir  valley overnight.</p>

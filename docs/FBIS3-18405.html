			<p>Language: <F P=105> German </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Bonn (DDP/ADN) -- German Defense Minister Volker  Ruehe has welcomed NATO's actions in the Bosnian conflict.  Ruehe was commenting to the CDU/CSU [Christian Democratic  Union/Christian Social Union] Bundestag group in Bonn today on  the shooting down of four Serb aircraft by U.S. fighters over  Bosnia-Herzegovina. Peace could only be achieved if the  decisions made by the United Nations were implemented. The Serb  aircraft had violated the UN no-fly zone.    Ruehe described it as "right" that German soldiers had been  on board the AWACS reconnaisance aircraft during the mission.  He said he was satisfied that the German Government had decided  in favor of the participation of German soldiers in the  reconnaisance flights.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 24 June (MTI-ECONEWS) -- Hungary's  Constitutional Court this week approved a new Land Law. In  April, President Goncz referred the law to the Court for rulings  on two aspects: The limit on the amount of land to be purchased  by Hungarian individuals, and the distinction between companies  and private individuals.    The Court decided that setting an upper limit on the amount  of farmland which can be purchased by Hungarian private  individuals is not unconstitutional. However, it also ruled  that the limit must be of temporary validity.    The Court also approved the section of the law which  excludes  the purchase of farmland by foreign individuals and companies.  This, it argues, is justified by the average price of Hungarian  farmland, which is rather low by international standards.    Banning Hungarian companies from purchasing farmland is in  line with the Constitution, the Court declared. The reason is  that individuals could otherwise set up a large number of  companies expressly for the purpose of buying land. Thus they  could acquire large tracts of land escaping the upper limit.    Under the law, the maximum amount of farmland that can be  purchased by Hungarian individuals is 300 hectares or 6,000  golden crowns. Foreign individuals are only allowed to purchase  farmsteads with less than 6,000 square metres of land.    Although Hungarian companies are not allowed to buy  farmland,  they may lease up to 2,500 hectares or 50,000 golden crowns.  Foreign companies and individuals are allowed to lease up to 300  hectares or 6,000 golden crowns of farmland.</p>

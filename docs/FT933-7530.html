			<p>930820 FT  20 AUG 93 / International Capital Markets: Novel D-Mark warrants on Portuguese bonds set BANKERS Trust yesterday launched the first offering of warrants on Portuguese government bonds hedged into D-Marks. The 2m warrants were targeted primarily at German, Swiss and French-based investors. Despite strong demand for high-yielding European bonds, many investors have been deterred from buying Portuguese paper because of the foreign exchange risk. The structure of the warrants, known as 'quanto' warrants, means that there is no exposure to the escudo, since the warrants are hedged into D-Marks at a rate of Es102.12. Many investors are also wary of the Portuguese bond market's illiquidity, having suffered heavy losses in last summer's currency turbulence. Warrants allow investors to participate in the market at a limited cost. The call warrants cost DM3.75 each and give holders the right to buy the 11 7/8 per cent OT (Portuguese government bond) due April 2000 at a set price of 109.95. The warrants can be exercised only on one day, May 19 1994.</p>

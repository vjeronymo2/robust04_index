			<p>940427 FT  27 APR 94 / NHS staff morale at record low, says Labour Labour yesterday sought to capitalise on the reorganisation of the health service to boost its campaign to win London seats in the local government elections next week. A report by the London group of Labour MPs called for a strategic authority to plan NHS services in the capital, and accused Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, of pursuing unjustified hospital closures. The report claimed that London had lost 22,000 hospital beds in 12 years while 165,000 people were on waiting lists and 75 hospitals had closed. A further 16 hospitals faced closure while others might be merged, it said. Launching the report, Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's spokesman for London, and Ms Dawn Primarolo, shadow health minister, claimed that morale among NHS staff was at an all-time low. Mrs Bottomley told MPs at question time in the Commons that Labour MPs had misunderstood the need for reorganisation of the health service in London. 'There is no recognition . . . of the population shifts or the changes in medical science to which the NHS in the capital must respond,' she said. 'All (Labour) can contribute to the debate is a litany of uncosted spending promises.' In a separate report, Mr David Blunkett, shadow health secretary, accused the government of wasting money by spending more than Pounds 600,000 to send pamphlets to NHS managers. The funds would have paid for 20 junior doctors for a year, he said. 'Bureaucracy has come before patient care in the implementation of the government's NHS changes.' The report - Bottomley's Bureaucracy - also highlighted the number of additional managers taken on by Family Health Service Authorities since NHS reorganisation took effect. It said that more than 1,000 new management posts had been introduced since 1989, when there were only 30. The numbers reached 640 in 1990 and 1,040 in 1992. Dr Brian Mawhinney, the health minister, said it was vital for everyone in the NHS to know what was going on. 'Most fair-minded people would expect the NHS to keep its staff informed, and would rightly criticise us if we did not,' he said. The Liberal Democrats called for a freeze in the motorway programme to release Pounds 4.4bn from the government's 1994-95 budget for spending on public transport projects. The party said 17 major projects would benefit, including the Crossrail scheme for a new east-west mainline rail link under London.</p>

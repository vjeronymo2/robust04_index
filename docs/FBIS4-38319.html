			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Sharip Ausuyev] </F>   [Excerpts] Groznyy, 28 May -- Chechen President Dzhokhar  Dudayev described yesterday's terrorist act in the republic as  carefully organized sabotage directed against independent  Chechnya. He said on local television today that forces opposed  to the slight thaw in Russo-Chechen relations were behind this  act.    Some details about the terrorist act emerged today. There  was a powerful explosion at about 2000 local time on 27 May on  the road between the Chechen settlements of Zakan-Lirk and  Alkha-Kala just as the president's motorcade was driving past a  Zhiguli model nine parked at the edge of the road. [passage  omitted]    Yaragi Mamodayev, head of the government of national  confidence, also gave his opinion about the terrorist act today.  In a statement he stressed that the process of the  self-destruction of the Chechen people is becoming more  profound. The government of national confidence resolutely  condemns such actions, no matter by whom, and appeals to the  leaders of the regime, to all sociopolitical forces and to the  citizens of the republic for nationwide reconciliation and an  end to all forms of confrontation.</p>

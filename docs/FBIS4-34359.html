			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Article by Jose Quintero De Leon] </F>   [Text] Haitian Charge d'Affaires Georges Barberousse told  LA PRENSA that he has confirmed during his stay in Panama that  there is a connection between Haitian military leaders and drug  trafficking.    Barberousse pointed out that Panamanian authorities recently  seized at Coco Solo Pier, Colon, two vessels bound for  Port-au-Prince. More than 1,000 kg of cocaine were found in the  vessels' holds, thus revealing a criminal connection.    As for the sanctions adopted by the OAS against the Raul  Cedras military regime and the Panamanian Government's  compliance with those sanctions, the Haitian charge d'affaires  said he had received no official notification whatsoever.    The diplomat added: "If this is the Panamanian Government's  position, the embassy approves of it with satisfaction, because  that is the kind of attitude the international community is  taking to solve the Haitian crisis."    Questioned on the imminent military invasion of his country,  just as happened in Panama, Barberousse emphasized that the  official position of Jean-Bertand Aristide's government's is not  to support a military incursion in Haiti, but he understands the  Panamanians' position on the issue.    The Haitian official also said that now is not the time for  a  military invasion but for the implementation of peaceful  measures to settle disputes. That is the path that the  international community is taking, thereby coinciding with the  interests of the constitutional government.    Barberousse said: "What we really want is for the Haitian  military to leave power, and that is what we are aiming for  through the implementation of sanctions, which, we hope, will  become more effective every day."    As for Panama, he reported that the Haitian Embassy this  week  sent a note to the Panamanian Foreign Ministry requesting a  meeting with the foreign minister to discuss the implementation  of sanctions and the cooperation the Panamanian Government has  offered Haitians so far.</p>

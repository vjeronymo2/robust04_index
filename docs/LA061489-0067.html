			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE STATE  </P> <P> Orange County supervisors rejected a proposed ordinance that would have banned  discrimination against AIDS victims, making the county the only major urban  area in California without such a measure. The 3-2 vote before a tense and  emotional crowd capped an 18-month study by the county's HIV Advisory Committee  that concluded that the ordinance was necessary to reduce the spread of  acquired immune deficiency syndrome by making its victims more likely to seek  treatment. Opposition was led by the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon's Anaheim-based  Traditional Values Coalition.  </P></p>

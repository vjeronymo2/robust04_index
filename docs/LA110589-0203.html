			<p><P> November 5, 1989, Sunday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> UNLV GETS THE BENEFIT OF LONG BEACH COLLAPSE  </P> <P> Cal State Long Beach fell apart in the second half Saturday, losing its fourth  consecutive game, 43-21, to Nevada Las Vegas in the Silver Bowl.  </P> <P> Overcoming a 14-7 halftime deficit, the Rebels scored 36 points in the second  half, more than they had scored in a single game this season.  </P> <P> Las Vegas intercepted two passes by quarterback Paul Oates in the third quarter  and turned each into eventual touchdowns. The Rebels then poured it on, aided  by an ineffective 49er defense.  </P> <P> "In the first half our tackling was pretty good, but in the second half we got  a little tired and worn down," said Long Beach Coach Larry Reisbig, whose team  fell to 3-7 overall and 1-4 in the Big West Conference. The 49ers have given up  40 or more points five times.  </P> <P> Oates had a poor game, completing only 12 of 36 passes. But Las Vegas  quarterback Derek Stott became the first Rebel to pass for more than 300 yards  since Randall Cunningham did it five years ago. Stott completed 18 of 23 passes  for 326 yards and three touchdowns.  </P> <P> Keenan McCardell caught seven of Stott's passes for 139 yards and one  touchdown.  </P> <P> Stott got the Rebels (4-4, 3-2) started toward a 19-point third quarter with a  51-yard scoring pass to Rickie Wills, but the 49ers held onto a 14-13 lead when  the extra-point attempt was missed.  </P> <P> Then, after an interception by Freddy Phillips, Stott drove the Rebels 63 yards  in six plays to put them ahead for good, 19-14, with 4:35 left in the quarter.  </P> <P> Fullback Kyle Toomer gave balance to the Rebels' attack by rushing for 143  yards and two touchdowns. Tailback Tommy Jackson added 100 yards rushing.  </P> <P> Even UNLV's Anthony Vannucci, a walk-on freshman, scored on a 10-yard run in  the fourth quarter. It was his second carry as a collegian.  </P> <P> Long Beach had a 201-165 advantage in total yards after the first half but was  outgained, 552-330 for the game.  </P></p>

			<p>930825 FT  25 AUG 93 / UK Company News: Mersey Docks improves to Pounds 8.9m THE MERSEY Docks and Harbour Company reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.86m for the first six months of 1993, an increase of 16 per cent on the previous Pounds 7.63m. Turnover rose to Pounds 44.8m (Pounds 42m) despite only a 5 per cent increase in cargoes to 13.6m tonnes. The interim dividend goes up to 2.85p (2.5p), payable from earnings per share of 9.53p (8.12p). The outcome marks a decade of continuous improvement for the company. The government, which five years ago wrote off more than Pounds 100m of debts, is still the biggest shareholder with a 20 per cent stake. The company, which last week announced it was in negotiations to buy the Medway ports in south-east England, said yesterday it plans a Pounds 10m floating stage in the Mersey at Birkenhead. This would serve the Irish Sea roll on-roll off freight routes, saving ships more than one hour per trip through not having to pass through locks into the Liverpool dock system. In overall markets, grain and animal feedstuffs showed the biggest cargo increases, rising 25 per cent. Bulk liquids were up a similar amount and scrap metal rose 17 per cent. Containers put on 5 per cent in spite of a difficult international trading climate, particularly on North Atlantic routes. Mr Trevor Furlong, chief executive, refused to elaborate on the Medway negotiations because both sides had signed a confidentiality agreement. However, he stressed the south-east ports would be 'totally complementary' to Liverpool. The Medway Ports were privatised last year via a Pounds 29.7m management and employee buy-out. Mr Furlong refused to confirm reports he was negotiating at about Pounds 75m, a price which might politically embarrass Mersey Docks' largest shareholder.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] At the end of the second day of the deliberations  of the military committee in Cairo, it transpires that the  progress being made is extremely slow, despite public  declarations on the intention to facilitate the talks and reach  an agreement soon. Our correspondent in Cairo Arye Gus has  learned that the Palestinians are avoiding agreements on various  issues, and that they tried to reopen several issues which have  already been concluded, such as the deployment of the  Palestinian forces in Gaza and the timetable for the deployment  of the police force in the autonomy areas. There are also  differences between Israel and the PLO on the technical  procedures for the entrance of the police force to the  territories. Our correspondent was told that the Palestinians  will not be given any responsibility over the autonomy areas  before the agreement is signed, although they will be  responsible for refugee camps handed over to them in these areas.</p>

			<p><P> August 26, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> NEWSWIRE  </P> <P> Prince Alexandre de Merode, chairman of the International Olympic Committee's  medical commission, said that a new procedure for testing for banned substances  has turned up 50 positives for anabolic steroids from 1,110 samples taken at  the Seoul Olympics.  </P> <P> "We are unable to detect the name of the drug that has been used," de Merode  told the New York Times Friday as IOC officials gathered in San Juan, Puerto  Rico, for their annual meeting. "But we believe with this system we are able to  prove that athletes have taken anabolic steroids."  </P> <P> The identities of those who tested positive are not known because the documents  matching the control numbers of urine samples and the athletes' names were  destroyed after the Games, as is customary.  </P> <P> In Seoul, where all medalists and others picked at random were tested, only 10  athletes tested positive for illegal substances, including Canadian sprinter  Ben Johnson, who was stripped of the gold medal after winning the 100-meter  dash.  </P> <P> The test that produced the new results was conducted at the University of  Cologne in West Germany by Dr. Manfred Donike, a member of the medical  commission.  </P> <P> De Merode termed the test "only scientific research, nothing more."  </P> <P> It is common practice for international laboratories to retain samples  collected at competitions and freeze them for later use. It helps officials  refine their testing procedures.  </P></p>

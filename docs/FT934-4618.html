			<p>931203 FT  03 DEC 93 / Pensions probe after fears over bad sales advice Financial regulators are to review the personal pensions of up to 500,000 individuals who have transferred savings out of employers' schemes into private plans. Up to Pounds 7bn is involved. The Securities and Investments Board, the City's top watchdog, fears that people may have been badly advised and might be worse off in retirement than if they had stayed in their employers' schemes. An initial review by regulators found that, in many cases, sales agents sought too little information to be able to give proper advice. Almost every life insurer, bank and building society that has sold personal pensions is expected to be affected. The SIB has retained the accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick to find out how many people are at risk. Its report is to be released within the next few weeks. The review is intended to see that those who followed wrong advice are compensated and that measures are taken to ensure that, in future, personal pensions are sold only to those for whom they are appropriate. Mr Andrew Large, SIB chairman, said personal pension policyholders 'should not be alarmed. The problem we are looking at is not about theft.' 'The SIB felt that this was a problem that should be flagged and dealt with promptly, so regulators are taking action now to ensure that people will not be disadvantaged when they retire.' The life insurance industry, under fire for its sales practices, has been alerted to the regulators' actions and is concerned that the publicity will further damage its reputation and business. It will also raise questions about the government's strategy of offering tax incentives for people taking personal pensions. The SIB, along with the self-regulatory bodies for retail financial services, Lautro, Fimbra and Imro, will form a panel of regulators and industry officials. The panel will set a uniform standard for determining when an individual is deemed to have been given wrong advice. Priority will be given to cases of older individuals who have been encouraged to leave schemes with fully inflation-indexed benefits. The panel will also agree a method of assessing compensation. Regulators feel compensation will prove most difficult to deliver where the employer's scheme will not allow individuals to rejoin or where the life insurer cannot or will not pay. There are also concerns about whether insurers will be willing to pay compensation on policies sold through independent financial advisers. Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the life insurance industry, will ask member firms to review the cases of those who rejected an employers' scheme in favour of a personal pension. Lautro has taken disciplinary action against several life insurers whose sales agents have aggressively encouraged transfers to personal pensions from employers' schemes. Separately, the SIB has been stepping up supervisory visits at the banks and building societies whose retail financial services activities it directly regulates. French pension reform, Page 2</p>

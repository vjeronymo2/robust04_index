			<p>941212 FT  12 DEC 94 / This Week: Film/Video The week's glossiest offering is the live-action/animation movie The Pagemaster. Macaulay 'Home Alone' Culkin is a boy caught up in a magical world while wandering a library. A hint of sorcery; a whiff of dragons; and our hero is hurled into the twilight zone between reality and fantasy. Most of us feel we are already there by this time of year. Buffeted by conflicting bids for our Yuletide attention, we scarcely know which is the way to cosy naturalism and which to state-of-the-art make-believe. The Pagemaster, promising on paper but flimsy on film, prompts another question. Why is Britain getting all the feebler seasonal fare from Hollywood, while the good films - writing from Tinseltown, I can identify them as I speak - stay in the States keeping our ex-colony happy? The smash hits here at present are Disney's cheerful Father-Christmas-is-amongst-us whimsy The Santa Clause, everything that Miracle On 34th Street isn't; the bright, if mildly barmy, sci-fi romp Stargate; and Star Trek Generations, which may be old hat but at least wears its headgear with a flourish. Britain has Junior, fast slipping down the world charts; it has Lord Attenborough in whiskers (in Miracle on 34th Street), prompting the thought that we get enough of that at home; and it has the glorious but one-year-old The Nightmare Before Christmas. The week's new UK openings add to Scrooge-like feelings. They include the grimly self-explanatory Never Ending Story III and the wholly dispensable Dennis Hopper film Chasers. With the video year entering bleak midwinter, where to turn for comfort? Those seeking the perfect cassette present - and having command of unlimited funds - could shun the choice of re-issued movies and go for something completely different. Why not buy the entire set of Monty Python TV shows, repackaged this year for the team's 28th anniversary? Re-viewing highlights recently, I found myself still dissolving into helplessness at dead parrots, AC/DC lumberjacks, ill-equipped cheese shops and all those other things that make life with Python - and should make Christmas with Python - worthwhile.</p>

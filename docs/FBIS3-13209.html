[Darawshah] Yes, we are in Damascus. That is a fact.    [Tal] How were you received there?    [Darawshah] We received a tremendous reception. All 57  members of the delegation were pleasantly surprised by the warm  welcome and the expressions of brotherhood here. Our Syrian  brothers are going out of their way to welcome us and host us.  They also surprised us with their openness, contrary to  everything we had heard earlier. We received a warm welcome and  the delegation members were permitted to go wherever they  desired. We were told that we could do whatever we wanted and  meet whomever we desired. During the day we toured the city, we  conducted a very interesting visit to the 'Amawi mosque and to  the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. MK Talib al-Sani' and myself,  together with the other members of the delegation, placed a  large wreath on the Tomb, and the governor of the Damascus  district also held a large feast in our honor although it is now  Ramadan.    [Tal] Is there any chance of your meeting President al-Asad?    [Darawshah] According to the schedule, we will meet  President al-Asad on Wednesday [9 March].    [Tal] What do you plan on telling him?    [Darawshah] First of all, we will issue our condolences on  the death of his son. That, after all, is the purpose of our  visit. The president is free, of course, to raise any issue;  however, we will not initiate such discussion.    [Tal] Is the Syrian media covering your visit?    [Darawshah] Our visit was extensively reported on Syrian  television, on the radio, and in the press. The press  throughout the entire Arab world is extensively covering this  visit.    [Tal] Is the fact that the delegation is from Israel  highlighted?    [Darawshah] Yes, they are aware of this fact and report it.  Everyone knows who we are and where we came from.    [Tal] The media as well?    [Darawshah] The media as well. All the correspondents know  that the delegation includes two Israeli MK's, local council  heads, university lecturers, public figures, journalists, etc.  The eight journalists who arrived with the delegation from  Israel are being permitted to report on things, to ask questions  and interview people, and to take pictures.    [Tal] Is there any chance that you might receive some  information about the Israeli POW's and MIA's?    [Darawshah] I cannot say anything on this matter at the  present time.    [Tal] Did you learn anything about the state of the Jewish  community in Syria?    [Darawshah] We are scheduled to visit the Jewish community,  meet with the chief rabbi, and visit the main synagogue here.  We asked permission to conduct such a visit and our Syrian  hosts immediately agreed. I hope that we will indeed have the  chance to meet with the Jewish community; however, from all that  we have heard they are treated exactly like the other Syrian  citizens.    [Tal] MK Darawshah, have you received the impression that  the Syrian people receive accurate information about the peace  process?    [Darawshah] Look, they listen to Qol Yisra'el in Arabic.  They watch television and read newspapers. This is not the  isolated and closed off Syria that people try to portray. We  have seen that the people here are aware of everything that is  going on. There is a profound desire to reach a peace agreement  but a great deal of distrust regarding the intentions and  positions of the Israeli Government. The Hebron massacre was  especially painful and infuriated people.    [Tal] The massacre probably received wide coverage in Syria.  What do the members of the delegation, as Israel's  representatives to some extent, have to say about that?    [Darawshah] Well, you know that we also have a position on  that matter. We are angry. It is no secret that we protest and  condemn it. On the other hand, we greatly aspire to contribute  to the peace process.    [Tal] Do you explain that the massacre does not reflect a  phenomenon but was the act of an isolated individual?    [Darawshah] I believe that the Syrians are aware of the  arguments on this matter within Israeli society. There is  criticism of the Army's actions following the massacre. There  are daily reports on the incidents in the territories and on the  fact that more people are killed and wounded every day. This is  very worrisome.    [Tal] Thank you, MK Darawshah.    [Jerusalem Qol Yisra'el in Hebrew at 0500 GMT on 8 March  reports that "our correspondent Qaysar Qabhah, who is  accompanying the delegation of Israeli Arabs visiting Damascus,  reports that PLO official Faruq Qaddumi also visited the Syrian  capital recently and before leaving left a letter for MK  Darawshah. MK Darawshah refused to divulge the letter's  contents."]</p>

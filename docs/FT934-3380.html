			<p>931209 FT  09 DEC 93 / Salomon follows trend in paying big bonuses Salomon Brothers, the US investment bank which recorded the highest ever profits of a Wall Street firm in the second quarter of the year, has followed the lead of Goldman Sachs in awarding unusually high bonuses to London staff. The bonuses are believed to be below the level set by Goldman last month. 'They are not in the Goldman league,' said one Salomon insider. Yet most executives are said to have at least doubled their salaries through the bonus payments, which were announced individually to staff this week. It emerged last week that Goldman is paying 70 London-based executives, including 26 partners, Dollars 1m or more each; partners are to receive a minimum of Dollars 5m in total remuneration this year. The high level of awards at Goldman has boosted expectations in the City, with many dealers citing Dollars 100,000 as a yardstick. Top performers at Salomon are believed to have exceeded the Dollars 1m mark. Mr Stephen Posford, chief executive of Salomon Brothers' London operation, is rumoured to have been particularly well rewarded for London's strong third-quarter performance, which helped make up for a loss-making position taken by the proprietary trading desk in New York. Salomon said it would not comment on these matters. Goldman Sachs is widely viewed as the top bonus payer in the investment banking business, partly as a result of its partnership structure. Both Goldman and Salomon are also strong in proprietary trading - taking views on markets using the banks' own capital - which generates large profits, resulting in big bonuses. Other high payers are Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley, which do not announce bonus awards until next month.</p>

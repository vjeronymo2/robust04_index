			<p><P> July 15, 1989, Saturday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GOLF ROUNDUP;  </P> <P> KING, DESPITE A PAR 71, LEADS WOMEN'S OPEN BY 3  </P> <P> Betsy King, bidding for her first U.S. Women's Open golf title, held her ground  in Friday's second round, and no one could mount a challenge.  </P> <P> The 33-year-old King remained at four under par with a par round of 71 for a  138 total at Indianwood Golf and Country Club in Lake Orion, Mich., and took a  three-stroke lead over Patty Sheehan, Colleen Walker and Lori Garbacz.  </P> <P> Sheehan shot a 67 to go from three over par to one under par. Garbacz started  the day even and finished one under par despite a slide to three over par seven  holes into the round. Walker, who started at one over par, birdied Nos. 1 and 8  and parred everything else.  </P> <P> Marie Laure de Lorenzi-Taya of Spain, who trailed King by a stroke after the  opening round, fell victim to increasingly slick greens on the 6,109-yard Old  Course and finished with a 74 for a 142, where she was tied with Jane Geddes,  who shot a 72, and Dottie Mochrie, who had a 70.  </P> <P> Mike Hulbert birdied his last two holes for a five-under-par 66 and took a  one-shot lead at 131 after two rounds of the Anheuser-Busch tournament at  Williamsburg, Va.  </P> <P> His closest pursuer was Tim Norris, who was at 132 after a 67. Mike Donald was  at 133 after a 66.  </P> <P> Orville Moody shot a seven-under-par 64 to take a one-stroke lead over Michigan  native Dave Hill in the first round of the Greater Grand Rapids Open for  seniors.  </P> <P> Dale Douglass was at 66, while Harold Henning, Bobby Nichols, Agim Bardha and  Senior PGA Tour newcomer Terry Dill had 67s.  </P> <P> Gordon Brand Jr. of Scotland birdied four of the last five holes for a  four-under-par 67 and moved into a one-stroke lead over Australia's Peter  Senior and Spain's Jose-Maria Olazabal with a 204 total after three rounds of  the Scottish Open at Gleneagles.  </P> <P> Ian Woosnam of Wales, who led or shared the lead through the first 36 holes,  shot a 71 and was tied for fourth place at 206.  </P></p>

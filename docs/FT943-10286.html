			<p>940805 FT  05 AUG 94 / World Stock Markets: S African golds tumble Gold shares took a sharp tumble as the bullion price fell to Dollars 375 an ounce, but prices had stabilised by the close of trading. The overall index lost 9 at 5,687, industrials rose 26 to 6,474 and golds weakened 41 to 2,086. Gold issues had drifted lower for most of the day on increasingly bearish forecasts about the state of the gold market, but accelerated downwards as the metal suddenly dropped in mid-afternoon trade, before picking up off the lows. Some industrials continued to do well on offshore demand and lack of scrip. But a weakening in the financial rand indicated net foreign selling. News that the Congress of Trade Unions of South Africa had called off next week's regional stay away had no immediate impact on the JSE but was expected to improve sentiment, which had been dampened by the threat of labour action. Demand continued for De Beers, which ended R1 higher at R117.50 after hitting a new peak in dollar terms of Dollars 26 in New York overnight. Anglos, dragged down by gold, shed R2 to R250. Pick 'n Pay bounced a further 50 cents, or 4 per cent, to R13 in continued positive reaction to the resolution of a bitter 24-day strike.</p>

			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Ra'uf Qubaysi and Suzannah Tarbush: "We Seek To </F> Bolster Our Trade Relations With Britain, To Build Modern State,  and To Lay Down Bases of Democracy"]    [Text] Dr. Muhammad al-'Imadi, Syria's minister of economy  and foreign trade, has asserted that Syria is keen on bolstering  its trade relations with Britain. He said that his country  "seeks to build a modern state, to achieve development, and to  lay down the bases of democracy."    The Syrian minister made the statements yesterday at a  symposium that followed the inauguration of a Syrian products  fair, entitled "Made in Syria" and sponsored by the Arab-British  Chamber of Commerce in London. The fair will continue until 6  May 1994.    The Syrian minister touched on his country's economic  policy,  saying that Syria is working to achieve economic independence  and to take advantage of advanced knowledge in the science and  technology area "while it bolsters the Arab economic cooperation  procession." He added that the backbone of Syria's  socio-economic and political system is an economic plurality  that "guarantees every individual's economic freedom." He  pointed out that economically this means the "presence of a  public sector along with a private sector and a joint sector."    Al-'Imadi said that one of the important distinguishing  marks  in the Syrian economic procession is the process of gradual  opening up to the market economy "in which the public sector  coexists with a competing private sector." He pointed out that  Syria launched this process by educating the people and  preparing them to accept these principles "so the experiment  will proceed in a fashion that spares the country social and  political obstacles." He also said that Syria has managed,  despite the recent difficult years, to raise its gross national  product (from 83 billion Syrian pounds to 410 billion pounds in  1993).    On inflation, al-'Imadi said that it was reduced from 26.3  percent in 1985 to 5.7 percent in 1993 "when capital components  rose from 20 billion pounds in 1985 to 100 billion pounds in  1993, and when the exports and imports volume rose from 33.8  billion pounds in 1987 to 60.7 billion pounds in 1993."    Minister al-'Imadi also touched on political relations  between his country and Britain, saying that they are good and  that mutual visits between Syrian and British ministers "have  laid down the foundations of mutual understanding between the  two countries on problems facing the Arab region and the world."    He added, "I still recall Mrs. Margaret Thatcher's visit to  Syria when she was the shadow cabinet prime minister. Our  president welcomed her and introduced her to his family  members." Al-'Imadi further added, "I also still recall the  post-World War II period when British forces ousted Vichy's  military regime from Syria when Syria's wheat was the source of  the bread that fed Allied troops in our region."    He also said that the accord, which he had the honor to sign  in Damascus in 1976 with Michael Mitcher, the then deputy  minister for parliamentary affairs [name and title as published]  "is still the basis on which relations between our two countries  are founded."    Al-'Imadi noted that the said accord called for bolstering  economic relations and industrial exchange in the service of  both sides. The accord further called for establishing a  British-Syrian Council to achieve various objectives, including  determination of the areas from which both sides can benefit and  examination of the means that ensure the implementation of  development projects.    He said that the aforementioned council met in April 1980  and  underlined the importance of increasing trade between Britain  and Syria and of visits by businessmen's delegations, as well as  the benefit of participation in trade fairs, particularly  specialized fairs.    Minister al-'Imadi welcomed foreign investments in his  country, saying, "Syria enjoys numerous advantages, including  geographic position; a balanced industrial base that includes  agriculture, oil and gas, industry, tourism, and commerce; a  significant market of 13 million people; trade ties between  Syria and the Arab countries; tax exemptions offered by Syria's  investment laws; the stability Syria has achieved in the past  one-quarter century; the availability of labor and skilled  manpower; the presence of large groups of energetic businessmen;  and people's openness and their ability to cooperate with  others."    The "Made in Syria" fair is the first Syrian products fair  organized outside the Arab world. A total of 160 Syrian  companies have participated in it. The fair opening was attended  by hundreds of Arab and foreign businessmen, plus Arab  ambassadors and officials and a Syrian delegation comprised of  10 individuals representing Syria's various ministries.  Displayed products range from food products to traditional and  modern products and textiles, machines, and other products.    At the symposium, held at the Hilton Hotel, Sir Richard  Beaumont, the Arab-British Chamber of Commerce chairman, said in  the address with which he opened the symposium that the fair  idea "was welcomed by our Syrian friends."    The discussion touched on Syria and focused on its political  importance in the Middle East. It also highlighted Syria's trade  importance in history "when it was a sea region [engaged] in the  silk and frankincense trade."    On the sidelines of the symposium, AL-HAYAH interviewed  Muhammad Khadr, Syria's ambassador to Britain, who said that now  that British-Syrian relations have improved, "especially since  British Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd's visit to Syria," the  idea of the fair has become necessary.    Khadr added that the fair comes within the context of  bolstering trade between Britain and Syria, of "familiarizing  British export and import companies with Syrian products, and of  providing the opportunity to Syrian businessmen from the public,  private, and joint sectors to take part in this fair, which we  consider more of a demonstration than a fair."    In a related development, AL-HAYAH has also interviewed Dr.  Ratib al- Shallah, chairman of the Chambers of Commerce Union  and of the Damascus Chamber of Commerce. He pointed out that the  idea of the fair emanates from Syria's keenness on the future,  "especially since what we produced a few years ago wasn't enough  for us, whereas we produce a surplus now as a result of the  projects implemented in accordance with Investment Law No. 10 of  1991."    Al-Shallah noted that the goal of the fair is to familiarize  the Syrian producer with world markets "so he can hear praise,  criticism, and recommendations; so he can learn the type of  standards demanded by the world market; and so he can be in  constant contact with available technologies that enable him to  compete in world markets."    Despite praising his country for producing an agricultural  and industrial surplus, al-Shallah said that Syria does not want  to encounter a crisis of production surplus for which there are  no markets, "whether at home or abroad or in terms of quality or  of prices."    Answering a question on whether displayed products reflect  the degree of development achieved by Syria in the industrial  and agricultural sectors, al-Shallah, who is a prominent Syrian  businessman, said, "The fair doesn't at all reflect the true  character of Syria's agricultural and industrial production." He  added that officials of the Chambers of Commerce Union and of  the Damascus Chamber of Commerce were not able to contact all  producers, especially those who have no surplus to sell. "But we  expect that participation by Syrian producers in future fairs  will be much stronger."    Adib Ghanam, the assistant information minister, said in the  question-and-answer session of the symposium that in addition to  the current television channel, Syria plans to establish a  television channel operated by artificial satellites. He told  AL-HAYAH that Syria has concluded an agreement with Arabsat,  Arab Satellite, to start transmitting via artificial satellites  by 1996. He said that the channel will transmit in Arabic and  English.    Martin Baker, the official in charge of the branch that  deals  with British exports to Asia, Africa, and Australia at the  British Chamber of Commerce and Industry, has said that Mike  Heseltine, the British secretary of trade and industry, has  decided that Syria will be included in a list of 80 countries to  which Britain aspires to export. Baker added that tourism is the  most attractive sphere of investment in Syria currently.    A participant asked Dr. al-'Imadi if multiple currency  exchange rates continue to exist in Syria and if there is a  possibility of floating Syrian currency or of establishing a  single uniform price for the Syrian pound in the near future.  The minister answered, "The purpose of the policy embraced by  the Syrian Government recently is to unify the exchange rates so  they will be as close to the market rate as possible." Al-'Imadi  noted that unifying the various exchange rates has created the  so-called "neighboring countries exchange rate."    Al-'Imadi added that customs tariffs have been applied as of  the beginning of this month on the basis of the average exchange  rate, which is 23 pounds per dollar instead of 11.25 pounds per  dollar, excluding foodstuffs and raw materials. However,  al-'Imadi warned that changing exchange rates dictates that the  Syrian Government be aware of the social ramifications.    Dr. Ratib al-Shallah said that, even though it is desirable  to have a unified exchange rate, the step could be "costly" to  some people. As an example, he cited the question of applying an  exchange rate of 44 or 45 pounds per dollar to assess customs  tariffs. He said that such a rate would pose hardship to the  working classes and to people with a limited income.</p>

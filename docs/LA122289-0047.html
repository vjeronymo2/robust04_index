			<p><P> December 22, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> OFFICIALS MISJUDGED INMATE UNREST, REPORT ON PENNSYLVANIA RIOTS SAYS  </P> <P> Prison administrators showed "serious misjudgments" in failing to heed warnings  of inmate unrest at Camp Hill state prison, and in not securing the institution  after the first of two nights of rioting, a report released Thursday concluded.  </P> <P> But Arlin Adams, a retired judge who headed the three-member investigating  panel that issued the report, stopped short of recommending to Gov. Robert P.  Casey that anyone be fired because of the October riots that destroyed half of  the medium-security facility.  </P> <P> The 57-page report documents in detail how inmates indicated their plans for an  uprising, and how administrators failed to appreciate the severity of the  crisis.  </P> <P> It said corrections officials made critical mistakes after the first night of  rioting by failing to conduct a shakedown of the inmates and failing to padlock  cells.  </P> <P> Casey said he would act on the recommendations after discussing the report with  Corrections Commissioner David Owens.  </P> <P> The prison near Harrisburg suffered $15 million in damage during rioting in  late October. At least 122 people were injured and 26 guards were taken  hostage.  </P></p>

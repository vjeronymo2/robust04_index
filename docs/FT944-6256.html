			<p>941130 FT  30 NOV 94 / Budget 94 (Public Spending): Sharp cuts in road building programme - Transport The government's Pounds 2bn annual road building programme faces sharp cuts over the next three years, despite hopes of an increasing financial contribution from the private sector. Spending on the national railway network and London Underground is also set to fall by an estimated Pounds 300m next year. Public spending on roads had risen by a half in real terms over the past 10 years, the chancellor said. 'But now that the main need of the economy is control of public spending and borrowing, we cannot carry on pumping in the same amount of taxpayers' money. 'We have therefore significantly reduced the planned public spending on trunk roads and motorways,' he told Parliament. Total transport spending over the three years 1995-96 to 1997-98 will fall to Pounds 16bn, of which Pounds 2bn will come from the private sector, Mr Brian Mawhinney, transport secretary, said yesterday. This compared with the Pounds 16.8bn previously forecast to be spent between 1994-95 and 1996-97 in the transport department's most recent annual report. Spending on motorways and major roads is expected to fall from Pounds 2.1bn in 1994-95 to Pounds 1.7bn in 1997-98, transport department figures showed. Greater emphasis is to be given to smaller road schemes designed to eliminate local accident and congestion black spots, Dr Mawhinney said. Spending on these schemes will rise to Pounds 108m next year from Pounds 74m this year. Central government support for local authority road schemes is due to decline from Pounds 981m this year to Pounds 863m in 1997-98. Total spending on public transport - rail, London Transport and the Civil Aviation Authority - will fall from Pounds 2.38bn this year to Pounds 1.83bn in 1995-96 and Pounds 1.56bn the following year. However, the proceeds from the sale of British Rail assets, including the rolling stock leasing companies and freight companies, will bring in Pounds 770m next year and Pounds 325m the year after. In 1997-98 public transport spending recovers, however, to Pounds 1.9bn with no contribution from the privatisation process. Spending on London Transport's core network, excluding large projects such as the Jubilee Line extension, will fall steadily to Pounds 382m in 1997-98 from Pounds 497m this year. In contrast with the strong criticism made by London Transport of government funding in recent years, Mr Peter Ford, the new chairman, described this as 'a fair settlement' though less than previously indicated. Organisations of road users criticised the government for its spending reduction. The RAC said the government had increased the tax burden on motorists by raising fuel duties 'while pulling the roads out from under their wheels'. The Freight Transport Association said plans to bring private finance into road building without clear income streams to repay the private sector 'could lead to crippling delays and serious inconvenience to UK industry'. Mr Michael Meacher, Labour transport spokesman, predicted far higher fares for travellers on public transport and a reduction in services. Funding for the railways was being cut on the assumption that privatisation would be successful while Britain's roads would continue to deteriorate. Transport 2000 said private finance was a substitute for a transport policy and forecast that the cuts in rail spending would lead to drastic cuts in services. Mr Mawhinney defended the decision to bring more private finance into transport as 'a partnership between the public and private sectors'. He said: 'I am determined to break the psychology which rules that, if money does not come from the taxpayer, it is not real or, in some sense, does not count. We must look at what is being spent not, just the immediate funding mechanism.'</p>

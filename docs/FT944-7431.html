			<p>941124 FT  24 NOV 94 / International Company News: NSK in joint venture with US group NSK, the Japanese motor components and bearings group, is forming a joint venture with Ingersoll-Rand, the US multinational, to launch a broader attack on Europe's 15m-plus units a year market for vehicle steering columns. The equally-owned venture, Nastech Europe, initially will pool the resources of Torrington, Ingersoll-Rand's automotive subsidiary, and NSK's steering column manufacturing facilities in the UK. Later they will consider adding capacity in continental Europe. Torrington employs 400 people at Coventry and NSK employs 160 people at Peterlee in north-east England. The two plants have a combined turnover of Pounds 35m to Pounds 40m (Dollars 22.3m-Dollars 25.5m) a year. Torrington supplies traditional European customers such as Ford and Rover. The Peterlee facility supplies mainly Japanese transplant operations, notably Nissan at Sunderland, Toyota in Derbyshire and a Suzuki venture in Hungary. Together they account for about 15 per cent of Europe's steering column market, according to Mr Chris Thomas, the new company's managing director. Large independent rivals include ZF of Germany. But about 50 per cent of demand is currently met by vehicle makers' in-house production. However, executives of Nastech Europe, which will start operations early next year, say they believe that the trend of vehicle manufacturers increasingly to out-source components should provide good growth opportunities in the sector.</p>

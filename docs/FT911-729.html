			<p>910510 FT  10 MAY 91 / UK Company News: Frogmore brands Southend offer as effort to solve gearing problem Frogmore Estates, the subject of a Pounds 130m offer from Southend Property Holdings, yesterday accused its bidder of being in a 'financial strait-jacket'. 'Southend's offer is no more than a thinly disguised attempt to overcome its very real problem caused by an alarming level of gearing,' said Frogmore in its defence document. Southend responded with a claim that it was 'particularly disappointed and concerned to note the complete absence of any valuation of Frogmore'. 'Could it be that Frogmore is worth less than shareholders believe?' asked Mr Malcolm Dagul, chairman of Southend. Southend's own net asset value came under attack in Frogmore's document. It said that Southend's net assets of 147p would be reduced by 9p if it had not assumed the 'extremely questionable' conversion of preference shares, ignored the placing and open offer currently being made to shareholders and included Pounds 7m of warrants which have not been exercised. Frogmore also said that Southend's financial performance had 'run out of steam' and its last two dividends had not been covered. It said that Southend would have reported an attributable loss last year were it not for a change in accounting policy. It also attacked Southend's claim about its net asset growth, saying that the majority of the growth in the last five years was the result of issuing shares. Frogmore contrasted its share price performance, which has seen a 2 per cent rise above its pre-crash price, with Southend's which has fallen 69 per cent. The defence document said that Southend was offering Frogmore shareholders an immediate capital loss of 7.3 per cent and a reduction in dividend income of 12.1 per cent. Frogmore advised shareholders that rather than take on Southend's portfolio, the company would do better by buying other properties below their balance sheet values. It described Southend's assets as 'unattractive', as many were in locations where rental and capital values could be vulnerable.</p>

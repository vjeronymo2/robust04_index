			<p>BFN     [Text] Interior Minister Carlos Podesta has recognized that  the police showed "inefficiency" during the 2 May incidents in  Tacuara that resulted in the death of young Sebastian Larrosa.  The minister agreed to answer questions from labor and peasant  leaders, journalists, and a number of legislators during a  public meeting at the Radio Primero de Marzo auditorium. Podesta  admitted that the police shot at shoulder height in Tacuara. He  was nevertheless strongly accused and criticized for his  performance at the head of the Interior Ministry. He was also  criticized for the government's performance.    A good portion of the questioning session centered on the  violent incidents in Tacuara during the 2 May general strike,  and the murder of peasant leader Esteban Balbuena. The program  was conducted by journalists Carlos Peralta and Andres Granje.    Podesta was calm in answering questions from labor and  peasant leaders during the program. At some points, however, he  showed signs of being annoyed, particularly when he heard strong  accusations against his performance in the case of the death of  the peasant in Tacuara.    The minister defended the image of the police institution at  all times, saying that it was not a criminal organization.    Regarding police performance during the peasant  demonstration  at Tacuara, Podesta said that the police had been instructed to  try to reason with the demonstrators as much as possible, adding  that no one received orders to shoot at anyone.    In the midst of the debate Podesta recognized: "There were  police officers, more than one, who shot at shoulder height. We  recorded the incidents, and thanks to the videos we can  determine who they are. A total of 17 police officers are under  arrest at this time."    Later the minister recognized that the police had been  inefficient in Tacuara, adding, however, that the police  officers did not have any ill intentions.    Podesta denied that he had received instructions to order  the  police to be inflexible during the strike, not even from  President Wasmosy.    Labor leaders Alan Flores and Eduardo Ojeda strongly  criticized the performance of Podesta, who said he will not hide  from his responsibility in the event and will not resign. "It is  not fair to include my resignation among labor's demands," the  minister told union leaders.    Podesta denied that the killing of peasant leader Estaban  Balbuena had any political implications. He added that an  in-depth investigation of the case has not produced enough  evidence to come to that conclusion.    The questioning session reached a climax when Arganaist  [from  the Luis Maria Argana faction of the Colorado Party] Deputy  Walter Bower intervened to characterize Podesta as "an expert in  political warfare." The legislator said the questioning session  fitted his purposes perfectly, as the minister was able to show  his qualities and confuse the people even more.    At the end of the program, labor and peasant leaders said  they were not satisfied with Podesta's answers.    At one point during the questioning session, Podesta denied  that peasants were being blamed for wanting to destabilize  President Juan Carlos Wasmosy's government. Podesta thus  contradicted accusations made by the president, who repeatedly  blamed peasants for the alleged campaign to destabilize his  government.    Labor leaders accused the government of implementing an  alleged plan to eliminate labor and peasant leaders, citing the  recent assassinations of Esteban Balbuena and Sebastian Larrosa.  Podesta categorically denied that the government was planning to  eliminate social and labor organization leaders.    The secretary of state insisted that the police department  was not a criminal organization, adding that the government was  working to turn the institution into a healthy organization.  "This is what we have. We are working on it," Podesta added. At  another point, the minister said that government authorities  regret more than anyone else what happened during the 2 May  general strike. He said the ministry had ordered an inquiry to  find out exactly what happened. The minister also said he  trusted that the murders of peasant leaders Esteban Balbuena and  Sebastian Larrosa would not go unpunished.</p>

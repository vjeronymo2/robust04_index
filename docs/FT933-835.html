			<p>930927 FT  27 SEP 93 / Investcorp to control Gucci for Dollars 170m INVESTCORP, the Bahrain-based merchant bank, will today announce it has won control of Gucci, one of the world's best-known luxury goods brands, in an amicable solution to the battle for ownership. Mr Maurizio Gucci, grandson of the founder, will sell his 50 per cent stake to Investcorp, the only other shareholder, for about Dollars 170m (Pounds 110m). The price is slightly more than the Dollars 160m paid by Investcorp to buy its holding in the booming late 1980s. Analysts expect Investcorp to move quickly to recapitalise Gucci and prepare it either for flotation or sale to a bigger luxury goods concern. The bank has already acquired a portfolio of luxury goods companies, including Tiffany, which has been floated, Chaumet and Saks 5th Avenue. Mr Gucci will cut all links with the group, established 70 years ago. However, in a surprise twist, he is expected to be appointed as a special consultant to Investcorp for its luxury goods activities. The appointment also offers the two sides a face-saving solution to the bitter war of words of recent months. In July, Investcorp obtained a temporary freeze on Mr Gucci's stake. Claiming Mr Gucci was mis-managing the company, it also instigated formal arbitration proceedings to resolve differences between the two shareholders. Gucci's financial performance has suffered from the recession and the inability of its shareholders to agree on policy. Sales fell to L225bn (Pounds 93m) in the 1992-3 financial year ending January 31st from a peak of L299bn in 1990-91. Mr Gucci's attempts to restore the company's fortunes by concentrating on traditional items and cutting the number of outlets helped reduce losses to L25bn last year from a peak of L38bn in 1991-2. However, Gucci is still experiencing financial difficulties with high borrowings and continuing losses at its important US subsidiary. While stressing his commitment to the family business, Mr Gucci made clear in July that he was open to offers. Negotiations, which began soon after the legal action, were completed last week.</p>

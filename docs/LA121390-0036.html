			<p><P> December 13, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> STAGE WATCH: MORALITY IS THEME OF TAPER, TOO SCHEDULE  </P> <P> The Taper, Too will open an unusual season in February: three plays by European  writers. Not one of the productions will be a bona fide Los Angeles premiere,  and no local directors will be involved.  </P> <P> On tap are Moliere's "Don Juan," directed by Travis Preston, Feb. 5-March 3;  Bertolt Brecht's "The Wedding," directed by Vladimir Strnisko, March 19-April  14, and Heiner Muller's "The Task," directed by L. Kenneth Richardson, May  7-June 2.  </P> <P> All of the plays examine various forms of "accepted morality," according to a  Taper press release.  </P> <P> The 99-seat Taper, Too often is considered the Taper's arena for grass roots  experimentation. The Taper Lab presents new-play workshops there, using many  local playwrights, each fall.  </P> <P> Last year, Los Angeles writer John Steppling's "The Thrill" graduated from the  Lab to a full production at the Taper, Too, and in the past such new plays as  "In the Belly of the Beast" and "Stand-Up Tragedy" moved up from Taper, Too to  mainstage productions.  </P> <P> But next year's productions date from 1665 ("Don Juan"), 1926 ("The Wedding")  and 1980 ("The Task"). All three plays have been previously produced in Los  Angeles, though "The Task" was seen here under a different title, "The Mission"  (1988, in a production by KitchenCollective at the Museum of Contemporary Art  and the Wallenboyd Theatre).  </P> <P> Next year's playwrights are French and German. And the directors live in New  York, New Jersey and Czechoslovakia.  </P> <P> Preston, the New Yorker, has directed in the East and in Europe, where his  feature film "Astonished" has won attention at film festivals. Richardson has  worked at the Taper ("The Colored Museum," 1988) and the Taper Lab, but he  lives in New Jersey, where he formerly directed Crossroads Theatre Company.  </P> <P> Strnisko runs an avant-garde theater in Bratislava, Czechoslovakia, that was  closed due to government pressure under the former regime; this will be his  U.S. debut. The Taper discovered him when a Taper troupe appeared in Bratislava  in 1988.  </P> <P> "We like to use the Taper, Too in different ways," said Taper artistic director  Gordon Davidson. "There was great interest in these three directors right now,  and there were no plays (from this year's Taper Lab) we wanted to develop to  the next stage at this moment, though there are longer-range plans for some of  them. Also, the planning of Taper, Too has to go on before the (Lab) festival  is over."  </P> <P> Davidson pointed to his use of local directors in the "50/60" series on the  mainstage last spring, and said that more such opportunities will arise should  the Taper ever be able to expand into the 250-350-seat second space that he has  long coveted.  </P> <P> Salonga in 'Saigon'?: Is Lea Salonga a "star" or "an actor providing unique  services"?  </P> <P> She must fit at least one of those descriptions for Actors' Equity to allow her  -- or any foreigner -- to star on Broadway. There are indications that Equity  is questioning Salonga's credentials.  </P> <P> Producer Cameron Mackintosh had asked Equity for permission for 19-year-old  Salonga, a Filipina, to re-create her title role in London's "Miss Saigon" on  Broadway, claiming he couldn't find an Asian-American actress for the role.  According to the New York Times, an Equity council meeting deliberated four  hours Tuesday before deciding to pass the decision to a panel consisting of an  arbitrator, two Mackintosh representatives and two Equity representatives.  </P> <P> Equity officials and Mackintosh declined comment Wednesday.  </P> <P> According to her biography in the program for "Miss Saigon," Salonga had  appeared in 11 plays and six movies, sung on five albums, and received six  awards -- all in the Philippines -- before "Miss Saigon." Her ultimate goal is  to be a doctor, according to the bio.  </P> <P> The Salonga dispute occurs in the same week as hearings before the New York  City Commission on Human Rights about discrimination on the New York stage. The  hearings were inspired by the controversy over the hiring of Salonga's Welsh  co-star, Jonathan Pryce, to re-create his London role in New York. He plays a  Eurasian character, and Asian-American activists within Equity said that an  Asian actor should play the role.  </P> <P> Redgrave in 'Lettice'?: Vanessa Redgrave is likely to take over Maggie Smith's  starring role in "Lettice and Lovage" when the comedy goes on tour, say Shubert  Organization officials, who co-produce the play and whose Shubert Theatre in  Century City is one of the theaters under consideration for the tour. There  have been reports that Smith was concerned about the size of the theaters on  the tour, including the Century City Shubert; Shubert officials declined to  comment.  </P></p>

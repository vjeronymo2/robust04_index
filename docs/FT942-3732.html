			<p>940614 FT  14 JUN 94 / Brcko attack condemned The UN yesterday condemned Sunday's rocket attack on a Serb-held town of Brcko in northern Bosnia where several civilians were wounded. In a separate incident at the weekend, British troops came under mortar and small-arms fire in central Bosnia. However, UN officials said the country-wide truce agreed last week appeared to be holding. Commander Eric Chaperon, the UN Protection Force spokesman in Sarajevo, said fighting continued to decrease substantially over the weekend, 'indicating continuing compliance with at least a spirit of the cessation of hostilities agreements'. The UN's special envoy to the former Yugoslavia, Yasushi Akashi, described the firing of rockets at Serb-held Brcko as 'reprehensible'. A statement released from UN headquarters in Zagreb said the rockets were fired from the nearby Orasje pocket, where Bosnian, Croat and Moslem units are deployed. The Bosnian Serb commander, General Ratko Mldic, warned of retaliation if the attacks continued.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Ekaterina Zhilyakova] </F>   [Text] Moscow April 8 -- Representatives from Russia's  radical opposition are hardly likely to put their signatures to  Yeltin's memorandum on Civic Accord.    The executive committee of the "TRUDOVAYA ROSSIYA" (LABOR  RUSSIA) movement told ITAR-TASS that it recently adopted its own  version of the agreement on accord in Russia. The movement is  ready to sign the memorandum only if it accomodates their  demands. Among those demands are: to immediately and  unconditionally halt the "course on the restoration of  capitalism in Russia, to restore the power of the Soviets  everywhere, to immediately and unconditionally freeze and then  lower prices on the main food products, to outlaw and prosecute  speculating, and to restore the buying power of bank deposits as  of the 1 January 1990 status."    Georgy Gusev, the executive secretary of the "Civil Accord"  committee, which was formed about three years ago, thinks the  idea of an agreement on civil accord in Russia is good, however  all the sides will hardly be able to reach a consensus on  concrete points of the agreement. Overall, he said, the work on  the draft agreement reminds one of the work on the 1991 union  treaty and, therefore, may share the treaty's sad fate. The  signing of the union treaty was prevented by the 1991 August  attempted coup, then the agreement simply fell behind events.</p>

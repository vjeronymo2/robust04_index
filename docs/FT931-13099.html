			<p>930126 FT  26 JAN 93 / International Company News: Randgold edges back into the black A TURNROUND into profit at the Harmony gold mine helped Randgold, the gold arm of the Barlow Rand group, to record a R6.7m (Dollars 2.2m) after-tax profit during the December quarter compared to a R6.5m loss in the previous quarter. Harmony's performance, achieved with special government dispensation to blast on Sundays, and to blast more than once in 24 hours, could well be instrumental in hastening reform of restrictive laws which hamper productivity in the gold mining industry. A number of other marginal mines have recently sought similar exemptions from the government. Harmony itself made an after-tax profit during the quarter of R8.5m compared with a R5.7m loss the previous quarter. Mr John Turner, chairman of Harmony, said permission to blast on Sundays, granted in September, had diminished the risk of closure. He added that the mine was not yet out of the woods and would have to maintain current levels of grade and production to stay profitable. This required continuing Sunday operations. The exemption granted in this respect is to be reviewed in March. During the December quarter, Harmony produced an extra 563kg of gold, out of a total production of 5,305kg. This contributed an extra R13.2m working profit to the mine's results. Harmony, with a 14,600 workforce, is the largest marginal mine in the industry. Its closure would have serious implications for the nearby Free State town of Virginia. Elsewhere in the group, Durban Deep had a steady quarter with after-tax profits of R963,000, against R1m. Increased production and lower costs helped Blyvooruitzicht lift taxed profit to R4.3m from R1.5m. Losses at ERPM rose to R7m from R3.4m with production to 1,539kg from 1,685kg.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> Finnish </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Prime Minister Esko Aho is critical of the debate  conducted in Finland about NATO's Partnership for Peace  initiative. According to Aho, in the debate at home, Finland has  been placed in the same position as the member countries of the  former Warsaw Treaty. After talks with Dutch Prime Minister  Ruud Lubbers, Aho's interpretation was that the Partnership for  Peace initiative serves primarily the former socialist countries  of Eastern Europe, and an open invitation has been extended to  the other CSCE countries merely in the name of impartiality.    Aho thought that the countries that had sought membership in  the European Union could progress to become observer or full  members of the Union's defense system, the Western European  Union, and that way possibly further into NATO membership. Aho  said that the Finnish Government intends to ask for  clarification of what NATO means by Partnership for Peace.</p>

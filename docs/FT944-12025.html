			<p>941103 FT  03 NOV 94 / Leading Article: A bank for peace The Casablanca conference on Middle East economic development has played a valuable role in dismantling psychological barriers. It also came up with a concrete proposal to that end, in agreeing to work towards the creation of a regional development bank. Pan-regional economic institutions - on trade, for example, and water - will be essential if peace is to be consolidated and trust built between ancient enemies. It is questionable, however, whether a bank is the best means to that end. Putting flesh on the bare bones of the proposed Middle East and North Africa Development Bank, and achieving a funding target of Dollars 10bn, will prove challenging. The yet to be selected 'group of experts' who will examine policy options for the bank should look closely at the chequered history of others in Asia, Africa and the Americas. One obvious lesson is that regional development banks have fared best when operating in relatively well-managed economies where project lending might have a better than average chance of proving profitable. The experience of the African Development Bank shows how difficult this can be. At the end of last year, over 39 per cent of its outstanding loans were to just four countries: Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria, the last two scarcely models of third world development. The percentage of loans going to the north of the continent is predicted to increase as investment opportunities decrease in sub-Saharan Africa. Significantly, those four countries would expect to be members of, and beneficiaries from, the new bank, an unnecessary duplication which cannot be left unresolved. Similar problems exist with the potentially overlapping activities of the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development and the Islamic Development Bank - not to mention the World Bank itself. The management of any new bank would need simultaneously to make Herculean efforts to loosen the link in the Middle East between politics and economic assistance. Arab countries bordering Israel have long been rewarded by one paymaster or another, according to political stance, not to economic performance. Israel still enjoys substantial and largely uncritical US assistance, while the Palestine Liberation Organisation is already showing all the symptoms of the aid addict in its demands for unfettered cash assistance. Regional governments will continue to emphasise the threat of Islamic extremism in an effort to ensure that political aid is not reduced. But it has been the very failure of those regimes to manage their economies efficiently which has created the conditions in which extremism flourishes. It is welcome that Middle Eastern governments are discussing ways in which they can work together. But a bank along the lines suggested is not the best form of co-operation - and certainly should not be the only one.</p>

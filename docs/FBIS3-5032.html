Comrade Dao Duy Tung, member of the  Political Bureau and secretary of the party Central Committee,  is attending.    Comrade Pham Van Tho, member of the party Central Commmittee  and secretary of the provincial party committee, delivered a  report to the conference. According to the report, after  scoring outstanding achievements and effecting a considerably  high economic growth rate over the past three years, Hai Hung is  now adopting new measures to shift to the commodity economy and  effect economic restructuring in the direction of the market  mechanism. The average gross domestic product for the last  three-year period increased by 7.85 per cent, which is 2.3 times  higher than that of the previous five-year period. The 1993  grain output reached 1,252,000 tons and the local industrial  output accounted for 29.2 per cent of the overall national  industrial product. The average export index reached 9 million  dollars.    The report of the provincial party organization's executive  committee also pointed out Hai Hung's shortcomings as follows:  The local economy still depends entirely on agriculture and is  unstable. The pace of development of the commodity economy is  slow. Production operations are scattered. Agricultural  products processing and consumption is still rife with many  difficulties. Unemployment constitutes a burning problem.    Hai Hung is making efforts to ensure that from now until the  conference of the seventh provincial party organization it will  achieve an average increase of more than 9 percent in the gross  domestic product; formulate an overall economic development plan  under which agriculture will account for 40 percent of overall  production, industry for 30 percent, and the service sector for  30 percent; apply uniform measures to boost the multisectorial  economic growth; make continued efforts to renovate and perfect  the mechanism and economic management system, create a favorable  environment for the development of the commodity economy,  resolve social problems, renovate and revamp party  organizations, and strengthen the relations between the party  and people.</p>

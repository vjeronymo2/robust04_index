			<p><P> July 23, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> LE CELLIER TO SERVE ITS LAST MEALS JULY 31  </P> <P> The dependable, traditionally French Le Cellier in Santa Monica has been sold,  and will serve its last dinners on July 31. The restaurant opened almost 20  years ago -- on the site that had been occupied by Madame Wu's, incidentally,  until that establishment moved to palatial newer quarters a few blocks to the  west. Le Cellier owners Madeleine and Jacques Don Salat plan to retire -- "with  mixed emotions, very frankly," says Madeleine Don Salat. The restaurant's  longtime chef, Jean Bellordre, she adds, "is being a bit mysterious about his  plans, but he certainly wants to have at least some months of complete rest."  </P> <P> The new owner of the premises is Carmine Inc., a company owned in part by  Carmine Competelli, Jr. -- whose family ran the veteran West L.A. Italian  restaurant called Carmine's for several decades, before selling it last year.  (It remains open under the Carmine's name, but is no longer affiliated with the  original proprietors in any way.) Competelli plans to remodel Le Cellier  slightly and reopen it by mid-September as Menello di Carmine. The food, he  says, will be Continental/Italian -- but he adds that "my thing has always been  that I'll make anything anybody likes. If somebody wants a French  bouillabaisse, I can make that. Italian's my specialty, but I'm also a great  steak cook, and I can make a terrific hamburger."  </P> <P> Competelli's partners in the new enterprise are businessmen Matthew Smith and  Gerald Goldman and former Carmine's maitre d' Eddie De Bellagente. Madeleine  and Jacques Don Salat retain a small interest in the place, and additional  minority shares are held by 30 or so additional investors -- including  Hollywood celebrities Tony Danza and Kim Basinger.  </P> <P> PYRAMID SCHEME: Under its original proprietor, Fernand Point, La Pyramide in  Vienne, south of Lyon, became arguably the best and most influential single  restaurant in France. Among the chefs who learned their trade there were Paul  Bocuse, Alain Chapel and Louis Outhier. Thus, it was almost literally the  birthplace of the nouvelle cuisine, and by extension of all the cooking styles  that stemmed from it -- the "New American Cuisine" among them. Following  Point's death in 1956, his widow, Mado, continued to run the place in something  of an ossified fashion, as a slowly fading monument to his greatness. She died  two years ago, and her family closed the restaurant. Now it has reopened under  the ownership of a Paris-based development company called Le Foncier des Champs  Elysees, with its dining room remodeled and expanded and a few guest rooms  added. The new proprietors are 31-year-old chef Patrick Henriroux and his wife,  Pascale. The food world waits and watches.  </P> <P> THE VERY THINGS THAT HAPPEN: The Seventh Street Bistro, downtown, holds its  first wine maker's dinner tomorrow night at 7 p.m., featuring the wares of  Rutherford Hill Winery. The six-course meal costs $75 per person, with tax, tip  and even valet parking fee included. . . . The Mandarin in Beverly Hills, in  association with the L.A. chapter of the American Institute of Wine &amp; Food,  offers a special luncheon next Sunday called "The Daily Foods of China." The  restaurant will be divided into a series of food stalls, each serving samples  of authentic regional Chinese street food. Call (213) 473-5324 for details. Lew  Mitchell's Orient Express on the Miracle Mile matches the wines of Adler-Fels  with a special Chinese-French-style menu, July 31. Cost of the seven-course  meal is $50 per person. . . . And photographer/painter Paul Child, whose wife  is Julia, will be honored at a special exhibition of his work Aug. 6 from 4 to  7 p.m. at the Santa Barbara Winery in Santa Barbara. The winery's own wines  will be served with food selected by Mrs. Child -- and tours of three nearby  food businesses will be available. The event is sponsored by the Southern  California Culinary Guild. Tickets are $25 apiece, and reservations must be  made by July 30. Call Laila Rashid at (805) 963-3633.  </P> <P> And Yamashiro in Hollywood hosts "The Keith and Margo Murder Mystery," a  combination prix fixe dinner and audience-participation drama, Aug. 4, 12 and  18, with later dates to be announced. Cost is $65 per person, and reservations  are essential.  </P></p>

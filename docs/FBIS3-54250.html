"I hope the meetings with Peres will bring about a  breakthrough in the negotiations," said the PLO chairman. Asked  by the YEDI'OT AHARONOT correspondent whether he is close to a  decision on signing the Gaza-Jericho First agreement, 'Arafat  responded: "The decision is not only mine. There is another  side, too."    Asked for his assessment on the effects of Basil al-Asad's  death on the Israeli-Syrian negotiations, 'Arafat answered: "I  do not know. I personally lament the death of Basil. I knew  him when he was still a boy, when al-Asad was a major in the  Syrian Air Force. I deeply regret his death."    'Arafat was asked whether Syria is heading for a separate  agreement. His answer: "Al-Asad took care to convene the Arab  leaders prior to departing for Geneva in order to receive their  blessing. This is the way to practice politics!"    'Arafat said there are still four issues under discussion  between Israel and the PLO. 'Arafat's aides -- Yasir  'Abd-Rabbuh, Akram Haniyah, and Abu-al-'Ala' [Ahmad Quray'] --  sounded a little more optimistic. Haniyah said the first  meeting with Peres increased his optimism regarding the chances  for an agreement. 'Abd-Rabbuh said: "God willing."</p>

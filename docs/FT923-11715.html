			<p>920723 FT  23 JUL 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fears of further German rate rise upset bourses FEARS that the Bundesbank would be forced to raise the Lombard rate added to the negative factors weighing on continental equities, writes Our Markets Staff. FRANKFURT was depressed by disappointing money supply figures, a downgrading of Thyssen and poor car registration figures for the first half. The DAX fell 31.55 or 1.9 per cent to 1,628.22, its lowest close since mid-January, while the FAZ was 7.28 lower at 649.04 by midsession. Turnover fell to DM6.3bn from DM6.9bn. The 8.7 per cent growth in M3 money supply in June, little changed from May, upset the market which had hoped for a month-on-month decrease. There was active trading in Thyssen after analysts cut their recommendations from hold to sell following a meeting with the steel group on Tuesday. Analysts are now forecasting that Thyssen will cut its 1991/92 dividend by up to DM2 from DM10 a year earlier. The shares lost DM15.40 or 6.9 per cent to DM207.60, but off the day's low of DM205. Other steel groups weakened with Hoesch down DM6.10 at DM235 and Kloeckner-Werke losing DM8.50 to DM100. Car shares fell after the release of figures showing a 9.2 per cent decrease in new registrations for the first six months. Daimler-Benz lost DM14 to DM705.50, Volkswagen fell DM9.90 to DM354 and BMW shed DM5.50 to DM538.50. After the close, Volkswagen said that its share of the West European car market had risen to 17.8 per cent in the first half of 1992 from 16.7 per cent last year. PARIS dropped to its lowest level since Christmas, as the CAC-40 index ended 35.18 or 2 per cent lower at 1,727.49 on turnover of FFr2.63bn. Alcatel remained busy on arbitrage-related business, falling FFr11 to FFr613, but the FFr31 fall in BSN to FFr1,059 reflected genuine disinvestment by investors reducing their exposure to the market. An increasingly bleak outlook for the luxury goods market prompted selling of LVMH which closed FFr102 lower at FFr3,463. Euro Disney fell a further FFr2.75 to FFr97.25 on a growing consensus that the theme park operator would have to reduce prices. MILAN continued to fall, with the banking sector particularly badly hit by fears of mounting bad debts following last Friday's compulsory winding up of Efim, the state industrial holding group. The Comit index fell 1.95 to 409.76 in turnover estimated at L100bn after Monday's L136bn. The banking sector fell 1.85 per cent, with Banca Commerciale Italiana, which is said to have the biggest exposure to Efim among the domestic banks, falling L119 or 4.7 per cent to L2,401. Credito Italiano and San Paolo, which reportedly have smaller loans to Efim, fell L40.5 and L25 to L1,310 and L10,075 respectively. Benetton dropped L840 or 7.3 per cent to L10,700 on a domestic newspaper report that the company had sacked its managing director. After the close the company confirmed that Mr Emilio Fossati had resigned, but under amicable circumstances. ZURICH was generally weaker and the SMI index declined 27.4 or 1.5 per cent to 1,757.1. Union Bank led the sector lower and its bearers fell SFr7 to SFr684. Among insurers, Zurich bearers lost BFr20 to BFr1,795. AMSTERDAM retreated, the CBS Tendency index closing down 1.1 at 116.5. Fokker fell 40 cents to Fl 29.20 on fears that talks between Dasa of Germany and the Dutch government might break down when they resume today. Among multinationals Unilever lost Fl 2.40 to Fl 180.80 and Royal Dutch shed Fl 1.30 to Fl 145.80. BRUSSELS caught up with world markets after its two-day holiday, the Bel-20 Index falling 25.49 or 2.2 per cent to 1,145.35, its lowest level since January 14. Petrofina fell BFr200 or 1.8 per cent to BFr10,750. VIENNA fell back, in line with major bourses. The 18-share ATX index lost 8.76 to 803.95. Erste Allgemeine ordinaries fell Sch80 to Sch3,020, but preference shares rose Sch45 to Sch1,880 after the insurer reported improved 1991 profits. MADRID's general index fell 4.46 or 2 per cent to 216.10 as the market reacted negatively to the government's measures to reduce the budget deficit. In the construction sector FCC lost Pta500 to Pta6,300 and Cubiertas was Pta190 lower at Pta5,380. STOCKHOLM was driven lower by a wave of selling in the final 30 minutes. The Affarsvarlden index shed 9.0 to 851.1 as turnover remained low at Skr292m. OSLO's all-share index dropped 4.22 or 1.1 per cent to 373.89 in low turnover of NKr117.08m. Norsk Hydro lost NKr3 to NKr145 while Saga Petroleum A shares shed NKr2 to NKr61.5. ISTANBUL fell 1.3 per cent in trading which concentrated on minor shares. The 75-share index closed down 51.71 at 4,091.90.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- FT-SE EUROTRACK 100 - JUL 22  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Hourly changes  -----------------------------------------------------------------------    Open  10.30am    11 am    12 pm     1 pm     2 pm     3 pm    close 1065.85  1064.92  1064.28  1058.88  1058.08  1059.72  1059.80  1060.97  -----------------------------------------------------------------------            Day's High  1065.89    Day's Low  1057.34  -----------------------------------------------------------------------  Jul 21    Jul 20    Jul 17    Jul 16    Jul 15 1075.64   1064.04   1097.57   1120.48   1122.53  ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Base value 1000 (26/10/90).  -----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

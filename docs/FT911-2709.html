			<p>910427 FT  27 APR 91 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading THE LONDON derivative markets ended quietly with dealers still anticipating further falls in UK shares. Over the past week, the June FT-SE 100 index contract has fallen 72 points as the buyers who had driven the market higher during the first three weeks of April lost their appetite for shares. The futures market has consistently traded this week below the theoretical level which brokers estimate takes account of futures dividend payments and the cost of finance. With a bearish outlook for UK equities, the futures market has dragged the stock market lower. Yesterday, June FT-SE closed 11 points easier at 2,472. But it remained at a premium of just 19 points to the spot FT-SE index, compared with the 30 point fair value premium. The futures market initially attempted to move higher but with a scarcity of buyers the rally soon ran out of steam. The belief that Wall Street would open lower and disappointing US economic statistics pushed prices easier and the market closed just above the low of the day. In the traded options market, dealing was sluggish with just 17,900 contracts changing hands, against 28,409 in the previous day, which made it one of the quietest sessions so far this year.</p>

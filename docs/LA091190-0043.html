			<p><P> September 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> YOUR BODY: SOME 'ALLERGIC' TO STRESS-REDUCTION CLASSES  </P> <P> You're anxious and it's getting worse by the day. You snarl at other drivers,  slam doors at home, mutter mean things to co-workers. At last, you take charge  and enroll in a stress-reduction program. Finally, you can relax.  </P> <P> Or can you?  </P> <P> After just a few sessions of stress-reduction training, you feel more stressed  than ever. Worse yet, you are nervous because you don't seem to be getting the  knack of it as quickly as you'd hoped.  </P> <P> What you have now, according to one psychology expert, is relaxation-induced  anxiety, a paradoxical response some people suffer when they participate in  formal relaxation training.  </P> <P> "At least one in three persons will not find traditional relaxation techniques  especially helpful," said Arnold Lazarus, distinguished professor of psychology  at Rutgers University, who writes about the limitations of relaxation in the  current issue of the journal Psychotherapy.  </P> <P> "In essence, while many people derive benefits from the relaxation response,  some appear to be 'allergic' to it and for them, it is clearly  contraindicated," Lazarus wrote.  </P> <P> When clients react unfavorably to formal relaxation programs, Lazarus said,  they most often say they fear losing control.  </P> <P> Formal relaxation techniques aren't the answer for everyone, agrees a  Huntington Beach psychologist who directs a biofeedback center. Least likely to  derive benefits from the formal programs, said Ivy Walker Wittmeyer, are people  who need to be "in control," those who have had a bad psychological reaction to  anesthesia, those with a history of illegal drug use and "bad trips" and those  who have been sedated for mental health problems.  </P> <P> But Walker indicates that formal relaxation programs can work for most people,  given the proper instruction. "What people often don't understand is, they can  gain control by allowing themselves to lose control," Wittmeyer said. She talks  to patients at length to prove that "letting go" during biofeedback sessions  can ultimately help them gain control over stress and anxiety.  </P> <P> For those who still can't relax in formal relaxation programs, Lazarus suggests  finding a therapist who can tailor a program to their personality and needs. He  has developed a questionnaire for therapists to predict what forms of  relaxation work with which clients.  </P> <P> Turning to less traditional relaxation approaches can be the answer for others,  Lazarus said in an interview. A client who is very active might do better  running laps than learning biofeedback, for instance, he said. "Some people  find mini-relaxation is the answer -- simply closing their eyes several times a  day for two or three minutes," Lazarus said. He tells other clients to sit in a  bathtub with warm water for half an hour and read a magazine.  </P> <P> As for Lazarus' personal stress-reduction method? "I watch TV a heck of a lot,"  he said, "and I play tennis."  </P> <P> </P> <P> SHOPTALK  </P> <P> New Scale Talks You Down  </P> <P> Need a booster shot of motivation to lose those extra pounds? Maybe you need a  conscience like the Technasonics' new Weight Talker II, a $99 talking scale  with a volume control.  </P> <P> A man's voice tells you your weight, plus the amount gained or lost since the  last weigh-in, according to Kenneth Burnett, Technasonics' president. Even if  you've slipped, it tells you "Goodby" or "Have a nice day," whichever sign-off  you select. As many as five family members can store data in the Weight Talker  II, sold through Sears catalogue and other outlets.  </P> <P> Is it worth the price? Yes, with some caveats, according to Jody Lander  Spector, program coordinator of a weight loss program at St. Vincent Medical  Center, Los Angeles. "It does keep track for you. You don't have to remember  what you used to weigh. He just told you."  </P> <P> But Spector cautions people not to become obsessive about weigh-ins, whatever  scale they use. Weigh in weekly on the same day and at the same time, she  recommends. "And keep a written record. It helps."  </P> <P> </P> <P> POINT  </P></p>

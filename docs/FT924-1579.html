			<p>921217 FT  17 DEC 92 / Observer: Mugged Still on the subject of presents, the lull in new product launches in Britain's royal memorabilia market seems to have ended. One company, no doubt staffed by republicans, has produced a 'Windsor in Flames' commemorative mug. On one side is a picture of a burning Windsor castle, while the other has a cartoon of a monarch, plus corgis, living in a cardboard box on the Embankment and saying 'Can you spare us Pounds 60m, guv?' Rather surprisingly, the Guardian carried the advert but Time Out, the London listings magazine, rejected it. Bet that wouldn't have happened when it was being run by the previous bunch of lefties.</p>

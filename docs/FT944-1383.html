			<p>941220 FT  20 DEC 94 / Commodities and Agriculture: EIU says coffee may have peaked World coffee prices have probably peaked, provided there are no further crop surprises and the next Brazilian harvest turns out well above the gloomiest forecasts, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit. In its December outlook for food commodities, it predicts a 1995-96 crop of 17.5m bags, helped by the recent rains. This is 2.7m tonnes higher than the highest estimate from the Brazilian government in early November. The EIU sees the crop rising to 28m bags the following year. However, if this recovery is threatened, for example, by further frosts next year, prices could easily rise above Dollars 3 a pound, it says. This is because stocks at the end of the 1994-95 season are likely to be at their lowest for many years, especially in producing countries. The EIU sees the differential between robusta and mild arabica prices widening from about 17 per cent at present to average more than 20 per cent next year. It says robusta supplies should recover sharply thanks to a bumper crop expected in Indonesia in 1995-96 and big increases in the harvests this season in Ivory Coast, Vietnam and Thailand. After this year's sharp rise in sugar prices, the report predicts little change next year, and a decline to about 11 cents a pound, from a 1994 average of 11.9 cents, in early 1996. This is because of a probable swing from a third successive global deficit to a surplus of 1m tonnes in 1995-96. On grains, it expects record maize and soyabean crops in the US this year to push prices lower next year. It says export prices of US maize will hit their long-term floor, averaging about Dollars 9 a tonne less than in 1994 at Dollars 100 a tonne or just below. The US maize crop of up to 260m tonnes will push carry-over stocks to nearly 60m tonnes at the end of the season next August, compared with 22m tonnes a year earlier, says the EIU. But a stock drawdown is likely to help prices recover in the first half of 1996. Soyabean oil is forecast to fall to Dollars 559 a tonne by the third quarter of next year  - 8.5 per cent lower than the third quarter average for 1994  -based on world oilseed output reaching more than 189m tonnes in 1994-95, up nearly 11 per cent on the previous year. Wheat prices are expected to range between Dollars 150 and Dollars 160 a tonne until the middle of 1996, unless the US crop next year proves insufficient to rebuild depleted global stocks. In that event, the EIU predicts prices could go as high as Dollars 180 a tonne.</p>

			<p>930601 FT  01 JUN 93 / Spanish Elections: Gonzalez in late bid to snatch lead MR Felipe Gonzalez, the embattled Spanish prime minister, last night began a late comeback ahead of the June 6 general elections, with a spirited performance in a final television debate with his conservative challenger, Mr Jose Mara Aznar, leader of the Partido Popular (PP). Accusing his opponent of doing little more than 'solemnising the obvious' for repeatedly insisting that Spain needed to creat more jobs, Mr Gonzalez, for the first time, may have damaged Mr Aznar by playing successfully on his vagueness. Not once did Mr Aznar, constantly goaded by the prime minister, detail any policy plans should the PP win next Sunday. Mr Gonzalez also used the debate to reveal a drop of 40,000 people in the number of unemployed. The debate, which experts assume will have been decisive in moving, one way or the other, the support of up to 6m undecided voters, 20 per cent of the electorate, was ill-tempered. Mr Gonzalez accused Mr Aznar of falsely denying having accused him of being an international 'nuisance' when he was fighting for more European funds for Spain at the EC summit in Edinburgh last year. Mr Aznar accused the prime minister of lying by suggesting that PP tax policies would reduce pensions. He tried unsuccessfully to unsettle Mr Gonzalez throughout the debate by laughing at him. Nevertheless, Mr Gonzalez did not badly dent Mr Aznar, whose party is running ahead of the Socialists in opinion polls. What he did was remove the doubts about his desire to win a fourth term in office, which his weak performance in the first TV debate a week ago had raised. Nevertheless, with just five days to go before the election, Mr Gonzalez and the Socialists will have to come a long way from behind. Even the most favourable of opinion polls, published at the weekend and yesterday by the daily newspaper El Pas, shows the PP leading the Socialists by 34.8 per cent of the vote to 34.5 per cent. El Pas found that the Socialists, in power in Spain since 1982, had lost support in all of Spain's 52 voting districts or provinces. The poll suggested the PP would reverse Socialist victories in 1989 in the autonomous regions (which each include one or more province) of Valencia, Aragon, Madrid, Castilla la Mancha, the Canaries, the Balearics and Murcia. The Socialists would hold their majorities only in Andalucia and Extremadura in the poor south, where the government nurtures its support through a subsidy it pays to farmworkers between harvests. The threat to Mr Gonzalez is that, within each province, very small shifts can produce dramatic results in the number of seats each party wins. Spain's proportional representation system does not let voters choose names from all the lists of candidates presented by parties. Only one party can be voted for. That is important because, while the PP is clearly taking a lead over the Socialists as the most popular party, voters still prefer many Socialist leaders over the untried faces in the PP. Mr Gonzalez holds a big lead over Mr Aznar in personal polls. The undecided vote has never been so high so close to polling day in any previous election in Spain. Aznar interview, page 38</p>

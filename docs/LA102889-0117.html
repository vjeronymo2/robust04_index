			<p><P> October 28, 1989, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> MCMARTIN PROSECUTORS BEGIN FINAL ARGUMENTS  </P> <P> Prosecutors in the McMartin Pre-School molestation trial opened the final phase  of arguments to the jury Friday by accusing defense attorneys of intimidating  child witnesses during their cross-examination in an attempt to stifle the  truth.  </P> <P> Deputy Dist. Atty. Lael Rubin criticized defense attorney Danny Davis for  having asked children to describe in intimate detail how they were molested.  Rubin told of Davis asking one 12-year-old girl to demonstrate for jurors how  she had been assaulted by using her hands to represent a penis and a vagina.  </P> <P> "That's embarrassing (and) offensive," Rubin told jurors. "You should be  offended."  </P> <P> Rubin asked jurors to question the defense attorney's motives for such  questioning. "What was he doing?" Rubin asked. "Seeking the truth or trying to  embarrass (the witness). . . . And that's what the defense is counting on.  Eliminate, extinguish, annihilate the truth" through intimidating  cross-examination of the children, Rubin said.  </P> <P> The prosecution is expected to take three days to complete its closing  arguments.  </P> <P> After that, Superior Court Judge William Pounders will instruct the jury, which  will begin deliberations in the record-breaking trial. Pounders has said the  deliberations could take several months.  </P> <P> On Thursday, Davis completed his 5 1/2-day closing argument, in which he asked  jurors to acquit his client, former teacher Raymond Buckey, 31.  </P> <P> Co-defense counsel Dean Gits, who represents Buckey's mother, Peggy McMartin  Buckey, 62, argued for her acquittal last week.  </P> <P> Before the defense arguments, Rubin's co-prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger  Gunson, gave the first phase of the prosecution's final arguments.  </P> <P> The Buckeys, former teachers at the now-closed Virginia McMartin Pre-School in  Manhattan Beach, are on trial on one count of conspiracy and 64 counts of child  molestation in the alleged sexual abuse of 11 pupils from 1978 until 1983.  </P></p>

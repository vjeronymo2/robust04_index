			<p>940224 FT  24 FEB 94 / Arts: Eric Clapton - Pop music If it's February it must be Clapton at the Albert Hall. 'Old slow hand' has returned for the eighth successive year for a string of dates which have become as ritualistic as the Proms. The crowd stays the same - City types who jog embarrassingly out of time with the music; the songs are predictable, culminating in 'Layla', at which the committed believers rush to the front to make a Mass of it; and the man is unchangeable, as ordinary as his guitar playing is out of this world. Yet there are always subtle differences. This year Clapton is pared down to minimalist jeans and T-shirt, crew cut and glasses, to go with his current pre-occupation with the blues. He begins unplugged, static, and solo on a chair. Then as the blues roll the stage fills with musicians, obviously professionals because they are weighed down in black suits. Clapton indulges himself outrageously as he pours out the best of Elmore James, Howlin' Wolf and the rest of the sad bunch of travelling men. A good blues, like 'Hoochie coochie man', hits the spot, but there comes a point when you cannot take any more misery. Clapton tests the loyalty of his fans before relieving the gloom by bringing on the girls and the brass and letting go with 'White Room'. This is what the audience expected and lays back, in its turn, to be indulged. It was not to be; well, only fitfully. Clapton did go back to basics with an intimate 'Tears in Heaven', which now seems less maudlin and more heart felt, but then the blues got a grip again. In a way it matters little. Clapton is in staggering form as a guitarist. Just as you can be tone deaf and wonder at Stern on the violin or Horovitz on the piano, so Clapton's genius is transparent as his guitar speaks the sad music. There is a feeling that the Clapton concerts have become an event for those chasing the place to be rather than for the fans who have kept the faith since proclaiming Clapton as God in the 1960s. When he sings 'Wonderful Tonight' just one couple of romantics held aloft their lighters aflame. By his musical professionalism Eric Clapton has made the atmosphere at the Albert Hall no different from that conjured up by the most acclaimed classical maestro. It is a memorable experience, but it is not rock and roll.</p>

			<p>920224 FT  24 FEB 92 / UK News (Employment): Call for reduced working hours BRITAIN will become 'the treadmill of Europe' unless working hours are reduced in line with those proposed by the European Community, according to the Low Pay Unit, a research organisation. A report issued today by the unit examines the case for the proposed European directive on working time, further debate on which has been adjourned until later this year after British opposition to it at the Maastricht summit. According to European Commission research, men worked longer hours in Britain in 1988 than anywhere else in Europe. British men worked 45.5 hours a week compared with 41 hours in most other member states. Mr Chris Pond, director of the unit, said there was no reason to believe the figures had changed substantially since then, in spite of the recession. The latest UK research, in the 1991 New Earnings Survey, showed that a fifth of men in manual jobs and nearly 10 per cent of all men worked 48 hours or more a week. Fewer women worked similar hours - 5 per cent of those in manual jobs and 1 per cent of all women. The unit's report argues that there is a powerful case for improving basic rates of pay to reduce working hours without loss of earnings. It says: 'This would improve health and safety at work, raise productivity and generate employment as well as allowing people to enjoy family and social life.' It adds that German reductions in the working week made since 1984 have had a positive effect on the economy for various reasons, including improved flexible working.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [From the "News" program] </F>   [Text] ROC [Republic of China] representative to Singapore  Chen Yu-chu is scheduled to depart the city state on 26 April,  at which time he will head to Denmark to assume his new  diplomatic posting. Meanwhile, the newly appointed ROC  representative to Singapore, Chiu Chin-yi, will fly to Singapore  on 29 April to take up his new position. Chen is a senior  diplomat in the ROC foreign service. He has served in his post  in Singapore since May 1990. Over the past four years, many  changes have transpired in relations between the ROC on Taiwan  and Singapore. The most important change has been that  Singapore established formal diplomatic relations with Communist  China in August 1990. During his tenure, Chen has worked to  maintain substantive ties between the two countries, exhibited  in the increase in private exchanges between the two sides and  strengthened trade relations. Government officials from both  countries often commonly made calls to the other.</p>

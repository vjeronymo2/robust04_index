			<p>941125 FT  25 NOV 94 / Scottish housing transfer attacked The Commons public accounts committee yesterday criticised Scottish Homes for failing to secure the best price for more than 1,000 properties it sold to a housing trust in the Borders region. The cross-party committee of MPs attacked state-owned Scottish Homes for accepting, in 1992, a Pounds 5.8m bid from Waverley Housing, an independent trust, for the 1,191 houses, over a higher bid of Pounds 6.3m. The MPs also criticised Scottish Homes for failing to ensure proper competition in the sale and for awarding Waverley the contract to manage the houses. The management contract was awarded to Waverley, without competition, in February 1989, even though the trust had only been established two months earlier and an experienced housing association was also interested. The MPs expressed concern that no records were kept of six meetings in 1987 and 1988 between Scottish Office officials and individuals who later established Waverley, saying this was 'very unusual'. Waverley's management costs were more than double previous bills. Costs for managing 1,800 Borders houses had come to about Pounds 1.2m in three years before the contract was awarded to Waverley. But the bill then rose to Pounds 2.4m over three years for Waverley's management of only 1,300 homes.</p>

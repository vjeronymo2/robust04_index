			<p>BFN     [Text] Phnom Penh 1 Apr (AKP) -- Prince Norodom Sirivut,  deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs of the  Kingdom of Cambodia, has voiced his support for a statement by  the UN High Commissioner for Refugees [UNHCR] protesting against  the Thai Army's repatriation of Cambodian refugees to another  zone of the Khmer Rouge.    Actually, the prince asserted his endorsement of the UN  stance following his return from Thailand where he paid a  two-day visit at the invitation of Thai counterpart Prasong  Sunsiri.    UNHCR High Commissioner Mrs. Sadako Ogata, in a message to  the Thai diplomacy chief, expressed her anxiety over the  repatriation by the Thai Government of 25,000 Cambodian refugees  to another Khmer Rouge-held zone, instead of regions controlled  by the Royal Government of Cambodia.    The Khmer Royal Armed Forces on 19 March took control of  Pailin, the "capital" of the Khmer Rouge, prompting an influx of  25,000 Cambodian refugees, most of whom were Khmer Rouge  families, into Thai territory. Thailand has lately begun to  send those people back to a Khmer Rouge-held area at Phnum Malai  hill, 45 km north of Pailin.</p>

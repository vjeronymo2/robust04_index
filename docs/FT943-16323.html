			<p>940705 FT  05 JUL 94 / France seeks EU-wide curbs on British beef France has joined Germany in pressing for restrictions on British beef exports to the rest of the European Union, while Germany said yesterday it had won sympathy from the Benelux countries for its plan to impose a six-month ban on UK beef. The French agriculture ministry confirmed that Paris supported German efforts to prevent the spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, so-called 'mad cow disease', by imposing restrictions on imports of British beef. But officials emphasised that France was pressing for general action by the European Union and had no intention of imposing its own national restrictions. The agriculture ministry in Paris said: 'We have, together with Germany, presented proposals to the European Commission for limitations on British beef imports. But we do not plan to take action on a national basis.' Even so, French support for restrictions will cause concern in the UK. France last year imported Pounds 189m of Britain's total Pounds 407m of beef exports and is by far Britain's biggest foreign customer. Mrs Simone Veil, the French health minister, and Mr Jean Puech, agriculture minister, teamed up with their German counterparts - Mr Horst Seehofer and Mr Jochen Borchert - to send a joint letter on June 20 to the commission proposing restrictions on British beef. The French and Germans are now awaiting its response, which is expected to be delivered next Monday at a meeting of agriculture ministers in Brussels. The UK agriculture ministry said the French proposals would be discussed today by the BSE sub-group of the EU's scientific veterinary group. 'We have spoken to the French, and as far as we are aware they are not talking about banning anything,' the ministry said. The German health ministry said yesterday there were signs that Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg would also support Germany in its efforts to ban British beef which it fears may be affected by BSE. The ministry said France and the Benelux nations were the first to have 'open ears' for the warnings from Mr Seehofer about the dangers of contaminated beef. The German Bundesrat, or upper house, is to vote on Friday on the proposal for a six-month ban.</p>

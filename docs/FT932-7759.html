			<p>930521 FT  21 MAY 93 / International Company News: TCI to buy 49% of Televisa cable offshoot TELE-COMMUNICATIONS (TCI), the world's largest cable television operator, has agreed to buy 49 per cent of Cablevision, the cable subsidiary of Mexico's giant media company Grupo Televisa. As part of the deal, TCI and Televisa will set up a joint venture to develop cable and pay television in Latin America, including Brazil, the region's largest television market. The new company will benefit from TCI's advanced pay television technology and expand by forming joint ventures with or buying up existing Latin American cable companies, or starting new ones from scratch, Televisa said. Mr Fernando Diez Barrosa, Televisa's vice-chairman, said: 'Together, Grupo Televisa and TCI will build the Spanish and Portuguese-speaking world's ultimate pay television system for information and entertainment. We will deliver limitless product options on-demand into the living rooms of over 350m consumers where the growth of cable and pay television will be explosive.' Cablevision says it is the largest pay television company in Mexico, although its main rival, Multivision, also claims this title. Last year, Cablevision had 193,000 subscribers, with revenues of nearly Dollars 80m, up 40 per cent on 1991. Televisa is the biggest and most powerful media company in the Spanish-speaking world with revenues last year of Dollars 1.36bn. It has a near-monopoly in Mexico and stakes in television stations in the US, through Univision, the Spanish-speaking network, in Peru and Chile, and production agreements in Venezuela and Argentina. However, its dominance in Mexico will come under threat next month when the government privatises two state-owned channels. The favoured bidding group for the state channels includes the owner of Multivision. In the US, TCI serves 10.2m customers in 49 states. It also has investments in nine countries - including the UK franchise, Tele-West, in partnership with US West. The Denver-based company has more than 1m international subscribers, and other international joint venture arrangements have taken it into Israel, Sweden, Norway and New Zealand.</p>

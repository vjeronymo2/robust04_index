			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [By Bruce Gilley] </F>   [Text] The State Planning Commission [SPC] has warned that  millions of state enterprise workers close to retirement pose  the biggest threat to social stability in China.    In the commission's First Quarter Analysis and Second  Quarter  Outlook -- which has been handed over to the State Council --  analysts say frozen salaries at a time of high inflation and the  inadequacy of pensions will make newly retired workers "the most  unstable factor" in the country over the next one to two years.    "They face big problems. They will be retiring on low fixed  incomes with little in the way of pensions to support them," an  SPC official said.    The state sector employed 109 million people at the end of  1993, of which 20 to 30 percent are due to be retired because of  age or redundancy.    This means the target group includes between 22 and 33  million people.    An additional 20 percent of the workforce -- or 22 million  --  are already retired and living on low fixed incomes. The report  compares state enterprise workers -- who account for almost  three quarters of employment in urban areas -- to the middle  class in developed capitalist countries.    "Overall social stability depends on their situation," the  official said.    Average retirement pay for state sector workers now stands  at  about 130 renminbi (HK$115) per month, the SPC official said,  which put households that rely on such incomes in the category  of "encountering living difficulties".    The report blames the heavy tax burdens and lack of  competition in the state sector as the main cause of their  present sorry state.    In the first two months of this year, 40.7 percent of state  enterprises lost money.    The SPC report makes two suggestions: credit policies should  not be tightened any further and no big economic reforms should  be introduced over the next one to two years which might put  state enterprises in an even worse competitive position.</p>

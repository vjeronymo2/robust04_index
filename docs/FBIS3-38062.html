			<p>Language: <F P=105> Russian </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By ITAR-TASS correspondent Georgiy Shmelev] </F>   [Text] Moscow, 27 Feb -- Georgiy Mamedov, the deputy  foreign minister of the Russian Federation, is confident that  "the Ames case" will not affect the Russian-U.S. relations.    After the conclusion of a working visit to Latin American  countries, Georgiy Mamedov visited Washington where he was  holding negotiations on the situation around Sarajevo and  Russian-U.S. relations. Straight after his return to Moscow he  said in an interview to an ITAR-TASS correspondent that "they  touched on the question of 'the Ames case' but it is an  exaggeration to say that I was a special representative on this  matter." Georgiy Mamedov said that there is rather a big fuss  in the United States over this matter, but he believes that a  lot is unclear in this case -- Ames himself has not admitted to  being guilty.    Georgiy Mamedov said that it is difficult to explain why the  declaration of "the Ames case" has coincided in time with the  critical situation over Sarajevo and with the declaration of the  new initiative by Boris Yeltsin, the president of Russia.    The deputy minister noted that "we simply should calmly and  in a balanced way sort all that out."</p>

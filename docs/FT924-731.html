			<p>921222 FT  22 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: French seek US allies against Gatt WHILE THE US and European Community governments find themselves often locked in conflict over agriculture, a group of European farmers visiting in Washington last week described a relationship with many American farmers that was warm, supportive and united against farm trade reforms proposed in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 'We are on a journey to improve communication and understanding,' said Mr Michel Pierre of the France Confederation Paysanne. With farmers worldwide caught in a downward spiral of lower prices and growing bankruptcies, 'it is necessary to do something'. What they were doing mostly in the US was talking - on radio and television, to newspapers, congressmen and other farmers - about the need to reduce production worldwide, about the need to preserve rural life in Europe. Mr Alain Roux of the Federation des Producteurs de Lait gestured with a pat of butter to explain the justice of 'dumping' surplus products. 'We think the European consumer, when he pays for a piece of butter, he has to pay this level for the nutrient butter and the rest for maintaining rural society,' he said. 'But if this butter is sold to Africa, this part - maintaining rural life - it has not to be paid by Africa.' It was little noticed that when French farmers launched protests against the US-EC oilseeds deal, American farmers marched in their ranks. Members of the American National Family Farm Coalition last month also met in France with the newly formed SOS Paysans en Difficulties to help them organise suicide hotlines, credit counseling services and debt restructuring plans. The French farmers returned the visit last week, accompanied by one Dutch dairyman. After attending the annual meeting of the National Farm Coalition in Indianapolis, half the group was taken to visit farms in Vermont, and the other half to Kentucky. In both places they created a stir in media appearances. Their language was different, but from Des Moines to Dijon there seemed to be one unifying theme among hosts and guests alike: the free market was scorned as 'an illusion' and supply management schemes - involving production cuts to raise prices to a profitable level - were pronounced the solution to the industry's difficulties. Mr Arian Kamp, a 29-year-old dairyman who heads the Dutch Young Farmers' Union, said it was the educated young European farmers 'with good ideas about how to create better products' who were most at risk because they had had to buy farms at a time of declining food prices. 'Every continent - every group of countries - must be able to build up a kind of agriculture policy which makes possible that farmers within that area are able to get the cost of production so they are able to able to exist in rural life,' he said. 'We young farmers prefer supply management. We want decisions made in Gatt about the volume of production.' The international networking among farmers is likely to grow. Mr Mark Ritchie, who accompanied the French farmers, is organising a US chapter of the Farmers World Network, which promotes exchanges between farmers around the world. 'Our problems are increasingly global so the solutions must be global too,' said Mr Ritchie. 'We will have to consider the interests of the whole planet, if we want to solve problems at home.'</p>

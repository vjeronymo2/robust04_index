			<p><P> September 29, 1990, Saturday, Southland Edition  </P> <P> NATION IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> ILLINOIS;  </P> <P> VIOLENCE'S EFFECT ON CHILDREN DETAILED  </P> <P> A study has found 74% of Chicago's inner-city children have witnessed a  slaying, shooting, stabbing or robbery, and experts worry about the impact such  violence has on youngsters' mental health.  </P> <P> "People think if they're chronically exposed to this kind of violence kids  adapt to it," said Dr. Carl Bell, a psychiatrist at the University of Illinois  School of Medicine. "But they're wrong. If children who witness crimes appear  withdrawn or silent, it's a symptom of the damage. They just shut off." Bell  heads the Community Mental Health Council, which conducted the study.  </P></p>

			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / MPs' aerospace appeal rebuffed The government yesterday rejected calls from the all-party Commons trade and industry committee for a detailed policy framework on the UK aerospace industry. Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, said: 'We do not believe that any reliable or precise estimates can be made about the levels of research and technology (in the British aerospace industry).' Government officials likened the committee's recommendation for a detailed framework governing decisions on aerospace as akin to a five-year plan which would be unworkable and unpractical. But Mr Derek Flatchett, Labour's industry spokesman, said the committee had rightly identified a role for government. 'We need a new strategic view and vision of the partnership between industry and government,' he said. The committee warned that the industry could suffer 'irreversible damage' without more government support and was falling victim to heavily subsidised competitors from other countries. Mr Sainsbury said the government would act 'within international rules' to challenge the subsidies offered to Britain's competitors. He added, however, that the current support was the envy of many other industries. Mr Richard Caborn, the committee's Labour chairman, called on the government to multiply aid five-fold to Pounds 100m.</p>

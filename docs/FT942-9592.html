			<p>940514 FT  14 MAY 94 / Markets: Jittery traders hang on the Fed's next move - Wall Street Is relief for the beleaguered US financial markets just around the corner? Few on Wall Street are willing to make such a firm prediction. But if this week's positive inflation data is followed next week by a well-timed policy tightening from the Federal Reserve, a floor for US stock and bond prices could be established that provides the foundation for a calmer, if somewhat less exciting, summer's trading. The April inflation numbers may turn out to be the key. On Thursday, Wall Street's analysts were expecting to hear that the producer price index had risen 0.2 per last month. Instead, they were told that the PPI fell in April by 0.1 per cent. Even excluding the unpredictable food and energy components, so-called 'core' producer prices rose by only 0.1 per cent, a figure that was also below expectations. Then, yesterday, analysts were looking for a rise of 0.3 per cent in the April consumer price index. They were surprised to find that the CPI advanced by only 0.1 per cent last month, while core consumer prices also rose by less than forecast. Taken together, the April inflation data could barely have been more encouraging for stock and bond investors worried that the inflationary fires were being fanned by the strengthening economy. Understandably, the markets reacted positively at first to the inflation news, with the benchmark 30-year bond rallying 1.5 points on Thursday morning - a move which lowered the yield on the issue to under 7.5 per cent and provided a firm boost to share prices. But the warm glow faded quickly and, by yesterday morning, both stocks and bonds were flat in spite of the promising CPI release. Markets failed to build on Thursday's gains because, once the inflation data was out of the way, investors turned their thoughts quickly to monetary policy and what the Fed's policy-making open market committee (FOMC) might decide at its next meeting on Tuesday. Wall Street knows what it would like the FOMC to do: put up interest rates one more time as a precautionary move against inflation. The federal funds' rate - the interest level at which banks lend money to each other overnight  -is now 3.75 per cent but the markets would like the Fed to raise it to at least 4 per cent, perhaps even 4.25. At the same time, it would be well received if the Fed also decided to raise the more important discount rate - the rate at which it lends money to the banks. During the recent round of monetary policy tightenings, the discount rate has remained at 3 per cent, but Wall Street now would like to see it at 3.5. If (and it is not that big an 'if' judging by all the comments and whispers coming out of the Fed lately), interest rates are raised on Tuesday or soon after, then the bond market - mindful of the recent encouraging PPI and CPI figures - might finally be persuaded to drop its inflation obsession, and the apparently inexorable climb in long-term interest rates could be halted at 7.5 per cent. After a suitable period of consolidation, long-term bond yields might then start slowly coming down again. Lower bond yields would help to restore the stock market's confidence, and a floor for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has fallen 9 per cent since the Fed started raising rates in February, could be established at around 3,600. Investors would then start to believe that the Fed had completed its round of tightenings and that the 'correction' in financial markets was over. There is one flaw in this rosy picture, however - the possibility that the Fed will raise rates next week, but not by enough to appease the bond market. A quarter of a percentage point increase in the federal funds and the discount rates would not be enough to satisfy bond market investors; and if the Fed chooses to leave the discount rate alone, it could be a potential disaster, with prices tumbling and long rates soaring as investors express their doubts about the central bank's anti-inflation resolve. The possibility that the Fed will raise rates by only 25 basis points is a real one because, until the Bundesbank cut German interest rates on Wednesday, almost everyone believed US rates would have to go up by 50 basis points to slow down the economy and support a very weak dollar. But, in terms of helping the dollar, the German rate cut might have done the Fed's work for it. If US policy-makers feel that an increase of 25 basis points is all that is needed to keep the lid on domestic inflationary pressures, there could be more trouble, not relief, around the corner for Wall Street.  ----------------------------- Monday       3629.04 - 40.46 Tuesday      3656.41 + 27.37 Wednesday    3629.04 - 27.37 Thursday     3652.84 + 23.80 Friday       3659.68 +  6.84  -----------------------------</p>

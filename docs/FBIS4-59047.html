			<p>BFN     [Text] O masses of our lofty Yemeni people everywhere: The  rotten clique is perpetrating its evil scheme against our people  and their brave Armed Forces. This clique aims at destroying  the homeland and wasting its resources. The separatist gang --  which is rebelling against constitutional legitimacy, led by the  butcher, who is immersed in the blood of conspiracies against  our people, the so-called 'Ali Salim al-Bid, and his clique --  is retaliating against Yemeni unity, your greatest achievement  in the contemporary age. It is firing its missiles and shells  on your historical and political capital, Sanaa, in order to  annihilate its peaceful people.    It is not strange to see this gang, which killed and  displaced thousands of Yemeni people in the black events of  January 1986, seeking alliance with all devils and losing all  sense of nationalism.    The sons of your brave Armed Forces are now waging the most  honorable battle to purge the country of their filth. We will  soon announce to you the crushing of the forces of apostasy,  which reneged faith in God while raising the slogan of Communist  ideology.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] A special-assignment reconnaissance unit, which has  been considered the vanguard unit of the FAR [Revolutionary  Armed Forces] seven consecutive times, is a true example of the  stability and strength of the Central Army, which is celebrating  the 33d anniversary of its founding today.    [Begin recording] [Unidentified parachutist] I do not  believe  a parachutist is an amateur. A parachutist is a man capable of  overcoming the fear that any man feels when he suddenly finds  himself at a very high altitude, looks down, and realizes he is  far from the earth.    [Second parachutist] It is not easy. When I was up in the  sky, I looked down and things looked so small to me. That is the  impression I had of things below. [end recording]    Although they may not admit it, they are surely exceptional  men. This special unit has carried out two internationalist  missions and is the best of its kind among the three Armies.    [Begin unidentified speaker recording, in progress] ...which  we use to reach the enemy's rearguard and the area we want; that  is, to carry out a reconoissance mission against the enemy.    This unit receives strong, overall special training, which  includes physical training, target practice, tactics, and other  aspects that make up the daily life of the troops. [end  recording]    Skill, power, and diversity are the characteristics of these  anonymous men, examples of willingness and commitment.    [Begin recording] [Reporter] What are the main objectives?    [Unidentified officer] Obviously, our main objectives are to  maintain this condition and to remain the best unit of its kind  within the FAR in the training being carried out. To achieve  this, we are going to fulfill the seven major working guidelines  of our Army, and thus, of our unit. [end recording]</p>

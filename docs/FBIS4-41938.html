			<p>BFN     [Text] Yerevan, June 28 (SNARK) -- Armenia is the only  country in CIS where the growth of basic economic indicators is  observed. According to the State Statistical Administration data  published in Yerevan today, the produced national income during  the five months of this year has increased as compared to the  corresponding period last year by 7.5 percent and the volume of  industrial output grew by 12 percent.    At the same time, say specialists, such a growth indicates  only insignificant improvement in the state of economy where a  steep slump was observed in 1992-93.    Due to the permanent blockade of communications and  insolvency, Armenia, still experiences a shortage of raw  materials and electricity and the life level of the republic  continues to remain the lowest among the CIS countries.</p>

			<p>920711 FT  11 JUL 92 / Food: The pea, one of life's little luxuries - Cookery ONCE UPON a time there were fresh garden peas and dried field peas. Fresh peas were a fleeting summer treat, sweet and tender with a hint of asparagus flavour, one of life's little luxuries. Catherine de Medici is credited with introducing them to the French court. Louis XIV loved them. So did King George III; patriotic British gardeners traditionally strove to have the first of the crop ready by June 4, his birthday. Dried peas, yellow and mealy, brought solid winter comfort to commoners  - think of mushy peas, pease pudding and foggily thick pea soup. Monarchs made use of dried peas too, occasionally slipping one under a pile of feather mattresses to test whether princesses had the capacity to be truly royal. Then the frozen food fairy waved her wand and fresh and dried peas all but vanished. Greengrocers and supermarkets were invaded by millions of polythene-bagged, seasonless, greener-than-real-life-green frozen peas. Tender and sweet, oh yes, but bland and characterless. Just occasionally hopes were raised by news that so-called fresh peas might be found on sale, but what a disappointment they turned out to be: ungraded bullets in yellowing pods as coarsely webbed as army belts. After years of pea deprivation, a couple of years ago I spotted some peas from Egypt in a local supermarket. They looked juicy and fresh and tasted as garden peas should. Manna from heaven. This summer the news is even better. English garden peas have returned to our shops. For two or three weeks now I have bought them and found them a delight - food for proper summer celebrations, to serve with other seasonal delicacies such as sea trout and lamb, and to enjoy on their own. PENNE WITH PEAS (serves 4-6) Pasta and vegetables play an equal role in this dish which can be served as a substantial first course or as a light main course. A somewhat similar dish of peas (minus the pasta) is served at the Ristorante Sozzani in Sondrio, capital of Valtellina in northern Lombardy, where it successfully partners osso bucco in lieu of the more usual risotto milanese. 12 oz pasta quills or shell shapes; 1 lb peas (shelled weight - in other words you will need about 3 lb peas in the pod); half a dozen or so outer leaves taken from a Cos lettuce; 1 large onion; 2 1/2 oz butter or melted bacon fat; about  3/4 pt light stock or water; a few tablespoons of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Chop the onion finely. Warm the fat and stew the onion gently in a covered pan for a few minutes. Add the peas, stir briefly and pour on enough liquid to immerse them completely. Half-cover and cook for 25-30 minutes until the peas are so creamily tender that they are easily crushed between finger and thumb. Shred the lettuce finely and add it to the pan after the first 15 minutes. Push it well down into the pan so it wilts quickly. Towards the end, season the peas with plenty of coarsely ground black pepper, some salt, and a pinch of sugar maybe. When they are ready, the vegetables should be moistened by, rather than swimming in, a little well flavoured syrupy sauce. Remove the pan lid to drive off surplus liquid if necessary, or add a splash more water and cover tightly if the juices evaporate too fast. Boil the pasta and drain it quickly. Add it to the peas and sprinkle on a little Parmesan. Toss to mix well and serve straight away. PEAPOD SOUP (serves 4-6) There is something very pleasing about making use of foods that might otherwise go to waste. Blackcurrant leaf sorbet and this delicate green soup are especially delicious examples of such frugal cookery - but the soup is only worth making with fleshy green pods fresh enough to snap juicily. 1 1/2 lb peapods; a small handful of young peas (optional); half a dozen spring onions; a little lemon juice and sugar; a few sprigs of mint; about 2 pt water or light stock;  1/4 pt cream. Put the well-washed pods into a soup pan with a sprig of mint, the chopped spring onions and half a teaspoon of sugar. Pour on 1 1/2 pt water (the water saved from cooking asparagus is ideal) or light stock. Cover tightly and simmer for 45 minutes, crushing the pods down into the liquid with a potato masher every now and again. Set the covered pan aside for half an hour. Then strain off the liquid and cook the peas in it. Meanwhile whizz the pods to a puree in a food processor and sieve carefully to separate fibre from tender green pulp. Stir the contents of the pea pan into the pulp. Add the cream, season with lemon juice, salt, pepper and sugar, and thin with  1/2 pint or so cold water or stock to taste. Chill well and serve in soup cups or plates, each garnished with a single mint leaf.</p>

Basta,  indirectly confirmed the suspicion that the post-November secret  service fabricated compromising material against journalists  critical of current officials.    "Using the same methods, you are arriving at the same  conclusions as I have. Of course, I cannot speak about things  that are still considered state secrets." This is how Basta  answered a RUDE PRAVO question in connection with the RUDE PRAVO  article of 15 January that discloses suspicion that the secret  service fabricated compromising material against troublesome  journalists that it could use in case of need.    "I would be only too happy if some matters could be  completely clarified. This can apply, for instance, to a  certain Security Information Service [BIS] or Interior  Ministry's disposition toward such sensitive issues as the  freedom of the press," Basta said at the CSSD news conference on  Friday. Afterward, he told RUDE PRAVO that he was thinking of  cases of press and public opinion manipulation by the Interior  Ministry.    According to him, other methods were also used to influence  journalists. As Basta said, "obviously, all means available to  the secret service were used to this purpose. This includes,  for instance, the establishment of an opinion-making instrument,  which can be established by simply providing exclusive  information regardless of the degree of their secrecy to certain  journalists. If we glance through RESPEKT magazine since 1990,  and possibly some other papers of a similar orientation,  precisely from the point of view of the publishing of classified  information, we will find at least four infractions or even  crimes against the law on state secrets," Basta told RUDE PRAVO.  According to him, the matter of the list of alleged State  Security [StB] agents in the Syndicate of Journalists also  merits an investigation. The list was prepared by the FIS in  1992, but the thing is, nobody was interested in how the  diskette with the list of Syndicate members got into the hands  of the FIS agents, Basta observed.</p>

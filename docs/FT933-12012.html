			<p>930727 FT  27 JUL 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister rejects claims of regional aid 'bribes' MR TIM SAINSBURY, industry minister, yesterday rejected Labour allegations that political gerrymandering had determined changes in the areas qualifying for regional aid. He told the Commons the new assisted areas map announced on Friday ensured that help would be concentrated on areas with the most problems. Mr Sainsbury said that the changes made to the previous map drawn up in 1984 reflected the fact that unemployment had fallen in the north and north-west while it had risen in London, the south-east and south-west. Mr Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, accused the government of indulging in 'pork-barrel politics' and Mr Bob Cryer (Lab Bradford South) said that the new map reflected attempts to 'bribe' Tory MPs opposed to the Maastricht treaty. Mr Gerald Kaufman (Lab Manchester Gorton) complained that his constituency would get 'no help at all' while Sutton Coldfield, represented by Sir Norman Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, with less unemployment, was among the beneficiaries. Sir Teddy Taylor (C Southend East), a leading opponent of the Maastricht treaty, protested that a decision by the European Commission had resulted in Southend being excluded at what Mr Paul Channon (C Southend West) described as 'the very last minute'. Mr Sainsbury confirmed the commission had cut the overall coverage of assisted area status, but stressed that the UK had not suffered as much as Germany, which had been subjected to a 2 per cent reduction. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, said that aid was being provided for new areas by taking away help from other areas which still needed support.</p>

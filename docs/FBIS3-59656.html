Today, the Railway Technical Research Institute in  partnership with Tokai Passenger Railway Co. (JR Tokai) and the  Japan Railway Construction Corporation are gaining the  cooperation of Yamanashi Prefecture and are proceeding with  full-scale construction.  <H5>  Construction Status </H5>   The three business partners and Yamanashi Prefecture  sponsored a series of local informational meetings in a total of  18 districts in the six cities and towns (Sakagawa-mura,  Yatsushiro-cho, Misaka-cho, Ootsuki-shi, Tsuru-shi,  Akiyama-mura) situated along the Yamanashi test track.  Explanations on the environment, safety, and compensation for  the land required were repeated over 300 times. These efforts  were linked to results, advanced the securing of approval for  site entry in all the districts by the end of September 1992,  and made possible construction of the 42.8 km test track.    Today, site negotiations are under way in the districts  where  surveying has been completed. With local understanding and  cooperation, we closed contracts for site acquisition in the  zone from Misakayama to Tsuru-shi and Ootsuki-shi on the eastern  side. In addition, we are commissioning construction in the  tunnel zone in the nine sites that cross both cities. With the  exception of one site, excavation work is beginning. In cleared  zones as well, construction preparations are continuing for  facilities like car bases.    This civil engineering work is being performed under the  auspices of JR Tokai and the Railway Corporation.       -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Commissioned Tunnels     |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |Tunnel Name              |Length and Contractor    |Notes                    |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(1) Sasako Tunnel        |5,760 m                  |Excavation divided into 3|  |                         |                         | sites (west, central, e-|  |                         |                         |ast)                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Ootsuki-shi)            |Railway Corp.            |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(2) Hatsukari Tunnel     |460 m                    |Preparing for excavation |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Ootsuki-shi)            |Railway Corp.            |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(3) Takagawa Tunnel      |3,940 m                  |Excavation divided into 2|  |                         |                         | sites (west and east)   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Ootsuki-shi and Tsuru-s-|Railway Corp.            |                         |  |hi)                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(4) Kuki Tunnel          |3,930 m                  |Excavation divided into 2|  |                         |                         | sites (west and east)   |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Tsuru-shi and Ootsuki-s-|JR Tokai                 |                         |  |hi)                      |                         |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(5) Asahi Tunnel         |1,790 m                  |Excavation from starting |  |                         |                         |side                     |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  |(Tsuru-shi)              |JR Tokai                 |                         |  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------    <H5>  Tests To Be Performed at the Yamanashi Test Track </H5>   In order to reach the goal of the realization of a practical  maglev railway at the Yamanashi test track, the following items  will be verified through testing.    (1) Verification of safety and comfort at a steady, fast  speed of 500 km/h    (2) Verification of reliability and durability of the  superconducting magnets, the cars, the ground facilities, and  the equipment    (3) Verification of structural standards like the minimum  track radius (R = 8000 m) and the steepest grade (40&percnt;)    (4) Verification of required spacing (5.8 m) between the  track centers for passing    (5) Verification of car's performance with respect to the  tunnel's cross-sectional area and changes in pressure inside the  tunnel    (6) Verification of performance of the branching equipment    (7) Verification of environmental soundness    (8) Establishment of a control system for multiple trains    (9) Verification of the operating maintenance system and the  maintenance standards    (10) Verification of the control system between transformer  substations    (11) Pursuing economy and understanding construction and  business costs  <H5>  Test Track Facilities </H5>   Base facilities have been provided, for example, the command  center that plays a central role during the running tests, the  power transformer substations that supply power at variable  voltages and variable frequencies in the surface propulsion  coils, the car lot for storing low noise two-car trains that are  low noise trains with little running resistance, and test  platforms.    On lines with multiple tracks in the same direction, the GTO  inverter that is used as the power transformer has 38 MVA per  system (3 units set up for triple power). The propulsion coils  running along the guideway carry a voltage of 22 kV. During the  initial planning period, the GTO inverter was a 20 MVA class  inverter and the voltage of the propulsion coils was 11 kV. But  as plans to develop larger capacity and higher voltages  proceeded, equipment closer to commercial standards was set up  and used in the running tests.    The progress of test track construction was described  earlier  and the initial plan is about one year behind schedule. As a  result, based on the initial objective of beginning tests when  construction ends, the 18.4 km zone from Sasaki in Ootuki-shi  (Koufu side) to Asahisoshi in Tsuru-shi (Tokyo side) is given  precedence as a priority construction zone. This zone is  included in the base facility described earlier.    Running tests will begin at the end of 1994, a year later  than scheduled in the initial plan. But the advantage is fast  acceleration traveling that is designed in the improved  standards for the facilities explained earlier can be  established. Except for the final verification of stability and  durability when the train is running, the essential goal of  implementation in mid-1997 stands. Outside the priority  construction zone, consultations on the land required are being  actively pursued.  <H5>  Conclusion </H5>   Tunnel excavation work and equipment design and manufacture  have been in progress since 1991. The project team composed of  the Railway Technical Research Institute, JR Tokai, and the  Railway Corporation plans to proceed with construction on the  Yamanashi test track and further technical development.  Therefore, basic systems, facility specifications, and test  plans will be advanced substantially.    Although the acquisition of required land was delayed by one  year, to avoid hindering the Basic Technology Development  Project and the Yamanashi Test Track Construction Project, I  would like to focus our best efforts and move forward in  realizing the plan.</p>

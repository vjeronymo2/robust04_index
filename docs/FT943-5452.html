			<p>940903 FT  03 SEP 94 / Finance and the Family: Footie lags as London markets rise  -At a glance All sections of the London market have performed strongly over the past quarter, but the FT-SE 100 index, which includes the largest companies, is trailing its smaller rivals. When the US Federal Reserve raised its key interest rates in February the first UK equity sector to fall was the FT-SE 100 as institutions, whose principal equity holdings are in the main index, sold heavily. The gap between the Footsie and the smaller indices widened while the gap between the second and third-line indices (the mid 250 and the small cap) only grew towards the end of the sell-off. In the past quarter all sectors have recovered sharply.</p>

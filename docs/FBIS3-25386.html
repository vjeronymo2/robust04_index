The union leader said the  10,500 workers wanted a 12.5 percent increase which a labor  relations tribunal has said must be dated back to July 1992.  Many services were not available because of today's strike but  senior staff were maintaining essential operations. The  corporation said the strike was illegal and the workers risked  losing their jobs. The corporation has appealed to the Supreme  Court against the ruling by the labor relations tribunal.</p>

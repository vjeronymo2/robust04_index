			<p>920227 FT  27 FEB 92 / International Capital Markets: Profits at Towngas surge by 20% to HKDollars 778.7m HONGKONG and China Gas, the monopoly supplier of piped gas to the colony, yesterday announced a 20 per cent rise in 1991 net earnings to HKDollars 778.7m (USDollars 110.5m), against HKDollars 648.2m in 1990. Turnover for the company, better know as Towngas, rose 19 per cent to HKDollars 2.65bn from HKDollars 2.22bn. Towngas has been steadily building its customer base, especially in the New Territories, with about 70,000 added to the network last year, raising the total to 829,292. The company also declared a one-for-five bonus share issue, and announced an allocation of warrants to shareholders on a one-for-10 basis. The warrants give shareholders the right to convert into shares at a price of HKDollars 13.30 between June this year and June 1994. This compares with a share price of HKDollars 13.80 at yesterday's close. Mr Lee Shau-kee, chairman, forecast continued progress during 1992, with sales climbing another 10 per cent and the addition of 70,000 customers to the Towngas network. The directors, who expect a strong year ahead, recommended a final dividend of 21 cents a share which, with the interim dividend of 12 cents, makes a total for the year of 33 cents.</p>

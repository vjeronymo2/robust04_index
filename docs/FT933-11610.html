			<p>930728 FT  28 JUL 93 / World Stock Markets: Falling money market rates lift Lisbon stocks - Liquidity is driving Portugal After a shaky start to the year when Lisbon's Banco Totta e Acores (BTA) index hovered around the 1,700 mark, share prices have rocketed. From a low of 1,707 in mid-May, the index broke through the 2,000 level in June, finishing at 2,186 yesterday. Since the beginning of the year, the BTA index has climbed 34 per cent, a record bettered only by Turkey. The key to this outstanding rise is money market interest rates, which have fallen sharply, pushing up liquidity and making equities more attractive than other securities. 'What is happening here is very similar to events last year in the US and Europe, when liquidity became the driving force behind markets as interest rates came down,' says Mr Joao Oliveira Rendeiro, managing director of fund managers Gestifundo. 'This has been particularly true of the last couple of weeks of fast price rises.' Money market rates in Portugal have fallen recently from 17 per cent to around 10 to 11 per cent. The result has been to create a great pool of liquidity in the market and divert investors away from bonds and other securities and into equities. Short-term economic fundamentals in Portugal are not bright as the country is sucked into the international recession. But Mr Rendeiro believes that investors are looking ahead to what he sees as the growth years of 1994 and 1995. Most of the share market movement is currently being directed by foreign investors who play a dominant role in the Portuguese market. But analysts are encouraged by what they see as a surge in investment by domestic companies as well. For these reasons, market operators are confident that the outlook for continued price and volume growth in equities, though it is bound to slow, remains bright. The sectors that are faring well fall mainly into the infrastructure bracket. Portugal will benefit from a high level of EC transfers over the next five to six years that will provide a high level of business to constructors and other infrastructure-related sectors. More than sectors, it is individual companies that stand out for their performance. Companies related to the Sonae group, based on distribution and wood products, are faring well, for example. Other distribution companies are also outshining other sectors. The Portuguese market has now had time to digest the 'big bang' of operating and regulatory reforms (the Sapateiro law) which was introduced in September 1991. The operational changes have been successful, with continuous trading in a national market, a private telephone network to facilitate dealing and a computerised national stock registration house. But dealers find the regulatory side of countless rules and articles on insider dealing, takeovers and mergers, share manipulation and disclosure bureaucratic. 'The Sapateiro law is an enormously bureaucratic book of regulations that makes the red tape costs of being listed among the biggest a company faces,' says Mrs Helen Gray de Castro, chair of Papelaria Fernandes and a board member of the parent paper company, Inapa. 'To put the Portuguese market in perspective you have to realise that it is thin, superficial and highly bureaucratic,' she adds. Many market operators are also unhappy about new reforms the Finance Ministry is planning that will make it easier to take over a company without having to buy 100 per cent of the capital. The current limit of ownership before a shareholder must launch a bid is 50 per cent. The government wants to make this 50 per cent excluding indirect holdings. Brokers feel this would make it too easy to take over a company without having to make a bid for all the stock - by buying, for example, 30 per cent of directly owned capital and 30 per cent of indirectly owned capital. 'The government has suffered a lot of negative feedback over this measure,' says Mr Rendeiro, 'that I feel sure they will withdraw it.'</p>

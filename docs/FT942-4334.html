			<p>940610 FT  10 JUN 94 / Leadership Contest: Cunningham pulls out and backs Blair Mr Jack Cunningham yesterday withdrew from Labour's leadership battle and threw his weight behind Mr Tony Blair, virtually guaranteeing a three-cornered fight when the contest begins today. Mr Blair, shadow home secretary and the party's leading moderniser, is the hot favourite to succeed John Smith. He will be joined on the hustings by Mrs Margaret Beckett, the acting leader, and Mr John Prescott, the traditionalist shadow employment secretary. Mrs Beckett will also stand for re-election as deputy leader, the post she has held since 1992. Mr Prescott will decide at a 9am meeting with close friends whether he should also contest the deputy's post. The only remaining uncertainty surrounds the position of Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, who is likely to decide against running for either post. Mr Cook is expected to throw his weight behind Mr Blair. Mr Blair will formally declare his candidacy at a constituency meeting in Sedgefield on Saturday. He is regarded as certain to win, following the withdrawal last week of Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor. Mr Cunningham, shadow foreign secretary, was regarded as a rank outsider. He said he had received 'a large amount of encouragement and support', but it was in Labour's interests for Mr Blair to win. 'I would urge all those who offered me their support to vote for him, and I shall do everything I can to ensure his success,' he said. The extreme left is unlikely to nominate a candidate because of divisions within the Campaign group, the main leftwing forum. However, Mr Ken Livingstone, who made an unsuccessful attempt to win the leadership in 1992, signalled that the left will seek to limit Mr Blair's room for manoeuvre. In a letter to Mr Blair, Mr Livingstone demanded a clear commitment to full employment, and claimed there was 'widespread dissatisfaction with the cautious and orthodox economic approach' of Mr Brown. 'You may feel that this letter is an attempt to pin you down,' Mr Livingstone wrote to Mr Blair. 'That is correct. No politician has the right to ask the Labour party or the British people for a blank cheque. Those who seek to govern must go beyond sound-bites and photo-opportunities.' Mr Blair's friends have welcomed the prospect of a contest which they believe will allow him to lay the groundwork for a successful campaign to win the next general election. Officials believe that the party's high opinion poll standing is due in part to media coverage of the phoney leadership campaign over the past few weeks. Mr Prescott will focus his campaign on the strength of Labour's commitment to full employment, combined with the promise of a return to traditional socialist values. Mrs Beckett, who has moved substantially to the right as deputy leader, will cover some of the same ground. She will also present herself as the candidate offering the best organisational ability and continuity with Mr Smith's leadership.</p>

			<p>931001 FT  01 OCT 93 / Death toll in Indian quake climbs to 10,000 NEARLY 100,000 army and police personnel were deployed in rescue operations yesterday after an earthquake rocked the Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, killing 10,000 people and injuring at least that many, according to Indian television. Some reports put the death toll as high as 16,000. Thousands are feared trapped under the debris of their homes. The earthquake, measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale, hit an area seldom affected by severe seismological disturbances. Its epicentre was in the border region of Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, but the impact was felt over a vast area covering six other states. The quake was followed by six milder aftershocks. In the cities of Bombay and Hyderabad, people rushed from their homes in the pre-dawn darkness. The populations of entire villages in the economically backward rural districts of Osmanabad and Latur in western Maharashtra were wiped out when villagers were crushed under their mud and brick huts as they slept. The area is drought-prone but small farmers, growing mostly millet, had a good monsoon season this year. Although the worst-hit areas are too poor to have an effect on the country's economy, disruption may affect the sugar cane and industrial belt of Ahmednagar district. Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma appealed to voluntary organisations to help in the government's relief efforts for what is Maharashtra's worst-ever disaster, and the world's fourth-worst earthquake in the past decade. Neighbouring Pakistan, with which India has fought three wars since independence in 1947, offered to send help. Acting President Wasim Sajjad and Mr Moeen Qureshi, caretaker prime minister, sent messages to their Indian counterparts to express sympathy. Western aid agencies were yesterday launching relief appeals The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies sent Dollars 66,000 (Pounds 42,857) in emergency funds and Christian Aid Pounds 50,000. Medical and food supplies in the region were said to be short. Mr P V Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, pledged Rs20m (Pounds 420,000) from a government relief fund. A crisis management group under the chairmanship of Mr Zafar Saifullah, the cabinet secretary, met in New Delhi to co-ordinate relief work. Mr Rao said he would visit the area as soon as he was certain his presence did not impede relief operations. India's last big earthquake was in the hills of Uttarkashi in the north on October 20 1991, when 1,500 people died. The worst earthquake on record in the subcontinent was in 1935, killing 30,000 in Quetta, in present-day Pakistan.</p>

			<p>930410 FT  10 APR 93 / International Company News: Societe Generale flat at FFr3.27bn for year SOCIETE Generale held its profits last year at a net FFr3.27bn (Dollars 598m), down slightly on the previous year's FFr3.37bn, after avoiding the losses incurred by many other French banks more heavily involved in property. Its relative prudence in property meant it had to increase its provisions by only 11.2 per cent to FFr6bn, compared with the far larger precautions which have depressed the 1992 results of many other French banks. The bank is maintaining its dividend at FFr15 a share. But both as a reward to loyal shareholders and as protection against a possible future takeover, it has decided to give any investor holding shares registered for a period of two years - backdated to January 1 this year - double voting rights. Mr Marc Vienot, president, said 'the move does not reflect any particular danger. But you never know what will happen in the future, and it is better to take precautions in a period of calm.' Societe Generale was the subject of a spectacular takeover attempt in 1988, encouraged by the then Socialist government. Nearly 40 per cent of the bank is owned by French institutional and industrial investors, some of whom will be privatised by the new Balladur government. Mr Vienot said the bank might take a share in one of its traditional industrial partners such as Rhone-Poulenc, but would refrain from doing so in state-owned bank rivals.</p>

			<p><P> April 4, 1990, Wednesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> MURDER-SUICIDE SUSPECTED IN LIGHT PLANE CRASH  </P> <P> Police said today that a plane crash that killed two people earlier this week  may have been a murder-suicide perpetrated by the passenger in the twin-engine  Cessna.  </P> <P> Police spokesman David Grimm said local authorities have asked the National  Transportation Safety Board for permission to take control of the crash site.  </P> <P> The pilot, Bill Layne, 56, of Aurora and a passenger died Sunday when their  twin-engine Cessna 421 Golden Eagle crashed into a residential neighborhood in  southwest Boulder.  </P> <P> The crash destroyed several outbuildings and garages and one vacant home. A man  who was thrown 40 feet out of his garage by the impact suffered a broken hip.  </P> <P> Grimm said the passenger was tentatively identified as Gordon Larry Hood, 45.  He said Hood originally was from the Atlanta area but recently lived in Denver.  </P> <P> Grimm said investigators contacted two "friends and associates" of Hood's who  live out of state and both reported that the man was suicidal.  </P> <P> "The sources told us there were indications made to them that Mr. Hood was  potentially contemplating suicide, and in a manner similar to what occurred,"  Grimm said.  </P></p>

			<p>930906 FT  06 SEP 93 / Arts: Fears for live events funding - Sponsorship The world, well, that scrap of it known as the arts sponsorship world, was amazed when the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts came up with a figure of Pounds 64.4m for corporate expenditure on the arts in 1991-92 and predicted that there might even be a slight increase this year. If ABSA wants to ensure that its forecast comes true it need only add in the Pounds 4.5m that Classic FM has raised through sponsored programmes in the past year. It is hard to argue that the Classical Gas programme, sponsored by British Gas on the station; Classic Verdict, which appears thanks to Clerical &amp; Medical, and the station's Summer Music Festival programme, sponsored by Kenco (impressed by rival Nestle's success in underwriting the charts on pop commercial radio) are not a form of arts sponsorship. Certainly the latest initiative, a Pounds 100,000 investment by Prudential to ensure that its sponsorship of the Prudential Awards for the Arts is better known, is designed to help the arts world. Through the coverage, the 4.5m listeners of Classic FM, will hear all about the activities of short-listed companies like Theatre de Complicite, Opera North, and the Shobana Jeyasingh dance troupe, and will be encouraged to see them. There is a fear that the money spent on sponsoring arts programmes on television and radio, which is now being actively encouraged by the media involved, will take away funding traditionally put behind live events. There is the possibility that some companies will feel happier investing in media, which they understand through their advertising expenditure, rather than in sponsorship. But TV and radio coverage will need the events of the living arts to promote, and anything that gets business thinking about the arts as a marketing outlet, rather than traditional brand and corporate advertising, is a good thing. * Slowly, almost imperceptibly, ABSA Consulting is being launched on to the world. It is a risky business for the Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, a charity designed to increase corporate funding of the arts, to start up a commercial subsidiary. It has traditionally given free advice to its corporate members. It will still do so. If you want a quick opinion about a new sponsorship, or a run down of opportunities in the dance field, say, or in drama, ABSA will still weigh in with its experience. But if you are a long-term sponsor who is thinking of revamping its sponsorship programme and needs an audit of past activities and some considered research into potential commitments, or a totally new sponsor looking for guidance and perhaps a packaged arts programme, then ABSA Consulting will charge you the rate for the job based on its hours of research and its lengthy documentation, prepared by still to be recruited internal consultants. ABSA has always been a big player behind the scenes. It advised Digital when it launched its rescue programme for Sadlers' Wells based around dance, and helped English Estates with its important educational work. In future such time-consuming advice will be costed. ABSA's task is to ensure its hundreds of corporate members that they can still look to it for free day-to-day guidance on sponsorship matters. * The Barbican is the first arts organisation (festivals excepted) to take full advantage of the extra cash available under the re-vamped Business Sponsorship of the Arts scheme, which this year has Pounds 4.5m of government money to hand out as encouragement to arts sponsors. Since April the maximum top-up for an arts company with a sponsor in tow has increased from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds 35,000, and, more importantly, during a year it can make four applications (instead of two) and receive a maximum of Pounds 50,000 in state aid, double the old limit. The Barbican secured its Pounds 35,000 when the German bank Norddeutsche put up the same amount to underwrite an exhibition of the work of Mucha, and quickly reached its Pounds 50,000 limit when Levi's backed the exhibition of photographs by Bill Brandt, which also opens this month. So far nine arts companies have qualified for the Pounds 35,000 boost, mainly festivals, like the Brighton and the Covent Garden, but also exhibitions, like the Holbein show at the National Gallery of Scotland, backed by Capital House Investments, a first time sponsor. Another first time sponsor qualifying for Pounds 35,000 is BUPA, which is supporting the Council for Music in Hospitals in a number of events this year. Applications for BSIS cash provide a good monitor of the state of the arts sponsorship industry. ABSA, which administers the scheme, is actually turning away more applicants this year, especially those arriving late. All told it expects to receive a record 600 requests this year, suggesting that arts sponsorship has ridden out the recession better than most. * Tate &amp; Lyle, as a member of the Per Cent Club, devotes a proportion of its profits to good works, of which the arts merit 15 per cent. Most of this, Pounds 120,000 over the past three years, has naturally gone to the Tate Gallery, founded by Henry Tate in 1897. The link is due to end next month but already the search is on for a continuing connection. In the past Tate &amp; Lyle has sponsored the Friends of the Tate, providing the seed corn money which has enabled the Friends to grow in numbers and revenue. The Friends contribution to the Tate Purchase Fund now approaches Pounds 100,000, and included the commissioning of the Patrick Heron coloured glass window in the new Tate St Ives. * The London Philharmonic Orchestra has just returned from a twelve concert tour of South Africa. It is the first visit to the country by an important British arts company for many decades. The tour was sponsored by Nedbank, a leading South African banking organisation, for an undisclosed but 'substantial' sum, presumably around Pounds 100,000.</p>

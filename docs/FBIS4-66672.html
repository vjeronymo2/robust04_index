			<p>BFN     [Excerpts] The state has an ambitious project in the area  of telecommunications. The project involves the setting up of  100 million telephone lines in four years.    The Ministry of Communications signed the first deal in this  context with a German company. Today, the minister of  communications signed another agreement with the U.S.-Canadian  Northern Telecom. Details in this report by Imad Koutata:    [Koutata] On the basis of this agreement, Tunisia will be  provided with 360,000 electronic telephone lines that will be  distributed in many parts of the country. A network of mobile  telephones, known as JSM, will also be set up. This network  will include 5,000 lines that will cover the greater Tunis  province. The network will be a great help to businessmen and  investors in view of the great incentives and encouragements  provided for them in the investments code.    The agreement also includes a proposal for a partnership  between Northern Telecom and Tunisia. The partnership will  concern both industrial and commercial fields. The partnership  proposal involves the setting up of a center for developing  programs used in the telecommunications industry, the  revitalization of the manufacture of subscribers' equipment used  at telephone exchanges and, finally, the assembly and  manufacture of telephone exchanges. The agreement opens wide  prospects for an industrial and commercial partnership between  the two sides. [passage omitted]</p>

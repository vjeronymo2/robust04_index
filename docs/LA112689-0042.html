			<p><P> November 26, 1989, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> TIMES BOARD OF ECONOMISTS: EAST BLOC NEEDS WESTERN SUPPORT  </P> <P> The historic changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe cry out for support  from the West. We welcome the political and economic revolution sweeping the  region and should be willing to help it succeed. The chances of success are  greater if living standards improve; if they do not, hard-liners could once  again come to power in the region. Thus, there may be a big payoff to economic  assistance at this crucial juncture.  </P> <P> All of the centrally directed economies face certain common problems as they  try to become market economies. To varying degrees they lack some parts of the  framework of a market economy -- entrepreneurial skills, institutions for  creating and responding to market signals and other incentives, and financial  instruments for channeling investment and risk taking.  </P> <P> In addition, years of central planning in each country have left relative  prices distorted and resources misallocated. Because of these shortcomings,  total production is inefficiently low and what gets produced is not what  consumers want. In some cases, these problems have worsened recently.  </P> <P> In a market economy, these shortcomings would be corrected eventually. But  getting from the present state to the market system may not be an easy  transition. There is little precedent and no good theory to guide the process.  And for a time the countries may face both more unemployment and higher  inflation, as well as sharp increases in income inequality among workers.  </P> <P> Unemployment will rise as inefficient firms and industries are forced to lay  off employees. Eventually these workers should find jobs where they can produce  more and earn more. But all the needed jobs will not be immediately available;  so, there will be transitional unemployment and the need to provide  unemployment compensation.  </P> <P> The inflation risk comes in part because the price of goods that have been  heavily subsidized in the past will rise, while pent-up demand for goods that  have been rationed or unavailable will push up their prices. Only gradually  will expanded production lead to lower prices for these goods in a market  economy. In addition, any transitional decline in total output may push up the  average price level.  </P> <P> With such problems looming, how can the Western industrial democracies aid in  the transition from socialism? Western firms are already entering some Eastern  European markets. Such direct investment and joint ventures between foreign and  domestic firms can provide technical and entrepreneurial expertise, capital and  immediate entree to the market economies of the world. For the long run, these  are what the economies need the most. But in some countries, the transitional  problems may require more immediate, macroeconomic assistance.  </P> <P> Prof. Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, who has studied Poland's economic  situation carefully and is an adviser to the Solidarity labor union, believes  that Poland has much of the foundation needed for a market economy:  entrepreneurial talent and a relatively skilled and educated work force. He is  optimistic that foreign investors would be attracted to the new Polish economy.  </P> <P> Nonetheless, Sachs sees a critical need for special financial support from the  West to help maintain living standards and provide foreign exchange to permit  imports and support Poland's currency during the transition to a market  economy. Congress has recently provided for aid to Poland and Hungary, and  other financial help will come from international agencies and other industrial  democracies. Whether enough is forthcoming remains to be seen. With the Bush  Administration pleading poverty in response to acknowledged domestic problems,  it will be unlikely now to provide generous leadership on this international  front.  </P> <P> The problems, the stakes and the difficulties in providing assistance to  Eastern Europe are all magnified when it comes to the Soviet Union. There the  distortions of central control and bureaucratic oppression have existed for as  long as any citizen can remember. Initiative and entrepreneurship are not only  in short supply, they are feared and disliked by the average citizen. The  handful of Soviet cooperatives that have sprung up and have prospered modestly  by operating outside the centrally controlled economy are not admired for their  accomplishments so much as they are mistrusted for fostering income inequality.  </P> <P> If the economic situation in the Soviet Union has the furthest to go, it is  also the most crucial. Soviet living standards have worsened during Mikhail S.  Gorbachev's reform period, and his leadership is at risk because of it. The  incredible transformation that has taken place in the Soviet Bloc has happened  because Gorbachev allowed it and encouraged it. If economic disaster were to  lead to his overthrow by hard-liners, it would threaten progress in Eastern  Europe as well.  </P> <P> At the same time that the stakes are especially high and problems with the  Soviet economy are particularly grave, some kinds of assistance contemplated  for Poland or Hungary will be less available to the Soviet Union. Its economy  starts with less of the foundation needed for a market economy, and it is  likely to be less attractive to foreign investors. And clearly, neither the  public nor politicians are ready to send direct monetary aid to the Soviet  Union the way they are to Poland.  </P> <P> How then can we help? Certainly by finding ways to reduce defense spending in  both the Soviet budget and our own. Probably by allowing technical transfers  that have previously been discouraged or forbidden, by removing trade barriers  and by encouraging direct involvement of U.S. firms in the Soviet economy.  </P> <P> But we may also need to contemplate more direct aid, such as through loans or  subsidized grain sales, that would provide temporary economic assistance.  Which, if any, of these initiatives would be appropriate, let alone politically  saleable, is yet unclear. The important thing is that President Bush leave all  such possibilities open. The sterile "read my lips" approach that he has  brought to domestic budget problems with such sad results should not be carried  over to this new arena.  </P></p>

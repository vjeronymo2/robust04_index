			<p>940706 FT  06 JUL 94 / Business and the Environment: Green river rising - Angus Foster reports on an ambitious public health scheme to clean up Sao Paulo's river system Brazil's Tiete river, which took slavers and adventurers into the country's interior in colonial times, now carries a less visible but equally dangerous cargo - pollution. The river flows through the centre of Sao Paulo city, whose sprawling mess of concrete and shanty towns is home to nearly 17m inhabitants. It is probably one of the most polluted rivers in the world. About 40 per cent of its flow is untreated sewage, because of the city's shortage of sewers and treatment stations. More than 1,000 tonnes of organic waste are dumped in the river daily, along with about 3 tonnes of untreated inorganic waste, including chemicals and heavy metals. In some stretches, the river is biologically dead. Annual floods wash polluted water into the homes of the urban poor who live along the banks, increasing the risks of diseases such as cholera and leptospirosis. Worse, the pollution is not quickly carried into the sea. The Tiete flows inland before linking with the huge Parana river. Sao Paulo's rubbish reaches the sea several thousand miles later, near Buenos Aires. Now a start has been made on cleaning up the Tiete. A huge project launched in 1992 by the Sao Paolo state government aims to cut the river's pollution 'in half' by next year, and bring the river 'back to life' by 2005. The programme may cost Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.6bn), making it one of the biggest public health works under way in the world. The project's general aim is supported by politicians and environmentalists. But its schedule has been criticised as designed to capture public imagination rather than being realistic. Brazil's frequent changes of government often lead to delays of infrastructure projects. Last month, tenders for two sewage treatment stations were put on hold, apparently for political reasons ahead of October's general elections. More important, Sao Paulo has suffered from poor long-term urban planning since the capital's rapid industrialisation began in the 1950s. The growth in shanty towns, which are difficult to link to sewage systems, and the lack of industrial zoning, which would group difficult wastes, suggest that cleaning up the Tiete will take longer than the government hopes, and that the already high costs will rise. The most important element of the project is a planned increase in domestic sewage treatment. According to Jose Fernando da Costa Boucinhas, Sao Paulo state's secretary of planning, only 10 per cent of domestic sewage was treated in 1990. This very low rate is partly due to past lack of state government interest, and partly because lax municipalities built sewers straight into the Tiete and its tributaries, rather than building interceptors linked to treatment stations. 'The Tiete is the symbol of the project, but most of the pollution comes from the tributaries which flow into it,' says Edson Jose Andrigueti, project co-ordinator. A Dollars 900m first phase, due for completion by the end of this year but likely to slip back to the middle of 1995, is designed to increase this treatment rate to 50 per cent, leading to an immediate improvement in the Tiete's water quality. Most of the increase will stem from the introduction of an activated sludge treatment station to serve three of Sao Paulo's biggest municipalities in the south. Work on the station began more than 10 years ago, but has been stalled by successive governments opposed to the project for political reasons or because of financial problems. Some equipment, such as compressors for the station's eight aeration tanks, have been in storage ever since. According to the plant's technicians, this equipment is out of date but will still function. Money for the first phase came in equal part from Sabesp, Sao Paulo's state-owned water and sewage company, and the Inter-American Development Bank. A second phase, likely to cost a further Dollars 1.2bn, will take the total length of sewers installed under the project to nearly 2,000km and add a further two treatment stations. The target is 100 per cent treatment by 2006, although Andrigueti admits that will be difficult to achieve. Although domestic sewage and rubbish accounts for about 70 per cent of the volume of pollution in the Tiete, industrial waste is probably equally harmful. Sao Paulo is home to most of Brazil's biggest polluters, such as its car, chemicals and metals industries. The country's economic problems have provided companies with an excuse to delay environmental spending, even when tougher legislation was introduced five years ago. The clean-up project targeted 1,250 companies that were deemed the most serious polluters. They were given until the end of this year to arrange pre-treatment of wastes to be discharged into the public system. According to Boucinhas, 840 companies are now complying, mainly by installing pre-treatment facilities at their sites. According to critics, the effort to clean up the big polluters is welcome, but largely symbolic. Since most of these companies are well-known or multinationals, most had already moved towards pre-treatment. Also, government claims that these companies represented as much as 80 per cent of industrial pollution are challenged by environmentalists, who say it is impossible to measure pollution from Sao Paulo's thousands of small companies. 'Some companies are doing good work, but many others are not. And (the government) is still only concentrating on what comes out of the end of the pipe rather than on how to help companies improve production processes to reduce pollution,' according to Eugenio Singer, president of consultant Semco-ERM. Independent estimates of the number of small and medium-sized companies that are regular polluters range from 10,000 to 100,000, so it is difficult to guess how long Sao Paulo's industrial clean-up will take. But the government will have to hurry if it is to meet its 2005 pledge to return the Tiete 'to life'.</p>

			<p>930803 FT  03 AUG 93 / International Bonds: Rome prepares global bond that could raise up to Dollars 5bn THE Republic of Italy is preparing to issue the world's largest global bond in a deal which could raise up to Dollars 5bn and virtually complete this year's foreign borrowing programme. The largest global dollar bonds issued so far are Dollars 3bn issues for the UK and Ontario, according to IFR Securities Data, while the UK and Italy have both issued global offerings of DM5bn. Italy has filed a registration with the US Securities and Exchange Commission to issue up to Dollars 10bn in bonds on the US market over the next decade. The registration is expected to be used up over a number of issues over a period of several years. Precise timing for the transaction has not been revealed. However, the Italian treasury will be embarking on a two-week roadshow to international investors in early September. 'The bond could come straight after,' said Mr Alberto Giovannini, an adviser to the treasury. The size of the issue will depend partly on the outlook for issuing in other currencies before year end, said Mr Giovannini. In January, the Italian authorities said they wanted to raise Dollars 10bn to Dollars 15bn on international markets this year. So far, they have borrowed about Dollars 7.2bn through fixed rate deals in D-Marks, dollars and yen as well as a floating rate dollar bond. However, Italy's foreign currency debt represents only 3 per cent of the total outstanding debt, since the large Italian domestic market dwarfs Italy's foreign bond borrowings. 'The government will not push the market for an extra Dollars 1bn, because it's just a drop in the ocean for Italy,' a dealer said. The global bond, which has been expected in international markets, will be led by Goldman Sachs and Salomon Brothers. Choosing a global deal, rather than a more traditional Eurobond offering, will allow the treasury to access the US debt market immediately, said Mr Giovannini. Italy has not previously tapped the US market. 'This is probably the most important issue in the global bond market. Before it was just speculation. Now it's a fact,' he said Elsewhere, activity in the Eurobond market was subdued yesterday, as investors took stock of the effective collapse of the exchange rate mechanism over the weekend. Even without the recent turmoil in the currency markets, new issue volume would be subdued, as August is the low point for activity in the Eurobond market. In the D-mark sector, the National Bank of Hungary, which borrows on behalf of the Hungarian government, launched a DM1bn issue of 10-year bonds via Deutsche Bank. The deal was initially sold at a spread of 230 basis points over the 10-year Treuhand bond yield. The Treuhand issue is considered the 10-year benchmark, prior to the launch of the new 10-year bund today. Other potential deals are a D-mark offering by the European Investment Bank and a Dollars 500m 10-year Eurobond by the Inter American Development Bank. The People's Republic of China is planning its first Eurobond issue since the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. Nomura has been awarded the mandate to arrange the Euroyen bond issue, following a series of roadshows to promote the offering in Europe and Asia Pacific in September.</p>

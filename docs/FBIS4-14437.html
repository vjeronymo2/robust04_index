			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Report by Lyubov Tsukanova citing remarks by Sergey </F> Samoylov, deputy chief of the Administration for Territorial  Affairs under the President's Administration, under "Regional  Elections" rubric: "Who Has Been Voted Onto Local Organs of  Power"]    [Text] "Today we have only the preliminary data on the  elections," Sergey Samoylov, deputy chief of the Administration  for Territorial Affairs under the President's Administration,  told our correspondent. "At the moment it is still too early to  analyze the composition of the local-level representative  organs; that is a task for the next few days. But one or two  preliminary conclusions can be drawn: For instance, we were  attracted by the election proceedings in Kemerovo Oblast. Of  the 35 districts, elections were valid in 30. Nineteen  supporters of Aman Tuleyev, the former oblast soviet chairman,  headed by Tuleyev himself, were voted onto the representative  organ, and 11 of the deputies elected are supporters of the head  of the administration and his course. The future representative  assembly will thus be determined by by-elections for five  deputies.    "Running for the Novosibirsk Oblast Soviet of Deputies (such  is the name of the representative organ) was the former chairman  of the local oblast soviet, a `star' of all antipresidential  campaigns. He was elected along with a significant number of  his supporters.    "We forecast that the elections would prove invalid in  Magadan Oblast: This region has a very difficult social  situation, and sends many complaints to the president, and  indeed, of the 17 districts, elections were valid only in 10.  We hoped that the elections would take place more or less  evenly in Samara Oblast, and that a good guberniya duma would be  elected, but the results do not empower the representative organ  to begin work. Elections to the organs of local self-government  were valid here in only half the districts.    "Ryazan Oblast is a special case -- voters elected 19  deputies, there was a fairly large turnout, but the people of  Ryazan had raised the bar which they have to clear: In order  for the elctions to be deemed valid, not less than 35 percent of  voters had to take part in the vote here. This bar was cleared  in only 12 districts, and the representative organ cannot begin  work because it is one deputy short.    "The conflict between Nizhniy Novgorod's governor and the  head of the oblast center administration could not fail to  affect the course of the elections. The collapse of the  elections in the city suggest that the legislative assembly will  be composed of people of a sufficiently conservative cast of  mind."</p>

The visit will promote the development of contacts which  were  established during the visit to Pyongyang by LDP Deputy Chairman  Aleksandr Vengerovskiy in April, 1994 on the occasion of Kim  Il-song's 82d birthday, the same source said. In an interview  given to ITAR-TASS during the visit Vengerovskiy stressed the  intention "to maintain an active position as regards North  Korea."    LDP sources said that during Zhirinovskiy's forthcoming  visit  an agreement on cooperation will possibly be signed. "We do not  reject proposals to develop contacts," the same source said.</p>

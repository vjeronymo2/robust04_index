Three degrees of secrecy of information comprising state  secrets and security classifications corresponding to these  degrees for the storage media of the indicated  information--"special importance," "top secret" and  "secret"--shall be established.    The procedure for determining the dimensions of damage that  may be done to the security of the Russian Federation as a  result of dissemination of information comprising state secrets,  and the rules of awarding a particular degree of secrecy to the  indicated information, shall be established by the Government of  the Russian Federation.

Procedure for Defining Information as State  Secrets    Information shall be defined as state secrets in accordance  with its origination in a particular sector, department or  special-purpose program.    Justifying the need for defining information as state  secrets  in accordance with the principles of information classification  shall be the responsibility of bodies of state power,  enterprises, institutions and organizations obtaining  (generating) this information.    Information shall be defined as state secrets by the chief  executives of bodies of state power in accordance with the List  of Officials Granted the Authority to Define Information as  State Secrets, approved by the President of the Russian  Federation.

Separate lists of information subject to  classification may be drawn up within the framework of  specific-purpose programs for the development and modernization  of models of armament and military equipment, and on  experimental design and scientific research by decision of the  clients for the indicated models and work. These lists shall be  approved by the corresponding chief executives of bodies of  state power. The suitability of classifying such lists shall be  determined by their content.    Article 10. Restriction of the Rights of Ownership of  Information by Enterprises, Institutions, Organizations and  Citizens of the Russian Federation in Connection With Its  Classification    Officials granted the authority to define information as  state secrets in accordance with the procedure foreseen by  Article 9 of this Law shall have the right to make decisions on  classifying information owned by enterprises, institutions,  organizations and citizens (henceforth--the owner of  information), if this information is listed in the List of  Information Defined as State Secrets.

The owner of information shall have the right to appeal in  court the actions of officials which in the opinion of the owner  of the information infringe upon his rights. In the event of  recognition of the actions of officials to be unlawful by the  court, the procedure by which damage done to the owner of the  information is to be compensated shall be determined by a  decision of the court in accordance with currently effective  legislation.    The right of ownership of information by foreign  organizations and foreign citizens may not be restricted if this  information was obtained (generated) without violating  legislation of the Russian Federation.

Storage media shall be subject to  declassification prior to expiration of this term if the  provisions of the list currently effective in the given body of  state power, the enterprise, the institution and organization on  the basis of which they were classified are amended.    In exceptional cases the right to lengthen the initially  established term of declassification of storage media of  information comprising state secrets shall be granted to chief  executives of state bodies authorized to define the  corresponding information as state secrets, on the basis of the  conclusion of an expert commission appointed by them according  to established procedure.

Chief executive of state archives of the Russian Federation  shall be authorized to declassify the storage media of  information comprising state secrets stored in the closed  collections of these archives, in the event that such authority  is delegated to them by the collection-forming organization or  its successor. In the event of liquidation of the  collection-forming organization and absence of its successor,  the question of the procedure for declassifying storage media of  information comprising state secrets shall be examined by the  interdepartmental commission on protection of state secrets.

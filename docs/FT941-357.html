			<p>940330 FT  30 MAR 94 / UK Company News: Macfarlane shows 25% improvement to Pounds 12.7m Macfarlane Group (Clansman), the Glasgow-based packaging company, boosted annual profits by 25 per cent on the back of an 11 per cent rise in turnover. Pre-tax profits for the year to end-December rose from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 12.7m on turnover of Pounds 96.7m (Pounds 87m). Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, chairman, said that all divisions of the company had benefited from a gentle upturn in the UK economy. The group had increased the numbers employed from 1,500 to 1,600. Packaging accounts for 70 per cent of turnover and 75 per cent of the workforce. The group runs two other divisions - plastic moulding and development, which includes the group's sticky label and furniture business. A&amp;W Fullarton, the largest manufacturing company in the packaging division, is investing in additional storage facilities in order to cope with increased demand. In plastic mouldings, ACW of Aberdeen increased its capacity and started to produce a new range of packaging for the medical sector. Earnings per share emerged at 11.25p (8.8p), and a final dividend 2.4p takes the total for the year to 3.84p (3.186p). In the past four years the dividend has risen by some 57 per cent. The group ended the year with net cash of Pounds 19m, up from Pounds 11m. Lord Macfarlane said further small acquisitions were expected this year, which together with planned organic growth would use up much of the cash.</p>

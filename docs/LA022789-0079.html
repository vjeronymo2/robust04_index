			<p><P> February 27, 1989, Monday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY DIGEST: LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF;  </P> <P> SANTA ANA;  </P> <P> FIRE HITS EMPTY HOUSE; DAMAGE PUT AT $20,000  </P> <P> A fire attributed to transients or children caused $20,000 in damage to an  unoccupied house Sunday night, Santa Ana fire officials said.  </P> <P> The blaze at 5404 W. 4th St. was reported at 6:21 p.m. and brought under  control about 10 minutes later, Battalion Chief Jess Hernandez said.  </P> <P> "When I say the damage was about $20,000, I mean to the structure itself,  because the house was abandoned," Hernandez said. "There was just trash inside  the house."  </P> <P> While the cause of the fire is unknown and under investigation, Hernandez said  that "it was probably started by transients or kids."  </P> <P> The fire erupted in a rear room of the single-story, single-family home,  Hernandez said. The blaze did not spread to any other structures, and no  injuries were reported.  </P></p>

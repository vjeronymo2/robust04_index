			<p>930316 FT  16 MAR 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (29): Guruship in context MANAGEMENT GURUS by Andrzej A Huczynski Routledge, Nov. 92, Pounds 19.99, 352 pages WHY DID the 19805 generate such vast interest in new management ideas and in the gurus who propounded them at conferences and seminars, in books, newsletters, videos and cassettes? What makes a management guru? The author of this well-researched book puts guruship into its historic context and shows the relationship between demand - as organisations become larger and more complex - and the diversity of supply. The trend probably began 100 years ago, with F W Taylor, the 'Father' of scientific management, and other pioneers like Fayol, Mayo and Maslow. In the seventies and eighties, Ted Levitt revolutionised managements' views of marketing and more recently Peters &amp; Waterman's In Search of Excellence has had a powerful impact. The author, a senior lecturer at the University of Glasgow's Business School, groups six 'families' of popular management ideas or specialisms, such as scientific management and human relations, each of which produced its own gurus. Management ideas and their values, he argues, stem from the originator's position, or involvement, whether in academic research, or consultancy or experience of management. At the top of the hero-manager category, according to Fortune's list of best-selling books in the US 1979-1988, we find Lee Iacocca's autobiography, followed by Peters &amp; Waterman's In Search of Excellence and Trump on The Art of The Deal. This is a useful step by step guide for those who aim to achieve guru status, as more aspirants at business schools, in business journalism and in industry seem likely to. But where are the latterday gurus able to help companies cope with the turmoil of recession and survival and the aftermath?</p>

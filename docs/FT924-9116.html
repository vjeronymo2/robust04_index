			<p>921107 FT  07 NOV 92 / Denmark hopes move will help with bargaining DANISH politicians yesterday welcomed the British decision to delay Maastricht ratification as strengthening Denmark's bargaining position in talks over its future relations with the EC. However, the British delay may sharpen other countries' dilemma over the concessions which can be negotiated to try to clinch a Danish Yes in a new Maastricht referendum next year. 'This emphasises that a solution to the Danish problem must be found,' Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, said yesterday. Mr Ivar Norgaard, chairman of the Folketing's Market Affairs Committee, indicated that, with two members failing to ratify until next year, Denmark's negotiating hand would be strengthened. 'It puts pressure on us all to reach an agreement ..and it puts the other countries in a position where the alternative they face is an arrangement for 10 countries only, so I think it is an advantage for us,' Mr Norgaard said. Mr Ellemann-Jensen has visited London, Bonn and Paris this week to present the Danish demands for special arrangement. The demands are contained in a position paper backed by seven of the eight parties in the Folketing. The foreign minister said yesterday he has repeatedly heard that the Danish requirements, if met, mean the treaty would have to be reopened. 'We have to point out that this is not what we want, and there is agreement on this in the market committee,' he said. The foreign minister said the government wanted political agreement for special Danish EC arrangements in place before the end of the year. 'All that will be missing then will be the technical arrangement to make it possible to submit legislation to the Folketing,' he said. After that another referendum could be held on the treaty, in a bid to correct the No delivered in June. Mr Ellemann-Jensen said, however, the government had not promised the UK government a referendum could be held in May. 'We have said that a referendum in May is possible, and that it is unlikely to be any earlier. But this depends on whether there is an agreement on Denmark's future in the EC,' he said. The four key requirements are that Denmark should be free not to participate in European defence policy; not to implement the third phase of the EMU; not to implement co-operation on police and legal issues on a supra-national basis; and not be committed to introduce union citizenship.</p>

			<p><P> December 11, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> COST OF U.S. BUILDUP MAY HIT $37 BILLION;  </P> <P> MILITARY: NEW TROOP DEPLOYMENT COMPELS THE PENTAGON TO RAISE ITS ESTIMATE. IT  PLANS TO ASK CONGRESS FOR MORE FUNDS TO HELP COVER EXPENSES.  </P> <P> Operation Desert Shield will cost an estimated $29 billion to $37 billion this  fiscal year, forcing the Pentagon to seek supplemental funds from Congress as  well as additional contributions from other countries, Pentagon officials said  Monday.  </P> <P> The additional deployment of more than 200,000 fresh troops caused the Pentagon  to adjust upward its earlier cost estimate of $17 billion -- an estimate that  assumes no combat. In the case of war, independent analysts have estimated  costs at as much as $1 billion or $2 billion a day.  </P> <P> The Pentagon is expected to seek new budget authority from Congress to fund the  increases in the coming weeks, as its cost estimates become firmer. Congress in  September directed the Defense Department to return with a supplemental funding  request once the full costs of the deployment became clear.  </P> <P> The new estimate is expected to intensify the debate about the costs of the  massive U.S. deployment and the extent to which countries affected by the  Mideast crisis are contributing to the U.S. effort.  </P> <P> Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, moved in part by growing congressional pressure,  last week pressed Washington's North Atlantic allies to contribute more combat  troops, logistic help and financial support to the Mideast deployment.  </P> <P> "Congress has mentally adjusted itself to giving us a supplemental," said  Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, who added that lawmakers have long  anticipated additional costs.  </P> <P> Still, Congress' invitation for the Pentagon to adjust its estimates came  before Cheney announced that the United States was sending a second wave of  troops to bolster the force already there. The decision to mount the new  deployment has drawn criticism from many leading lawmakers, including Senate  Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.).  </P> <P> The accuracy of the cost estimates has become a politically sensitive issue for  the Pentagon, which has said the new figures could change with rising fuel  costs and help from third countries with the airlift and sea-lift of U.S.  equipment.  </P> <P> Some congressional analysts have questioned whether all the expenses provided  for in the earlier Pentagon estimate were necessary for the deployment,  including a $1-billion military construction budget.  </P> <P> In recent days, Cheney has warned that the costly U.S. deployment could disrupt  plans to shrink the size of the armed forces and scale back defense spending.  </P> <P> "On the one hand, we're conducting one of the biggest military operations in  terms of the deployment of forces . . . and simultaneously talking about a  long-term plan that takes down the size of the force. . . . It's easy to get  schizophrenic about that process," Cheney said.  </P> <P> "Everything is subject to review," he added.  </P> <P> As the Pentagon continued the second wave of its massive troop deployment  Monday, it announced that the Air Force is sending more F-15 Eagle fighter jets  to the Persian Gulf area for Operation Desert Shield.  </P> <P> The Army also announced it had called to active duty another 1,457 reservists  from 20 states, bringing the total number of reservists called up to 189,250.  </P> <P> Elements of the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at Bitburg, Germany, will deploy to  the Middle East starting Dec. 28, the Pentagon said.  </P> <P> It did not say how many planes will go; a tactical fighter wing normally would  include about 70 aircraft.  </P> <P> The Air Force in recent days has disclosed deployments of a variety of  additional aircraft to the gulf.  </P></p>

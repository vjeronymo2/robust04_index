			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> We do not accept the comment that we should sanction a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider for interfering in the performance of a survey. We  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> believe that this situation is adequately addressed in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> section 2713 of the State Operations Manual, which provides  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that surveyors may allow, or refuse to allow, facility  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> personnel to accompany them during a survey. Each case is  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at the surveyors' discretion and is to be worked out with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> facility management. If it cannot be worked out, surveyors  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> should contact their supervisors. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=83 g=1 f=1 --> Determination of a Deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> Many commenters responded to our request in the proposed  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> rule for recommendations for a regulatory design that could  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> accommodate the use of scope and severity scales for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining deficiencies.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=3 --> Comment: <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 -->  A large number of commenters recommended that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> we adopt a system for determining deficiencies similar to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> that used by the State of Ohio. The Ohio system employs the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> use of a worksheet that must be completed for each violation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> of a requirement. The worksheet evaluates violations  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> against criteria such as preventability and resident choice,  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> and then classifies violations based on ratings of scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity into two types. The first type is called a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency and the second, lesser violation, is called a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> finding. Both a deficiency and a finding are recorded on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the statement of deficiencies and are disclosable to the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> public, but only a deficiency would require a remedy. To  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the extent that the State of Ohio does not use scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity scales to determine whether a violation should  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> appear on the statement of deficiencies but rather to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine appropriate enforcement action, the Ohio  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> enforcement system is similar to the one that we proposed.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Another model proposed requires a mathematical weight  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> for each tag number identified in the interpretive  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> guidelines. Individual data elements would be ranked in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> descending order according to their importance in a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> regulation. The model then calls for a statistical  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> computation incorporating scope to determine whether a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiency exists.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A third model submitted involves two factors in  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determining whether an observation is a deficiency. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> first factor is preventability. Under this proposal, if  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> either the negative outcome could not have reasonably been  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> foreseen or if the facility could foresee the negative  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> outcome and did everything reasonably possible to prevent  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> its occurrence but it occurred nonetheless, a deficiency  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> would not be cited, regardless of scope and severity. The  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> second factor is substantiality. If a facility were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determined to be in substantial compliance with a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirement, a deficiency would not exist. Scope and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> severity would be used to determine if the requirement were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> met.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Other models that incorporate the concept of substantial  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> compliance into the determination of deficiencies but that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> do not involve the use of scope and severity scales were  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> also recommended. One commenter suggested that we create an  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> audit form outlining the minimum requirements for long term  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> care facilities, and then rate each item either a ``pass'' or  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a ``fail'' depending upon whether the requirement was  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substantially met. Another suggestion was that we calculate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a percentage of error rate for each requirement and evaluate  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the rating against a tolerable threshold of compliance.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Certain commenters believed that for resident outcomes to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> have significance in the survey process, negative findings  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which have no adverse impact upon the care being received by  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> residents should not constitute citable deficiencies. One  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenter recommended that we adopt the Joint Commission on  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations' accreditation  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> system which places any minor deficiencies that do not meet  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> substandard care criteria on a recommendation report and  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> reserves the official citations for substandard care. Other  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters believed that guidelines should express a  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> standard of ``practicably met compliance with requirements''  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> which they asserted would be comparable to the ``highest  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> practicable'' language applied to facility responsibility for  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> resident care.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Although the majority of commenters (mostly from the  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> provider community) favored the use of scope and severity  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> scales to determine deficiencies, a significant number of  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> commenters did oppose it. Many of these were concerned that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the use of scope and severity scales to determine  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> deficiencies would violate the intent of the Act that all  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> requirements be met and enforced. One commenter noted that  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> the intent of the Act is to ensure that each individual's  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> needs are met ``at the highest practicable level,'' not just  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> at minimum standards. Others asserted that for enforcement  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> to be resident centered, residents' individual problems must  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> matter, and that using scope and severity scales to  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> determine deficiencies would force residents to put up with  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> a certain amount of misery before the facility would be  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> required to address their problems.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

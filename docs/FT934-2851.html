			<p>931211 FT  11 DEC 93 / Still a girl's best friend: Antony Thorncroft on the new sparkle in jewel prices On Tuesday Elton John will have a clear-out at Sotheby's. Nothing fancy, just oddments, like the Cartier brooch designed as a Watford Football Club rosette; the Tiffany brooch spelling out the singer's name in diamonds; and a diamond-encrusted walking cane. John, a magpie collector, periodically sells off pieces he no longer wears, and these should add another Pounds 750,000 to his millions. Or perhaps rather more. Jewels - both jewellery as well as unset cut and polished stones - have been the unexpected salvation of the auction houses in 1993. While other works of art have selective markets, the appeal of jewels has been wider. Moreover, good Impressionist pictures have recently been as rare as gold dust; demand for Old Masters has been disappointing; and contemporary art remains a tricky market. This year's big November jewel sales held by Sotheby's and Christie's in Geneva were the most successful in years. Sotheby's brought in almost Dollars 70m from four sessions, including the Dollars 11.8m paid for a 100.36 carat diamond, the second-highest dollar price ever paid for a stone. Christie's totalled Dollars 41.4m, and sold the Archduke Diamond, a 78.54 carat stone once owned by Archduke Joseph of Austria, for Dollars 6.4m. No two stones are exactly the same, but Francois Curiel, head of Christie's jewellery department, offers a guide to the recent price increases. 'Before the summer a 20 carat diamond, rectangular, D-colour (the best), and flawless, made around Dollars 47,000 a carat. In November it was going for nearer Dollars 62,000 a carat.' Curiel had sensed that demand was growing and approached big cutters in Antwerp and Amsterdam, who convert rough diamonds into gleaming jewels, asking if they had any large stones for sale. He was sent seven such stones and they all sold, making on average 12 1/2 per cent more than the sellers' minimum prices. Noting a number of unsuccessful bidders, Mr Curiel will be going back to the cutters for more diamonds to offer at St Moritz in February to try to catch the super rich in a relaxed mood. With new buyers competing for the finest items, the auctions last month resembled the heady days of the late 1980s when Japanese buyers pushed prices for Impressionist and Modern paintings to unsustainable heights. This year, jewels will rival post-1870 art as the largest sector of the international art market, contributing more than Dollars 200m, or about a fifth, to the turnover of Sotheby's, and Dollars 140m to sales at Christie's, a 27 per cent rise on 1992. But amid the glitter and excited bidding there is a worrying undertow to the sudden rush of interest in jewels. It is concentrated on a few big buyers for the largest stones. Half the lots by value went to Saudi Arabia and the Gulf, and Hong Kong, areas of possible political turmoil in the next few years. Italy, currently redrawing its political map, supplied the third-largest group of buyers. Jewels - portable, durable, and with a history of value - look a shrewd investment during uncertainty. But according to David Bennett, who heads Sotheby's in Geneva, the interest in expensive diamonds is not motivated solely by considerations of security and investment. With money earning 3 per cent annual interest in American banks, the wealthy of the world are considering alternative homes for their cash. And the new rich of Taiwan, Indonesia, Singapore and now mainland China have followed ancient traditions in using jewellery to display wealth. d4 Everyone involved has 1980 ingrained on their heart. Then, an investment boom inspired by high inflation and low interest rates suddenly fell apart. Since then, however, the rise in jewellery prices has been slow and steady. It is the unremarkable progress of this price appreciation since 1983, especially compared to the boom and bust which affected other sectors of the art market, that has most encouraged the trade. Both Bennett of Sotheby's and Curiel of Christie's are encouraged that buying interest is not confined to large diamonds which were traditionally stored away as investments; buyers want jewels to wear. This is reflected in the demand for other gems, notably rubies. Traditionally Burmese rubies carried a hefty premium, selling for about Dollars 150,000 a carat for a 10 carat stone, as against Pounds 20,000 a carat for a ruby mined in Thailand. In November a 10 carat Thai ruby fetched Dollars 41,000 a carat. Emeralds, too, are increasingly popular. This is good news for Elton John. The most costly item in his auction is an emerald and diamond bracelet made by Cartier in about 1925. The new generation of jewellery collectors does not share the distaste for the antique shown a decade or so ago, although most really large stones are still given new settings by their owners. The brace-let alone should bring a Pounds 80,000 smile to the singer's face.</p>

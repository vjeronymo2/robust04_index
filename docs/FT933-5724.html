			<p>930902 FT  02 SEP 93 / Swedes find hard times far from over: The biggest problems are still very much there JUST as the Swedes were beginning to believe the worst was behind them in the country's deepest recession since the 1930s, a leaked report last week from the International Monetary Fund highlighting the dire state of the public finances came as a painful warning that the hard times are far from over. Rising exports - boosted by last year's big devaluation of the Swedish krona  -improving industrial profitability and tumbling interest rates had combined over the summer to produce a conviction that the economy had at last touched bottom after more than two years of decline. The stock market boomed through the spring and summer and all the forecasts were of a return to growth, albeit modest, by 1994. The consensus that the economy will expand by around 1.5 per cent next year, after three years in which it will have shrunk by nearly 5 per cent, has not changed. But the IMF report provided a stern reminder of how far Sweden still has to go in the struggle for sustained recovery. 'People are longing for good news and there is some,' commented Mr Hubert Fromlet, chief economist at Swedbank. 'But we shouldn't over-estimate the good news. We still have a lot to do.' Two deeply entrenched problems - unemployment and the yawning budget deficit  -still loom ominously over the economy. Tackling them means confronting the issue of how much further Sweden must go in reforming its famously extensive welfare and social security structures. The IMF report, according to newspaper reports that have not been denied, in effect called for much greater dismemberment of the 'Swedish model'. It criticised the level of public spending for having 'weakened incentives to work and to save', created 'a cripplingly high level of overall taxation' and produced a 'public sector deficit that dwarfs those in other industrial countries'. It said the government's plan to cut SKr10bn (Pounds 833m) in spending and bring the deficit down from what it estimated to be more than 16 per cent of gross domestic product (higher than other estimates) now, to 4.3 per cent in 1988 was inadequate. It said cuts should be doubled to SKr20bn a year. Prime minister Carl Bildt's centre-right government was not much out of sympathy with the thrust of the IMF criticism. It came to power in 1991 committed to stripping back the state's role in the economy and cutting taxes. But the depth of the recession - and especially an unprecedented real jobless rate of 13 per cent of the labour force - has limited its options. The fear is that too hard a fiscal squeeze could jeopardise the return to economic growth. In any case, Mrs Anne Wibble, the finance minister, is already under fire from the Social Democratic opposition for her medium-term plan to cut SKr26bn in transfer payments and SKr35bn in public consumption. With a general election due in September 1994, the government is hoping conditions will have improved sufficiently by then to head off the Social Democrats, who have abandoned a consensus approach on the economy and want a shift towards stimulating consumption, given the low level of inflation. There are signs of a turnaround. Industrial output bottomed out at the turn of the year and is set to rise by more than 2 per cent in 1993 as a whole. Exports are rising sharply, up 15 per cent this year, in large measure due to a more than 20 per cent depreciation in the Swedish krona since it was floated last November. The government can claim that reforms it has enacted - chiefly cuts in corporate and marginal income taxes made early in its tenure - have helped create a climate for recovery. But it faces a bleak outlook on what amounts to the central political issue, unemployment. The export-oriented sector may be producing and earning more, but it is not adding significantly to its workforce. The domestic economy is still mired in recession and is not expected to return to growth at least until late next year. Unemployment is likely to peak at up to 18 per cent just before the election. Government policies are partly responsible. Cuts in public spending and measures to increase savings, by cutting the tax deductibility of interest payments, are holding down demand. There is a lag in the stimulation effect from falling interest rates as households and companies prefer to unwind debt rather than spend or expand. Private consumption is set to fall by nearly 4 per cent this year and remain negative next year. The question is not whether the government will adopt the IMF's way, but whether it can stick to the more modest path it has set itself. With the election clock starting to tick, it will be a hard enough road to follow.</p>

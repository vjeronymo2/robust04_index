			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by Pekka Vaisanen: "Opposition to EU Has Lessened </F> Now That Results of Negotiations Are Clear -- Support Nearly  Unchanged, More People Uncertain Than Before"]    [Text] According to a recent Trade and Industry Commission  (EVA) poll, about 40 percent of all Finns now support membership  in the European Union [EU]. About 37 percent of them oppose  membership. More than a fifth of all citizens cannot yet say  where they stand on the issue.    In comparison with the last EVA poll conducted last fall,  support for membership has increased by about a percentage  point. Opposition to it has decreased by about 4 percentage  points. Now that the results of the membership negotiations are  clear, it is surprising that the percentage of people who are  uncertain of where they stand on membership has increased by 3  percentage points since last fall.    Men are still clearly more enthusiastic supporters of  membership than women. Nearly a third of the women are uncertain  about it.    The biggest change since last fall is in how young people  view it. Support for membership among those from 18 to 25 years  of age has considerably dropped. On the other hand, support for  membership has increased in the oldest age group.  <H5>  Center Party Still Opposes It </H5>   EVA has been reporting on how Finns view EU membership a  couple of times a year since the beginning of the decade. This  time 1,900 replies to an interview conducted by mail were  received between 30 March and 6 May.    SAK [Central Federation of Finnish Trade Unions] members'  position on EU membership has become more positive than before.  Nevertheless, there are still more opponents of membership in  SAK than supporters. On the other hand, opposition to membership  has increased in the STTK [Finnish Central Federation of  Technical Functionaries]. AKAVA [Academic Professional  Commission] members are still the most enthusiastic supporters  of membership among wage earners.    Three-fourths of the farmers and MTK [Agricultural Producers  Association] members still oppose membership. The interviews for  the EVA poll were conducted mainly in April when national  measures in support of agriculture had largely not yet taken  shape.    Center Party supporters now take a slightly more positive  view of membership than before, but there are clearly still more  opponents of it in the party than supporters. The party  leadership's vigorous policy of promoting EU membership is  beginning to take effect among SDP [Social Democratic Party]  supporters. There are already twice as many supporters of  membership as opponents of it.    On the other hand, enthusiasm for the EU is fading among  supporters of the Greens and the Left League. Opposition to it  has grown in both parties since the fall.    Sixty-eight percent of all citizens feel certain that they  will vote in the consultative referendum next fall.  <H5>  Media Will Determine Result </H5>   The results of the negotiations achieved by Finland in early  March are, in Finns' opinion, mainly satisfactory. Only a small  number of supporters felt that they were very good. Most of the  supporters described the results as satisfactory. Most of the  opponents felt that the results were poor or very poor.    In the opinion of many of the respondents, there was too  much  emphasis on agriculture during the membership negotiations. In  the opinion of the majority of the respondents, we should not  have agreed to removing restrictions on foreign ownership of  summer cottages in the negotiations.    Over half of the citizens feel that they are not very well  informed on the results of the negotiations. Young people,  students, and women are most uninformed on them.    Fully 81 percent of the respondents feel that the media will  have a decisive effect on the outcome of the referendum.    Many of them mentioned the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation  television news and the local newspaper as being their most  important sources of information. In Uusimaa they felt that  HELSINGIN SANOMAT was almost as important a source as the  television news.  <H5>  Finland Will Probably Be a Member Within Next Few Years </H5>   Finns feel it likely that Finland will be a member of the EU  within the next few years. Fully 81 percent of the interviewees,  that is, at least one out of every two opponents of membership,  are of the same opinion.    How Finns view the most important goals of the Maastricht  Treaty was also followed for a couple of years in the course of  the poll. Forty-three percent of them now support a common  foreign policy, but 46 percent still oppose it.  <H5>  Over Half Opposed ECU </H5>   Fifty-one percent of all Finns supported Finland's  committing  itself to common EU security and foreign policies and 51 percent  to a common economic policy as well.    However, only 37 percent of all Finns wanted a common  currency, the ECU, while 52 percent opposed the idea.  <H5>  Citizens Hope Finland Will Avert Disadvantages of EU </H5> Membership    "In the final analysis, whether EU membership is good or bad  for our country is a matter of faith, regarding which no one has  certain knowledge." This, according to the EVA poll, is what one  out of every two Finns thinks.    This time the Trade and Industry Commission also explored  citizens' fears and hopes with regard to EU membership during  its EU opinion poll.    Most of the respondents felt that Finland would be labeled a  fringe area, isolated from West Europe if membership in the EU  is not realized. Most of them also felt that, as a member of the  EU, Finland would before long become a member of a military  alliance, either NATO or the WEU.    Frightened by the unrest in Russia, Finns feel that, "with  an  unstable Russia as its neighbor, it would be safer for Finland  to be a member of the EU than to stay out of it." Fifty-four  percent of the respondents were of this opinion, while 22  percent differed on this.    Half of all Finns think that Finland does not have a chance  of influencing EU decisions but, on the other hand, just as many  also feel that Finns would not even notice membership in their  daily lives.    If the decisionmakers were to respect citizens' opinions,  they would organize the referendum on the EU to be held  simultaneously with those to be held in Sweden and Norway.  Forty-nine percent of all citizens want a simultaneous  referendum, while 24 percent do not feel that that is necessary.    Many Finns do not regard the EU "as a paradise." We may  infer  from this that citizens hope that Finland will, as a member of  the EU, first and foremost avert the disadvantages they fear  will result from membership.    Finns do not think that EU membership would help Finland  maintain control over international crime. Seventy-seven percent  of the respondents feel that Finland should further the  combating of international crime in particular in the EU.  <H5>  Women Worried About Social Security </H5>   In citizens' opinion, the third most important concern to be  promoted in the EU would be the protection of [members'] right  to self-determination. Citizens also hope that Finland will try  to reduce the EU bureaucracy, promote environmental standards,  and defend the Nordic social security model. Forty-four percent  of the respondents fear that Finland would not be allowed to  determine its own level of social security as a member of the EU.    Both supporters and opponents of membership have the same  sort of list of objectives. Women are more worried than men  about women's status and Nordic social security.    Finns take a more pessimistic view of the future of the  labor  union movement in the EU than do labor leaders. Forty-five  percent think that the status of the labor union movement and  its opportunities to influence decisions will be reduced with  membership, and they cannot muster any faith in the labor union  movement's chances of influencing international decisions either.

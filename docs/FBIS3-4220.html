			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [By Shiny Li in Beijing] </F>   [Text] The Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) has ruled  out the participation of Hong Kong officials in its review of  the territory's ordinances. The PWC has begun reviewing Hong  Kong's laws to identify any possible conflict with the Basic  Law, the territory's post-1997 mini-constitution. But the move  has raised concerns that the PWC is duplicating some of the  tasks being carried out by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group  (JLG) set up by an internationally binding treaty. Shao  Tianren, the coconvenor of the PWC's legal group which began a  three-day meeting in Beijing yesterday, ruled out the  possibility of inviting legal experts from Hong Kong to attend  the discussions to avoid any duplication. "We can't invite Hong  Kong officials for they are under the British administration,  and that would involve discussions at a foreign affairs level,"  he said.    Mr Shao's statement contradicted moves by the PWC several  months ago to invite Hong Kong officials to address its groups,  sparking a row with the British administration. The PWC's  economic group had invited Secretary for Economic Services  Gordon Siu to explain Britain's fourth proposed airport funding  strategy. The invitation was declined.    Speaking after the first day of the legal group's  discussions, Mr Shao said 12 ordinances relating to land and  real estate had been reviewed. "The group has decided not to  recommend changes to the units of weights and measures under the  British system such as inches, feet or pounds," he said. "All  these are historical habits. Let the Hong Kong people decide  whether to change them or not after 1997." However, Mr Shao  said the 12 ordinances were in need of technical amendments to  remove references to British sovereignty, such as "Royal" and  "British government".    He denied any duplication of the work already being  undertaken by JLG experts. "Our group will only give principal  advice and we will not amend the ordinances and regulations one  by one" he said. "It's not the assigned work of the PWC. If  both sides (the Chinese and British) can co-operate the (legal)  work actually can be discussed in the Joint Liaison Group."</p>

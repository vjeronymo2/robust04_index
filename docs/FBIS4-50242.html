			<p>BFN     [Text] Chongqing, May 16 (XINHUA) -- Vice-Chairman of  China's Central Military Commission Liu Huaqing urged the  country's defence industry to produce more civilian products and  well adapt itself to a socialist market economy.    Liu made the call during his inspection tour of defence  industrial enterprises in Sichuan Province.    China's defence industry began to shift to civil production  more than ten years ago upon the call by Deng Xiaoping. Taking  advantage of its advanced technology and equipment, the defence  industry has become a force to reckon with in the process of  establishing a market economy.    Liu Huaqing urged defence industrial enterprises to seize  the  current opportune moment and take further steps to readjust  their structure, lower costs, renew their products and make  themselves highly responsive to market demand.    He also urged these enterprises to improve the living and  working conditions of the workers, who have made major  contributions to the country under very harsh conditions.    Liu also visited Chinese people's liberation army and armed  police stationed in Sichuan, urging them to improve the quality  of officers and men and actively support local economic  development.</p>

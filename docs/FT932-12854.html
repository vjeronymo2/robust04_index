			<p>930427 FT  27 APR 93 / IMF World Economic Outlook: Bright outlook for third world MEDIUM-TERM economic prospects for the developing world appear brighter than for decades, the International Monetary Fund reports in its World Economic Outlook. After growing by more than 6 per cent last year, the best result in more than 10 years, the economies of the developing countries are projected to achieve growth rates of 5 per cent in 1993 and 1994, accelerating to an average 5 3/4 per cent in 1995-98. Economic performance has diverged widely among countries, however, and the IMF notes with disappointment its failure to find evidence that living standards in the developing world are catching up with those prevailing in industrialised nations. Nevertheless, the Fund's economists expect some convergence in economic performance over the medium term as more countries in Asia, Latin America and Africa implement the kinds of macro-economic policies they advocate, and as more countries get over the debt servicing problems they experienced in the 1980s. Western hemisphere countries, in particular, are forecast to show a strong pick-up from 2.5 per cent annual growth in 1993-94 to 4.8 per cent in 1995-98. Growth in Asia is expected to remain strong, averaging 6.6 per cent in 1993-94 and 7 per cent in 1995-98, while growth in Africa is projected to accelerate from 3.3 per cent over the next two years to 4.4 per cent in 1995-98. Developing countries in the Middle East and Europe are expected to show stable growth averaging 4.4 per cent a year from 1993 to 1998. The IMF says the developing countries with the best growth share some characteristics: low and predictable inflation, stable fiscal balances, low but positive real interest rates, competitive and relatively stable exchange rates. They have higher and more efficient investment, financed by high rates of domestic saving, and strong export growth resulting from outward-oriented trade and industrial policies, which do not discriminate between production for the domestic market and for export, or between purchases of domestic and foreign goods. Stable macro-economic policies may not be enough to ensure strong growth, the IMF warns, citing the slow growth of the CFA franc zone in West Africa and India's moderate growth, now accelerating in response to structural reforms.</p>

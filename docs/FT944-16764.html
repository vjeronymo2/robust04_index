			<p>941012 FT  12 OCT 94 / Job study finds race bias evidence A study of racial discrimination in job recruitment in Nottingham has found the chances of getting an interview were twice as high among white applicants than among black or Asian candidates, Richard Donkin writes. The study by the Nottingham and District Racial Equality Council submitted three fictitious applications for each of 281 job vacancies. The candidates, one white, one black and one Asian, were evenly matched. In the 38 cases where only one applicant was offered an interview, 30 of the employers picked the white applicant, five chose the Asian, and one chose the black candidate. In another case letters of application were sent to an insurance company seeking a sales representative. The white jobseeker received an application form on the first day of the month asking him to contact the company for the interview. The other two applicants did not receive the form until the 11th of the next month, a full six weeks after the white applicant. There was no offer of an interview with the forms. The company described itself as an equal-opportunity employer.</p>

			<p>940915 FT  15 SEP 94 / International Company News: Longuet looks to boost Renault sale - Divorce sends European automotive groups along divergent routes The planned flotation of shares in Renault should be followed by further reductions in the government's holding in the French automotive group, according to Mr Gerard Longuet, industry minister. Speaking after the government announced plans to sell a stake of about 28 per cent in the car and truck maker, Mr Longuet told Le Figaro newspaper: 'There is no particular reason for the state to remain the majority shareholder in the long term.' He described the planned flotation as a 'step, not a completion'. The political sensitivity of Renault, a former trade union stronghold, prompted the centre-right government of prime minister Mr Edouard Balladur to limit the scale of its issue of Renault shares and retain a stake of at least 51 per cent. Volvo, the Swedish motor group which holds 20 per cent of Renault's shares, will sell a stake of between 8 and 12 per cent as part of the operation. The move is part of an unravelling of an alliance between the two companies following the collapse of merger plans at the end of last year. The French industry minister said Renault would need to find industrial partners before full privatisation. Describing a consolidation of the European automotive industry, he said Renault would play a part in the reshaping of the sector. Shareholders in an ultimate privatisation would need to know what they were buying into, he said. Mr Longuet declined, however, to comment on possible partners. He said the Renault sell-off should take place as quickly as possible, reinforcing speculation that the operation will be launched at the end of October or early November. He indicated that the government had valued the company at between FFr40bn and FFr44bn (Dollars 7.5bn-Dollars 8.3bn), at the lower end of analysts' calculations. Regarding other issues in the government's privatisation programme, Mr Longuet said that Groupe Bull, the computer manufacturer, was well-prepared for sale. He hoped the state would be able to reduce its 76 per cent holding in Bull before presidential elections, scheduled for early 1995. French economic officials stressed that the partial flotation of Renault did not derail plans to privatise Assurances Generales de France, the insurer which has been competing with the automotive group to be the next privatisation issue. Mr Edmond Alphandery, the economy minister, said plans for the AGF sale were continuing and that the operation would be launched as soon as possible.</p>

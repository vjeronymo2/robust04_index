			<p>930525 FT  25 MAY 93 / People: Late return to first love A B 'Sandy' Marshall, 68, a former chief executive of P &amp; O, is one of the great survivors of Britain's declining shipping industry. Hence, he should have little difficulty stepping in to the number two slot at the Chamber of Shipping, caused by Les Atkinson's sudden departure for Singapore. Marshall takes over as vice-president of the Chamber of Shipping at the end of the month from Atkinson, the chairman of BP Shipping, who has has been promoted to head of BP's Far East operations. The latter's move to Singapore, which follows a management reshuffle at BP, left the chamber with a problem of finding a well-known industry figure willing to take on the mantle of president from the current incumbent, Edmund Vestey. Traditionally, the president of the chamber, which represents the owners of Britain's 12m dwt shipping fleet, serves a one-year term and his successor is the vice-president. Marshall worked for P &amp; O for 32 years before losing his job as chief executive after a boardroom disagreement over P &amp; O's strategy for survival. He became chairman of Bestobell, Commercial Union and vice-chairman of Boots. But he kept some link to the sea through chairmanship of The Maersk Company. His 'first love' has always been the sea and he is looking forward to his new role.</p>

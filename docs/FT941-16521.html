			<p>940110 FT  10 JAN 94 / Neo-Tesco look services motorways Turn left after the Burger King, pass the amusement arcade and you will reach the Country Kitchen restaurant, complete with patisserie, salad bar, and hot servery. Not your local high street, but Granada's Chieveley service station near Newbury, Berkshire, built in 1987 on a 50-mile stretch of the M4 between the Heston and Membury service stations that had no toilets, food or fuel. All the signs are that it will be the model for the new service stations promised last week. Granada - which with Forte's Welcome Break dominates the 53-station market with a score each - sees de-regulation as an opportunity to establish a brand identity, not to revolutionise the service-station concept. Mr Ian Dunstall, the commercial director of Granada Hospitality, said: 'Historically there has been no branding between operators, with people defining a station by location rather than operator.' The most sensitive motorists will be disappointed to hear that the prevailing 'neo-Tesco' style of station is unlikely to be overtaken by anything more elegant this decade. Granada plans to standardise its stations over the next few years so that visitors will hardly tell the difference between stops on the M25 and one on the M1. It will build three stations in the next three years, costing some Pounds 20m each. Meanwhile, it is installing a Burger King on every site and spending Pounds 10m on converting the interiors of its oldest developments. 'Criticism tends to be directed at the ambience internally,' Mr Dunstall said. 'People will be able to find their way round as easily as their local Sainsbury's' Forte points out that the government has protected against an explosion of fast-food outlets along motorways by insisting that operators continue to provide 24-hour access, fuel, free parking and toilets. Mr Richard Power, head of corporate communications at Forte, said: 'The experienced operators will open a number of new outlets, but they are likely to be smaller than those built under the old system.' He predicts an increase in the provision of facilities so that outlets will be 'as much a place to relax as to eat'. Beyond that, Forte says its new Welcome Break developments will not be much different from existing ones. Smaller, more frequent service stations thus appear to be the way forward. But greater competition seems unlikely to attract significant new entrants. Accor, the French leisure group, recently showed some interest in a site on the M25. It has withdrawn, however, worried that the prime sites had already been snapped up. It was also put off by the requirement to provide fuel as well as catering facilities on site. The 24 new service stations - four with planning permission - which are now in the pipeline are the product of de-regulation. Until now, stations had to be spaced at least 30 miles apart. The government has given the private sector responsibility for picking sites, acquiring the land and seeking planning permission. Some are worried about the still-unwieldy nature of the planning process. Mr Peter Dixon, of consultants Grimley JR Eve's motorway and roadside development team, said: 'Motorway service area de-regulation was announced 16 months ago. It's a bit rich to boast that four have obtained planning permission after so long.'</p>

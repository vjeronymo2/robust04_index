			<p><!-- PJG STAG 4700 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 76. We continue to intepret retransmission consent as a new right given to the broadcaster under the terms of the 1992 Cable Act and as a right separate from the right of the underlying copyright holder and do not believe that our reconsideration decision in any way undermines the separate nature of these rights or creates a conflict between communications and copyright based policies. Congress indicated that it intended ``to establish a marketplace for the disposition of the rights to retransmit broadcast signals.'' As stated in the Report and Order, the right involved is one which may be freely bargained away in future programming contracts. Although NAB and INTV argue that carriage in the entirety is required to ensure the continued validity of both the retransmission consent right and the current compulsory copyright, we do not see how providing broadcasters and cable operators with additional flexibility to negotiate retransmission agreements for signals not eligible for must-carry status algers the nature of the rights granted under Sections 325 and 614 in any way. Indeed, according this additional flexibility is consistent with interpreting the right in question as a new right subject to the control of the station licensee. To the extent these rights have been bargained away, the remaining rights that have not been disposed of still remain under the control of the station involved. As noted in paragraph 99, a contrary interpretation would not only deprive broadcasters and cable operators of the ability to negotiate mutually advantageous arrangements for the carriage of portions of distant signals but would negate the functioning of various portions of Section 111 of the Copyright Act and of the Commission's rules which specifically contemplate the possibility that portions of distant signals may be carried. Accordingly, we interpret Section 325 to provide that broadcasters may bargain with cable operators for the right to carriage of any part of the broadcast signal provided that such station is not eligible under the provisions of Section 614, either because it is not a local commercial broadcast signal or it does not qualify for mandatory carriage. ``Carriage in the entirety'' remains a requirement with respect to signals eligible for mandatory carriage under the provisions of Section 614. Sections 76.62(a) and 76.64(k) are being revised to reflect this change. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> E. Retransmission Consent Contracts <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> 77. In the Report and Order we specifically prohibited exclusive retransmission consent agreements between television broadcast stations and cable operators. This provision forbids a television station from making an agreement with one MVPD for carriage, exclusive of other MVPDs. After reviewing the comments filed in response to the Notice, we concluded that this prohibition is necessary in light of the concerns that led Congress to regulate program access and cable signal carriage agreements. We then stated that we would revisit the issue in three years. We reject petitioners arguments that prohibiting exclusive retransmission consent agreements is not warranted and is not supported by the 1992 Cable Act. We are adding a new paragraph (m) to &sect;76.64 of our rules to reflect this decision. As we indicated in the Report and Order, we will consider the need for such a prohibition against exclusive retransmission consent agreements in three years. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=81 g=1 f=1 --> F.

Commenters had sought to eliminate exclusivity rights for stations choosing retransmission consent. We found, however, that the legislative history addressed this matter and that Congress intended for exclusivity protection to apply under its regulatory framework. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> 79. We affirm our decision to allow stations electing retransmission consent to assert network nonduplication or syndicated exclusivity protection as provided in the rules. <FOOTCITE>26</FOOTCITE>  We observe that this issue was considered earlier in this proceeding in response to a petition from NCTA, which we denied in the Report and Order. Parties have provided no new arguments nor additional evidence to convince us that our decision conflicts with the intent of Congress. We also do not find that there is a conflict between retransmission consent rights and exclusivity rights. Network nonduplication and syndicated exclusivity rights protect the exclusivity that broadcasters have acquired from their program suppliers, including their network partners, while retransmission consent allows broadcasters to control the redistribution of their signals. Both policies promote the continued availability of the over-the-air television system, a substantial government interest in Congress' view. <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <FOOTNOTE> <FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> 26 <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  </FOOTNAME> <!-- PJG ITAG l=28 g=1 f=1 --> We note that we also considered whether to modify the geographic zone applicable to exclusivity protection to make it consistent with the definition of a local television market as the ADI, as specified in the 1992 Cable Act. We declined to make such a change. <!-- PJG /ITAG --> </FOOTNOTE>  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

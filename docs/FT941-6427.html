			<p>940302 FT  02 MAR 94 / Bentsen firm on banking rules reform Mr Lloyd Bentsen, US Treasury secretary, yesterday refused to back down in the face of Federal Reserve Board criticism and insisted that the four overlapping federal bank regulatory agencies must be consolidated. Mr Bentsen offered to let the Fed - which currently supervises bank holding companies, foreign banks, and state-chartered banks which are members of the Federal Reserve payments system - conduct joint examinations of a cross-section of big banks in partnership with his proposed new Federal Banking Commission. This commission would have three members appointed for staggered six-year terms, as well as the Treasury secretary and a Fed governor. He resisted, however, the Fed's desire to remain a separate regulatory agency. 'The federal government is not Noah's ark. We don't have, or need, two Securities and Exchange Commissions. Or two Food and Drug Administrations. Or two central banks. We don't need two sets of rules and interpreters, or two sets of examinations,' he told the Senate banking committee. Mr Bentsen offered to allow the Fed to conduct joint examinations with the Federal Banking Commission of 10 of the 20 largest US banks, as well as of a cross-section of smaller banks. 'But there will be just one exam per institution. Just one,' Mr Bentsen said. This concession on joint examinations falls short, however, of meeting the Fed's demands, which are expected to be laid out at another hearing of the Senate banking committee today. The Fed's principal argument so far has been that it needs to be closely involved in bank regulation in order to stay in touch with market conditions that could affect the whole US financial system. Critics point out that the German Bundesbank, generally held out as a model central bank, has no such responsibilities.</p>

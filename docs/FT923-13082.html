			<p>920715 FT  15 JUL 92 / Parliament and Politics: Drawing fetches Pounds 352,000 - Saleroom A CHALK drawing by Gainsborough, 'A peasant family going to market' (detail right), sold for Pounds 352,000 at Christie's yesterday to an anonymous telephone bidder. The price was plumb in the middle of the saleroom's estimate and is the second-highest sum paid at auction for a drawing by the 18th century English artist. A year ago Christie's sold 'A lady walking in a garden' for Pounds 616,000. Gainsborough made the drawing in Bath in the 1770s. It gives an idealised view of rural life and owes something to the landscapes of Rubens. It comes from the estate of the late Lord Clark, of 'Civilisation' fame. The auction of British drawings and watercolours did well, totalling Pounds 830,863 with only 9 per cent unsold. A watercolour by Turner, 'The Splugen Pass', was near the top of its estimate, selling for Pounds 242,000.</p>

			<p>940509 FT  09 MAY 94 / Business school chooses director Manchester Business School will today name Professor John Arnold, now at Manchester University, as its new director. He takes up the post on September 1, but he will begin working on the school's strategy review when his appointment is ratified this month. The school has been involved in a row over plans to make it part of a federation with the university's department of accountancy and finance, and the school of management at the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology. The dispute led in 1992 to the resignation of the school's advisory board of private-sector leaders and the departure of then-director Professor Tom Cannon. His successor, Professor Tony Cockerill, is to become director of Durham University Business School. Yesterday Mr James Ross, chief executive of Cable &amp; Wireless and chairman of the school's new board, said that Prof Arnold was an inspired teacher and a very efficient administrator. Prof Arnold will be expected to raise the school's research rating, market it more effectively and improve its financial position.</p>

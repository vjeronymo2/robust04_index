			<p>941025 FT  25 OCT 94 / Gerstner bytes back: The IBM chief has won some respite Mr Lou Gerstner is becoming a Wall Street hero. Since taking over at the helm of International Business Machines 18 months ago, Mr Gerstner has engineered a remarkable turnaround in the financial performance of the world's largest computer company, after three years of heavy losses. The upward trend was confirmed last week when IBM reported net profits of Dollars 689m, or Dollars 1.18 a share, for the third quarter - well above expectations. Revenues increased to Dollars 15.4bn, up 8.6 per cent from the same period last year, after adjustments for the sale of a business unit and accounting changes. For the year to date, expenses are down by Dollars 2.8bn following 24,000 job cuts and other cost reductions. After four consecutive quarters of profit, it appears that IBM has turned a corner. The company's shares are trading at around Dollars 74, the highest level in two years, reflecting growing investor confidence. Yet IBM's new-found strength could be short-lived. Some important segments of IBM's business are still operating at a loss and the company's improved financial performance is at least in part the result of good luck, rather than good management or foresight. The paradox for IBM is that the restoration of its revenues and profits over the last three quarters has been on the back of unexpectedly strong demand for its mainframe computers, its flagship - and most profitable - products. For years, IBM's business strategy centred on its mainframes as the workhorses of corporate data processing. The company's recent difficulties have come from its failure to respond to mounting competition from networks of personal computers and servers. Failing to respond to the technology shift was 'the single most important mistake that IBM made,' Mr Gerstner said earlier this year. He ordered 'a massive redeployment of development money' away from mainframes into new products for networked computing. Mr Gerstner may be tempted to believe that the mainframe resurgence signals another sea-change in computer technology trends. IBM is currently renewing its mainframe marketing efforts and postponing consolidation of mainframe manufacturing operations. 'We have been listening to customers' needs and meeting them,' says Linda Sanford, general manager for IBM's System 390 mainframe products. 'Customers are adamant that they are not willing to abandon their investments in mainframe software, which total over a trillion dollars worldwide,' she says. The mainframe is also gaining new respect as corporate computer users become less enamoured with 'alternative solutions' based on networks. 'For reliability and robustness you cannot beat a mainframe,' says Jerry York, IBM chief financial officer. 'The alternatives are not yet bullet-proof enough.' Yet many industry observers believe that the role of central 'host' mainframes will decline as distributed computing takes hold. The temporary comeback of the mainframe may reflect nothing more than the economic recovery in the US and Europe which has created a surge in new orders after three years of depressed spending. If so, IBM's mainframe 'bubble' will not last, leaving the company vulnerable to the problems of some of its other businesses which are critical to future revenue growth. In the PC sector, for example, IBM is struggling to achieve profitability. 'Our PC problem continues,' Mr York said last week. '(It) will probably take us until the end of 1995 to see progress that we will feel really good about.' Over the last year, IBM has lost market share in PCs to competitors including Compaq Computer, which has overtaken IBM to become the market leader. Struggling to regain its momentum, IBM has restructured its PC operations, cut jobs and simplified overlapping product lines. But it seems that IBM keeps bungling opportunities in the PC market. Last month it launched a new line of 'Aptiva' consumer desktop multimedia PCs to very positive reviews. But the IBM PC unit underestimated demand and already has orders for all of the Aptiva PCs it can build by the end of the year. Uncertainties surrounding the future of IBM's PC business are increased by the company's efforts to establish the 'PowerPC' microprocessor, the heart of a new generation of PCs, jointly developed with Motorola and Apple Computer. But in the absence of suitable software, the project could take years to bear fruit. Data storage products represent another weak point for IBM. Revenues declined by a 'double digit' percentage in the third quarter against the same period last year, said Mr York. Although sales of disk drives for PCs grew strongly, IBM has been losing ground in the market for high capacity data storage systems. Mr Gerstner said last week that he was encouraged by IBM's progress in moving new technology 'from lab to manufacturing to market much faster'. But data storage is an example of IBM's failure to keep pace with competitors in exploiting new technology. IBM is also playing catch-up in the market for PC software, which is currently dominated by Microsoft. The recent launch of OS/2 Warp, a new PC operating system to rival Microsoft's Windows, could give IBM a boost. But its investments in software development currently outstrip revenues from this important growth sector. There are some bright spots for IBM. Sales of its AS/400 mid-range computers increased by about 25 per cent in the third quarter, following the launch of models earlier this year. It is also making rapid progress in the sale of semiconductor chips to outside customers, with sales of Dollars 2.2bn to date this year, from next to nothing two years ago. Yet as IBM continues to pare back its spending on research and development - down by 23 per cent in the third quarter to just over Dollars 1bn - the company will face a crisis if revenues from older product lines, in particular its mainframe computers, decline more quickly than growth in other sectors. Financial analysts expect IBM's performance to continue to improve through 1995. Mr Gerstner has also silenced the industry pundits who just two years ago said that the only way to 'save' IBM was to break it up into smaller, more agile businesses. But the longer term outlook is far less certain. Even as he continues to cut costs, the more difficult challenge facing Mr Gerstner is to generate revenue growth on a sustained basis. So far he has not demonstrated how IBM will achieve this goal, although as Mr York puts it, 'a huge amount of our energies are focused on that issue'.</p>

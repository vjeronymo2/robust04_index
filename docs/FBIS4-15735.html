			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Leonid Mlechin report: "Bloodshed in Bosnia Will Continue </F> Because It Is Not a Religious or an Ethnic War but a Battle for  Land"]    [Excerpt] [passage omitted] The Serb offensive on  Gorazde, the NATO aerial bombardment, and the Bosnian Serbs'  refusal to deal with the United Nations have dealt Belgrade's  diplomacy a grave blow. A delegation from the lower chamber of  the Yugoslav parliament has just been to Moscow and left taking  with them the most optimistic impressions.    "The main Duma factions promised us support on what is the  main issue for us -- the lifting of sanctions," Radoman Bozovic,  chairman of the Yugoslav parliament's lower chamber, told  IZVESTIYA. "Russian deputies realize that sanctions were  introduced simply to punish the Serbs."    The Belgrade politician also thinks that Russian diplomats  have changed their approach to Yugoslavia's problems:    "Minister Andrey Kozyrev and his deputy Vitaliy Churkin told  us that they consider the lifting of sanctions an inalienable  part of the peacemaking process. Following the December  elections, Russian diplomacy has taken a more realistic stance  on Yugoslavia."    Radoman Bozovic gave IZVESTIYA an interview in the  half-empty  Yugoslav Embassy building in Moscow, where there are just a few  diplomats left owing to the sanctions and where Kozyrev, the  Vatican, and the Americans are cursed and tales told about the  genocide of Serbs. Politicians and professional propaganda  personnel speak significantly and only too often about Slav  unity, which people in Belgrade only recalled after sanctions  were introduced against Serbia. The main task facing Belgrade's  diplomacy is to pit Russia against the West.    The representatives of Yugoslavia against which the UN  sanctions have been imposed are not very well received  worldwide. The 41-year old Radoman Bozovic, who used to teach  the theory of economic development, was elected chairman of the  parliament's lower chamber a year ago and this is his first  official visit abroad.    "We told Kozyrev and Churkin that the Bosnian Serbs and Serb  Krajina (an enclave on Croatia's territory) must have the same  right to self-determination as the other peoples of the former  Yugoslavia," Radoman Bozovic said. "If the Bosnian Muslims or  the Croats can have their own state, then why should the Bosnian  Serbs be denied that?"</p>

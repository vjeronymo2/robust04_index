			<p>930917 FT  17 SEP 93 / Survey of International Mergers &amp; Acquisitions (12): More talk than action in business - A German investment banking life is not a happy one at present ARE there too many foreign investment bankers in Germany? One banker, who for understandable reasons wants to remain anonymous, thinks that there are. 'Germany is teeming with investment bankers beating their breasts in search of business which just isn't there,' he observes. 'They talk about the business out there waiting to be done, they get highly-paid jobs on the basis of the business they are going to do . . . but I doubt whether they really do enough to justify their overheads. 'The thing is that the investment banker here does not have the comfortable role he enjoys in the UK or the US. German companies see almost no reason for using them - and why should they? 'It makes sense to use a foreign investment bank when you are trying to sell a company to a foreign buyer, but that is about it in terms of conventional M&amp;A business. Nowadays it is difficult to persuade a German company to use a foreign investment bank as anything other than a broker for selling troubled subsidiaries.' Is this bleak assessment correct? Certainly, the investment banker's lot in Germany is a poor one amid Germany's worst recession since the second world war. According to statistics complied by the German arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, the number of transactions in Germany last year fell by 12 per cent to 2,559 - the lowest level for five years. Among these there were a handful of spectacular cross-border deals, such as the complicated joint transactions which led to Credit Lyonnais' purchase of a majority stake in the BfG Bank for a total package of an estimated DM1.5bn. The related transaction was Assurances Generales de France's acquisition of a large holding in Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second largest insurance group. Westdeutsche Landesbank, the state sector bank, bought Thomas Cook, the UK-based travel group (for around DM600m); Schering, the Berlin-based group sold its industrial chemicals division to Witco of the US for DM660. The bulk of M&amp;A transactions involved smaller, privately owned companies, as is usual for the German market for corporate control. Moreover, most of these deals were done without the help of Anglo-American-style financial advisers. German companies tend to turn to their house-bank or to tax, legal and accountancy advisers for many of the services provided by investment banks in the 'Anglo-Saxon' markets. And for those investment banks lucky enough to have won a mandate, there comes another problem: the Coopers study found that the quality of the market had changed perceptibly. It is no longer a seller's market. 'In the light of current economic climate many of the previously active acquirers have entered a period of consolidation,' the study observes. 'On the seller's side the search for a suitable buyer is often a fruitless one.' 'It is quite difficult to get deals done in these sort of circumstances,' confirms Peter Espenhahn, deputy-head of corporate finance at Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant bank which is a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, and a director of the bank's German operations . 'There tends to be a large gap between the expectations of buyer and seller. Selling companies at a time of declining fortunes is always difficult.' Mr Piers von Simson, head of European mergers and acquisitions at S G Warburg, says that his team of eight professionals working in the German-speaking countries has 'got its hands full', for example, advising PowerGen of the UK on its proposed acquisition of the Mibrag lignite mines in eastern Germany. But von Simson concedes that the 'process by which German companies come to recognise that investment banks add value to transactions is very gradual . . . There will not be a boom in M &amp; A business, but the conditions are right for a gradual increase in the use of financial intermediaries in the German market.' Long-term factors include the increasing tendency of German conglomerates to 'unbundle' non-core businesses or the increasing trend towards privatisation of assets owned by federal and regional government, von Simson believes. At least two new foreign investment banks have established themselves in Frankfurt since 1990, attracted by similar arguments to those advanced by Mr von Simson. Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, has made a big splash in the Frankfurt financial community: it has recently taken a second floor in the Messeturm skyscraper and has doubled its personnel in Germany to 120 over the last year alone. Phil Murphy, one of the firm's two resident partners in Germany, says that, along with the Hong-Kong office, Frankfurt is the fastest growing office in the entire Goldman Sachs network. The firm is active in the fixed income and equity markets in Germany as well as mergers and acquisitions. Kleinwort Benson's presence is more modest: there are just six professionals based in the Frankfurt office. But the evolution of the office since it opened last year shows how, with a degree of flexibility, a UK merchant bank can adapt itself to changing circumstances in the German corporate finance market. 'When we started, we expected that 90 per cent of our business would be mergers and acquisitions,' says Mr Hendrik Borggreve, chief executive of Kleinwort's German operations. 'That was the game in town and everybody was doing it. But then we faced difficulties as the market started to dry up. When we started it was possible to line up 50 or so buyers for every company that came up for sale. Now almost nobody wants to buy.' The solution was to broaden the range of service offered by the new office - with a particular focus on project finance, a London speciality which had not hitherto been developed on an international basis. Kleinwort's Frankfurt office is advising on the financing of a number of important infrastructure projects in eastern Europe. For example, it is advising Gazprom, the Russian state-owned gas company, on two such projects: a DM5bn plan to construct a pipeline to bring Russian natural gas to Germany; and a DM1.5bn proposal to build a polyethylene plant at Novy Urengoy in Siberia in conjunction with western partners. Kleinwort is also advising on the financing for the planned D-5 motorway which will link Prague with Nuremburg via Pilsen. 'After 16 months in action I am confident that we will make a profit this year,' says Borggreve. 'The office is ahead of budget.' Not all international investment bankers operating in Germany can make such a positive statement. Sceptics - such as the anonymous banker above - expect an early shake-out as institutions that decide the investment in time and money needed to crack the German market is too great.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Riga, May 02, BNS -- Latvian and Russian state  delegations signed a protocol on the most favored nation status  in economy, Latvian Prime Minister Valdis Birkavs told reporters  Sunday [1 May] on return from Moscow.    Under the protocol, the favored nation relations take effect  starting 1 June. The respective agreement is scheduled for the  second half of May when Russian Prime Minister Viktor  Chernomyrdin tours Riga.    Birkavs draw a link between the achieved compromise on the  amount of rent for the Skrunda radar and the agreement on the  most favored nation status in economy.    As reported, Russia initially offered Latvia 2 million U.S.  dollars per year while Latvia demanded 400 million U.S. dollars  per year.    The 30 April troop withdrawal treaty provides for a  $5-million yearly rent. Birkavs pledged to channel the funding  for the needs of Skrunda locals who will have to put up with the  radar for four more years.    Latvia needs long-term goodneighborly relations with Russia,  said Birkavs. He claimed that Latvia and Russia faced a new  historic epoch in this aspect.    "The new, democratic Russia understands Latvia's problems  and  the signature of the agreements will consolidate democracy also  in Russia itself," noted Birkavs. [passage omitted]</p>

			<p>930514 FT  14 MAY 93 / UN to withdraw forces The United Nations is to withdraw its 236 'blue helmets' from northern Iraq because it has no funds to keep them there, Reuter reports from Geneva. Officials said yesterday the first 50 guards would be pulled out today and the remainder by mid-June unless western governments responded before then to urgent UN appeals for funds. The first batch of the guards were sent to Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War to help protect Iraqi Kurds in the north of the country who had rebelled against President Saddam Hussein. Mr Tam Dalyell and Mr George Galloway, two UK Labour party MPs, have arrived in Iraq to explore the effect of sanctions and tour the southern marshes. They are the first British MPs to travel to Baghdad since the Gulf War.</p>

			<p>BFN   <F P=106> [Unattributed article: "Clinton and Pope Talk Longer Than </F> Planned"]    [Excerpts] (ANSA) Vatican City, June 2 -- The conversation  in Vatican City today between United States President Bill  Clinton and Pope John Paul II lasted forty minutes, ten minutes  more than expected.    The Clinton motorcade entered Vatican City on schedule  through the belltower gate to the left of St. Peter's basilica  at exactly 11:50 [0950 GMT]. Bill Clinton thus became the tenth  U.S. president to come within the precincts of this tiny  independent state.    The President and his party, which included his wife Hillary  and Secretary of State Warren Christopher, were welcomed in the  San Damaso courtyard by the prefect for the Pontifical House,  Msgr. Dino Monduzzi under the watchful eye of a platoon of Swiss  guards. As this was not an official visit, no anthems were  played.    As the Clintons were conducted through the magnificent rooms  towards the papal library where John Paul awaited them, they  admired with obvious pleasure the rich decor of paintings,  frescoes, sculpture and furnishings which embellish the Vatican  complex.    Despite his recent hip replacement surgery, the pope was  standing up to greet Clinton as he crossed the threshold into  the library. The two men then sat down in two armchairs to begin  their private talk.    Clinton is the fourth U.S. president to be received in the  Vatican by John Paul II. The others were Jimmy Carter, Ronald  Reagan, and George Bush.    While the pope and the president talked, Warren Christopher  immediately began talks in the nearby Hall of the Popes with a  Vatican delegation led by Secretary of State, Cardinal Angelo  Sodano. At the end of the private conversation between the  president and the pope, the rest of Clinton's party were  introduced into the libary.    The first to enter was his wife Hillary who was wearing  black  and who had covered her head with a black veil in keeping with  Vatican protocol. She was followed by her mother and then the  other members of the American delegation. The usual exchange of  presents took place after the pope greeted each of the visitors.    At the end of the papal audience, Clinton and his party  proceeded to another part of the palace to join up with Cardinal  Sodano, and American cardinals William Wakefield Baum and  Casimir Szoka, who are members of the Curia.    Coming out of the audience, the U.S. president said that  among the topics he discussed with John Paul II was the upcoming  Cairo conference on birth control; the international situation,  with special reference to Bosnia and the Middle East; the role  of Islam; and problems of religious liberty in the world,  especially in Asia.    Clinton said he was honored to have been received by the  pope  and he praised the willingness of the Catholic Church to cope  concretely with problems.    The world assembly in Cairo on population, organized by the  United Nations, came up again when Clinton stopped to talk with  a group of American seminarians. The president said that he and  the pope had discussed both what they agree on and what they do  not agree on in this area, and said that they found a common  meeting ground in their awareness of the need to uphold a  responsible growth in population. Both men also reviewed the  progress that has been made in the direction of responsable  parenthood, he added.    The topic came up again when Clinton responded to questions  put by a group of journalists. Unlike China, the United states  does not support abortion as a means of birth control, he  insisted. But his administration is concerned about the tens of  millions of abortions that take place in unsafe conditions  around the world, putting women's health and very lives at risk.    He admitted that "differences" exist between the United  States and the Vatican on the matter of contraception, but he  voiced the conviction that the thrust of the Cairo conference  would be to support sustainable development and strong families.    Nevertheless, Clinton said that "progress" had been made in  his talk with the pope.    White House spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers stressed that neither  compulsory abortion nor abortion upon request were part of the  Clinton Administration policy. Abortion must be safe, legal and  rare, she said. Nevertheless, family planning and access to  contraception are important means by which to control population  growth so as to prevent massive migrations of people due to food  scarcity and to fend off environmental degradation, the  spokeswoman said.    Asked if the points of view of John Paul and the American  president were irreconcilable, Myers would only say that she did  not believe the pope would change his mind on these issues.    The two men have distinctly different views on abortion and  family planning and have already clashed swords on the issues,  including when the pope was in Denver last August, during the  pope's appearance at the world youth celebrations there. The  issue returned to the spotlight in New York last month during  preparatory debate for the Cairo conference. [passage omitted]    Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro confirmed that the Cairo  conference was in the front line of topics discussed by Clinton  and the pope during the private audience. Although the two  leaders had discussed a variety of international matters,  including world peace in general and the situation in the Middle  East and in Jerusalem, the lion's share of their conversation  had pivoted on that UN-sponsored conference and the serious  ethical questions it raises, Navarro said. The Holy See is  deeply concerned with the defense and promotion of life and the  defense and promotion of the family, and with this in view, the  pope has appealed to the responsibility of a great nation like  that of the United States which in its origins and throughout  its history has always proclaimed ethical values to be at the  basis of every civilization, the Vatican spokesman continued.    He added that U.S. Secretary of State Christopher and his  Vatican counterpart, Cardinal Sodano, in their separate talks,  had reviewed certain aspects of preparations for the Cairo  conference and had discussed the chief problems having to do  with international peace: Europe, Africa and the Caribbean, and  "with special emphasis on peace in the Middle East and the  future of the Holy City of Jerusalem," he said.    During his meeting with the pontiff today, Clinton also took  the opportunity to thank the Vatican for having recognized the  state of Israel and for the support it is giving to the Mideast  peace process, it was later learned.</p>

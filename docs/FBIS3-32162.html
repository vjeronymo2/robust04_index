			<p>Language: <F P=105> Spanish </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [From "The Reporter" newscast] </F>   [Text] Government Minister Marcelo Santos has made a call  for understanding, good sense, and prudence to ensure there will  be no regrettable incidents during the labor strike. The  minister did not rule out the possible of militarizing the  country for the duration of the strike should the situation  warrant.    [Begin Santos recording] I want to urge Ecuadorans to  reflect  on the situation. I want them to understand that the president  [words indistinct] adopt measures that could weaken -- in one  way or another and to a greater or lesser extent -- citizens'  purchasing power without regard to established levels and also  being aware of the political impact that this could have on him  and his government, is adopting the necessary steps to effect  authentic economic recovery in Ecuador. [end recording]    Congress President Samuel Belletini described as sadistic  the  economic measures implemented by the regime that will supposedly  cover the fiscal deficit. He added that demonstrations and  protests are just, in view of the harshness of the economic  package, because once more the government is attacking the  living conditions of Ecuadorans. The people cannot bear this  situation any longer because they are confronting serious  problems to secure basic staples, he said.    [Begin Belletini recording] What can I say to the poor of  Ecuador, to laborers, employees, and workers? I can only tell  them to be courageous and to struggle, to struggle for their  lives and for dignity, and to struggle for the future of their  children. Messrs. Reporters, also ask me what I have to say to  the president. Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, please, the  people cannot endure more taxes. The anguish, fear, and pain  that the poor are suffering grows worse by the day. Rectify  this tariff that is really a disguised tax through an increase  in gasoline prices. Listen to the Congress' opinions. Join the  Congress by supporting this law that injects life into the  productive apparatus. [end recording]    Labor Minister Alfredo Corral termed as understandable the  workers' strike [words indistinct] that the economic measures  are harsh. He urged workers to conduct protests in a peaceful  and calm manner. [Begin Corral recording] We understand that  the harsh measures that the government had to implement caused a  popular reaction. The dialogue, however, is still completely  open to deal with this and any other problems. We think [words  indistinct] decrease in funds caused by a drop in oil prices,  the paralysis of activities in the country. Quite to the  contrary, the country must produce more [word indistinct] with  the efforts and work of all Ecuadorans, and it will never [words  indistinct] solution to problems. [end recording]</p>

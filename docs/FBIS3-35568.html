The Central News Unit reports that Mr. Mohajerani, head of  the Committee for Supporting the Palestine Islamic Revolution  [CSPIR], in an exclusive interview stated: The Islamic Republic  of Iran is ready to send pharmaceutical and food aid to those  who suffered from the recent Zionist atrocity in Hebron through  international relief organizations.    On the effects of the atrocity on the process of the  Gaza-Jericho accord, the head of CSPIR said: The territory of  occupied Palestine has witnessed a new move and fervor within  the intifada. Though Nazareth used to be considered a safe city  for the Zionists so far, it has witnessed popular revolt in  recent days.    Referring to the fact that the recent Zionist action has  once  again exposed the false claims of those professing to support  human rights, Mr. Mohajerani said: In line with other Islamic  nations, Islamic states must also make a serious decision to  resolve the Palestine issue.    In conclusion, he called on the people of Iran to take  another practical step toward supporting the oppressed  Palestinians by their solid presence on Jersusalem Day.</p>

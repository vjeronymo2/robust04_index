			<p>BFN   <F P=106> ["froe" report: "DIHT Opposes European Social Standard"] </F>   [Text] Bonn -- The Federation of German Chambers of  Industry and Commerce [DIHT] has come out against a  harmonization of the social policy of the European Union [EU] at  the present time. The top organization of the industrial and  trade chambers criticized the Commission's "Green Paper on  European Social Policy" by saying that the authors want to  pursue "social policy under the cover of an `active' labor  market policy."    The Green Paper is to show ways to fulfill the demand of the  Maastricht Treaty to have European integration accompanied by  sociopolitical measures.    The DIHT welcomes the approach of the Green Paper, according  to which "social progress is possible only by means of economic  success," and also agrees that the social services must be used  more purposefully to provide greater incentives to look for  work. In this way the DIHT thinks that the wrong use of state  funds for the labor market could be reduced and employment  increased.    However, the top organization thinks that the authors of the  Green Paper do not pursue their own principles any further.  When they make the right to work the starting point of European  social policy, which the EU members must fulfill by means of  jobs that are subsidized by the state, this can no longer be  brought in harmony with the principle of economic compatibility,  the DIHT says. The EU's social safeguard systems have already  reached the limits of their economic capacity. The DIHT also  has budget policy reasons for warning against a uniformly high  standard of social services, in particular since the levels of  social achievement are still very different in the individual  countries.    The DIHT also calls into question the "right of the  individual to advanced training throughout his or her working  life," which the authors of the Green Paper postulate. Such a  right would decouple qualifications from the requirements of the  labor market "and thus have an effect contrary to what the EU  Commission is striving for." Separating qualifications from  company policy would, at the same time, require state financing,  which none of the EU states could guarantee. Rather, the  working people's own interest must be mobilized to contribute  themselves to competitiveness on the labor market and to use  their money and leisure time for this purpose.</p>

			<p>930928 FT  28 SEP 93 / The FT Review of Business Books (18): Change for its own sake / Government THE REFORMING ORGANISATION By Nils Brunsson &amp; Johan P Olsen Routledge Pounds 12.99 240 pages The Reforming Organisation is an excellent example of current European thinking about organisational rejuvenation or renewal. Modern organisations often believe it is possible to change organisational structures and processes by rational choice and design. Indeed, organisations often go through a series of different reforms. The success or failure of such initiatives is never evaluated, and the failure of old reforms that supposedly make new reforms necessary does not seem to reduce the belief in reform in general as an approach to accomplishing change. The Reforming Organisation sets itself a threefold agenda. First, why it is that reform efforts occur. Second, why reformers propose specific solutions. Third, the effects of reforms. The authors' contention is that the origins, content and effects of reforms are best explained, not by the rational model so loved in the US, but by environmental and other external factors. Their conclusion is that attempted reform often stabilises and legitimises common conceptions in organisations, rather than leading necessarily to real change. But true optimism about organisational learning and renewal can only arise from a thorough understanding of what condemns most organisations to sub-optimal performance. The Reforming Organisation is unlikely to star in the show-biz gravy trail of management consultancy, but it is essential for anyone interested in organisational transformation.</p>

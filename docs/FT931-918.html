			<p>930327 FT  27 MAR 93 / Lamont urged to clarify Bank aid LABOUR LAST night reacted to the disclosure that some banks are receiving financial support from the Bank of England by calling for a government statement on the nature of the support. Mr Alistair Darling, the party's City spokesman, said there was 'a clear contrast' between the Bank's prompt action to save some banks and the 'marked reluctance' of the government and financial institutions to save struggling manufacturers. His comments followed the disclosure that a number of small and medium-sized banks had received financial support in the second half of 1991 and that some of them were still in receipt of Bank funds. Mr Darling said Mr Lamont should explain both how much was spent and where the support came from. 'The chancellor must say whether it was the Bank of England's money, or whether the Bank persuaded other banks to put together support packages,' he added. He called for the Bank to say whether it gave implicit or explicit guarantees to any bank as part of a support exercise. He planned to ask Mr Lamont to encourage banks to show 'a similar understanding' in their relationships with industrial and other commercial concerns.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] Neither the military collegium of the Russian  Supreme Court, nor court martials or other courts of the Russian  Federation ever considered the criminal case of former Soviet  citizen Vladimir Rezun (Viktor Suvorov) and sentenced him to  death for high treason in absentia, the military collegium's  press office said Tuesday.    Former officer of the Main Intelligence Department of the  General Staff (Russian abbreviation GRU), Vladimir Rezun,  defected from Geneva to Great Britain in 1978 after four years  of work in Geneva as a fixed-post espionage officer. At  present, 47-years-old Rezun lives in a military base in Great  Britain under protection and teaches in a military educational  establishment.    As he repeatedly said, Rezun was sentenced to death in the  Soviet Union after his defection.    Rezun has written seven books. The Ice-Breaker which he  signed as Viktor Suvorov is the most popular. In the book, Rezun  based on open Soviet publications to prove that "the Soviet  Union was the main culprit and the main instigator of the World  War II" and that "the Communists unleashed the war in Europe by  the hands of Hitler in the 30s and were preparing a swift strike  against Hitler himself to seize the Europe he had destroyed."    The Ice-Breaker was published in many countries. In 1992  more than 300,000 copies were printed in Russia. Rezun gave a  news conference in Moscow on April 13 when he answered  journalists' questions over the telephone from Britain.</p>

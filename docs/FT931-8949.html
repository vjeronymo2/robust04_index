			<p>930217 FT  17 FEB 93 / A long-term commitment to cost cuts: How ministers who are keen to reduce the immense social security budget are boxed in by manifesto commitments - Public Spending Review / Social Services THE SOCIAL security department's budget is the largest target in the sights of the government's review of public expenditure. As the highest spending department - Pounds 74bn this year, more than a quarter of government spending - it is where the biggest savings might be expected. Also, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, like Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury who is carrying out the review, is on the Conservative right and might be expected to be enthusiastic about the unthinkable in seeking new ways to cut public spending. But, eager though he might be to curtail public spending, Mr Lilley will find it hard to offer Mr Portillo savings that will make much impact before the next century. Indeed, he might find that the withdrawal of the state from some central areas of social security will initially cost money, rather than saving it. The elderly get nearly half the social security cake, most of it for the flat-rate basic pension paid to almost everyone over state retirement age - 65 for men and 60 for women. The basic pension accounts for about a third of the social security budget and 10 per cent of public spending as a whole. Yet while it is an important part of most pensioner incomes it is of declining importance to the growing numbers who retire with substantial occupational pensions and savings. Until now most attention has focused on ways in which the state could stop paying the basic pension to the minority of pensioners who are well-enough off to provide for themselves. In previous years the government has made much of targeting additional help to the most needy through means-tested benefits. One policy option - under consideration by Labour's Commission on Social Justice - would be to extend means-testing to the state pension. But Mr Lilley seems to have set his face against offering Mr Portillo a means-tested pension. One reason is that it would involve breaking a manifesto promise to continue paying the pension as at present and uprating it annually in line with inflation. There is also a strong Conservative aversion to further 'intrusive' means-testing, well expressed in a recent pamphlet by Mr David Willetts, the MP for Havant who formerly directed the Centre for Policy Studies, the think tank founded by Baroness Thatcher and Lord Joseph. The other options likely to be considered are no easier. Mr Willetts wants to spend more on some pensioners - the over-80s - who are less likely than recently retired pensioners to have substantial income from savings or occupational pensions, and so are more likely to be at the lower end of the income distribution. To pay for this, Mr Willetts proposes raising the retirement age to 65 for all (and possibly to 67 eventually). Some of the Pounds 3bn saved in this way could be ploughed into higher pensions for the over-80s - which could later be phased out as all pensioners came to enjoy some private pension income. The savings from such a move would be slow in coming through. A similar delay in reaping savings may be expected from proposals from the Adam Smith Institute, the free-market think tank, to extract the state from the provision of welfare benefits. Dr Madsen Pirie, institute president, will unveil a strategy he describes as the privatisation of choice in a pamphlet to be published tomorrow. This extends the approach adopted by Sir Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman, in offering incentives to people who opt out of the state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) into personal pension policies. The institute will advocate incentives for people who opt out of other parts of the welfare state, especially the fast-growing sickness and invalidity benefits. No one would lose entitlement to the present welfare benefits if they wished to stick with them, so no manifesto pledges need be broken. The policies which qualified for the incentives would, like the pension policies which allow opting out of Serps, guarantee minimum levels of benefits. The problem is that providing incentives to opt out would almost certainly add to the cost in the short term. The Serps incentives have cost more than Pounds 6bn, which might not be recouped through the payment of lower pensions for a very long time. These are not the only ideas on the table for the Portillo review. There is interest in the idea that employers, rather than the state, should be responsible for industrial disablement benefits. This would make little impact on the Pounds 650m these benefits will cost next year, but would mean that no more people would become eligible in future. Ministers might also consider making individuals responsible for their own unemployment insurance, to eat into the Pounds 2bn-a-year cost of unemployment benefit. If this also included cover for mortgage payments, some of the more than Pounds 10bn of income support paid to the unemployed might be saved. Again, both measures could only be applied to people becoming unemployed in the future, reducing the immediate savings that would be possible. Ministers may also find time to return to an earlier proposal from Mr Willetts to freeze child benefit at its present level and concentrate future increases on the under-fives, whose family income is usually affected by the mother stopping work. As with basic pension, however, there are manifesto commitments that would make it hard to touch the Pounds 6bn child benefit bill before the next election. All this suggests that Mr Lilley and Mr Portillo will find it hard to make significant savings in the social security budget in the near future. In spite of the size of the target, ministers are boxed in by manifesto commitments and the cost of persuading taxpayers to switch from state welfare benefits to private provision.</p>

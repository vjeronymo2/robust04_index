			<p>940630 FT  30 JUN 94 / Lifelong socialist takes charge: Tomiichi Murayama, a fisherman's son, is Japan's new PM Mr Tomiichi Murayama, Japan's fourth premier in less than a year, is a lifelong socialist, with no previous experience in a ministerial post. The 70-year-old Mr Murayama became chairman of the Social Democratic party last September after the resignation of Mr Sadao Yamahana, who stepped down in order to take responsibility for the party's poor showing in the election that summer. Mr Seishiro Fukuda, editor of the party newspaper Shakai Shinpo, described him at the time as a politician who had no distinct policy platform. 'He is a harmoniser who will play a balancing role.' But his attempts to balance the opposing wings of his own party created little harmony for the coalition formed as a result of that election. The socialists repeatedly threatened to leave the government. They started out opposing the opening up of the country's rice markets and initially opposed the reform measures of the Hosokawa government. In February this year, the uneasy truce between the socialists and their nominal allies in government threatened to break down completely when Mr Hosokawa tried to push through a sharp increase in consumption tax to offset cuts in income tax. The socialists' opposition forced the government to drop the plan. The strains of office finally proved too much for the party in April when the new government of Mr Tsutomu Hata constructed a conservative grouping within the coalition. Hours before the vote yesterday Mr Murayama was still involved in negotiations with Mr Hata. When these broke down he won the backing of most members of the Liberal Democratic party. He takes office at the head of a government dominated by the LDP, which had been the conservative ruler of Japan for nearly 40 years and, until last night, the new prime minister's inveterate political foe. A striking figure, tall and stooping with bushy eyebrows, Mr Murayama is a former trade union official. The fifth son of a fisherman from Oita prefecture in southern Japan, he attended Meiji University in Tokyo. He spent several years in local politics before being elected to the lower house of the Diet in 1972.</p>

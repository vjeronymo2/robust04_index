			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Kuala Lumpur, Wed -- The Royal Malaysian Air Force  [RMAF] today received the first of its 10 British Aerospace  [BAe] Hawk 100 twin-seater advanced jet-trainer aircraft from  BAe Defence Military Aircraft Division in Warton, United Kingdom  [UK].    On hand to receive the aircraft from BAe Defence Military  Aircraft Division director Kevin Smith was RMAF chief Lieutenant  General Datuk Abdul Ghani Aziz.    The Warton factory will also supply 18 Hawk 200 single-seat  ground attack aircraft to the RMAF.    The Government ordered the Hawks in December 1990, costing  more than RM1.2 billion, including equipment training aids,  spare parts and ground support equipment.    In his speech, Kevin said the delivery marked a significant  milestone for BAe as Malaysia represented the first sale of the  Hawk 100 and 200 series in ASEAN.    "We fully recognise that the successful introduction of the  Hawk into service in Malaysia is of prime importance to both the  RMAF and BAe," he said.    Excerpts of his speech was released in a statement issued by  BAe here.    Abdul Ghani later toured the plant to view the other Hawks  being assembled.    The Hawk 100 is equipped with high-technology avionics  including a high performance laser initial navigation unit, new  generation Head-Up Display/Weapon Aiming Computer (HUN/WAC) as  well as high accuracy Air Data Sensor.    In addition, the aircraft is also equipped with a  Forward-Looking Infra Rec (FLIR) and laser range finder which  lets the pilot complete his mission day or night and in poor  weather conditions.    The same system will help the pilot to deliver its weapons  accurately.    The Hawk 100 is powered by the Rolls Royce 871 Adour engines  with refinements to the wings to include a new combat flap  setting.    The addition of such sophisticated equipment is not at the  expense of the aircraft's proven reliability and maintainability.    The Hawk 200 is the only aircraft in its class to be fitted  with a sophisticated Hughes AN/APG-66H multimode pulse doppler  radar.    The improved cockpit has been designed to provide good  all-round visibility and the pilot's workload in attack is  reduced by the Hotas.    Ground support equipment and spares are being shipped from  the UK to Malaysia and BAe field representatives are now in  Malaysia to assist in their implementation.    BAe had also begun training RMAF technicians as of last June  and pilot conversion training has been conducted since early  this month.    The sale of the Hawks have generated participation of local  aviation companies in co-manufacturing of parts and maintenance  of the aircraft to off-set the cost of buying the aircraft.    Among them are SME [Expansion unknown] Technologies Sdn Bhd  [Company Limited] which are involved in manufacturing weapons  pylons and Airod Sdn Bhd for engine servicing and overhauling.    Apart from that, BAe is also involved in transferring  on-board technology computer software to the RMAF.</p>

			<p>921127 FT  27 NOV 92 / Parliament and Politics: School fees ruling raises wider issues - Robert Rice and Andrew Jack on how Hansard was cited to clarify legislation AFTER many years of dispute, lawyers and accountants were yesterday digesting the impact of the Law Lords' decision in the Pepper vs Hart case. At issue was whether schoolmasters were permitted to pay fees at marginal cost for their children attending the school at which they taught, without them being taxed as a benefit. Had they lost, thousands of employees could have faced changes in benefits provided by their employers. By ruling in their favour, the Law Lords have raised far wider constitutional questions over the extent to which ministerial statements in Hansard - the official report of parliamentary debates - can be used to help clarify the intention of a piece of legislation. The Law Lords said it was common ground that concessionary fees more than covered the additional cost to the school of educating the taxpayers' children and that the childrens' education at reduced fees was a taxable benefit under the 1976 Finance Act. The crucial question was how much should be treated as an emolument - the cash equivalent of the benefit. The taxpayers argued that the only expense incurred by the school 'in or in connection with' the education of their children was the additional or marginal cost to the school. The Revenue argued that the expense incurred in or in connection with the provision of education for children of the taxpayers was the same as the expense for all other pupils. Therefore the expense of educating any one child was a proportionate part of the cost of running the whole school. The Law Lords said the cost to the employer of providing an 'in-house benefit' for the employee (in this case concessionary education) depended on whether the courts could look behind the language of the statute to reports of parliamentary proceedings in order to determine the true legislative intention of parliament. The taxpayers would win if the courts were allowed to refer to parliamentary material as an aid to statutory interpretation, as was clear from a reading of Hansard covering parliamentary debates on the 1976 act and from statements made by the financial secretary at the time. But if the courts were not entitled to refer to parliamentary material, a literal interpretation of the 1976 act meant the Revenue's argument would succeed. Under present law there is a general rule (the exclusionary rule) dating back to 1769 that references to parliamentary material as an aid to statutory construction are not allowed. Although the courts' attitude to this rule had varied, they had made reference to reports which lead to legislation. But until 1989 there was no modern case in which a court had looked at parliamentary debates as an aid to construction. In 1989 the House of Lords made big inroads by looking at a minister's parliamentary words to help them decide a statutory regulation's meaning. Mr Anthony Lester, QC for the teachers, argued that where the words of a statute were ambiguous or obscure or were capable of giving rise to an absurd conclusion it should be legitimate to look at the parliamentary history to identify the intention of parliament. But he said the exclusion rule should not be relaxed entirely. The attorney-general argued that the rule had a sound constitutional and practical basis and should not be relaxed. The use of Hansard would constitute a 'questioning' of the freedom of speech or debate as it would involve an investigation of what a minister meant by the words he used, and would inhibit him in what he said by attaching legislative effect to his words. The Law Lords disagreed. The only real objection to a relaxation of the rule was that legal advisers would waste hours at the expense of litigants researching parliamentary intent. This would raise the cost of litigation. But Lord Browne-Wilkinson said it was easy to overestimate the cost of research. Hansard would show whether the minister said anything significant, making further research pointless. The Law Lords therefore said the rule should be relaxed to allow reference to parliamentary material where: Legislation was ambiguous, obscure or led to an absurdity. The material relied or consisted of one or more statements of a minister or other promoter of a bill. The statements relied on were clear. Looking behind the language of the 1976 act it was clear the teachers must win the appeal.</p>

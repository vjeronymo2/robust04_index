			<p>931214 FT  14 DEC 93 / UK Company News: Greene King below expectations at Pounds 9.6m Depressed conditions in the East Anglian beer market hit Greene King's first half pre-tax profits which, on an adjusted basis, rose 1 per cent to Pounds 9.6m. The result was below market expectations and the shares lost 15p to close at 553p. The company sells two thirds of its beer volumes in East Anglia, but managed to restrict its sales decline to 1 per cent against a reduction in overall market demand of 7 per cent. 'The region is the most depressed in the country,' said Mr Simon Redman, chairman. 'There is little evidence of a pick-up there, though in our new trading areas further south there are now some signs of recovery.' On an FRS 3 basis, pre-tax profits for the six months to October 31 rose 41 per cent to Pounds 9.5m, but the figure was distorted by exceptional costs of Pounds 2.8m last year for the bid for Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer. Mr Redman said that no further move against Morland, in which Greene King retains a 29 per cent stake, was imminent. 'We shall continue to keep our options open,' he added. Trading profit of Pounds 12.7m was 5 per cent lower on turnover ahead 4 per cent at Pounds 70.2m. Spending on brand advertising increased from Pounds 1m to Pounds 1.6m. Apart from difficult trading in its home region, the company faced competitive discounting in the free pub trade. Profits reflected a slight reverse in volumes and margins; but bad debt provisions of Pounds 620,000 were in line with last year. Volumes in the take-home market, which accounts for 3 per cent of sales, rose 6 per cent. Managed pubs, increased to 194 with the acquisition in September of 44 outlets from Bass, improved margins and raised drinks sales 13 per cent and food sales 57 per cent. Food's share of total sales grew from 11 per cent to 13 per cent. Profits of the company's 676 tenanted pubs were marginally higher in spite of a decline in beer volumes. Capital spending on pub acquisitions totalled Pounds 19m and a further Pounds 3.16m was spent on pub improvements, a third of it on the tenanted estate. Borrowings at the half year end amounted to Pounds 99.8m and gearing rose from 34 per cent to 42 per cent. Adjusted earnings per share came out at 16.4p (16.3p), and the interim dividend is raised 4 per cent to 3.85p (3.7p).</p>

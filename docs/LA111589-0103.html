			<p><P> November 15, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> BETTING WITH BOB  </P> <P> Beginning with today's Hollywood Park thoroughbred meeting opening card, Times  handicapper Bob Mieszerski will make at least one wager on racing days.  </P> <P> He begins this feature with a mythical $1,000 bankroll. He could make a  straight win bet, he could make a daily double bet, he could make an exacta  bet, he could make other exotic bets, or any combination of bets. But, he will  make at least one bet.  </P> <P> His winnings and/or losses will be chronicled each day, indicating his  beginning bankroll, what he wagered the previous day and the status of his  current bankroll that day.  </P> <P> For today's opening card, Bob will bet a total of $60 -- or $20 across ($20 to  win, $20 to place and $20 to show) -- on Portal in the third race.  </P></p>

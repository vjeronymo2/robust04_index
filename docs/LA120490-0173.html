			<p><P> December 4, 1990, Tuesday, P.M. Final  </P> <P> DAVIS, SCHOTT MAKE UP AFTER SHE FOOTS BILL  </P> <P> Outfielder Eric Davis, who accused the Cincinnati Reds of appearing to forget  about him when he was hospitalized after a World Series injury, has been  reimbursed for the cost of his medically equipped return flight, Davis' agent  said.  </P> <P> Eric Goldschmidt said Reds owner Marge Schott authorized reimbursement of about  $18,000 for the specially equipped airplane that carried him from Oakland to  Cincinnati after the World Series.  </P> <P> Goldschmidt said Reds General Manager Bob Quinn originally had declined to  approve the reimbursement.  </P> <P> "As soon as Marge learned all the details, she was willing to make the  payment," Goldschmidt said. "The Reds didn't have to pay for it, following just  the letter of the rules, but it's the sort of thing any professional  organization would do for one of its players."  </P> <P> The issue became a sore point for Davis, who said he thought the Reds had  forgotten about him after he injured a kidney in the fourth game of the World  Series and remained behind in an Oakland hospital for treatment.  </P> <P> Davis injured himself while making a diving attempt at a catch in left field.  </P> <P> He said the Reds wouldn't return his phone calls as he lay in the Oakland  hospital.  </P> <P> Schott and Davis met privately Nov. 1 after Davis returned to Cincinnati, and  they had a joint news conference the following day at Davis' home to tell  reporters they had patched up their differences.  </P> <P> "Time heals all wounds," Davis said then. "Marge took a big step in calling me,  even if it was a little late."  </P></p>

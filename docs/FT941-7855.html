			<p>940223 FT  23 FEB 94 / Lobbyists cool to self-regulation Five of the largest lobbying firms have teamed up to produce proposals for a self-regulating regime for the industry. But they told MPs yesterday that they would rather be regulated by parliament. Mr Michael Burrell, managing director of Westminster Strategy, told MPs on the committee of members' interests that the suggestions were only the second-best approach. Self-regulation could lead to a perception that the industry was acting as judge and jury, he said. He added that a system similar to the register of members' interests, which records pecuniary interests and other material benefits received by MPs, would 'command more respect' than anything the industry could put forward. The five firms - Westminster Strategy, European Political Consultancy Group, GJW Government Relations, Ian Greer Associates and The Public Policy Unit - are proposing to set up a Association of Political Consultants. The five account for at least Pounds 10m of turnover between them. This body would propose a code of professional practice and impose a number of ethical duties on its members. It would be responsible for disciplining its members should the code of practice be breached. It would also maintain a voluntary register of professional lobbyists. The firms said: 'We believe that the voluntary principle would avoid the administrative complications associated with such a wide remit while highlighting those who refuse to register.' Referring to alternative proposals under which the Public Relations Consultants Association would administer a registration system and code of conduct for lobbyists, the firms said it would be 'inappropriate' for a body representing the public relations industry to regulate professional lobbyists. Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, has said a voluntary code of registration would be preferable to a register that was imposed.</p>

			<p>931020 FT  20 OCT 93 / UK Company News: One word which shook a bank - Andrew Jack and John Gapper consider Samuel Montagu's damages IT COULD prove the most expensive single word answer ever given in corporate history. It may cost Samuel Montagu more than Pounds 180m, and was yesterday sounding alarms at other merchant banks in the City of London. In August 1987, Mr Ian McIntosh, then Montagu's head of corporate finance, attended a meeting of about 30 people at the offices of Slaughter &amp; May, the law firm representing British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings, the financial services group. B&amp;C wanted a reassurance from Montagu that its client had the money to complete a purchase. Mr McIntosh was asked and replied, simply: 'Yes.' The client was Quadrex, a Delaware corporation controlled by Mr Gary Klesch. It was threatening to make a rival bid for Mercantile House Holdings. Quadrex would hold back if B&amp;C agreed to sell it Mercantile's wholesale broking division after the acquisition. B&amp;C, in turn, needed the proceeds from the sale of Quadrex to allow its Mercantile bid to go ahead. Mr McIntosh was asked to give his assurance after Quadrex said there was no time to prepare full documentation, which would require a meeting of its credit committees. But after the acquisition, Quadrex failed to provide the cash. That ultimately helped drive B&amp;C into administration in 1990 with debts of Pounds 1bn. On Monday Montague was ordered to pay damages of Pounds 172m to B&amp;C's creditors with further payments possible. Mr John Gunn, then head of B&amp;C and now with Midland and Scottish, yesterday recalled the meeting that began five years of litigation. 'From my lawyers I believed that an oral statement was as good as a written contract.' Mr Gunn is unrepentant about relying on that single word of assurance. 'You don't need to see a loan document. A merchant bank earns its money by putting its reputation at the beck and call of the client,' he said. Opinion was divided yesterday over whether the judgment would make bankers more circumspect. One corporate financier said it would make him far more cautious about signing 'highly confident' letters in which merchant banks gave assurances that their clients were able to lay hands on funds for mergers and acquisitions. 'I signed one of those letters last week, but if you put it in front of me today I would not do the same thing,' he said. This was because he believed the judgment did not take full account of what Mr McIntosh meant by his reply. He argued that an assurance that a client has funds usually means there is a credit facility in place from banks. However, such credit facilities will usually contain provisions that mean that they can be withdrawn in some circumstances. 'If you tell the man in the street, funds are available, he understands that there is a pile of cash next door. But when a corporate financier says it, it does not mean quite the same. Most people in the City know that,' he said. However, other bankers argued that they would be wary about making such an unqualified verbal assurance as Mr McIntosh in a minuted meeting. It would be more common to sign a letter with a number of disclaimers and conditions. 'With a letter like that, you hedge it around with such a lot of conditions that you are protected, quite frankly. There tend to be clauses about current market conditions, and so on,' said one corporate financier. The 'highly confident' letter, pioneered by Drexel Burnham Lambert, the failed US investment bank, in the US during the 1980s takeover boom, is one case of an assurance given by a merchant bank in order to allow a transaction. Another UK example is the requirement of the Takeover Panel that a compulsory takeover offer must carry a merchant bank assurance. In cases of public takeovers, the bank is protected if it has carried out inquiries diligently in good faith. The most notable case in which a merchant bank has come to grief over an assurance was that involving Kleinwort Benson and the 1985 purchase of House of Fraser, the stores group, by the Fayed brothers, who were Kleinwort's client. Kleinwort was subsequently criticised by Department of Trade and Industry inspectors for allowing statements in its name that the Fayeds had sufficient funds to finance the offer, without taking adequate steps to verify the truth. Most corporate financiers believe that the House of Fraser case, along with a general tightening of the regulatory regime, has already made them careful about giving assurances. The Samuel Montagu judgment will only mark a further push towards caution. 'I suppose it will make some sloppy operators tighten up a bit,' said one, 'But it is bog standard to be asked to give this sort of assurance. Not many people will give them without being positive that they are telling the truth.'</p>

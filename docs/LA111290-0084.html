			<p><P> November 12, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> GREEN BAY USES MAJIK TO BEAT THE SHELL GAME;  </P> <P> PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDER COACH LOSES FOR FIRST TIME AT COLISEUM AS PACKER  QUARTERBACK THROWS TWO TOUCHDOWN PASSES.  </P> <P> The Raiders came home Sunday expecting a hot meal and a quick fix at the  Coliseum, the way it has always been under Coach Art Shell. Instead, a 10-game  home winning streak snapped like a toothpick, giving way to a two-game streak  of another kind and some speculation concerning the course of Shell's ship.  </P> <P> The Green Bay Packers tiptoed in, blemishes and all, and departed with a 29-16  victory before a crowd of 50,855.  </P> <P> On the subject of packs, the Raiders seem to be coming back to theirs in the  AFC West, where only a last-second loss by Kansas City keeps the Raiders atop  the division that seemed theirs for the taking only a few weeks ago.  </P> <P> Of course, a few weeks ago, quarterback Jay Schroeder led the conference in  passing, only to topple three pegs in last week's loss and no doubt a few more  after Sunday's performance: 11 for 23, three interceptions, no touchdowns.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, the Raider defense would have stuffed a team that dared bring  to the game a rushing attack led by its quarterback's 170 yards in eight games.  </P> <P> Sunday, the Packers unwrapped a football cryogenics project named Michael  Haddix and watched him more than double his seasonal output with 69 yards in 20  carries. The Packer offense had the ball almost twice as long as the Raiders.  </P> <P> A few weeks ago, the Raiders were a clean-hitting football machine that minded  its manners and penalties. But 10 more penalties Sunday made it 21 flags in two  consecutive losses. "We're going to have to evaluate the last two weeks,"  tailback Marcus Allen said. "Because we're going in the wrong direction. Art's  said time and time again the good teams start winning games and step forward.  We took a step backward last week and we took a step backward today. Everyone's  really upset about it. I'm upset about it. We just can't let it happen  anymore."  </P> <P> The Raiders made some big plays, sacking Green Bay quarterback Don Majkowski  eight times, but to what end? No one made a sack when it counted. Majkowski  bled the Raider secondary with a precision short passing game, and kept the  over-eager Raider pass rush off balance with draw plays to Haddix.  </P> <P> Haddix said it was clear the Raiders had their sights set on Majkowski, not  him.  </P> <P> "Any time you do that you're susceptible to some draws," Haddix said. "I think  they knew that, but they really didn't expect our running game to do what it  did today."  </P> <P> The score was 16-16 at halftime, thanks to scoring runs of five and two yards  by Marcus Allen on the Raiders' first two possessions. The first touchdown was  set up by a 48-yard pass interference penalty, the second on an 87-yard kickoff  return by Jamie Holland.  </P> <P> But the Packers dominated the second half, using key third-down conversions and  clock control while outscoring their opponent, 13-0.  </P> <P> Green Bay took the lead for good, 19-16, on a 23-yard field goal by Chris Jacke  with 12:57 left in the third quarter. Jacke would kick five field goals in all,  setting a franchise record.  </P> <P> For this one he could thank Schroeder, whose first pass of the second half was  intercepted by linebacker Johnny Holland, who returned it 32 yards to the  Raider nine.  </P> <P> It was downhill for the Raiders' offense after that, unless you can appreciate  the beauty of three-yard rushes and punts. Bo Jackson managed 25 yards in 10  carries. The Raiders are 1-2 since he switched cleats. Allen finished with 17  yards in five carries.  </P> <P> The defense took its shots at Majkowski, but he kept shooting back.  </P> <P> Late in a key third-quarter drive, Greg Townsend and Bob Golic combined on a  seven-yard sack of Majkowski, leaving the Packers with third and 19 at their  42. But the Raiders couldn't hold. On the next play, Majkowski extended the  drive with a 29-yard pass to Perry Kemp to the Raiders' 27. The Raiders shoved  the Packers back one yard on first down, but Majkowski shoved back on second  when he tossed a 28-yard scoring pass to Kemp in the right corner of the end  zone.  </P> <P> That put the Packers ahead, 26-16, with 14:53 remaining. Majkowski had slipped  away again.  </P> <P> "It frustrates you a little," Golic said. "You stop them on the run on first  downs, and he's able to drop off the ball for just enough to get the first  down. You think you've got him hit, then he drops a 28-yarder in the end zone.  </P> <P> The Raiders had several chances to get back in the game, the biggest when  Schroeder's third-down pass at the Green Bay 41 fell incomplete with 11:04  left. The Raiders elected to punt from there, handing the ball back to the  Packers, who would not turn the ball back to the Raiders until there was 3:19  remaining and the game was out of reach.  </P> <P> On the drive, which produced no points for Green Bay, Majkowski kept possession  with key plays. On third and five at his 25, he passed eight yards to receiver  Jeff Query. On third and four at his 39, Majkowski passed six yards to Clarence  Weathers. On third and seven at the Raiders' 48, Majkowski scrambled nine yards  for another first down. All the while the clock was ticking, and all the  Raiders could do was watch.  </P> <P> The Raiders took a last gasp from their 12 with 3:19 to play, but Green Bay  linebacker Tim Harris sacked Schroeder on first and second down. On third down,  a Schroeder pass intended for someone was intercepted by cornerback Jerry  Holmes, who returned it 24 yards to the Raider four, setting up Jacke's fifth  field goal with 17 seconds remaining.  </P> <P> For the Raiders, Sunday's loss was a team effort.  </P> <P> "We just didn't play well," Shell said. "The whole football team. It was our  worst game of the year. No one in that room could say they did well. I did a  bad coaching job, I didn't get them ready to play. That's my job to do and I  didn't get it done."  </P> <P> Not even at home.  </P> <P> Raider Notes  </P> <P> Backup quarterback Steve Beuerlein was inactive for the seventh consecutive  week after receiving a two-game roster exemption to start the season. Asked why  Beuerlein hasn't been activated, Raiders' Coach Art Shell responded, "He's  always been activated. He's just de-activated on game day." . . . The Packers'  Don Majkowski completed 16 of 26 passes for 195 yards with two touchdowns and  one interceptions.  </P> <P> Jay Schroeder was sacked five times. He had been sacked 12 times in eight  previous games. "You don't play the position and not expect pressure,"  Schroeder said. "That's part of what I do." . . . Defensive end Greg Townsend  had another big game, recording eight solo tackles and 2 1/2 sacks to bring his  season sack total to 9 1/2. . . . Scott Davis had three sacks and five tackles,  Bob Golic was credited with 1 1/2 sacks and Howie Long recorded one. . . . The  Raiders were held to 53 rushing yards. . . . Sunday's roster card listed Green  Bay's coach as Andy Intente. It's Lindy Infante, of course. Infante was told of  the mistake afterward. "They'll know our name now," he snapped.  </P> <P> * MIKE DOWNEY: Packers drew their inspiration from unlikely source.

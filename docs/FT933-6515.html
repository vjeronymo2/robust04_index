			<p>930827 FT  27 AUG 93 / Lib Dems to push policies on crime THE Liberal Democrats are to use their conference next month to stake their claim as the party able to tackle crime effectively, aiming to reinforce their appeal to disaffected Conservative supporters. Although the conference takes place against a background of impressive recent by-election successes, hopes of a trouble-free occasion may be hindered by a split among its policymakers over uprating the state pension. The high-profile initiative on crime, which will include a party political broadcast, an eve-of-conference rally and two conference debates, will be spearheaded by Mr Robert Maclennan, home affairs spokesman, and Mr David Alton, MP for Mossley Hill. But Mr Alton's appointment offers some ammunition to the party's opponents, since he was the subject of dismissive comments from Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, at last September's conference. Mr Alton threatened to leave the party over its policy on abortion. Mr Ashdown replied that: 'His departure, though sad, will not in any way alter the effectiveness of our party or our capacity to put our message across.' Launching the conference agenda yesterday, Mr Charles Kennedy, Liberal Democrat president, emphasised that Mr Alton had been reconciled with his colleagues. The prospect of a clash over pension policy appears less easily resolved. The motion from the party's policy committee proposes a shift away from the general election manifesto commitment to uprate the basic state pension in line with earnings, in favour of uprating it in line with prices, together with extra help for those most in need. An amendment tabled by Mr Archy Kirkwood, the party's social security spokesman, however, favours keeping the uprating link with earnings, and meeting the cost from income tax.</p>

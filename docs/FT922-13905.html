			<p>920409 FT  09 APR 92 / International Company News: Hafnia's 1991 accounts delayed THE BOARD of Hafnia Holding, the beleaguered Danish insurance group, failed to approve the 1991 accounts after meeting all day yesterday. A brief statement said that the board would complete its deliberations by April 10 at the latest. Hafnia's shares were suspended on the Copenhagen and other stock exchanges on Monday as speculation about the future of the group mounted. After heavy and costly investments in Baltica, its Danish rival, and Skandia, the Swedish insurer, the group is expected to report a substantial loss for 1991. Since its investment in Skandia in December, when the Danish company, together with Norway's UNI Storebrand, tried to gain control of the Swedish group, Hafnia has maintained almost complete silence on the progress of talks with Skandia. Monday's statement to the stock exchanges said the negotiations with Skandia were reaching a conclusive phase, but this assertion was not supported in comments from either Skandia or UNI. Speculation in Copenhagen yesterday was that Hafnia's attempt to gain control of Skandia might end in a complete reversal, with Skandia taking over Hafnia.</p>

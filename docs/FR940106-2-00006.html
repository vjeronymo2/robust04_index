			<p><!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->  <!-- PJG STAG 4703 -->  <!-- PJG ITAG l=11 g=1 f=1 --> On September 30, 1993, the Forest Service completed a review of an Environmental Impact Statement completed in 1983 and the Master Development Plan which was approved based on that Environmental Impact Statement. Based on that review, the Forest Supervisor determined that there was no need to supplement the 1983 Environmental Impact Statement or revise the Master Development Plan except for amendments to the Master Development Plan that may result from the analysis of the Mad River water withdrawal proposal.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Four amendments to the Master Development Plan would likely be required if the project proposal is approved: (1) Identify the Mad River as a source of water for snowmaking; (2) Identify the anticipated schedules and volumes for water withdrawal and any restrictions or requirements related to snowmaking water withdrawal; (3) Revise the Master Development Plan trails map so that it accurately displays the approved trail configuration for Sugarbush South; and (4) Update the Development Schedule (Appendix C in the Master Development Plan) so that it shows current estimates of completion dates for each phase of the previously approved development at Sugarbush.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The proposed snowmaking facilities, trail widening, construction, and improvement, and the actual snowmaking itself, would be located on National Forest System land operated under special use permit. Approval of these actions which would occur on National Forest System lands requires Forest Service authorization under the Special Use Permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> The Department of the Army permit program is authorized by section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, section 404 of the Clean Water Act, and section 103 of the Marine Protection Research and Sanctuaries Act. These laws require permits authorizing activities in or affecting navigable waters of the United States, the discharge of dredged or fill materials into waters of the United States, and the transportation of dredged material for the purpose of dumping it into ocean waters. The Corps must make a decision as to whether to issue a section 404 permit for activities associated with the Mad River water withdrawal. These activities include water withdrawal structures, holding pond, access road, and fill. The proposed water withdrawal site, storage pond, access road and most of the pipeline to the snowmaking facility would be located on private lands.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Several permits, certificates, or authorizations through the review processes established for the State of Vermont are also required to implement the proposed action. The District Environmental Commission must issue permits under the State of Vermont's Act 250 for various phases of the project. A 401 Certificate must be issued by the State Division of Water Quality. A Dam Permit must be issued by the State Agency of Natural Resources. At this time, all permits or authorizations required by the State of Vermont have been granted, except for one Act 250 permit to approve the trial improvements.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> Until a Record of Decision based on this EIS is issued, the Sugarbush Ski Area will continue to be managed according to the terms and conditions of the Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green Mountain National Forest, the Master Development Plan for the Sugarbush Valley Winter Sports Area, and the Special Use Permit.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline --> A range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed action will be considered in the analysis. Reasonable alternatives are those which fulfill the purpose and need for the proposals and address significant issues that are identified during the scoping process. The analysis may include an evaluation of feasible alternative water sources or storage sites which could be used either separately or in combination to meet snowmaking objectives while reducing or avoiding impacts to the aquatic environment. Only one specific alternative to the proposed action has been identified at this time. That is the ``no action'' alternative. If the ``no action'' alternative were selected, the proposed project would not take place at this time. Other alternatives will be developed based on the results of scoping.  <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG 0012 frnewline -->   <!-- PJG /ITAG -->  <!-- PJG /STAG --></p>

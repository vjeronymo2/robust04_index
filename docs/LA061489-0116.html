			<p><P> June 14, 1989, Wednesday, Home Edition  </P> <P> EVERYONE BUT KRAFT WINS AS CHEESE CONTEST GOES AWRY  </P> <P> Any way you slice it, Kraft General Foods comes out the loser in a weekend  contest promoting cheese that inadvertently produced too many winners for a  single grand prize.  </P> <P> Accusing the printer that prepared the game pieces of botching the job, Kraft  on Tuesday declared its "Ready to Roll" game "null and void because of an error  in printing."  </P> <P> "Instead of only a limited number of winning game pieces, essentially all of  the game pieces appear to be winning ones," said Michael Caruso, a Kraft  spokesman at headquarters in the Chicago suburb of Glenview. He declined to  identify the printer.  </P> <P> On behalf of miffed contestants, attorney Jay E. DeGroot filed a class-action  lawsuit Tuesday in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago. "A couple of people  called us," he said. DeGroot described the action as a breach of contract suit  but declined to elaborate.  </P> <P> Caruso said the company contends that it is "not liable for any legal action  because the contest was deceptive." Caruso said Kraft is evaluating how to  compensate would-be winners.  </P> <P> The game required entrants to match a "right-half" coupon inserted into Sunday  newspapers in Chicago and Houston with the "left-half" coupon found inside  specially marked packages of Kraft Singles cheese slices.  </P> <P> Matched pairs were to be redeemed for whatever they depicted: one of 500  skateboards, one of 100 bicycles, one of 8,000 free packages of cheese, or, at  odds of 15 million to 1, a 1990 Dodge Caravan LE valued at $17,000.  </P> <P> However, Kraft realized that the job had been bungled when, by one estimate, as  many as 100 people in the Chicago area called claiming to have won the van.  </P> <P> Even if Kraft, a unit of Philip Morris Cos., wriggles out of having to honor  all winning entries, the company's reputation could suffer in the short run.  </P> <P> "Any time something like this happens in the industry, it hurts all of us  because it raises doubt in the consumer's mind," said Ken Fehskens, president  of Ventura Associates, a service that runs sales promotions and contests.  </P> <P> To Chicagoans, the unintentionally generous game was reminiscent of a 1986  Beatrice Cos. promotion connected with Monday night football game scores.  </P> <P> In that case, Frank Maggio, a Georgia man working at the time for rival Procter  &amp; Gamble, cracked a pattern in the contest scratch-off cards and came up  with 4,018 winning entries worth, by his count, $16 million. When Beatrice  refused to honor them, he sued and eventually won a settlement that has been  estimated at several million dollars.  </P> <P> DeGroot's law firm, Lawrence W. Leck &amp; Associates, filed a separate  class-action suit on behalf of 2,400 plaintiffs in that case and reportedly won  a $2-million settlement last year.  </P></p>

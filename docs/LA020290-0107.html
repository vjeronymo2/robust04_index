			<p><P> February 2, 1990, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HILTON SAYS IT WANTS TO BE ALONE  </P> <P> Hilton Hotels Corp. hung out a do-not-disturb sign Thursday, saying it would  pass up buyout offers for now and try to negotiate a better deal or come up  with a restructuring plan.  </P> <P> The lodging-casino concern, which put itself up for sale last summer, said its  directors met Tuesday and Wednesday to consider bids and restructuring  proposals.  </P> <P> The board adjourned "without taking definitive action," Hilton said.  </P> <P> Its stock, which had traded as high as $115.50 a share last August, tumbled  $3.25 to $58.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.  </P> <P> Hilton said its board "instructed its financial advisers and management to  further develop the acquisition proposals and the alternate strategies and to  report back to the board on these matter within the next several weeks."  </P> <P> Hilton has effectively been up for sale since settlement of a dispute over the  estate of founder Conrad Hilton last May. The company formally invited offers  in August for all or part of its lodging and casino operations.  </P></p>

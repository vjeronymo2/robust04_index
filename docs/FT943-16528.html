			<p>940704 FT  04 JUL 94 / Company News (This Week): Spotlight likely to fall on fate of cash mountain - GEC City analysts are expecting a modest advance in pre-tax profits at GEC for the year to March, with forecasts ranging from Pounds 875m to Pounds 900m compared with the Pounds 863m made in 1992-93. The group's perpetually rising cash mountain is expected to have grown even bigger, possibly reaching Pounds 2.5bn compared with Pounds 2.2bn. The backlog of orders is also expected to look healthy, possibly topping Pounds 13bn, compared with Pounds 12.3bn last year. Although it came too late to affect the forthcoming figures, the company recently announced a large train construction contract in South Korea for GEC-Alsthom, its joint venture with Alcatel Alsthom of France. The market will be watching carefully for any announcement from Lord Weinstock, the managing director, about how he intends to spend the cash mountain; and also about how long he intends to continue working after his 70th birthday on July 29. Mr James Heal, electronics analyst at Hoare Govett who is projecting pre-tax profits of Pounds 895m, said questions will also be asked about the effect on the company of cost over-runs on the European Fighter Aircraft. The Eurofighter's future has also been overshadowed recently by doubts in Germany over the need for the project. Mr Brian Rusling, technology analyst at Yamichi, whose profit forecast is at the lower end of the range, said: 'I would be a little cautious about current trading conditions. The real attraction is the yield on the final dividend.' At Friday's close of 288p, the yield was about 4.5 per cent, above the FT-SE 100 average. The consensus forecast for the dividend is about 10.8p, a slight increase on last year's figure of 10.3p. Earnings per share are pencilled in at between 19.9p and 20.8p, up from 19.7p the previous year.</p>

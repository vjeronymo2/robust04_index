Menem said bilateral trade  relations amount to the wine and champagne he sends the Cuban  president and the Cuban cigars Castro sends him in return.    Answering an Argentine reporter during a news conference in  Quito, Menem said: "The dialogue in question, by phone, with  Commander Fidel Castro did not occur. I do not know where the  story came from."    The president said his love for Cuba and the Cuban people is  well known, as are his differences with Castro.    "Our relations are cutting and dry when we meet. I ask him  to democratize Cuba and he says Cuba is already democratic. We  do not agree. But beyond our differences, we are friends. He  sends me Cuban cigars and I send him wine and champagne. That  is the only trade exchange we have with Cuba," Menem said,  laughing.    He added, however, that his country is currently purchasing  Cuban meningitis vaccines and that some Argentine entrepreneurs  are selling some products on the Caribbean island.    "The U.S. blockade is imposed exclusively by the United  States. Cuba has a more or less fluid exchange with the rest of  the world," Menem added.    "I speak with Commander Castro during Iberoamerican summits,  but not on the phone," Menem insisted. [passage omitted]</p>

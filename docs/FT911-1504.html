			<p>910504 FT  04 MAY 91 / How to Spend It: London's Covent Garden FIRST-TIME visitors to Orso's, that favourite watering-hole of the media in London's Covent Garden, never fail to be charmed by the sunny Italian pottery on which the food is served. The cheerful colours and light-hearted motifs are a splendid complement to the gutsy Italian-style mood of the cooking and many diners have ended up wanting to buy the plates it all came on as well. Now they can. Tricia Guild, who is married to Richard Polo, the owner of Orso, has now produced a new range of designs for the same robust pottery. It all comes from southern Italy but the colours of the new collection are softer, prettier, less bright. The motifs are as charming as ever, ranging from cockerels and fish to fruits and vegetables. Do not try to buy a matching set - the whole point is to have a random collection which you mix and match as the mood takes you. Available at Designers Guild, 271 King's Road, London SW3. Prices range from Pounds 6 to Pounds 27. Transporting the essential chilled white wine from kitchen to pool could not be easier than with this wire basket - Pounds 10 from Habitat. Also at Habitat is a range of folding wooden chairs painted in soft washed colours, the sort that would mix in beautifully with Tricia Guild's pottery. Pounds 14.75 each. Foot-high sturdy hurricane lamp - use traditional church candles but if you want the midges kept at bay make sure you buy an insect repellent candle. Pounds 42.30 from The Conran Shop, Michelin House, 81 Fulham Road, London SW3.</p>

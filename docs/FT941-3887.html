			<p>940314 FT  14 MAR 94 / The Markets: Global implications of the 'New Liberalisation'  -Economic Eye In the course of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, set to be completed next month in Marrakesh, more than 60 developing and former communist economies notified the secretariat of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of unilateral trade liberalisation. This represented a policy revolution, historically unrivalled in terms of the number of countries and human beings affected. An important question is whether this shift in policy direction will prove temporary. An important book*, published last year, suggests a subtle reason why it will not. It does so in calling attention to what the authors call a 'new liberalisation', in which 'deterioration of the current account led to a package of crisis policies that included trade liberalisation'. There is a general awareness in developing countries of the benefits of the market and, more specifically, of liberal trade and greater exports. But policy-makers have also come to accept what industrial countries realised a decade or two ago, namely, that restrictions on imports are not just an inappropriate response to balance of payments crises, but actually a damaging one. A country's ability to do well in the long run depends partly on how well it navigates past short run obstacles. The 1970s and 1980s threw down a series of such obstacles: a synchronised global boom, two oil price shocks, the explosion of bank lending in the 1970s, the US monetary and fiscal shocks under Paul Volcker and Ronald Reagan, the debt crisis of 1982 and then the oil price collapse of 1986. Wanting to learn how developing countries had coped with this turbulence, the World Bank commissioned a study of 18 developing countries. This book summarises the results. The lessons drawn by the authors seem solid common sense, perhaps the most important being that it is not external shocks, but domestic responses that determine success or failure. The authors note that there are profligate dictatorships and prudent democracies; that the convictions of those who determine policy are decisive, but that experience can change beliefs, even in Argentina; that macroeconomic stability is good for long-run growth; that sudden increases in investment are likely to prove wasteful; that it is foolish to assume loans will be refinanced; that beneficial windfalls cannot be expected to last; that policies and economies must be kept flexible; that rapid export growth is essential, as is fiscal control; and that foreign aid can be helpful in a crisis. They also conclude that high inflation is lethal, in itself and because of the costs of lowering it, while moderate inflation is not obviously damaging; that inflation is ultimately home grown; and that liberalising imports, while using the exchange rate as an 'anchor' for inflationary expectations, is very risky. This last point relates directly to the new liberalisation. Historically, note the authors, the standard response to a balance of payments crisis was increased restriction of imports. But because a restraint on imports is also a restraint on exports, those restrictions would not reduce external deficits, except in the short term. Instead, current account deficits would tend to re-emerge, but at a lower level of trade. The resulting vicious circle of import compression would, when crisis struck, lead to what the authors call 'import starvation'. Article XII of the Gatt allowed industrial countries to use quantitative import restrictions for balance of payments purpose. Over time, however, they realised that what was needed, instead, was macroeconomic adjustment. Article XVIII gave developing countries a comparable authorisation, but many of them continued to use it to justify import controls decade after decade. The new liberalisation indicated developing country acceptance of the modern theory of balance of payments adjustment: that trade policy should be assigned to long run economic efficiency, while balance of payments management depends on fiscal and monetary adjustment, combined with exchange rate flexibility. With this realisation, an important obstacle to sustaining trade liberalisation disappears. The charts show what has happened to the trade of those developing countries that dared to undertake liberalisation during the past 30 years: Korea from the mid-1960s, Chile from the mid-1970s, Turkey from 1980, Indonesia in the mid-1960s and again in the 1980s and Mexico and Thailand in the 1980s. In all these cases, ratios of trade to output rose. In the 1950s and 1960s trade grew faster than output for most industrial countries. Thereafter, the impulse to growing openness lost momentum, partly because liberalisation was far advanced already. Now it is the turn of developing countries. In 1976, Korea's imports were 7 per cent of those of the US; in 1991, they were 16 per cent, while it had also become the world's 12th largest import market. But Korea has been only a forerunner of far bigger players, such as China and India. The new liberalisation suggests that the developing countries are now on the same intellectual footing as the industrial countries, so far as balance of payments adjustment is concerned. But many of their policy-makers tend also to have a better appreciation of the efficiency benefits of trade liberalisation. This means that their vast potential for further trade expansion will probably become reality, with even balance of payments crises failing to stop them. *IMD Little, Richard N Cooper, W Max Corden and Sarath Rajapatirana, Boom Crisis and Adjustment: the Macroeconomic Experience of Developing Countries (New York: Oxford University Press, for the World Bank, 1993).

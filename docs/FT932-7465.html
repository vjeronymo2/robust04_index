			<p>930524 FT  24 MAY 93 / NZ and Australia stress links New Zealand and Australia sought at the weekend to underline their commitment to co-operation, particularly in trade, after a three-day visit to New Zealand by Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Mr Keating spelled out a vision of 'companionability' for the trading future between the two countries, adding that the 'main game is our integration in the Asian-Pacific region'. On defence, Mr Keating apparently failed to secure agreement for New Zealand to spend more, and was also unsuccessful in his calls for the country to patch up its differences on nuclear ship visits with the US under the Anzus pact. There was agreement on pensions integration, and the two leaders said they would facilitate moves on air travel between the two countries to allow people to use domestic terminals by the end of the year.</p>

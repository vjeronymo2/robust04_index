			<p><P> April 28, 1990, Saturday, Orange County Edition  </P> <P> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM;  </P> <P> FAMILY CARE STRATEGY IS READY FOR ACTION  </P> <P> A city-sponsored committee charged with developing a local family care strategy  has concluded six months of work and is calling on community agencies and  business leaders to help put the plans into action.  </P> <P> "We'll have to continue as a group to make sure it is implemented as it is  supposed to be implemented," said Christopher K. Jarvi, director of Anaheim's  Parks, Recreation and Community Services Department.  </P> <P> Last month, the Anaheim Family Care Consortium came up with a list of problems  most often encountered by those seeking and providing care for children and  elderly family members, and a five-year plan for dealing with those problems.  </P> <P> Among the 10 issues targeted were the lack of programs to care for infants and  toddlers and the scarcity of before- and after-school care for elementary and  junior high students.  </P> <P> At a Friday breakfast, the group presented a booklet offering Anaheim employers  information about meeting the family care needs of their workers. By the end of  next month, the group will distribute a directory of local care facilities for  children, senior citizens and the disabled.  </P> <P> The Anaheim Family Care Consortium started with a $20,000 state grant that paid  for the services of a consultant for six months. The group will now be on its  own and plans to meet on a monthly basis. LISA MASCARO  </P></p>

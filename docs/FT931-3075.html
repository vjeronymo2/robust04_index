			<p>930317 FT  17 MAR 93 / Letter: Older people often make better workers than the young Sir, I was not surprised to read of the increase in the operation of age bars in job advertisements ('Jobseekers over the hill at 45', March 15). Employers faced with a large pool of potential labour will invariably use some method to reduce the cost of recruitment. An age bar is one of the cheapest mechanisms that influences supply to the firm. On grounds of efficiency employer behaviour may thus be seen as rational (and to be forgiven). In terms of equity, however, employers can be criticised for disallowing certain age groups equal access to the competition for jobs. My own research shows that employers' perceptions of age-related performance are based on inaccurate stereotypes. For example, contrary to the prevailing stereotype, older people tend to have lower turnover rates, less frequent absence for sickness, higher commitment and better time-keeping than younger people. Thus, employers' belief that younger people are a 'better bet' may be ill-founded and their behaviour may actually be inefficient. My advice to the European Commission would be that if they want to 'hold on to employees for several years' they may find it less costly and more efficient to employ an older person.

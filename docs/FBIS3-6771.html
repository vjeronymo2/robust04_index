The Kabo Peasant War was a patriotic and progressive mass  struggle to liquidate the feudal misrule, secure the right of  people to existence and defend the national sovereignty from  foreign aggression. The war was a largest ever armed struggle  in the modern history of Korea.    The historical Kabo peasant war started with the publication  of a manifesto run through with the patriotic idea of "promoting  national interests and welfare of the people" and "rejecting the  West and Japan" by Chon Pong-chun, commander-in-chief of the  peasant army, on March 21, 1894, and the war raged as an  anti-feudal struggle, an anti-Japanese national salvation  struggle stirring up the whole country at that time.    The war, however, ended in failure due to the outrageous  armed intervention of the Japanese aggressors, treacherous acts  of the reactionary ruling quarters and due to the  organisational, ideological and tactical limitations of the  peasant army itself.    Kim Sok-hyong, president of the Academy of Social Sciences,  in his report at the meeting noted that though the Kabo Peasant  War failed, it dealt a telling blow at the Japanese aggressors  and the domestic reactionary ruling quarters, gave impetus to  the bourgeois reform movement in Korea, awakened the people of  all walks of life to their class consciousness and consciousness  of national independence and started the modern anti-Japanese  righteous volunteers' struggle.    He said "it was a principal historical summing up of the  bloody lessons of the Kabo Peasant War that there must be the  outstanding guidance of a great leader capable of closely  rallying the popular masses and leading them along the road of  struggle and victory if they were to sweep away the oppressors  and reactionary ruling quarters, realise the independence of the  masses and defend the country's sovereignty with the internal  forces of the nation.    "The national sovereignty which was so ardently hoped for by  the participants in the peasant war and other people a hundred  years ago has not yet been realised nation-wide and the South  Korean people are in the lot of colonial slavery," he said, and  stressed:    "In order to realise the long-cherished desire of the  nation,  the anti-national, anti-democracy and anti-reunification Kim  Yong-sam 'civilian' fascist regime must be wiped out and the  independence and democratization of the South Korean society be  achieved".    Noting that the struggle against foreign aggression should  be  intensified to realise the national sovereignty on a nation-wide  scale, he condemned the U.S. and Japanese imperialisms as  inveterate enemies of the Korean people who invaded and have  plundered Korea from long ago.    He stressed that the Koreans in the North and South and  overseas must firmly unite under the banner of great national  unity and vigorously struggle to decisively check and frustrate  the manoeuvres of separatists at home and abroad and achieve  national reunification in the '90s at any cost.    The meeting was attended by Chang Chol, vice-premier of the  Administration Council, Yu Mi-yong, chairperson of the Central  Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, Yo Yon-Ku, presidium  member of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the  Reunification of the Fatherland, other officials concerned and  men of science, education, culture and art and the press and  public organisations.</p>

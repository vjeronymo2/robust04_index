One of the wonders of arrogant powers in justifying their  worldwide plundering interests is the use of political concepts  with various, and occasionally contradictory, meanings which  create a convoluted and complex situation and paves the way for  them to capitalize and misuse.    For example, when the expression war and peace loses its  meaning in Somalia and western forces' invasion of Somalia is  said to be to restore peace, within that context, war and peace  would be difficult to appraise in any part of the world.    An expression which, more than war and peace, has lost its  true meaning and is used in various, and sometimes  contradictory, forms is the concept of human rights.    The best evidence of that fact is the present situation in  occupied Palestine. Murder, assassination, breaking of limbs,  arrest and torture of Palestinian combatants, and dozens of  other inhuman acts are the daily achievements of Zionism, of  which few are unaware. But, despite those terroristic  activities, which take place officially and semi-officially, the  violation of human rights in the region is not on the agenda of  any organization defending human rights.    The deadly silence of international forums proclaiming to be  defenders of human rights places a heavy onus on freedom-seeking  people of the world, to perform their humanitarian duty and  bring the oppressed cries of the Muslim people of Palestine to  the world's ears.    Ruyvaran, Middle East analyst of the New Research Group,  describes the situation in occupied Palestine and the  international forums overlooking Zionist crimes.    He says:    Perhaps one could sum up that the Muslim people of Palestine  are deprived of their right to live, let alone their other  rights. Basically, the policies of the Zionist regime in the  occupied territories are not even comparable to the racist  policies of the apartheid system in South Africa.    In the occupied territories, in accordance with the planned  policies of the Zionist regime, the people of Palestine are  deprived of a large portion of their political, economic and  social rights, and basically face unequal conditions in matters  of education, hygiene and employment.    Not even once have the international organizations and  forums  objected to the policy of rendering the Muslim people of  Palestine homeless and settling migrant Zionists in homes which  used to belong to Palestinians. This is despite the fact that  such a policy contravenes the fourth article of the Geneva  Convention. Generally speaking, this policy entails the  disruption of the demographic composition of Palestine, and this  is an objective which as a whole constitutes one of the  indisputable foundations of the Zionist process of thought.    Placing Palestinians in protected zones and preventing their  movement in the occupied Palestine unless with the permission of  the military governors, has in practice deprived the people of  Palestine from enjoying equal opportunities in jobs, education,  and health. This behavior can only be analyzed within the  framework of the systematic and wholistic policies of the  Zionists, the main objective of which is the political,  economic, and scientific impoverishment of Palestinians.    Equally important, by training and arming the Zionist  settlers on the one hand, and then on the other hand depriving  the Palestinians from the right to defend themselves in that any  of them who dares carry even knives and other non-firearms is  punished, the Zionist regime has formed a kind of relationship  between the Palestinians and the Zionist settlers which  basically entails that any dispute is invariable resolved by  coercion and the law of the jungle.    The tragedy of the massacre of fasting worshippers in the  tomb of Abraham, even if one accepts the Zionist regime's claim  that the crime was committed by an individual, was a natural  outcome of the aforementioned official policies. So long as  these policies remain in force, similar tragedies will  unfortunately happen again.    Of course one must not overlook America's role amid all  this.  Although Washington was probably more informed than any other  party about current developments in the occupied territories,  but it made certain arrangements two years ago to put pressure  on the UN General Assembly to rescind its resolution which  equated Zionism with racism.    The International Human Rights Committee's turning a blind  eye to that reality has thus far been an encouragement to the  Zionist regime to pursue its policies through further violation  of the rights of the Muslim Palestinian people. Maybe that is  just the the reason why those international forums cannot be  considered blameless in the atrocities that are daily happening  in occupied Palestine. Mr. Mohammadi, from our country's foreign  ministry, has this to say about the issue:    [Begin Mohammadi recording] Human rights and the Palestine  issue is one of the United Nation's complicated issues. That  is, on the one hand the Special Committee of 24 for  Decolonization -- which is one of the main UN General Assembly'  committees -- condemns Israel every year as a violator of human  rights and on the other hand the UN Human Rights Commission  fails to take any measures to prevent human right violations in  the occupied territories. That can be interpreted in this way  that the legal aspect of human rights differs from its political  aspect when applied to various states. That is, wherever the  political will of those powers which are at the top of the  United Nations and international organizations is in line with a  state and those powers are in agreement with such a state then  the powers take no decisive and urgent action to prevent human  right violation and are not even willing to issue any binding  resolution. There human rights is merely confined to its legal  aspect and is never used as a political weapon to discredit and  isolate such states.    In the last half century the world public opinion has  witnessed the violation of human rights -- in its worst possible  form -- in the occupied territories. On the other hand it does  not seem that anyone can remember that up till now any special  envoy to have taken any action on human right violations in the  occupied territories on behalf of the United Nations or the  Human Rights Commission. Only on one occasion, when 400  Palestinians were expelled from their homeland, the UN Security  Council adopted an advisory resolution saying the Palestinian  should be returned to their homeland. And even that was  implemented conditionally -- given the occupiers method of  approach to the resolution. That is, the occupiers decided how  they were to return to their homeland.    Therefore we can draw this conclusion that those states  which  are supporters of the Qods occupying regime and are at the top  of international organizations do not in anyway make use of the  political aspect of human rights against the image and  credibility of the Qods occupier regime and fail to adopt  serious decisions and measures for human rights to be observed  in the occupied territories. [end recording]    The political and discriminatory approach by world powers  towards human rights issue and their use of it as a pressure  lever to secure their own plundering interests distances the  Human Rights Committee and Amnesty International Organization  from their titles every day and renders them devoid of  humanitarian objectives.</p>

[passage omitted]    The pro-Meciar government daily REPUBLIKA launches another  attack against the personality and past of Moravcik under the  page one banner headline "Founder of the Spark of Lenin Club  Heads Slovak Government."    Moravcik's decision to form a dissident faction within the  HZDS [Movement For a Democratic Slovakia] and then to join  forces with those who voted no confidence in Meciar shows that  the new premier's "realism" lies in his ability to connive and  predict the future, the daily writes.    The roots of Moravcik's stances which elevated him to the  foreign ministry are embedded in the Spark of Lenin Club, "which  began its activities -- wonder of the world -- not in the 1950's  or the years of normalisation, but in 1988." Moravcik was "also  prescient when he later joined forces with Meciar... but was  hardened by the political discussions in the Spark of Lenin  Club, put out his antennae in time, and behind the back of his  movement (the HZDS) he held talks with President Kovac and  opposition leaders about bringing down the government he  belonged to."    "After the lighting of the Leninist spark, the `centering'  of  the VPN (Public Against Violence, the forerunner of HZDS) and  the `realistic alternative,' Moravcik is getting, with the help  of college educated Marxist-Leninists (this time in the  Democratic Left Party [SDL]), the post he was already modestly  longing for around the Leninist campfire," REPUBLIKA concludes.  "His rise has its logic. According to the principle: Shake  thoroughly before use, after use throw it out."    REPUBLIKA continues in the same vein with its attacks on  Moravcik's still unnamed government, which it says does not have  nor will have either ethical, moral or political legitimacy or  authority.    The new government did not come to power through  parliamentary elections, but through intrigues, and therefore  will rush toward populism. Nor will it restrain itself from  making promises or insulting the previous government, the daily  writes.    "Similarities to (the communist takeover in) February 1948  are certainly accidental," REPUBLIKA comments ironically. "Only  the `technology' of the strategy and tactics was different then,  and the individuals played different roles," it adds, pointing  out that one of the main actors in today's drama was a member of  the Czechoslovak Communist Party operating in London, later as a  financial advisor to Castro's Cuba, and now as president.    REPUBLIKA also claims that it was 230 billion crowns worth  of  national property to be privatised that led SDL Chairman Peter  Weiss, who "hides badly his longing for the renewal of communist  power," and KDH [Christian Democratic Movement] Chairman Jan  Carnogursky, who "voted against the Slovak Constitution,  sovereignty and statehood," to join forces.    "When money is concerned, brother doesn't know brother.  Vladimir Meciar broke with 'morality' because he did not want  anything for himself. As they said during the French  Revolution: One can't be clean among the unclean." [passage  omitted]</p>

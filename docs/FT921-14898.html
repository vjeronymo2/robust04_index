			<p>920114 FT  14 JAN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Through the jargon jungle  -In A Nutshell Even if your business has survived the recession by dint of good management or good luck, you may have found yourself having to cope with the repercussions of business failure among suppliers, customers or competitors. But do you really understand the technical terms which are used by the accountants and insolvency specialists? What is the difference between bankruptcy, receivership, administration and liquidation? KPMG Peat Marwick has produced a 13-page Glossary of Insolvency Expressions ranging from Administration Order to Wrongful Trading which explains some of English (and Scottish) jargon. Irritatingly, the Peat booklet adopts a straight-laced, technical approach, and is too concise, describing the different procedures rather than attempting to relate one to another and explain how they differ in practice. Cork Gully, part of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, have done a better job with Insolvency in Brief, a rather longer (24 page) guide which comes down to the level of the businessman or woman in the street. Unfortunately the Cork booklet has proved so popular internally that few copies are available to outsiders. It may be worth pressuring a friendly partner though. Contact local Peat office or 1 Puddle Dock, Blackfriars, London EC4V 3PD. Tel 071 236 8000. For Cork booklet see above. Both are free.</p>

			<p>Language: <F P=105> French </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Article signed RHR (PIW): "GMM Denies Any Financial </F> Backing for Zhirinovskiy"; as released by Brussels BELGA  Database]    [Text] Brussels, 20 Jan (BELGA) -- The Global Money  Management trust (GMM)-- with its headquarters in Amsterdam and  headed by Russian financial advisor Anton Nenakov -- asserted on  Thursday [20 January] that it had never given a single ruble to  support the campaign of Russia's leader of the far right,  Alexander Zhirinovskiy.    At a Brussels press conference, Mr. Nenakov added that -- to  the contrary -- he was a Yeltsin supporter and that information  suggesting that he had funded the nationalist leader's campaign  had been circulated in order to harm his company.    The Russian daily, SEVODNJA, reported in December last year  that GMM had provided 800 million dollars (more than 28 million  Belgian francs) to support Zhirinovskiy's campaign, adding that  the company was operating without a license in Russia where it  is involved in speculation.    Mr. Nenakov denied these claims, stating that the newspaper  who accused him was in fact in the hands of one of his  competitors and that they were seeking to harm his professional  activities.    He indicated that he had instigated proceedings for  defamation against SEVODNJA and that the journalist who wrote  the article had already admitted that he had no document able to  prove his claims.    As regards GMM's activities in Moscow -- where the Global  Money Management trust has a subsidiary -- another company  representative, financial adviser Mr. Liozner, stated that his  company has met with no difficulties with the Russian central  bank, even if it attracts private Russian capital for  investments abroad. He pointed out that relations between GMM  and the central bank had "normalized," apart from few purely  "technical" difficulties mainly due to differences between  Russian and Western banking legislation.</p>

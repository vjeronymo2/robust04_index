			<p><P> May 26, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HUNTING GUIDE ORDERED TO PAY $2.7 MILLION FOR YELLOWSTONE FIRE  </P> <P> The Forest Service has ordered a hunting guide in Bozeman, Mont., to pay more  than $2.7 million to reimburse the government's costs of fighting one of the  forest fires that swept through Yellowstone National Park last summer.  </P> <P> Forest Service investigators said they traced the source of the blaze to camp  stoves set up by outfitter Vernon Smith last Aug. 15. They said sparks from  Smith's stove started a local fire that spread rapidly under high winds and  became the Hellroaring Fire.  </P> <P> The blaze burned more than 52,000 acres in Yellowstone and an additional 29,000  acres in adjacent Gallatin National Forest before being doused by rain and snow  in the fall.  </P> <P> According to federal law, a person proven to have started a fire that burns  public land can be required to repay the government for losses due to the fire.  The law is seldom used because people found to have started fires usually  cannot pay the high costs of firefighting.  </P> <P> Smith declined to comment. Government officials said it is unlikely that he  could pay the amount he has been charged, but federal lawyers said they could  recoup part of their costs by attaching his property.  </P> <P> Jim Sanders of Gallatin National Forest said the government also has billed  Todd Wilkof of Canton, Ohio, who was on a back-country trip led by Smith the  day the fire began.  </P> <P> Forest Service investigators said Wilkof used a camp stove that morning. Their  investigation concluded that sparks from the stove blew into the dry forest and  quickly kindled an unmanageable blaze.  </P> <P> Eleven major fires erupted in the Yellowstone area last summer and fall. Forest  Service detectives said they believe that people started three of the fires  while lightning was responsible for the others.  </P> <P> By tracing the path of a blaze upwind to its source and checking forest  records, investigators often can pinpoint who was at the kindling point when  the fire began.  </P> <P> Earlier this year, the federal government charged four Idaho loggers with  dropping cigarettes in a forest west of Yellowstone last July. That evidently  kindled the North Fork fire, the largest of the Yellowstone fires.  </P> <P> Those loggers were formally charged only with the misdemeanor of dropping  cigarettes.  </P></p>

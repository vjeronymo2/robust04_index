			<p>940810 FT  10 AUG 94 / Swansea DVLA to shed 700 jobs The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency is to shed 700 jobs over the next three years at its centre in Swansea, south Wales, Roland Adburgham writes. The DVLA is an executive agency of the Department of Transport and employs 4,300 people including 2,700 at Swansea. It has been told to make a 20 per cent efficiency improvement over two years from April. To meet the target Pounds 12m is being invested in projects to change the way information is captured, accessed and managed. Mr Donald Anderson, Labour MP for Swansea East, described the announcement as 'a devastating blow to the very heart of our economy in Swansea. Here we see the economics of an inhuman government that invests Pounds 12m to destroy 700 jobs.' Swansea has more than 10,500 unemployed people in its travel-to-work area, a rate of 9.2 per cent.</p>

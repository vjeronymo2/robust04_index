The city is truly facing a  threat of an outbreak of epidemics, says the chief state  sanitary physician in the republic.    The first alarm signal was received in March of last year.  More than 150 people were affected back then as a result of a  dysentery epidemic outbreak. The reason was damage to the water  supply network which, when water is supplied to the population  on schedule, was responsible for bacteriologically contaminated  water entering the water pipeline.    Yet it appears that the city authorities are not  particularly  concerned about it. The city water supply network which has  outlived every permissible life span continues to supply water  with an unknown composition to houses in its original  incarnation.    The situation is even further aggravated this year due to an  acute energy crisis. For months, household garbage is not hauled  away from the city, and there is no gasoline. The city hall was  forced to appeal to the population to fill the garbage trucks,  whenever possible, with their own fuel whose prices have reached  record levels--1 l of gasoline fetched $1.20.    And until the fuel problem is solved, the epidemiological  situation has a potential to get out of control any moment.</p>

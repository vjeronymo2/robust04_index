			<p>940905 FT  05 SEP 94 / Survey of Mobile Communications (7): Customers are confused  -Paul Taylor looks at the mobile data market The mobile data market has failed to live up to early expectations. Set against the growth of cellular radio voice communications in particular, customer demand for mobile data has been distinctly disappointing. As a result, most market analysts have downgraded their predictions for mobile data market growth in the 1990s while network operators and others have reassessed their investment strategies. In the UK, for example, Hutchison Mobile Data ceased marketing its fledgling dedicated mobile data service last autumn and will now offer mobile data services on its recently launched Orange digital Personal Communications Network (PCN) later this year. 'There has been a lot of 'hype' and industry push over the years,' says Mr Dean Eyers, a senior industry analyst with Dataquest who has just completed a report entitled 'Mobile Data Communications in Europe - The Potential for a Horizontal Market'. Another market research organisation, Ovum, conceded in a report on mobile data published last year that, 'despite services being available on cellular and public data-only networks, the market has been slow to develop'. Ovum noted that despite the acknowledged benefits of mobile data, 'data-only networks are facing an uphill struggle to attract subscribers and the number of data users on the cellular network is in the region of 2-5 per cent of the user base.' By the end of 1993 Ovum estimated that there were just 325,000 users of mobile data in North America and Europe. In the UK the three dedicated mobile data networks have a total of about 5,500 customers. There are, however, indications that subscriber interest is growing. In the first six months of the year subscribers to Ram Mobile Data's network more than tripled. Meanwhile, about 15 per cent of the 45,000 subscribers to National Band Three's two-way public access mobile radio communications network in the UK now use the service to transmit data. Mobile data customers fall into two main categories according to Ovum - vertical markets, particularly the service industries, and early horizontal markets involving industries with a significant service element in some aspect of their business. Typically, these mobile data customers use data services to transfer engineering, customer or product information to and from portable computers, or to retrieve information from mobile data terminals used by a mobile workforce such as meter readers. But the Ovum report suggested that the market for mobile data had been constrained by customer concern over competition between mobile data services and over the availability of networks, the price of equipment and excessively complex and expensive applications, lack of market understanding and the belief that perceived risks outweigh cost benefits. Customer confusion is understandable. In the UK for example, excluding pager traffic, mobile data services are provided by both analogue and digital cellular telephone network operators, dedicated mobile data network operators and private and public access mobile radio networks - all using incompatible standards and equipment. It is possible to transmit data over an analogue cellular telephone networks, but this is generally more difficult and considerably slower than transmitting data over the fixed public switched telephone network. As a result, relatively few business customers use cellular telephone systems to transmit data. Data transmission over the new generation of digital cellular telephone systems, such as the GSM and PCN services in Europe should be much simpler, faster and more reliable. The GSM specification includes a facility which, once implemented, will allow any terminal - such as a portable facsimile machine or a notebook computer - to be plugged directly into the handset. In the US, analogue network operators led by AT&amp;T's recently acquired subsidiary, Macaw Cellular Communications, are upgrading their networks to accommodate a new 'open' technology called cellular digital packet-switched data (CDPD) which enables data to be sent in blocks over existing networks using the 'spaces' between voice traffic. Because it provides digital transmission without the need for expanded system capacity, it is a cost-effective option. Public access mobile radio services such as NB3, owned by Geotek of the US, provide another alternative for customers who require both mobile voice and data communications. NB3 customers buy their own communications equipment and then pay a fixed monthly subscription. They do not pay call charges. However Mr Andrew Robb, managing director of NB3, acknowledges that for high volume data customers who do not require voice communications, the high speed and low cost wireless data links provided by dedicated packet-switched data networks make more sense. In the US the Ardis network, which uses Motorola's DataTac technology, covers the 400 largest metropolitan areas and has around 35,000 subscribers, while Ram Broadcasting's network uses Ericsson's rival Mobitex technology. Similar packet-switched data networks, mostly based on Mobitex, have been built or are planned throughout Europe. In the UK three mobile data networks survive: Cognito, Vodafone's Paknet and Ram Mobile Data - a joint venture involving US-based Ram Broadcasting and BellSouth, France Telcom, Swedish Telcom and Bouygues. Elsewhere in Europe their are Mobitex-based networks built or under construction in France, Sweden (where there are two), Finland, Norway, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium which will eventually be linked through roaming agreements to provide a pan-European network. There are only two DataTac networks in Europe, one operated by Deutsche Telekom in Germany and the other Hutchison's mothballed systems in the UK. Although subscriber growth has been slow, Mr John Jarvis, Ram Mobile Data's chief executive, says: 'We are starting to see an industry with mass market characteristics in terms of size and potential.' Ram's customer list includes local authorities whose parking wardens use handheld computers, field service engineers working for Coca-Cola's service company and emergency services in Cleveland and Manchester. BIS Strategic Decisions recently estimated that the European market for mobile data will grow 15-fold into a Dollars 1.5bn business by 1998. Meanwhile Dataquest's Mr Eyers believes the emerging mobile data market will split into three main segments which he has dubbed 'data heavy', 'data lite' and 'consumer users' and predicts that the overall market in Europe will exceed 5m subscribers by the end of the decade. Dataquest expects data heavy users - frequent mobile data service users such as traffic wardens, meter readers and organisations which use the services every day - will gravitate towards dedicated mobile data networks such as Ram. Data lite users - infrequent mobile data users, such as travelling salesmen or executives who want to read their electronic mail or access an office database - are expected to turn to GSM and other networks which also provide voice services. However, Dataquest does not expect the consumer market for mobile data to develop on a large scale until 'towards the back end of this decade'. The Dataquest report concludes: 'While paging, public mobile radio and analogue cellular have all paid lip service to supporting mobile data communications, strong candidates to support a significant market are only now emerging in the form of packet mobile radio and digital cellular technologies. Further support from manufacturers and operators for new services and applications are required and expected.' Corporate users had 'a positive attitude towards mobile data communications but will need to be sold on the value which such solutions can provide if this sector is to reach its potential.'</p>

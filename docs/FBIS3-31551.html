"We are taking one problem at a time, by choosing Sarajevo  first before going on to other problems," Haekkerup said,  referring to the threat of NATO air strikes which convinced the  Serbs to remove their heavy weapons from around Sarajevo or  place them under UN control.    "The threat of air strikes will be used again," Haekkerup  told the daily DET FRIE AKTUELT. ``If we managed to force the  withdrawal of heavy weapons from around Sarajevo, the UN and  NATO are ready to impose new conditions, and there is a good  chance they will be respected.    "You can't deny that they (the Serbs) took the NATO threat  seriously," he said. "The situation on the ground confirms that."    The airport in the northeastern Bosnian town of Tuzla is  held  by UN troops but the Serbs have steadfastly refused to let it be  used to fly in emergency aid.    The Serbs have also prevented Canadian UN peacekeepers from  being rotated out of the besieged Moslem enclave of Srebrenica  in the east of the country.    Also Monday, Danish Premier Poul Rasmussen said the United  Nations had asked his government to divert to Sarajevo a column  of tanks bound for Tuzla.    Rasmussen, emerging from a meeting of the Danish  Parliament's  Foreign Affairs Committee, said the government had received the  request during the night but had not yet decided whether it was  going to reply favourably.    He said the United Nations wanted the tanks to be on the  outskirts of Sarajevo ready to intervene if the withdrawal of  heavy artillery by the Bosnian Serbs did not go as planned.    The 10 German-designed Leopard tanks, accompanied by 100  Danish soldiers, are already on their way to join the Nordic  battalion in Tuzla from the south after being refused permission  by the Serbs for some four months to go in from the north.    Rasmussen said any change in itinerary would have to be  approved by parliament.    The chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Peter  Duetoft,  said "The United Nations is within its rights to divert our  tanks temporarily, but their final destination remains Tuzla,  where they will defend the Nordic battalion of around 1,000 men  and contribute to opening up the airport of this besieged town."    Rasmussen also emphasised Denmark's support for keeping up  pressure on the Serbs.    "Pressure on the Serbs should be maintained even if the risk  of NATO air strikes on Serb positions is much less than a few  days ago," he said.    "In the longer term, one could imagine putting similar  pressure on other towns in difficulty in Bosnia."    He said he was glad that the NATO threat to launch air  strikes on heavy weapons not withdrawn from a radius of 20  kilometers (12.5 miles) from the center of Sarajevo had been  taken seriously, and "confident in the Serbs' inclination to  keep their promises to withdraw all their heavy weaponry from  around Sarajevo."</p>

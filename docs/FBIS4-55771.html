			<p>BFN     [Text] Budapest, 19 May (MTI) -- "The Hungarian Democratic  Forum [MDF] has quickly recovered after the shock which the May  8 election result caused to its voters and organizers," MDF  acting chairman Sandor Lezsak told the party's news conference  in Budapest on Thursday. He said he believes broad cooperation  between conservative forces could obstruct a Socialist-Liberal  majority in the new parliament.    According to Lezsak, many people want to vote on May 29 for  fear of an overwhelming ruling power leading to autocratic rule  and a constitutional dictatorship. On June 4, the MDF's  National Board will look into the reasons behind the party's  poor election performance. It will also decide whether to  discuss past and current affairs with delegates of the 8th  National Convention, or to elect new delegates, and select a  date for the next national meeting sometime before October.</p>

			<p>930211 FT  11 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: 'Polecat' fails to rouse rage a soubriquet he chose himself - was back. Lord Tebbit yesterday demonstrated his flair for grabbing the headlines and shaping debate at Westminster. 'When I was translated to the peerage there must have been a good many in high, or even low places muttering, 'well that's got him nailed up safely in his political box',' he told the press gallery. Not for the first time in his political life, Lord Tebbit was biting the hand of the establishment that once fed him. He may have been flattering himself unduly. Elsewhere at Westminster the reaction was more condescending than outraged. Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, did not rise to the bait, while a government whip sniffed: 'He (Tebbit) is yesterday's man.' The 61-year-old former Conservative party chairman, trade and industry secretary and employment secretary has only a fraction of the influence he once held. At his height he was one of the closest allies of Baroness Thatcher, the former prime minister. He was the epitome of a Thatcherite minister, a grammar-school boy who worked his way to the top. His brash straight-talking fitted in a conviction-driven government. He told the unemployed to get on their bikes to look for work. He was ambitious, privately harbouring ambitions to be Conservative leader. But he left the government mainly to look after his wife who was badly injured when the IRA bombed the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the 1983 Tory conference. He did not, however, have a personal following in the Commons, and after leaving office he earned disrespect for raising immigration as a political issue. Now he risks devaluing his credibility with each ever-stronger outburst. His importance rests on the belief that he does, to some extent, speak the mind of Baroness Thatcher, still a totem for the Tory right wing. He is a master at rabble-rousing, successfully dividing last October's Conservative conference with an electrifying speech on Europe in front of Mr John Major and Mr Hurd. He is an embodiment, perhaps, of the darker side of many Tories  -enunciating their fears about an encroaching European state - who can be safely disowned in public. Hence the lukewarm reaction of Euro-sceptic Tory MPs yesterday may not have been surprising. 'We don't take our orders from Tebbit,' said one. 'We will take our own decisions in our own time,' said Mr James Cran, a prominent dissident. Lord Tebbit may have damaged their tactics. One loyalist Tory said the debate about Labour's amendment to the Maastricht treaty was peaking too early. No vote is likely for at least a month, he said. It would be easier now for constituency associations to be warned that their MP was backing the social chapter. But that may be too optimistic. Lord Tebbit's talent for self-resurrection is not exhausted yet.</p>

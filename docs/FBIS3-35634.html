However, the situation continues to  remain extremely tense in the Karabakh-Azerbaijani conflict zone.    Although the Azerbaijani Army is suffering huge losses in  men  and material, it is pressing ahead with its desperate attempts  to break through the Karabakh forces' defensive lines in various  sectors. In the last three days alone the Karabakh forces  either destroyed or captured 19 armored cars, including 16 tanks.    Nagorno-Karabakh Republic Defense Army headquarters reported  that the Azerbaijani attacks in various directions along the  combat line, extending from northwest to the southern borders,  were completely checked during battles yesterday. The enemy  launched its fiercest attacks against Martuni. The Azerbaijanis  retreated to their initial positions after losing two tanks and  nearly 70 soldiers. The Azerbaijanis also lost a few dozen more  troops in the other sectors of the war front. Seven were killed  and 18 injured on the Karabakh side.    The combat operations resumed on the morning of 28 January  in  the north of Kelbadzharskiy Rayon and nearby Mardak?rtskiy  Rayon. According to reconnaissance data, the Azerbai?anis are  bringing in fresh forces to the other sectors of the war front.</p>

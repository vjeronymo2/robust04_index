			<p>920530 FT  30 MAY 92 / Israel extends bar on Gaza Palestinians ISRAEL yesterday extended the order barring Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip from entering Israel, their main source of work, and is said to be considering permanently banning men under 30 years old from leaving the strip. It also prepared to stop Palestinians from the West Bank entering Jerusalem tomorrow during celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of Israel's capture of the Arab half of the city in 1967. Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, admitted during the week that cutting off access to work in Israel, which accounts for around half of all Gazan employment, was likely to increase frustration in the impoverished area and lead to further acts of violence. The government orders were prompted by fears of further clashes between Israelis and Arabs following intensified violence during the week. The murder of a 15 year-old Israeli girl in the Tel Aviv suburb of Bat Yam on Sunday led to five successive nights of rioting by angry residents, many chanting 'death to Arabs'. The atmosphere worsened when a Jewish settler was stabbed in Gaza on Wednesday. With the general election on June 23 less than four weeks away, the hardline Likud party government led by Mr Yitzhak Shamir is anxious to respond to public pressure for a tough security clampdown. Israeli forces were also in action again in Lebanon yesterday. They advanced from the 'security zone' they maintain in southern Lebanon to blow up seven houses in two villages suspected of harbouring Palestinian and Lebanese guerrillas. Reports from the area said they planted roadside bombs, wounding three people in passing cars, before withdrawing. It was the first time since February that Israeli infantry had advanced beyond the limit of the security zone. Israeli forces have attacked guerrilla targets, mainly of the Hizbollah Moslem fundamentalist militia, every day for more than a week in one of the severest bouts of fighting in the area for months. Some 30 Lebanese and one Israeli soldier have been killed in the Lebanon fighting since May 19. Six Palestinians and three Israelis have died in the West Bank, Gaza and Israel over the past week, including two Arab collaborators mistakenly killed by Israeli under-cover soldiers.</p>

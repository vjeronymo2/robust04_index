			<p>BFN     [Text] Meanwhile, the new Russian minister of nationalities  and regional policy affairs is ready to take up his duties. Our  correspondent reports from Krasnodar with the details.    [Correspondent S. Shcherbal] The 43-year-old governor of  Kuban, Nikolay Yegorov, who has not been released from that post  yet incidentally, arrived in Moscow today to take up the seat as  minister of nationalities and regional policy affairs, which he  has inherited from Sergey Shakhray.    [Begin recording] [Ingushetia President Ruslan Aushev] We  see  Nikolay Dmitriyevich's appointment as a hopeful sign, and we  heads of republics and regions must of course help him formulate  policy.    [Yegorov] In my work as a Russian government minister, I  don't intend to do anything revolutionary, especially in the  sphere of interethnic relations.    [Unidentified correspondent] At one time you did try to use  harsh measures to extinguish a number of hotbeds of interethnic  tension that flared up in the kray. In your capacity as  minister, do you plan to use these sorts of harsh measures on a  Russia-wide level to extinguish conflicts?    [Yegorov] If it is necessary to use harsh measures, if the  situation demands it, then I do indeed have enough strength and  will to do that.    [K. Zatulin, chairman of State Duma committee for CIS  affairs] Alexander Dumas the elder commented that blood in the  south flows more quickly, thus any indigent nobleman from the  south of France, from Gascogne, who went to Paris would make a  career for himself faster than his far richer comrade from the  north, from Normandie or Picardie. I think that what goes for  France is typical for the south of Russia, too. [end recording]</p>

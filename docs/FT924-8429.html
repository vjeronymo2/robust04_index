			<p>921111 FT  11 NOV 92 / Business and the Environment: A brighter shade of green - George Graham asks whether the Clinton-Gore team can protect both US jobs and the environment Over the long months of the US presidential campaign, voters and observers have been exposed to two sides of the environmental politics of Governor Bill Clinton. On one side stands the governor of Arkansas, who has made enough of an effort to preserve the rivers and forests of his state to win the endorsement of a number of environmentalist groups, but whose record on the environment is by no means perfectly green - who has, in fact, consistently shown a tendency to compromise with industry over questions of pollution. On the other stands the candidate who selected as his vice-presidential running mate Senator Al Gore of Tennessee, a leader in the Senate on environmental questions and the painter, in his bestselling book 'Earth in the Balance,' of an almost apocalyptic portrait of the consequences of global warming, the degradation of the environment and untamed population growth. Now that Clinton is president-elect, due to take office in a little over two months, many are now wondering which side will dominate in his administration. During the campaign, Clinton largely deferred on environmental questions to his partner. Their Republican opponents had initially planned to concentrate on Arkansas's spotty environmental record and on the soiled waters of the White River, polluted by wastes from the chicken farms that are the state's economic base. Instead, they launched an attack on Gore as an environmental extremist. The attack was led by Vice-president Dan Quayle, who helped sell a good many extra copies of his rival's book to those who rushed to check his slightly stretched claim, made in the televised vice-presidential debate, that page 304 of 'Earth in the Balance' advocated a Dollars 100bn-a-year Global Marshall Plan to safeguard the environment in third world countries. But President George Bush joined in with a will, dubbing Gore 'the Ozone Man' in his regular speeches on the campaign stump. Central to the attack was the view that Gore, and by implication Clinton, were willing to sacrifice jobs - be they in the timber industry of the Pacific northwest, by protecting the habitat of the northern spotted owl, or in the automotive plants of Michigan and Ohio, by demanding that carmakers increase the average fuel efficiency of their cars from 27.5 to 40 miles per gallon - in the interests of the environment. Clinton, during his years in office, often compromised on environmental issues in favour of jobs. Some Arkansas observers claim that one of the formative events of his political life was a battle against Georgia-Pacific, a big forestry products company, in his first term as governor. The fight helped cost him re-election, and even his allies say that when he won back the governorship two years later, he was a chastened and more pragmatic politician. And while Arkansas's environmental record is clearly not all bad, Clinton took the opportunity of Earth Day in April to promise a greener approach in the future. 'I've made the choice from time to time for jobs, because my state was a poor one, without either enough jobs or enough federal help to clean up the environment. But over the years, as I have worked in this area, I have come to learn something that Bush and his advisers still don't understand: I've come to reject the false choice between economic growth and environmental protection,' he said. It is widely believed that Gore, when he takes over the vice-presidency, will assume general responsibility in the environmental area, but he has muted some of his views during the campaign; indeed, he himself has in the past put jobs before the environment, voting against the controversial preservation of the snail darter, a small fish threatened by dam construction in his native Tennessee. Even a vice-president with less involvement in environmental policy would help bring about a considerable change in the US, for Quayle has taken an activist approach towards blocking and delaying the implementation of new environmental regulations, especially those implementing the Clean Air Act, that he believes damage US business competitivity. If the new Clinton administration were simply to leave the Environmental Protection Agency under the command of William Reilly, who was appointed by Bush, the result would probably be a much more constrictive set of regulations than Quayle has allowed through. Among those who have been mentioned as possible replacements for Reilly are Madeline Kunin, former governor of Vermont, Carol Browner, Florida's environment secretary, Thomas Jorling, New York's conservation commissioner, and Fred Krupp, director of the Environmental Defence Fund. The first effects of the 1990 Clean Air Act became evident last week when new, cleaner-burning petrol, blended with oxygenates, became compulsory in 39 metropolitan areas, in an effort to reduce levels of carbon monoxide, especially concentrated in the winter. The new blended fuels cost more per gallon, and yield lower mileage. The EPA published a flurry of new clean air regulations in the week before the election, covering nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-burning utilities, pollutants from steel industry coke ovens, tests on car exhausts and an innovative system to allow companies to sell their pollution rights if they make faster progress in cutting their emissions than the law requires. Many of these regulations are still subject to public comment and alteration, leaving time and leeway for a Clinton administration to make its own amendments. But even under the supervision of Gore, few expect the new administration to seek a draconian toughening of the requirements, at a time when its top priority is to put into effect some kind of job creation package.</p>

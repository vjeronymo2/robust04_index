			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] [passage omitted] On the ground in Goma, on the  Zaire-Rwanda border, we have the first report from our  correspondent, Nicolas Poincare:    [Begin Poincare recording] Operation Turquoise has begun.  The first French forces are inside Rwanda, but the first  mission that was due to be carried out today could not, in the  end, go ahead. The first troops were due to enter Rwanda from  Zaire to the south, to go to Cyangugu and set up a first  protection zone. Here in Goma, on the Zairean side of the  border, where the headquarters of Operation Turquoise have been  set up, the soldiers now say they are ready for this mission.  They are just waiting for the green light from Paris. This  will probably be given tomorrow morning. Around 60 paratroopers  and marine commandos will go to Cyangugu to protect Tutsi  refugee camps. The Tutsis number some 8,000 in this region,  under threat from the Hutu militias.    This will be a first intervention to show the RPF [Rwandan  Patriotic Front] quite clearly that the French have come on a  humanitarian mission. The soldiers will then try to expand  their protection zone, but all this will take a lot of time.  For now, Operation Turquoise is above all a logistical  operation. Here in Goma, for example, only 150 men have  actually arrived.    Nicolas Poincare in Goma for France Inter. [end recording]</p>

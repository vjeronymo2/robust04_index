			<p>941209 FT  09 DEC 94 / Letters to the Editor: Simple way to determine fair pay Sir, Mr Blackaby pursues the line favoured by some Japanese companies (Letters: December 7) - that there should be a simple ratio between the chief executive and the lowest paid in any company. Unfortunately, the ratio approach ignores important differences between companies, particularly structural ones. Some companies are very flat. In a cleaning firm, for instance, Mr Blackaby's cleaner may be only one or two layers down from the chief executive. Therefore the appropriate ratio may be 5:1. On the other hand, a hotel conglomerate may justifiably have 10 or more layers between the two positions, requiring 50:1. The simplest way to approach pay fairness is to look at the differential which should be paid to someone when he has to take on a position at the next level of responsibility. Just as a tradesman needs a salary enhancement to take on the foreman's job, so a director should expect to receive a differential for being appointed as the chief executive and ultimate can carrier. Determining what the differentials should be in percentage terms has to vary from company to company - again, it is affected by factors like structure and decision-making style. However, if shareholders wish to cast aside the market factor as the most important determinant of executive salaries, they would make more headway with the differential approach than by searching for a universally applicable ratio.

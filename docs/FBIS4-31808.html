			<p>CSO   <F P=106> [Article by M. Simovic: "Motor Vehicle Industry: The Process </F> of Disintegration Is Continuing"]    [Text] More than 1,700 items for Zastava motor vehicles,  which before the disintegration of the SFRY [Socialist Federal  Republic of Yugoslavia] were produced by the industry of the  seceded republics (some were imported from the West European  countries), have been put into production either in Zastava  factories or in firms in Serbia and Montenegro which have joined  the motor vehicle program. So far, according to Eng. Miodrag  Bogdanovic, director of the motor vehicle factory in Kragujevac,  more than 19 million German marks [DM] have been spent to  organize that production, "mainly at the expense of the earnings  of workers of the firms that have joined this production  program." You might think that at Zastava they would look on  substitution of production from its former industrial  cooperation outside Serbia and Montenegro as a kind of victory  in the economic war which, along with its other forms, has  broken out on the soil of the former Yugoslavia. That is not the  case. Even in the initial phase of heightened tensions in the  business sphere between Serbia and Slovenia, they were saying at  Zastava that the disintegration of the state and the  accentuation of animosities would impose too heavy a price on  all large business systems, from the producer of the end product  to his partners in industrial cooperation. Perhaps that price is  best reflected in the drop of production from nearly 200,000 to  only about 6,000 last year and about 11,000 vehicles this year.  Although the situation in production is dramatic, as confirmed  by the frequent visits made to Zastava by republic and federal  officials in order to find the key to "faster startup of the  installed capacity," the question is whether this substitution  makes sense, that is, whether even that much production would  have occurred if they had not been "timely in undertaking to  eliminate dependence on auto parts producers in the seceded  republics," Bogdanovic says. It is certain that without having  organized production of those 1,700 items, production would not  be possible, especially because the sanctions and blockades have  prevented imports from the West European countries, specifically  from industrial cooperation with FIAT in Italy.    The process of organizing the production of the new items  has  not been completed, and certain parts and assemblies are now  being put into production, especially for the Florida and the  restyled Yugo, the convertible.... A recent visit to the vehicle  factory in Kragujevac by representatives of the republic  government, led by Dragan Tomic, minister without portfolio, who  is also a member of the team for "rapid intervention" in the  economy and who is working to guide the decisions of the  government to more effective invigoration of the economy, had  the objective of "examining in the most specific terms what is  interfering with the growth of production, especially because  the present market--such as it is--is showing a greater demand  than the supply Zastava is now presenting." It was, of course,  observed that money was necessary and credits to finance  production, and then there is the need for the state to take  specific steps in the area of tax policy to benefit motor  vehicle producers, as well as in the area of tariff policy,  whether it is a case of benefits in the importation of  production supplies or importation of vehicles which because of  their comfort, capacity, and other features should carry the  burden of filling the state treasury with the charges that would  be collected on them. Because the government representatives  then talked separately to the managers of the vehicle factory  and the management of the truck and special-purpose factories,  and then in a broader meeting attended by the journalists as  well, about the "main direction of the effort to invigorate  production," it is not possible to talk with much confidence  about the details that were dealt with and agreed on at that  time. It was only a few days later that Miodrag Bogdanovic  announced in a news conference that he was going to Belgrade,  where he would talk to representatives of the government about  "three scenarios to invigorate the production of motor  vehicles." The contents of each of those scenarios and which  will be adopted are a bit of a secret at the moment, but it is  known that each one defines the growth of production this year  and preparation for the period after the sanctions are removed.    Will the growth of production be based solely on substituted  production of parts, or will an attempt be made even by renewing  ties with the earlier parts producers all over the former SFRY  to make motor vehicle production cheaper and more concrete? The  answer to this question does not lie solely in the power of  Zastava or Serbia or of its subcontractors in Slovenia, Croatia,  Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Macedonia [The Former Yugoslav  Republic of Macedonia--FYROM]. It is certain that those former  republics of Yugoslavia, now independent states which are  members of the United Nations, must respect the sanctions that  have been introduced and the economic blockade. To whose  detriment: Is it only to the detriment of Serbia? As far as the  author of these lines is aware, many former subcontractors of  Zastava in the seceded republics have complained that the  business ties were severed, least of all, of course, out of any  sentimental reasons, but purely on the basis of business and  profit. At Zastava, they make no secret of the fact that the  economic logic of all the former participants in motor vehicle  production on the soil of the former state of the SFRY, which is  to say, its own economic logic, is on the side of renewing the  business ties, because with every passing day, with every new  auto part put into production, when it comes to this kind of  production, the process of disintegration of the economy on the  territory of the old Yugoslavia intensifies, and this is  occurring under the pressure of the need to somehow survive.  Economic interest is now emerging as a factor tending to weaken  ties further, a factor that has been forcibly yoked to the logic  of actual war and economic war, the sanctions of the United  Nations, but also mutual penalization for having lived in the  same state for decades. All unused capacity previously employed  to make motor vehicles gives rise to reflections about whether  it is better for us now or better earlier.    The present course of disintegration of economic entities  attached to the motor vehicle program in the former SFRY will  indisputably have an impact on the speed of renewal of the  marketing of Zastava vehicles in the parts that have become  separate from Yugoslavia. Along with all the negative  consequences of disintegration, we must not forget that almost  60 percent of the total sales of Zastava vehicles on the  territory of the former SFRY were marketed in republics which  are no longer in Yugoslavia. It is indisputable that economic  interest will decide whether and at what speed sales will be  renewed in the newly born states on the territory of the former  Yugoslavia, but it is equally indisputable that the  decisionmaking will also be influenced by the fact of whether  and to what extent Slovenia, say, is involved in the production  of that vehicle that comes from Kragujevac, when it defines its  policy to encourage or to block that import.    Certain signs at present indicate incontestably that the UN  sanctions and the blockade of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia  do most to favor disintegration of the former Yugoslav economic  space to the detriment both of the "state being punished" and  also to the detriment of those the sanctions are supposed to  protect. Disintegration is deepening superfluous emotions and  favoring those forces, regardless of where they may be located,  which do not want peace to return to this region, which would be  favored best and most reliably by economic cooperation and  respect for mutual interest. Viewed in this light, substitution  can be seen as something imposed by necessity for survival at  any price, as a superfluous effort, as a factor for further  impoverishment of an already exhausted economy, but also as a  factor that leads toward a definitive parting of the ways of  even those business entities which until yesterday relied on one  another, figuring as factors in each other's rate of development  and progress.</p>

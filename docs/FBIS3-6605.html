			<p>Language: <F P=105> Japanese </F> Article Type:BFN     [Text] Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association [JAMA]  Chairman Yutaka Kume (concurrently chairman of Nissan Motor  Corp.) stressed his position of not to completely follow the  government's market opening package to be released later this  month. At a news conference on 17 March, he referred to  automakers' efforts to work out voluntary plans for expanding  purchase of foreign-made auto and auto parts, and said: "Our  import expansion plans are being discussed as voluntary efforts  of the private sector. We want no comments from the  government." His statement was made to check government  officials' attempt to incorporate the purchase plan into their  market opening package. At the same time, he severely  criticized U.S. Trade Representative [USTR] Mickey Kantor's  demand for the Japanese Government's guarantee for fulfilling  parts purchasing targets, stressing the Kantor remark is "an  attempt to ruin our efforts."    Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Nissan, are  individually mapping out plans for purchasing foreign-made auto  parts. Chairman Kume said the JAMA is "planning business talks  with auto and auto parts manufacturers not only of the United  States, but also of Europe and other countries." To demonstrate  "the industrial circles' initiative," the automakers' import  expansion plan is expected to be released before the  government's package.    However, Chairman Kume noted "our plan is intended to assist  foreign manufacturers, and it is not the JAMA's numerical  target." Touching particularly on USTR Kantor's demand for the  Japanese Government's guarantee for the amount of auto parts  imports, Kume said: "That is a very improper remark which may  ruin automakers' initiative to better the Japan-U.S. relations."    Expansion of Japanese automakers' purchase of foreign-made  autos and auto parts is the focal point of the Japan-U.S.  economic framework talks. In connection with this, some  quarters in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry  [MITI] say "automakers' voluntary efforts should be added to our  offer to the United States." MITI Vice Minister Hideaki Kumano  hinted on 17 March at possibilities of merging the JAMA's parts  purchase plan into the government's market opening package,  saying: "I do not know contents of the private sector's plan,  but we are considering (if it should be incorporated in the  government's package)."    Under such circumstances, the automakers are wary of their  voluntary efforts becoming "the government's formal pledge." A  top official of a major automaker expressed his deep-rooted  concern, saying: "At last, figures will go out of our control,  and the private sector will have to suffer from them."    Chairman Kume showed discord between the public and private  sectors on this issue, stressing: "Since this is a voluntary  effort of the industrial circles, the government's intervention  would become an obstacle."</p>

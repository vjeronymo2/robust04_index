			<p>920815 FT  15 AUG 92 / ANC torture inquiry An African National Congress inquiry into charges that dissidents were tortured by ANC officials has uncovered 'shocking abuses,' a newspaper reported yesterday, AP reports from Johannesburg. The Weekly Mail said it learned from unidentified sources that the probe into alleged abuses at ANC camps in other African countries put much of the blame on former ANC security chief Mzwai Piliso. 'ANC's torture chief named,' said the newspaper's front-page headline. The anti-apartheid Weekly Mail is widely seen as South Africa's leading investigative paper and has uncovered stories embarrassing to the white-minority government and various black groups. 'The ANC's inquiry into the treatment of detainees in its camps in exile has uncovered evidence of shocking abuses,' the newspaper said. Mr Piliso, now head of the ANC's personnel department, was 'directly implicated in some of the assaults on prisoners,' the article said. Mr Piliso was quoted in the report as saying he was following instructions. The ANC said yesterday it had no comment on The Weekly Mail report. It has said the dissidents were undercover government agents.</p>

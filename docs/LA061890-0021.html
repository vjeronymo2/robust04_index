			<p><P> June 18, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> POP CAPSULES : THE CRAMPS RECAPTURE INITIAL FRESHNESS  </P> <P> After floundering through a stretch of erratic live shows, numerous personnel  shifts, record company woes and the danger of being stuck in a stylistic rut,  the Cramps hit the Palladium on Friday with a healthy display of full-blooded,  sexy, silly rock 'n' roll mayhem.  </P> <P> Like the Ramones, the Cramps never veer very far from their original game plan.  </P> <P> But behind their strongest album in years, "Stay Sick!," the band has  recaptured its initial freshness. From Friday's opening blast of the country  blues staple "Muleskinner Blues," the quartet's obsessive, full-throttle power  overwhelmed any concerns of stagnation. Add to that an innate sense of  absurdity -- where else would you find a singer in his early 40s named Lux  Interior, clad in black vinyl bondage panties with matching stiletto-heel  pumps, wiggling his lubricious way across the stage while hoarsely croaking  something called "Daisys Up Your Butterfly"?  </P> <P> With guitarist Poison Ivy distilling a pristine concoction of punky,  psycho-billy guitar lines as stately as the rhinestone tiara on her head, the  Cramps remain crown fools of sex-camp grunge-rock, proof that arrested  development can be its own best virtue.CRAIG LEE  </P></p>

[passage  omitted]    In line with America's former policies toward China, during  his four-day visit to that country, Warren Christopher tried  very hard to make use of the human rights issue in China as a  means for extracting a number of economic and political  concessions from Beijing. However, despite America's political  deceptions on this issue, Christopher failed in his mission to  China; because Chinese leaders know full well that the claims of  White Office officials about defending human rights, freedom of  expression and assembly, and the release of political prisoners,  are nothing but political ploys. America's silence regarding  manifest human rights violations by her own allies proves this  point. [passage omitted]    The most important disagreements between Beijing and  Washington, which started after the collapse of the former  Soviet Union, have been due to the two countries' different  perceptions of international developments and the new world  order favored by America. The two countries' different  interpretations regarding the new polarization of power in the  world, as well as the rapid growth in China's commercial exports  and the expansion of cooperation between Tokyo and Beijing as  two superior powers in East Asia constitute the roots of  contradictions of interest between China and America, which have  assumed more complex dimensions during the past few months.    During the past few years, the Asian countries of the  Pacific  Ocean rim have enjoyed the fastest economic growth in the world.  In Washington's eyes those countries constitute a suitable  market for helping the recovery of America's ailing economy.  America, which is making every effort in order to gain access  to that market, is worried about the loss of her market in that  part of the world and China's excessive influence there.    The repetition of the allegations of human rights violations  in China, even raising the issue of the danger of the  proliferation of nuclear weapons in that region, are in fact  parts of Washington's attempts to achieve its goals.    By claiming to defend human rights and by exaggerating the  danger of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and even by  increasing her pressures on her allies in the region, such as  Japan and South Korea, America is trying to justify the  necessity of her presence in those countries, which have always  rejected American requests to open their markets to American  goods.    The failure of Christopher's recent visit to Australia and  Japan has been due to the rejection of American demands by those  countries. During his visits Christopher did not succeed in  extracting economic concessions from those two countries, which  are regarded as being America's allies.    In any case, Christopher's failures during his visits to  Australia, Japan, and subsequently China, demonstrates the fact  that in the new international scene America is incapable of  forcing her views upon powerful economic countries, whether  those countries that are her allies or those that are opposed to  her.</p>

			<p><P> January 13, 1989, Friday, Home Edition  </P> <P> THE NATION;  </P> <P> SUSPECT HELD IN NERVE-GAS BOMB CASE  </P> <P> A Korean-American businessman was arrested in Newark, N. J., on charges of  trying to illegally buy and export deadly quarter-ton nerve-gas bombs and an  array of other weapons, some of which may have been meant for sale to Iran.  Juwhan Yun, the 48-year-old president of Komex International Corp. in Short  Hills, N. J., was accused of having negotiated with an undercover U.S. Customs  Service agent to ship bombs containing a lethal gas known as Sarin. Officials  described Sarin as a colorless, odorless poison that quickly attacks the  nervous system after being inhaled, absorbed through the skin or swallowed.  They added that it has not been manufactured in this country since 1970 and  cannot be exported legally.  </P></p>

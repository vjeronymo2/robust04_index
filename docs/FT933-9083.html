			<p>930812 FT  12 AUG 93 / World Trade News: Chemicals investors sought TAIWAN'S state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) said it had invited 20 private Taiwanese companies to invest in building a multi-billion dollar petrochemical complex on the island, Reuter reports from Taipei. The 20 companies have been briefed on CPC's plans for the complex, which would include a naphtha cracker with annual production capacity of 900,000 tonnes of ethylene and an oil refinery with a daily capacity of 200,000 barrels. 'We hope the private companies will present plans for their participation next month so that we can map out the whole project,' a CPC spokesman said. He said CPC would have a stake of 30-35 per cent in the project, with the private sector holding the rest. CPC itself is on the government's list of companies to be privatised, but no date has been set. The spokesman said other details of the complex, including the size of investment and the site, had yet to be decided. Taiwan's Tuntex group, one of the companies invited to take part in the CPC project, last month announced plans to build its own Dollars 3.3bn (Pounds 2.21bn) petrochemical complex.</p>

			<p>BFN     [Text] The draft of the federal budget for 1994 failed to  collect the necessary number of votes (225) for its confirmation  during a repeated voting in the RF [Russian Federation] State  Duma Wednesday. As many as 220 deputies voted for it, 46 -  against, and 33 abstained from voting. A total of 299 deputies  participated in the voting.    A new voting on the draft has been scheduled for 16:00 [1200  GMT], until that time all factions of the lower chamber will  discuss this issue.    Addressing the deputies before the voting, chairman of the  chamber's budget committee Mikhail Zadornov warned them that in  the case that the budget is not adopted the government will be  forced to present a draft decree on financing for the third and  fourth quarters, as a result, the State Duma would be left  without any opportunity to monitor the spending of state funds.    The arguments of Fist Deputy Finance Minister Vladimir  Petrov, who declared that the government cannot receive a credit  from the Central Bank of Russia without the adopted budget,  apparently seemed unpersuasive to the members of the chamber.  Without the loan the state will not be able to finance Russian  regions this July or pay wages to state employees. Due to the  delay in the adoption of the budget, he said, the government  will have no opportunity to carry out the decree on increasing  of the minimum wage which the State Duma is to consider this  Wednesday.    As many as 194 people voted for the adoption of the budget  during the first voting, 57 - against, and 44 abstained from  voting.</p>

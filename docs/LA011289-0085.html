			<p><P> January 12, 1989, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> PLAY TO WIN!;  </P> <P> COMPTON HIGH BASKETBALL COACH GOADS TEAM WITH TOUGH TALK  </P> <P> Compton High School was losing a basketball game, something it had never done  when Louie Nelson played. Now, 20 years later as the Tarbabes coach, Nelson  walked into a locker room, bounced his clipboard off the concrete floor and  screamed: "Everybody's playing scared, you don't want it bad enough."  </P> <P> "You're 6-5, you got one damn rebound," he raged at junior Calvin Curry. "Let  me tell you why you don't play, Calvin. You don't put out."  </P> <P> That was at half-time of Compton's Moore League opener Friday night at Long  Beach Wilson High. The day before, in the green-walled classroom where he  teaches algebra, Nelson had said, "I don't like to lose. I was trained not to  lose in basketball, I'm not used to it."  </P> <P> Long before losing began to persist at Compton, Nelson starred on the school's  1967-68 and '68-'69 undefeated state championship teams. In his first year as  coach, he has revived the Tarbabes, who were 4-16 overall a year ago but are  11-4 this season.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Emotional During Game  </P> <P> "I'm emotional, they're laid back," said Nelson, 36, who was a wreck in the  65-56 loss to Wilson. His shirttail was out. He rarely sat. He pleaded with the  referees and berated them for calling a multitude of fouls on his aggressive  players. He abruptly benched forward Ron Williams, telling him, "Don't you ever  talk back to me again, you understand me?"  </P> <P> Away from the charged atmosphere of his sport, Nelson's beard frames a smile  and he gives no hint, while helping students master equations, that he is  capable of blasting anyone.  </P> <P> "Sometimes I do things without thinking," he said. "My personality fluctuates.  There's only two ways I can be, real nice or real mean. If we're not winning,  I'm mean."  </P> <P> Nelson's top priority has been to instill discipline in his players.  </P> <P> "I have to keep adding rules because they're used to doing things on their  own," he said. "It's different in the inner city. Most of them don't have a  father image, they don't know what to expect from a black adult male. They're  not used to taking orders, so they have a tendency to mouth back a little."  </P> <P> One of Nelson's rules is that if a player does not come to school or class on  the day of a game, he does not play that night.  </P> <P> "I didn't realize the job it is getting them to go to class," he said. "They  come to school, come to practice, but they won't go to class. I tell them to go  to class, but I can't walk them to class because I'm teaching."  </P> <P> </P> <P> Team Catching On  </P> <P> Faced with Nelson's tough-guy approach, the Tarbabes have begun to catch on to  what he is telling them.  </P> <P> "All of us respect him," said point guard Alonzo Lemmons. "He's always thinking  positively. He only yells for us to do better. I'd rather have him yell at me  than make a mistake over again."  </P> <P> Nelson, who lives in Montclair, hopes he will be a positive role model for his  players but worries about their outlook on life.  </P> <P> "The expectations are not the same," he said. "When I was coming along, if you  were a black man, you needed to prove yourself. Now, expectations are low. They  don't really feel good about themselves. I think most of these kids don't know  whether they want to be successful. They live day to day and I thought about  long-range goals. I wanted to be comfortable in life, have a good job, be able  to afford nice things."  </P> <P> After graduating from Compton High, Nelson played at the University of  Washington and then spent the mid-'70s in the National Basketball Assn. as a  6-foot-3 guard with Washington, New Orleans, Kansas City, San Antonio and New  Jersey. At New Orleans he was the back-court partner of Pete Maravich and  averaged 12 points a game.  </P> <P> "They didn't know of me," he said, recalling his introduction to the Compton  players. "To the kids I'm old. The principal had told them I played, but you  don't really know until you get on the court, so a couple of times I had to get  out there and show them I could still do the job."  </P> <P> After his playing career, Nelson decided, because of an affinity for math and a  desire to have summers off, to become a teacher. He earned a teaching  credential at Cal State Los Angeles in 1981 and was an assistant basketball  coach there for five years.  </P> <P> </P> <P> Weak in Fundamentals  </P> <P> When he took the Compton job last June, he discovered a team that had talent  but was weak in fundamentals and had little knowledge of winning.  </P> <P> "I was programmed to win, these kids were programmed to accept losing," Nelson  said. "As long as they played hard and almost won, that was good. They don't  realize the sacrifices it takes to win. To go home from practice, eat and go to  bed so they can be at practice at 8 in the morning. They might go home, then  hang out, or watch videos till 2 in the morning and miss practice. When I  played we thought it was a cardinal sin to be late."  </P> <P> Compton's leading scorer is senior forward Terrance Adams, who is averaging 17  points a game. But Adams, who called a timeout late in the Wilson game when  Nelson did not want one, has not won his coach's respect.  </P> <P> "He's used to doing it his way," Nelson said. "He's really talented, but he  uses his skills only to score or block a shot. He plays toward a crowd. I don't  think he'll learn this year."  </P> <P> Friday night was a hard lesson for all the Tarbabes, who had made a comeback in  the fourth quarter before letting Wilson pull away. They picked up their blue  gym bags and walked gloomily back to the locker room.  </P> <P> "Some of you guys don't know how to win," Nelson told them without screaming.  "Almost don't get it, fellas. We lost 'cause you guys won't play together.  Practice tomorrow at 9 o'clock, be on time."  </P> <P> The shouts of the Wilson players celebrating in an adjoining locker room could  be heard.  </P> <P> "Go to the bus, just be quiet," Nelson said.  </P> <P> There was nothing else to say.  </P></p>

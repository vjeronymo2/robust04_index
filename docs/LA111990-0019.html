			<p><P> November 19, 1990, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> JAZZ;  </P> <P> CHARLES OWENS A STUDY IN PURITY  </P> <P> Charles Owens has the look of a lonesome traveler on the uncertain highway of  jazz. Never highly recognized, he has nonetheless persisted in finding his own  way through the twists and turns of the music's multitude of changing styles.  </P> <P> Friday night at St. Marks Restaurant in Venice, he made one of his too-rare  appearances outside the environment of studio dates and back-up bands.  </P> <P> Until his final number, he chose music that was uncompromising in its jazz  purity, with pieces like John Coltrane's "Equinox" and Cedar Walton's  "Clockwise" demanding skill in every aspect of improvisation. Backed by the  superb rhythm section of Bill Henderson on piano, Donald Dean on drums and  Richard Reid on bass, Owens played a series of solos as thoughtfully  well-crafted as they were stirringly emotional. His tone light and airy, his  rhythms as loose and flowing as those of Coltrane -- who is an influence but  not a model for him -- Owens approached every number as though it were a  challenge to the breadth of his skills.  </P> <P> Each of the other players also performed impressively in extended solo  sections, with Henderson's piano work particularly attractive in its ability to  blend contemporary styles ranging from fleet Bud Powell-like single note lines  to massive block chording.  </P> <P> Owens wrapped up the set with a slow, inexorably driving blues that sprung his  tenor saxophone loose for a whimsical salute to every jazz man who has had to  honk his way across a bar to excite an audience. The noisy St. Marks crowd  loved it. Somehow, you just knew they would. DON HECKMAN  </P></p>

			<p>BFN     [Excerpt] Frantz Robert Monde, president of the Chamber of  Deputies, and Senator Sansaricq, the president of the unofficial  Senate office, met on 27 April to coordinate viewpoints on a  means of resolving the crisis, particularly of filling the power  vacuum. For Sen. Sansaricq, this constitutes official  recognition of the office over which he presides in the Senate.  Edner Jean filed a report:    [Begin recording] [Jean] This meeting occurred fewer than 24  hours after President Monde's shattering statements, which began  his turn to the right. This spectacular reversal is about to  take place because of extended consultations with the office  Sen. Bernard Sansaricq leads.    A significant fact: The talk took place in the office of  President Monde, the same place where, 15 days earlier, he had  assured Firmin Jean-Louis, the president of the National  Assembly, of his firm support, which he stated on this occasion  in the presence of journalists. With this gesture, Frantz Robert  Monde wished to prompt the Senate president to examine the  parliamentary plan submitted to him as a resolution by the  deputies. The latest statements and initiatives by Firmin  Jean-Louis had made Monde think he had other political motives.  The president of the Chamber of Deputies therefore decided to  switch to the other camp, with a wink at Sen. Bernard Sansaricq.    [Sansaricq, in Creole] President Monde has decided to work  with the Senate over which I am presiding. He finally recognizes  that this Senate is functional and has been constitutionally  elected. It is neither an acclaimed office nor an enigma, as  with what happened on 10 August in the presence of the  international community when they applauded and acclaimed a  president without going through constitutional norms, without  the president being elected according to the Senate's internal  rules. That was a mystery. The page is now turned and must be  turned completely. I have been awaiting this moment. It has  arrived and I think we must now work quickly to endow the  country with an executive because we must really begin  considering the country's suffering and pain.    [Jean] Bernard Sansaricq paid tribute to President Monde for  his flexibility and determination in seeking a solution to the  crisis, even though, he said, we have not always approved of his  approach. Despite some differences in their positions, the two  men have many points in common: Frantz Robert Monde and Bernard  Sansaricq are both legislators from the southern region who have  always been critical of President Aristide's seven months in  office. In the face of what they call interference by the  international community, they have always been uncompromising in  their opposition and nationalism. Very often in the past, both  the senator and the deputy have made the same speech using more  or less the same words.    [Sansaricq] The international community has its work and we  have our work. The best answer we can give the international  community is that we will install a serious and honest  government with capable men. That is the answer they need. Once  they have that answer and realize that we are determined to do  something serious for the country, that the prime minister and  the ministers who will be chosen will be competent, honest, and  capable of running this nation, they will know it is the best  answer. Dealing with them right now: Whether we greet Bouki  [Haitian folk character] or not, he will eat us up anyway. I  would therefore rather die standing up than crouched on my knees.    [Jean] According to Turneb Delpe, there is nothing new in  President Monde's position. The senator from the  constitutionalist bloc explains that the president of the  Chamber of Deputies has always expressed his preference for  Article 149 of the Constitution. Sen. Delpe would have been  surprised if he had said the opposite. [passage omitted] [end  recording]</p>

The financial services group also announced a return to the dividend list. The expansion was achieved by the application of 'good housekeeping principles' and the careful selection of business, the directors explained. On turnover of Pounds 1.18m (Pounds 1.29m) for the six months to June 30, pre-tax profit worked through at Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 155,000) and the net balance at Pounds 202,000 (Pounds 77,000). For the 1992 year the net balance was Pounds 185,000. Directors were 'sufficiently encouraged' by the results to restore dividends, and declared an interim of 0.25p from earnings per share of 1.22p (0.48p). They forecast a final dividend of 0.5p. It is intended to build the group, through Harton Securities, to the level of the minimum capital required under EC banking regulations. 'This will be done as quickly as is consistent with the exercise of prudent judgment.'</p>

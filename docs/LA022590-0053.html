			<p><P> February 25, 1990, Sunday, Home Edition  </P> <P> HISTORIC CHURCH RISING FROM ASHES IN NEW SANCTUARY  </P> <P> A little more than five years after fire destroyed the historic First  Presbyterian Church, members of the congregation will gather at 3 p.m. today  for a worship service to dedicate a new sanctuary.  </P> <P> The Rev. R. Scott Sullender, the pastor, said banners have been prepared  proclaiming: "New Sanctuary . . . New Management . . . Same Lord."  </P> <P> The new sanctuary on Holt Avenue at Gibbs Street replaces a church and bell  tower that were constructed in 1907 and burned to the ground in an electrical  fire Feb. 1, 1985.  </P> <P> Gil Thompson, assistant chairman of the sanctuary building committee, said the  fire lighted up the sky, drawing parishioners and other spectators from miles  away.  </P> <P> As church members watched the destruction, Thompson said: "Everyone was numb  and awe-struck. It was spectacular." Thompson, 71, had been attending the  church since he was 4.  </P> <P> Lynn Honaker, 84, a member of the congregation since 1929, said he was at home  in Pomona when someone called and said: "Your church is burning down." Honaker  said he raced to the scene in time to witness a miracle.  </P> <P> The old church was connected by a second-story pedestrian bridge to a Christian  education building that housed church offices, Sunday school classrooms and a  gymnasium. The fire was about to spread from the church to the education  building, Honaker said, when "a breeze from the southwest came up and stopped  it. We had a miracle here."  </P> <P> The preservation of the education building, which was constructed in 1930,  permitted the church to continue Sunday services without interruption. The  services have been held in the gymnasium, with the congregation seated in metal  folding chairs facing a cross. The gym floor was carpeted, but the room still  has basketball backboards at each end.  </P> <P> The new sanctuary, which cost $1.2 million, is a modern brick structure with  seven sides, curved walls and a distinctive roof line. It will seat more than  300 people.  </P> <P> Thompson, who worked on the building project with John Guthrie, the building  committee chairman, said construction has taken more than 1 1/2 years because  the church elected to save money by managing the project itself rather than  hiring a general contractor.  </P> <P> The Rev. James Baird, who grew up in the Pomona church and has served as pastor  of several Presbyterian churches in California and Colorado, will speak at the  dedication service. The church's music groups will be augmented by choirs from  other churches.  </P> <P> The First Presbyterian Church was founded in 1883, making it one of the first  churches in Pomona. It had as many as 1,300 members 60 years ago, but now has  290.  </P></p>

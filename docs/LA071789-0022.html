			<p><P> July 17, 1989, Monday, Home Edition  </P> <P> MORNING REPORT: TELEVISION  </P> <P> The executive producer of a CBS documentary on man's first walk on the moon in  1969 said the program mistakenly showed clips taken on the moon during a 1972  flight. The program said the 1972 footage was of the historic first moon walk  by American astronauts. "It was an honest mistake," Perry Wolff said Friday of  the error in "The Moon Above, the Earth Below," a two-hour special that aired  Thursday and saluted the 20th anniversary of the historic Apollo 11 moon  flight. The program was co-anchored by Dan Rather and Charles Kuralt. Two  scenes showed two astronauts -- ostensibly Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin --  bouncing on the moon's surface, and then their lunar orbiter blasting off from  the moon. In a brief interview, Wolff said he had just learned that they  actually were from the Apollo 17 flight in December, 1972. No deception was  intended, he emphasized. He blamed the error on a "mislabeled tape" taken from  a box of more than 100 tapes of footage of moon flights and landings. Claudia  Puig  </P></p>

The Health Care  Department is appealing to you in view of the emergency  situation that has developed in our city due to cases of  diphtheria among adults and children and an outbreak of an  epidemic. [passage omitted]    Over the first 10 months of this year, 110 adults and  children were taken sick with diphtheria, and 237 were  registered as carriers of toxigenic viruses of the diphtheria  pathogen. Serious cases of this disease were reported among 27  patients, four of whom died -- three adults under 50 years of  age and a child of two years.    Among all sick persons, 58 patients had not been vaccinated  against diphtheria, including all the death cases. [passage  omitted]    The State Hygiene Center for Epidemic Prevention has adopted  a resolution on the obligatory immunization of all city  inhabitants. Most of the people have already been vaccinated.  However, about 100,000 persons have not yet been immunized, and  they are boosting the spread of diphtheria in the city.  [passage omitted]    [Signed] V. Gadasyuk, chief of the Health Care Department at  the Kaliningrad City Administration.</p>

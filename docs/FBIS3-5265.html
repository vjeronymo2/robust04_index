This has led to a  reduction in Thai investment in Laos because investors could not  tolerate Lao Government's witchhunt. The Lao Government's  suspicions about Thai investment resulted from behavior of  unscrupulous Thai businessmen.    Suphachai said the Thai Government could not gain correct  understanding of the Lao Government in every issue involving  Thai investment. The private sector, particularly the chambers  of commerce in the northeastern provinces, should play a role in  this matter. The chambers of commerce could join to form a  "northeast business council" or a committee on Thai-Lao trade to  screen prospective investors to find good people whose  investment would not exploit Laos as in the past. The council  could also set regulations governing Thai businessmen making  investment in Laos and protect their interests when Laos changes  its regulations. These frequent changes of Lao regulations have  always troubled Thai investors. [passage omitted]</p>

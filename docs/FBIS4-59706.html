			<p>BFN     [Text] As part of the transfer of Civil Administration  powers to the PLO in Gaza, the Palestinians received today the  center of control over government offices in Gaza Strip and  independent apparatuses which serve, among other things, the  Interior and Agriculture Ministries.    The commander of the computer unit, Major Yoram Baraq,  believes that unless they are helped by Israel, the Palestinians  will have many problems operating the systems, although during  the overlap period they have acquired a reasonable basis to  begin working.    Our correspondent Karmela Menashe notes that the IDF [Israel  Defense Forces] has, in fact, evacuated the entire Gaza Strip,  except for the brigade headquarters, the governor's house, and  several other small installments. The ceremony of handing  control of the Gaza Strip over to the Palestinians is due to  take place tomorrow at the Qatif Bloc.    Brigadier General Dubi Gazit, Head of the Civil  Administration in the Gaza Strip, said after the PLO accept the  authority there is no reason they would not to be able to manage  the administration themselves. If any problems should occur,  they would be discussed by the regional committee on civilian  affairs, he said.</p>

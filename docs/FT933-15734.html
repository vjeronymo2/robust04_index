			<p>930707 FT  07 JUL 93 / International Bonds: Ssangyong Oil issue leads invasion from Far East A SPATE of Far Eastern equity-linked deals amounting to Dollars 650m in new issuance hit the international bond markets yesterday. The deals consisted of a large Korean convertible bond issue and two more bonds with warrants from Japanese corporates. Ssangyong Oil Refining, Korea's third-largest oil refiner, made its debut in the international capital markets with the launch of a Dollars 150m convertible bond with a 15-year maturity. Paribas Capital Markets, book-runner for the deal, said this was the largest Korean convertible bond issue to date. Equity-linked specialists said the deal had a 'fairly rapturous' response, given that foreign investors are finding it hard to buy some Korean shares. Although the Korean stock market has been opened up to overseas investors, there are strict limits on foreign ownership. Ssangyong Oil Refining, in which Saudi Arabia's Aramco has an equity stake, has already reached its foreign ownership limit, so the convertible bond offers overseas investors the only means of buying into the company, dealers said. Paribas Capital Markets said the bonds were convertible into non-voting shares, which currently trade at a discount of about 4.5 per cent to the voting shares. The indicated conversion premium, which will be set on July 8, is likely to be between 5 per cent and 10 per cent to the price of the voting shares. The coupon will be set at between 3.75 per cent and 4.25 per cent. 'The deal did very well, reflecting the scarcity of Korean convertible paper,' said one rival house. Demand from Switzerland and the UK was strong. Two more Japanese names came to the market yesterday, as expected, issuing bonds with warrants. NGK Insulators issued a Dollars 300m, four-year deal, while Sumitomo Cement launched a Dollars 200m, four-year deal - coming only one day after a chunky Dollars 480m issue from Seino Transportation. Dealers had voiced concern about the market's ability to absorb the large volume of deals expected from Japanese borrowers, especially since investor interest is muted ahead of the Japanese election. Several borrowers arranged to launch bonds with warrants, mandating the deals before the announcement of the Japanese general election. Nikko Europe, which was lead manager for the NGK Insulators deal, said the warrants traded in a range of 13 7/8 to 14 1/8 on the bid side, while Nomura International, lead manager for the Sumitomo Cement deal, said those warrants traded at 13 5/8 . 'Technically, they are pretty cheap, reflecting the relatively low investor interest,' said one house. Outside the equity-linked sector, the international bond market saw a handful of new issues. Bacardi-Martini Finance launched its first Eurobond issue - a Dollars 200m, five-year deal with a 5.75 per cent coupon. Last September, Bacardi, the Bermuda-based international rum company, paid over Dollars 1.5bn for a majority stake in Martini Rossi, the Italian vermouth and wines group. Yesterday's bond issue is aimed at helping to refinance bridging loans made in connection with the deal. The company has already done US private placements amounting to about Dollars 450m, and expects to arrange additional financing in the form of a syndicated loan. The other main Eurodollar deal of the day came from the Kingdom of Denmark, which launched a Dollars 250m, four-year bond priced to yield 20 basis points over the interpolated yield curve. The Kingdom of Sweden yesterday joined the steady stream of borrowers to tap the Eurolira market with a L250bn, 10-year deal carrying a coupon of 9.75 per cent. The bonds were reoffered at 99.375 per cent to yield 9.85 per cent. Deutsche Bank London, which lead managed the deal, said the aim was to draw more institutional investors into the Eurolira market, an area which traditionally has been dominated by retail investors. 'Sweden is well-known among institutional investors' said Deutsche Bank, claiming that some 55 per cent of the bonds were sold to institutional investors.</p>

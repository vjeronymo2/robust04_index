			<p>931210 FT  10 DEC 93 / Observer: Lines drawn It's been known for some time that the Royal Academy was looking for an architect to front its bid to take over the adjacent Museum of Mankind, which falls vacant in 1996, and turn it into a Museum of Architecture. So the smart money was always on the next president of the Royal Academy being an architect. Few surprises then that Sir Philip Dowson has been tapped to succeed Sir Roger de Grey as president of the Royal Academy. He is an architect, as was his close rival for the presidency, Colin Wilson. But whereas Wilson will be remembered for the unloved new British Library, Sir Philip, one of the founders of Ove Arup, was responsible for the admired Broadgate development in the City. He has one other advantage. At 69 he is an excellent time-filler until the more flamboyant artists who aspire to be president, such as Allen Jones and Tom Phillips, calm down a bit.</p>

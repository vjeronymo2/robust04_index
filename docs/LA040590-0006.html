			<p><P> April 5, 1990, Thursday, Home Edition  </P> <P> FOOD AND COMMON SENSE: PEOPLE WHO LIVE ALONE SHOULD AVOID CATCH-AS-CATCH-CAN  DINING HABIT  </P> <P> People who live alone can be divided, by diet, into two groups. At one extreme  are those who plan, shop and prepare meals with the same vigor as if they were  cooking for a family of four. At the other are those whose refrigerators may  contain nothing more than a jar of mustard, a loaf of weary bread, a stick of  margarine and a six-pack of diet soda.  </P> <P> If you -- or someone you care about -- fits into the latter category, maybe  it's time to consider a change.  </P> <P> "Dinner for one, please, James . . . Madam will not be dining tonight" go the  words to an old song. But most who dine solo don't have a "James" to prepare  the meal for them. And although making single servings might sound easier than  feeding an entire family, it sometimes turns out to be as hard or even harder.  </P> <P> When eating alone, we frequently don't bother fixing a nutritious, balanced  meal. Instead we grab whatever's quick and handy: Leftovers, snacks or  over-processed convenience foods. Sometimes the meal consists of only one kind  of food rather than an appetizing mix. Fruits and vegetables get forgotten in  the rush.  </P> <P> This type of dining can affect not only the composition of the meal but the  whole experience as well. Such a repast might be eaten standing over the sink,  in front of the videocassette recorder, while reading, or on the run. Food is  consumed either rapidly, absent mindedly, or both, rather than in a relaxed  manner in which each bite is savored. And thanks to the microwave, you can  stick processed food in the oven, wait for the bell, eat it and, presto, you're  done.  </P> <P> Nearly everybody eats this way on occasion. But when the catch-as-catch-can  style becomes a habit, you may need to work on improving a nutritional profile.  </P> <P> A place to start is the supermarket. People playing shopper's solitaire rightly  point out that it's hard to buy products in small enough quantities. Although  some single-serving canned goods are available, most frozen foods (aside from  complete dinners) come in large sizes. Half-loaves of bread are rare, and many  fresh foods come in family-size packs.  </P> <P> Numerous stores now offer serve-yourself salad bars, but some people find them  too costly. Rather than buy a head of lettuce only to find half of it rotting  in the refrigerator a week later, they may omit salad entirely. Their only  choice, they say, is between wasting food or eating the same thing over and  over.  </P> <P> We recognize that it's not easy, but don't throw good nutrition to the wind.  Eating alone doesn't make you less important. The same principles of prudent  eating apply no matter how many or few are sitting at the table. And with a  little extra effort, you can create varied, nutritious meals -- even if you're  on your own.  </P> <P> Planning is the key. At the supermarket, use a basic checklist. Included should  be leafy greens and yellow vegetables, citrus fruits, low-fat dairy products,  meats, fish, eggs, poultry, dried beans and peas, as well as whole-grain or  enriched breads and cereals and rice and grain products such as pastas. Make  selections with these important categories in mind.  </P> <P> Plan to use highly perishable fruits and vegetables earlier in the week. Later  in the week, you can depend on frozen vegetables. Buy these in pourable bags,  which are easier to re-close than boxes.  </P> <P> Plan ahead in cooking too. Think in broader terms than just meal by meal. If  you've bought larger amounts of ingredients (an economical way to shop), you  can cook extra servings and store them. Pasta sauces or soups with dried beans  can be kept in the freezer in microwave containers for defrosting later on.  Along with pasta, salad and a piece of fresh fruit, they make a delicious,  nutritious meal. Or cook a sizeable pot of beef stew, which will serve you in  good stead for two or three days. Any extra will last a few months in the  freezer.  </P> <P> Some people find it most convenient to do this type of larger-scale cooking on  the weekend. If you're having guests over for a meal, you can also cook extra  servings at that time and store them for later use too. An added advantage to  relying on the freezer in this way: If you decide to go out to dinner with  friends on the spur of the moment, the food will keep just fine. Or, if you  invite a friend home, you'll have a full larder to share.  </P> <P> The main message here is that while spontaneity in many matters adds zest to  life, a little foresight in the supermarket and advance work in the kitchen  lets you shop more economically and eat more nutritiously. It also gives the  solo meal a touch of class.  </P></p>

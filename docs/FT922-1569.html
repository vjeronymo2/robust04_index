			<p>920622 FT  22 JUN 92 / Kalon seeks to reassure Manders over jobs KALON GROUP, the West Yorkshire-based paint manufacturer, yesterday said its hostile Pounds 104.4m all-paper bid for Manders (Holdings), the Wolverhampton paints group, would only result in a net loss of 300 jobs and not the 500 originally feared. Kalon's formal offer document, which Manders' shareholders receive today, says recruitment after a merger would partly offset closure of the Windeck factory at Bingley and further rationalisation. The workforce would be cut by about 12 per cent overall instead of 20 per cent. It would still result in cost savings of more than Pounds 4m. Manders yesterday accused Kalon of backing down under pressure. The listing particulars also show that over the past three years Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon managing director, received a Pounds 745,300 bonus linked to earnings per share growth. His average annual salary including other bonuses over the same period was Pounds 128,000. In 1988 Kalon's pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.72m; in 1991 they were Pounds 9.2m, a growth rate of 36 per cent a year. Mr John Farmer, finance director of Manders, yesterday dismissed Kalon's profits growth and said its eight-for-three offer was 'fragile'. He said: 'Kalon is only offering its shares which have been inflated by its windfall figures of last year when its prices went up and raw material costs went down.'</p>

			<p>930118 FT  18 JAN 93 / International Company News: Debt ratings lowered at slimmed-down Tarmac TARMAC, the UK construction group, has had its debt ratings lowered by IBCA, the credit rating agency, which cited the difficult trading environment. Tarmac's long-term debt rating fell below investment grade, from BBB to BB+, while its commercial paper rating dropped from A3 to B. Its commercial paper is rated A3 by Moody's and P3 by Standard &amp; Poors. The group is expected to announce substantial pre-tax losses in the year to December 1992 after heavy exceptional charges. According to IBCA, the Pounds 150m realised from disposals by December 1992, and the further Pounds 100m expected in the 1993 financial year, could be offset by a rise in dollar denominated debt and an anticipated cash outflow arising from reduced contracting workloads. 'Although the group has made some progress in disposing of peripheral activities and benefits from a relatively long-term debt structure, the near-term outlook for its core business profitability remains poor, and financial protection measures could well deteriorate further in 1993,' IBCA concluded.</p>

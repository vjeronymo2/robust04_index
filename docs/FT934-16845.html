			<p>931004 FT  04 OCT 93 / People: Gaelic oils Cairn's finances Gaelic is not a language much used in the boardrooms, even of Scottish companies, but the occasional word may soon be heard in the corridors of Cairn Energy, the Edinburgh-based independent oil company, following the appointment of Agnes McLeod, 33, as its new finance director. McLeod, left, is a fluent Gaelic speaker. She joined Cairn in 1988 after spending five years as an accountant at Lasmo, another independent oil company. She spent her first two years at Cairn as a financial accountant. A stint as assistant company secretary followed, with promotion to company secretary coming at the beginning of this year. Her appointment trebles the ranks of women finance directors at UK oil companies, with Liz Airey of Monument and Phoebe Wood of Arco British leading the way. McLeod expects to be busy in implementing the financial aspects of Cairn's far-flung international activities in places such as Papua New Guinea and Vietnam. Earlier this year she played a key role in gaining shareholder approval for Cairn's US subsidiary to issue 4m new shares for Dollars 19.7.</p>

			<p>930708 FT  08 JUL 93 / Balanced review in accounts is urged COMPANIES SHOULD provide a written statement in their annual reports describing their performance and prospects under guidelines issued yesterday by the Accounting Standards Board. The proposed operating and financial review is designed to give directors maximum flexibility in commenting on their company's results and financial position. The board's guidelines say the review should be balanced, objective and analytical. It should also deal with both good and bad aspects of a company's performance. The statement will not be formally audited and is not compulsory like other accounting standards because it will be published within the text of the annual report rather than in the numerical accounts at the back. But in an unusual endorsement by the Stock Exchange and the 100 Group of leading finance directors, companies are being urged to comply with the statement 'in the interests of good financial reporting'. Mr Nigel Stapleton, finance director of Reed Elsevier and chairman of the 100 Group's technical committee, said that he believed peer pressure would encourage compliance by a growing number of companies. Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the Accounting Standards Board, said: 'We want a free-flowing document which leaves management free to write what they like without being constrained by the required formats of the accounts.' The review should include a commentary on the operating results, the dynamics of the business, investment and other factors that may have an impact on the future. The financial review would cover the capital structure of the business, internal financial management, cashflow and current liquidity, borrowing requirements and future needs, and any overseas restrictions on the transfer of funds abroad. Companies will be permitted to exclude information that they believe too sensitive on grounds of commercial confidentiality. The guidelines suggest that the review may also be the appropriate place to include a statement that the company is a 'going concern' for the next 12 months, as required by the Cadbury committee on corporate governance. The review is designed for listed companies, and the board is encouraging its adoption for other large corporations in which there is 'a legitimate public interest'. Operating and Financial review.

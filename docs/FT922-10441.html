			<p>920501 FT  01 MAY 92 / Germany to privatise air traffic control THE German Bundestag yesterday approved the privatisation of the German air traffic control system from next January 1, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn . Mr Gunther Krause, transport minister, said this would mean much greater efficiency, drastically reducing delays and long queues to land at airports like Frankfurt. The privatisation was agreed by 556 votes to 12, easily enough to allow the necessary change in the constitution.</p>

			<p>920305 FT  05 MAR 92 / Observer: Cross-over Still on the subject of big wheels and their revolving spokespersons, eyebrows will be raised by Sir Alastair Morton's latest Eurotunnel recruit. John Noulton, a former under secretary at the department of trade, is deserting Transmanche-Link, where he was administration director, to be Eurotunnel's latest director of public affairs. Will this exacerbate the already frosty relations between the two sides of the project, or help heal the split? At least Noulton should be able to stand up to the abrasive Morton and it could enhance the chances of an amicable settlement.</p>

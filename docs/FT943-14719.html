			<p>940713 FT  13 JUL 94 / Letters to the Editor: G7 must show initiative on African debt burden Sir, Once again the G7 Summit has done little more than utter a few pious words when it comes to tackling Africa's debt crisis, which is one of the greatest obstacles to human and economic recovery in the region. The G7 said it wished to encourage the Paris Club to pursue its efforts to improve the debt treatment of the poorest and most indebted countries. However, this is woefully inadequate on four counts. First, repeated rescheduling operations at the Paris Club have done little more than marginally slow the rate at which arrears on already unpayable debt are accumulating. Second, there is little sign of the full Trinidad Terms for debt reduction being implemented. Third, even the full implementation of the Trinidad Terms would not resolve Africa's debt crisis because, as the World Bank acknowledges, only six (at most) out of the 21 severely-indebted, low-income sub-Saharan countries would achieve a sustainable debt-servicing position. And, finally, the Paris Club simply does not address the problem of multinational debt owed to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund which is a millstone around the neck of several African countries. In the circumstances, the UK government could do much more to spearhead a new debt-reduction initiative. This should include the writing-off of between 70 and 100 per cent of all debt owed to governments and immediate action to increase the amount of debt eligible for reduction and rescheduling. It could also insist on the IMF using its own resources to write off a substantial proportion of the debt owed to it by African governments. This could be done by a sale of gold stocks or a new issue of Special Drawing Rights. Neither option would undermine the financial standing of the IMF, generate global inflationary pressures or have implications for the public expenditure of northern governments. Africa's debt burden is small in global terms but its human costs are immense. The burden can be relieved provided the political will is there. It is time that the G7 leaders showed such leadership.

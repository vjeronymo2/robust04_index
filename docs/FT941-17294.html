			<p>940105 FT  05 JAN 94 / Letters to the Editor: Not a serious education option Sir, John Authers informs us ('Vocational schooling urged for 14-year-olds', December 31) that government officials believe vocational options for non-academic 14-year-olds to be the solution to a 'major national failing': lack of the high-class technical education provided by Britain's major competitors. Can they be serious? Vocational courses for low-achieving young people are certainly a common European option. They are also generally despised as 'dustbin' courses, and have rapidly declining enrolments. High-status, high-class technical education is something quite different. Specialised technical courses generally start much later than 14; and are difficult (and therefore respected). They also give entry to first-rate higher technical institutes of the type Britain's polytechnics so disastrously failed to become. This sort of technical education is very expensive, and requires long-term planning. Small wonder, then, that it never appears in the UK's constantly renewed lists of educational 'reforms'; or that bright English children continue to choose the most traditional of academic options.

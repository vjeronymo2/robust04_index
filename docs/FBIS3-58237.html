			<p>Language: <F P=105> English </F> Article Type:BFN   <F P=106> [Interview with British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd by </F> correspondent Nick Gowing in Brussels on 10 January; from the  Channel Four newscast -- recorded]    [Text] [Gowing] Do you agree with President Clinton that  NATO has to be prepared to carry out its threatened air strikes?    [Hurd] We said in August, and we are going to repeat again  tomorrow, that if our forces are attacked or if the  strangulation of Sarajevo were resumed, then NATO would be  willing to use air power in support of the United Nations, and  that is absolutely right, and I can conceive and you can  conceive the circumstances in which it would be useful to do  that. But you do it if it is going to help, you plan ahead, not  just the one strike but what happens after that, who is going to  lose their lives, who is going to be at risk, what purpose is  going to be served. I can conceive of circumstances in which  the alliance decides to go ahead, and that is what Mr. Clinton  was saying we must be prepared to do.    [Gowing] Is the talk of withdrawal -- even the consideration  itself becoming a new dynamic as you try pursue peace, in other  words the warring factions now working for the moment when they  expect your forces to leave?    [Hurd] No decisions have been taken and no decisions will be  taken by us unilaterally without consulting those who are in the  same position as we are, this is a joint effort and we need to  consider its future jointly. The question is not yet answered  but it is a perfectly reasonably one to put, we have to look at  after this winter is over, for the winter we are committed and  would be quite wrong to withdraw during the winter. But when  the spring comes are we going to say in effect: We are willing  to continue this commitment for ever? Well the answer to that  question will depend on what the situation looks like then.    [Gowing] Could I ask very briefly on the enlargement of NATO  or the possibility of enlargement, what about the -- what some  people are saying that you are simply appeasing the Russians,  particularly because Yeltsin, when you were here two years ago,  wrote a request saying he would like Russia to join NATO  eventually.    [Hurd] It is not a question of appeasing Russia. We are  saying to countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czechs: You  want to join NATO, first of all let us have a partnership. What  does that mean? It means working out with them, cooperation in  things like training, joint exercises, joint planning, let us  get to work on that, see how we work together, and then maybe at  the end of the day there will be full membership, and each  country will respond to these limitations that have been signed  today in a different way, and we will be able, as time passes,  to assess progress with them, and to work out full membership,  timing, terms when that is right.    [Gowing] How happy do you believe the Russians will be about  your offer, your invitation which President Clinton will take,  do you expect them to accept this?    [Hurd] Yes, I do expect them to accept it. I think it would  be shortsighted of them not to; it is a big opportunity for  them, too. This is not aimed against them; it is an invitation  issued to them along with others, and I very much hope they will  take it up.    [Gowing] Even after all the bluster of complaint and  concern?    [Hurd] Well I would not use the word bluster. Russia is  rethinking its role in Europe as a result of the collapse of the  Soviet Union. It is not surprising that should take time, it is  not indeed surprising that there should be something of a  backlash in Russian elections with Mr. Zhirinovskiy, but he does  not make policy he is not the government, it is the government  with which we have to deal, they are rethinking policy, we have  to take some account of that, it does not mean giving him a  veto, and I think the Partnership for Peace strikes the right  balance.</p>
